          <seg id="1">У середу, 18 травня, уряд Чехії схвалив зміну умов виплати гуманітарної допомоги українським біженцям.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Сьогодні на виплату першої допомоги в 5000 крон мають право всі українські біженці, які прибувають, без будь-яких додаткових умов (потрібна лише віза тимчасового захисту).</seg>
          <seg id="3">Щоб отримувати таку ж суму наступні п'ять місяців, заявник повинен довести своє тяжке матеріальне становище – вважатися безробітним, не мати у Чехії власності тощо.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Мінпраці вирішило змінити цю практику таким чином:</seg>
          <seg id="5">1️⃣ Перша виплата допомоги перестане бути безумовною.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Якщо біженцю надано безкоштовне житло, щоденне багаторазове харчування та гігієнічне приладдя, то він не зможе претендувати на виплату 5000 крон.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Влада почне вважати, що базова допомога була надана в натуральній формі (житлом, їжею та засобами гігієни), а значить призначення гуманітарної допомоги виконано і у виплаті грошей немає необхідності.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Цей захід покликаний вирішити проблему з циганськими біженцями з України.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Багато хто з них приїжджає до Чехії лише заради грошової допомоги.</seg>
          <seg id="10">2️⃣ право на грошову виплату другої, третьої, четвертої, п'ятої та шостої допомоги, як і раніше, матимуть тільки ті біженці, які доведуть безпосередню потребу (відсутність роботи тощо).</seg>
          <seg id="11">Проте додадуться ще дві умови:</seg>
          <seg id="12">📌 як і в першому пункті, допомогу у грошовій формі зможуть отримати лише ті українці, яким не було надано безкоштовне житло, щоденне багаторазове харчування та гігієнічне приладдя;</seg>
          <seg id="13">📌 заявник повинен фактично мешкати на території Чехії.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Це потрібно, щоб припинити практику «туризму заради допомоги», коли біженець живе в одній країні, а до Чехії приїжджає на кілька днів виключно за грошима.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Відповідно до закону, кожен іноземець зобов'язаний проінформувати МВС про зміну місця проживання протягом трьох робочих днів після переїзду.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Якщо адреса в анкеті на виплату допомоги не співпадатиме з адресою, зазначеною в базі даних МВС, заявника попросять надати докази, що вона дійсно проживає в Чехії.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Інакше у виплаті допомоги буде відмовлено.</seg>
          <seg id="18">На даний момент Чехія витратила на виплату гуманітарної допомоги 2,626 млрд. крон.</seg>

          <seg id="1">On Wednesday on 18th of May, the Czech government approved amendments to the terms of humanitarian assistance payment to Ukrainian refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Today, all arriving Ukrainian refugees are entitled to a first assistance payment of 5,000 crowns without any additional conditions (only a Temporary Protection visa is needed).</seg>

          <seg id="33">Цей цвинтар уже став обʼєктом своєрідного «патріотичного туризму».</seg>

          <seg id="35">Це, напевно, і є один із запахів війни.</seg>

          <seg id="49">Можливо, також уявляє, що під мостом стоїть він, і думає: як це?</seg>

          <seg id="83">Якщо чесно, коли сирена застає тебе зненацька на вулиці, часто і нема де сховатись, нема відкритих бомбосховищ або підвалів поблизу.</seg>

          <seg id="15">But here it is: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 p.m. and we sounded the alarm, it was only heard from the alert on someone's phone.</seg>
          <seg id="16">And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living their lives.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Butch, the Irpin.</seg>
          <seg id="18">We made our way to Kiev through two of the many martyr cities - Bucha and Irpin.</seg>

          <seg id="47">Just sitting and looking at the chasm between Kiev and Bucheya.</seg>

          <seg id="47">He just sits and looks at the gap between Kyiv and Bucha.</seg>

          <seg id="51">On May 29, military Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.</seg>

          <seg id="56">And we believe that they will not capture - the city is fighting and living.</seg>
          <seg id="57">On street corners, at every second intersection, there are neatly stacked piles of tires and Bandera lanes.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Evening Mykolaiv is now incredibly quiet - the noise against which the city used to live has subsided.</seg>
          <seg id="59">No voices, no cars in the evenings.</seg>
          <seg id="60">And at night it is extremely dark.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Light masking for safety.</seg>
          <seg id="62">People live "by candles", or rather, by the flashlights of mobile phones.</seg>
          <seg id="63">At home, we turn on the light only in the kitchen - quickly and when needed.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Grandma covered the windows with heavy blankets, through which the light does not penetrate.</seg>
          <seg id="65">There is a hunting rifle next to my sister's childhood bed.</seg>
          <seg id="66">"At hand since the 24th," says the father.</seg>

          <seg id="68">But not every time.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Even in a front-line city, it is very difficult to live in a state of constant anxiety.</seg>
          <seg id="70">When then to live?</seg>
          <seg id="71">The Russian army is 30 kilometers from the city, shots from "pions" reach the Zhovtnevy district, covering Kulbakyne.</seg>

          <seg id="82">And what else to do?</seg>
          <seg id="83">To be honest, when a siren catches you by surprise on the street, there is often nowhere to hide, there are no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.</seg>
          <seg id="84">I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.</seg>
          <seg id="85">This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every resident of Mykolaiv.</seg>
          <seg id="86">On the lawn near the entrance lies a huge trident - once decorated by the State Administration.</seg>
          <seg id="87">Now there is an empty "nothing" in the place where the trident used to show off.</seg>
          <seg id="88">The same as in the place of the office of the head of the Regional State Administration and a dozen offices around.</seg>
          <seg id="89">The missile landed squarely on Kim's desk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">The war takes on a completely different shape when it is not in the news, but underfoot.</seg>
          <seg id="91">I walk through the corridors of the ODA, and with every step I hear the crunch of glass.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Numerous documents are scattered on the floor - someone submitted requests and statements, but now it does not matter.</seg>
          <seg id="93">On the table of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag.</seg>
          <seg id="94">There is a flower on the bedside table.</seg>

          <seg id="7">It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body - an endless flow of people.</seg>

          <seg id="9">Some go on to Europe, some return home, some stay.</seg>
          <seg id="10">At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The war is reflected in the windows of cathedrals, which are boarded up with dictation.</seg>

          <seg id="13">But you can't hear the war on Rynok Square, where thousands of voices are heard simultaneously, you can't hear it in coffee shops and bars, where people continue to live.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Yes, life stops earlier - at 11 p.m., life hides from the curfew.</seg>
          <seg id="15">But it is there: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 p.m. and announced the alarm, we could only hear it from the alert on someone's phone.</seg>
          <seg id="16">And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living their lives.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Bucha, Irpin</seg>
          <seg id="18">We made our way to Kyiv through two of the many martyr cities, Bucha and Irpin.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Hero cities where the air smells of hope.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Despite the pain, people come back and rebuild their lives.</seg>
          <seg id="21">A private house.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The fence is like a sieve.</seg>
          <seg id="23">(Shell fragments or machine gun fire?..)</seg>
          <seg id="24">A Ukrainian flag is stretched out on the smashed balcony.</seg>
          <seg id="25">There are holes near the front door, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.</seg>
          <seg id="26">And there are three people rummaging around the front door.</seg>
          <seg id="27">They clean, repair, and build a wall and a new life with it.</seg>
          <seg id="28">A mother and her child are walking in the park two blocks down.</seg>
          <seg id="29">I can't help but ask myself: "Did their father survive the shooting of men in Bucha?</seg>
          <seg id="30">Will he walk with them again?"</seg>
          <seg id="31">On the way out of Irpin, there is a car cemetery.</seg>
          <seg id="32">These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and were ruthlessly shot by the Russian occupiers.</seg>
          <seg id="33">This cemetery has already become an object of a kind of "patriotic tourism."</seg>
          <seg id="34">If you go deeper and stand surrounded by autoskeletons, you can smell a heavy odor.</seg>
          <seg id="35">This is probably one of the smells of war.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Heavy, slow-moving air, as if it could be cut with a knife.</seg>
          <seg id="37">And it's been weeks since the passengers died...</seg>
          <seg id="38">If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.</seg>
          <seg id="39">In one of the cars, there was an abandoned bicycle, and in the other, a warm baby's overalls.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Somewhere there is a booklet with instructions for using the airbag.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Remnants of someone's everyday stories and lives.</seg>
          <seg id="42">As we continue driving, I look back at the city one last time and catch sight of the very bridge under which the frightened civilians were hiding.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Here is the same overturned bus, and here, on these broken slabs, a Ukrainian soldier was carrying a child in white.</seg>
          <seg id="44">This child in the white overalls probably survived.</seg>
          <seg id="45">But is there a chance that the child who wore the clothes left in one of the cars is still alive?</seg>
          <seg id="46">A man sits on a broken bridge with a camera over his shoulder.</seg>
          <seg id="47">He just sits and looks at the gap between Kyiv and Bucha.</seg>
          <seg id="48">He doesn't take pictures, he just looks.</seg>
          <seg id="49">Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge and wonders what it's like.</seg>
          <seg id="50">"Happy holiday!" a man shouts out to us joyfully, "Happy City Day!"</seg>
          <seg id="51">On May 29, wartime Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Mykolaiv</seg>
          <seg id="54">A hero city, an outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.</seg>
          <seg id="55">A frontline city that the occupiers still cannot capture.</seg>
          <seg id="56">And we believe that they will not capture it - the city is fighting and living.</seg>
          <seg id="57">On street corners, at every other intersection, there are neatly stacked tires and Banderite stripes.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Mykolaiv in the evening is incredibly quiet now - the noise of the city has subsided.</seg>
          <seg id="59">No voices, no cars in the evenings.</seg>
          <seg id="60">And at night it is extremely dark.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Light masking for safety.</seg>
          <seg id="62">People live by candlelight, or rather, by the flashlights of their cell phones.</seg>
          <seg id="63">At home, we turn on the lights only in the kitchen - quickly and when needed.</seg>
          <seg id="64">My grandmother curtained the windows with heavy blankets, so that no light could get through.</seg>
          <seg id="65">There is a hunting rifle next to my sister's childhood bed.</seg>
          <seg id="66">"I've had it on hand since the 24th," says the father.</seg>
          <seg id="67">When air raid alarms and explosions sound, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.</seg>
          <seg id="68">But not every time anymore.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Even in a frontline city, it is very difficult to live in a mode of constant anxiety.</seg>
          <seg id="70">When to live then?</seg>
          <seg id="71">The Russian army is 30 kilometers away from the town, shots from "peons" reach the Zhovtnevyi district and cover Kulbakyne.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Several times it flies close to my family.</seg>
          <seg id="73">To the next block, across the street from us.</seg>
          <seg id="74">To my grandmother's neighbors - her windows were blown out, and the children took them to their place, to a safer neighborhood.</seg>
          <seg id="75">And we are on the border of Ingul and Central districts.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Life goes on.</seg>
          <seg id="77">A siren wails on the central Soborna Street, and an elderly couple sits on a bench, chatting about something, discussing it quietly.</seg>
          <seg id="78">A cyclist passes by.</seg>
          <seg id="79">We look at each other with my dad - what are we going to do?</seg>
          <seg id="80">"Well... Shall we go for coffee?"</seg>
          <seg id="81">We are still sitting on Soborna Street (formerly Sovetska, by the way) in the park near the monument to St. Nicholas.</seg>
          <seg id="82">What else is there to do?</seg>
          <seg id="83">To be honest, when a siren catches you by surprise on the street, there is often nowhere to hide, no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.</seg>
          <seg id="84">I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.</seg>
          <seg id="85">It's not just a hole in the building, it's a hole in the heart of every Mykolaiv resident.</seg>
          <seg id="86">On the lawn near the entrance is a huge trident - it used to decorate the RSA.</seg>
          <seg id="87">Today, where the trident used to stand, there is an empty "nothing".</seg>
          <seg id="88">Just as it was at the site of the RSA head's office and a dozen offices around it.</seg>
          <seg id="89">The missile landed squarely on Kim's desk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">The war takes on a completely different shape when it is not in the news, but under our feet.</seg>
          <seg id="91">I walk through the corridors of the RSA, and with every step I hear the crunch of glass.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Numerous documents are scattered on the floor - someone had filed requests and applications, but it doesn't matter now.</seg>
          <seg id="93">On the desk of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag.</seg>
          <seg id="94">There is a flower on the nightstand.</seg>
          <seg id="95">We took her home, transplanted her, and let her live.</seg>
          <seg id="96">We met the guard who was on duty on March 29.</seg>
          <seg id="97">He survived.</seg>
          <seg id="98">"We've darned it, sewn it up," he points to his head.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Only journalists can get to the RSA.</seg>
          <seg id="100">We are joined by a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Photos, live broadcasts, interviews.</seg>
          <seg id="102">According to official figures, 36 people were killed.</seg>
          <seg id="103">This is "September 11 in Mykolaiv," a "monument to the Russian world," the press attaché of the regional head comments.</seg>
          <seg id="104">Mykolaiv Regional State Administration is just one of the wounds on the body of Mykolaiv.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And these wounds will not heal soon.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Even when Denmark helps rebuild the regional state administration, Mykolaiv residents will always see it as a terrible emptiness.</seg>

          <seg id="16">And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Bucha, Irpin.</seg>
          <seg id="18">We paved the way to Kyiv through two of the many martyr cities  through Bucha and Irpin.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Hero cities in which the air smells of hope.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Despite the pain, people return and rebuild their lives.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Private house.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The fence is like a sieve.</seg>
          <seg id="23">( Debris of shells or automatic queues.   )</seg>
          <seg id="24">On the crushed balcony, Ukrainian banner is stretched.</seg>
          <seg id="25">There are holes near the front door, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.</seg>
          <seg id="26">And at that front door, three are poking around at that front door.</seg>
          <seg id="27">They clean, repair, build a wall and with it a new life.</seg>
          <seg id="28">And the park two blocks below is walked by a mother and a child.</seg>
          <seg id="29">I can't help but ask myself: " Did their dad survive the shooting of men in Bucha?</seg>
          <seg id="30">Will he walk with them again? “</seg>
          <seg id="31">At the exit from Irpen, there is a cemetery of cars.</seg>
          <seg id="32">These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and which were ruthlessly shot by the Russian occupiers.</seg>
          <seg id="33">This cemetery has already become an object of a kind of “ patriotic tourism” .</seg>
          <seg id="34">If you go deep and stand surrounded by auto-keletons, you can feel a heavy smell.</seg>
          <seg id="35">This is probably one of the smells of war.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Heavy, slow air, it seems that it can be cut with a knife.</seg>
          <seg id="37">And weeks have passed since the death of passengers...</seg>
          <seg id="38">If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.</seg>
          <seg id="39">And in one of the cars there is an abandoned bicycle, in the other  a warm children's overalls.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Somewhere a booklet with instructions for using the airbag is not burned.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Remnants of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.</seg>
          <seg id="42">We drive on, look back at the city for the last time, and come across the same bridge under which frightened civilians were hiding.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Here is the same overturned bus, but it was on these broken plates that the Ukrainian military carried a baby in white.</seg>
          <seg id="44">This child in the white jumpsuit probably survived.</seg>
          <seg id="45">But is there a chance that a child who wore clothes abandoned in one of the cars is also alive?</seg>
          <seg id="46">On the torn bridge sits a man, a camera over his shoulder, sitting on the torn bridge.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Just sitting and looking at the abyss between Kyiv and Bucha.</seg>
          <seg id="48">He does not take pictures, but only looks at them.</seg>
          <seg id="49">Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge, and thinks: how it is?</seg>
          <seg id="50">"Happy holidays! “ - the man exclaims to us happily. “ Happy City Day” “</seg>
          <seg id="51">On May 29, the military Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Mykolaiv.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The hero city, the outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.</seg>
          <seg id="55">A front-line city that the occupiers still cannot capture.</seg>
          <seg id="56">And we believe that they will not seize it  the city is at war and lives.</seg>
          <seg id="57">At the corner of streets, at every second intersection, tires and Bandera stripes are neatly folded together.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Evening Mykolaiv is now incredibly quiet  the noise against which the city lived has subsided against the background of which the city lived.</seg>
          <seg id="59">No voices, no cars in the evenings, no cars.</seg>
          <seg id="60">And at night it is extremely dark.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Light masking for safety purposes.</seg>
          <seg id="62">People live “ by candlelight”, more precisely, by the flashlights of mobile phones.</seg>
          <seg id="63">At home, we turn on the lights only in the kitchen  quickly and as needed  quickly and as needed.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Grandma covered the windows with heavy blankets, through which light does not break through the light.</seg>
          <seg id="65">There is a hunting rifle by my sister's childhood bed.</seg>
          <seg id="66">"At hand since the 24th, " says the father, " says the father.</seg>
          <seg id="67">With air raid alarms and sounds of explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement to the basement.</seg>
          <seg id="68">But not every time, now.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Even in the frontline city, it is very difficult to live in constant alarms.</seg>
          <seg id="70">When then to live?</seg>
          <seg id="71">Russian army  30 kilometers from the city, shots from the “ peony” reach the Zhovtnevy district, cover Kulbakyne.</seg>
          <seg id="72">He flies close to my relatives several times.</seg>
          <seg id="73">To the next block, across the street from us.</seg>
          <seg id="74">To my grandmother's neighbors - my grandmother's windows were taken out, the children took them to their home, to a safer area, to a safer area.</seg>
          <seg id="75">And we are on the border of Ingul and Central districts.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Life goes on.</seg>
          <seg id="77">A siren is howling on the central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple is sitting on a bench, talking about something, calmly discussing it, and that's how they discuss it.</seg>
          <seg id="78">A cyclist passes them by.</seg>
          <seg id="79">Watching with Dad  what will we do?</seg>
          <seg id="80">“ Well... Let’ s go and have some coffee.” “</seg>
          <seg id="81">So we sit on Sobornaya Street ( former Soviet, by the way) in the park near the monument to St. Nicholas's.</seg>
          <seg id="82">And what else to do?</seg>
          <seg id="83">To be honest, when the siren takes you by surprise on the street, there is often no place to hide, there are no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.</seg>
          <seg id="84">I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.</seg>
          <seg id="85">This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every Mykolaiv resident.</seg>
          <seg id="86">On the lawn at the entrance lies a huge trident  once decorated by the Regional State Administration.</seg>
          <seg id="87">Now in the place where the trident flaunted, there was an empty "nothing" left in the place where the trident flaunted.</seg>
          <seg id="88">As well as in the place of the office of the head of the Regional State Administration and a dozen offices around the area.</seg>
          <seg id="89">The rocket landed squarely on Kim's desk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">The war takes on a completely different outline when it is not in the news, but underfoot.</seg>
          <seg id="91">I walk along the corridors of the Regional State Administration, and with each step I hear the crunch of glass.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Numerous documents are scattered on the floor  someone submitted requests and applications, but now it does not matter.</seg>
          <seg id="93">On the table of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag on it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">There is a flower on the bedside table.</seg>
          <seg id="95">They took her home, transplanted her, even if she lives.</seg>
          <seg id="96">We met a guard who was at the post on March 29th.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Survived</seg>
          <seg id="98">"Shut up, sewn up, " he points to his head, pointing at his head. “ Already at work” .</seg>
          <seg id="99">Only journalists can enter the Regional State Administration.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Together with us are a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Photos, live inclusions, interviews, etc.</seg>
          <seg id="102">According to official data, 36 people were killed.</seg>
          <seg id="103">This is "September 11 in Mykolaiv", "a monument to the Russian world", comments the press attaché of the regional head of the region, commenting.</seg>
          <seg id="104">The Mykolaiv regional state administration is just one of the wounds on the body of Mykolaiv.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And these wounds will not heal soon.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Even when Denmark helps restore the Regional State Administration, Mykolaiv residents will always see it as a terrible emptiness.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Ми чуємо історії про втечу в безпечне місце, розповіді матерів, які розповідають своїм дітям про велику пригодницьку подорож, у яку вони вирушають разом, щоб посадити їх у поспіхом завантажені машини.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Історії дітей, які почуваються невпевнено та бояться всіх дорослих, які досі не зовсім розуміють, чому їхні батьки залишилися вдома.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Історії дітей, для яких єдиний спогад про будинок - це іграшка, за яку вони могли вчепитися під час багатьох годин, проведених у переповнених поїздах в оточенні дивних, незрозуміло сумних людей, - підкреслюють організатори.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Наприкінці кожної поїздки – повернення до безпечного будинку.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Але ця поїздка інша, страшніша.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ця поїздка не закінчилася навіть через понад вісім місяців.</seg>

          <seg id="14">До цього доклали рук майстри та майстрині, які разом з дітьми та дорослими створили костюми та маски величезних іграшок, соняшників, мотанок, будиночків та дивовижних птахів, які сяють.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Парад пройшов від Кампи до Вацлаваку, та на кожній зупинці грав величезний перформанс, драматургію якого розробила українська драматургиня та письменниця Оксана Маслова.</seg>
          <seg id="16">"Мені було дуже важливо зберегти світлу ідею параду та водночас показати з чим стикаються, українці зараз, - каже драматургиня. - Тому структура перформансу відображає нормальне життя, який перериває повітряна атака.</seg>
          <seg id="17">На порятунок першими приходить птахи, що світяться - вони закривають своїми крилами в першу чергу, дітей.</seg>
          <seg id="18">І після нещодавної масштабної атаки ракетами, цей символ крил, що захищають стає ще актіальнішим.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Дитячі голоси починають співати українську пісню.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Ця пісня шириться колоною.</seg>
          <seg id="21">І всі істоти повертались до життя: і соняшники, і мотанки, і іграшки і навіть домики.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Такий символізм.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Я дуже вдячна Чехії та кожному чеху, які допомогли та допомагають Україні та українцям.</seg>
          <seg id="24">І я вірю, що разом ми зможемо подолати цей непростий шлях і в домах запанує безпека".</seg>

          <seg id="1">Наша редакція поспілкувалася з українською біженкою Мариною, яка в рідному Нікополі працювала в галузі архітектури будівель та споруд.</seg>
          <seg id="2">«Нині я намагаюся реалізуватися як художниця», – розповіла українка.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Тривога, невпевненість, страх, переживання за рідних.</seg>
          <seg id="4">У розмові з Мариною, біженкою з України, простежується розгубленість щодо адаптації до нових умов, у яких вона опинилася разом із дітьми.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Але жінка вірить у свої сили і намагається пристосуватися до життя в Празі, не покидаючи думки повернутися до України.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Із Нікополя до Праги</seg>
          <seg id="7">Марина родом із Нікополя, що на Дніпропетровщині.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Саме там вона познайомилася зі своїм чоловіком і народила двох діточок – сина та донечку.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Працювала архітектором у Державній нікопольській установі.</seg>
          <seg id="10">«За освітою я архітектор будівель та споруд, закінчила Дніпропетровську академію архітектури з червоним дипломом.</seg>
          <seg id="11">До цього навчалася у художній школі, закінчила ліцей за спеціальністю «художник-оформлювач»», – розповіла Марина.</seg>
          <seg id="12">І все було добре, але 24 лютого її життя змінилося.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Як і мільйони українців, що тікали від натиску російської агресії в Україні, Марина, не роздумуючи, разом із дітьми виїхала з України.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Прихистком для жінки стала Прага.</seg>
          <seg id="15">«Звичайно, нове місто, велике, багатолюдне… Нова мова, але чеська дуже схожа на українську, тому багато чого з того, що мені говорять чехи, я розумію.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Знання англійської і мова жестів також стали мені у пригоді.</seg>
          <seg id="17">До того ж я не соромлюсь звернутися за допомогою до чехів і ніколи не відчула від них якоїсь агресії.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Дякую їм за це», – поділилася Марина.</seg>
          <seg id="19">За її словами, у вирішенні питань, пов’язаних із пошуком житла, оформленням візи та страхування, поданням документів на отримання пільг, їй допомогли люди, які вже довго живуть в Празі.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Але багато проблем їй доводиться вирішувати самостійно.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Відсутність місця в садку</seg>
          <seg id="22">Отримавши візу толерованого перебування, Марина мріяла знайти роботу.</seg>
          <seg id="23">«Звичайно, я хочу знайти роботу за фахом.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Але коли роботодавці дізнаються, що у мене двоє дітей, то розводять руками…», – розповіла вона.</seg>
          <seg id="25">«До садочку нас не взяли, бо немає місць.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Кажуть, що треба шукати адаптаційні групи для дітей, а де вони є, ніхто конкретно не знає.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Я познайомилася з однією дівчинкою, яка добре говорить чеською мовою.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Вона прагнула мені допомогти з пошуком місця в садку для дітей, обдзвонюючи низку різних інстанцій, але…», – продовжує Марина.</seg>
          <seg id="29">«Взагалі мене дуже турбує стан моїх дітей, їм важко пристосуватися до нових умов, вони стали примхливими і неслухняними.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Я не можу сказати, що діти заважають мені, але якби вони ходили до садка, я б змогла спокійно відвідувати курси чеської мови.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Одного разу пішла з малими на заняття з чеської, так вони трохи погралися, а потім почали неспокійно поводитись.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Я, як нормальна матуся, відволікалася, не змогла нормально вчитися… Якби ж були мовні курси для дорослих із дітьми або з малими хтось був під час навчання…Але моя донечка так прив’язана до мене», – зітхає жінка.</seg>
          <seg id="33">«Звичайно, ми разом із дітьми ходимо на різні безкоштовні заходи, які створені саме для біженців з України, за що велика окрема подяка Чехії», – додала Марина.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Коли діти сплять, Марина займається самоосвітою, вчить чеську онлайн, бо розуміє, що це допоможе їй знайти роботу і якось самоорганізуватися в чужій країні.</seg>
          <seg id="35">На підтримку України</seg>
          <seg id="36">Одного разу Марина переглядала вакансії в інтернеті і побачила оголошення: «У рамках ініціативи Асоціації «Spolek Zaedno» за підтримки представництва ЄК у Чехії «12 зірок для України» організовуємо одноденну мистецьку майстерню в Будинку національних меншин у Празі.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Шукаємо українських художників, пропонуємо пензлики, фарби.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Від учасників вимагається лише творча уява…».</seg>
          <seg id="39">Марина не могла не скористатися цією нагодою.</seg>
          <seg id="40">«Я набралася сміливості і подала заявку на участь.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Усіх бажаючих запросили на зустріч, де ми цілий день малювали.</seg>
          <seg id="42">До цього я не спала, переживала.</seg>
          <seg id="43">До того ж я шість років не брала пензлика до рук», – розповіла українка.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Під час творчої зустрічі було створено 14 великоформатних картин акрилом на полотні розміром 80 х 60 см, серед яких 12 картин – роботи українських художників.</seg>
          <seg id="45">«Тематика картин була вільна, але ми все-таки домовилися, що використаємо українську тематику у своїх роботах – за основу палітри ми обрали кольори українського прапора.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Тому в колекції картин переважають синьо-жовті кольори», – додала Марина.</seg>
          <seg id="47">У заході взяли участь 30 претендентів, з яких обрали лише 12.</seg>
          <seg id="48">Марина була серед них.</seg>
          <seg id="49">1 червня в Празі за їхньої участі відбудеться виставка картин за підтримки представництва ЄС у Чехії.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Our editorial staff spoke with Maryna, Ukrainian refugee, who worked in the Field of Buildings and Structures Architecture in native Nikopol.</seg>
          <seg id="2">"Now, I try to become a painter," – told the Ukrainian woman.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Alert, insecurity, fear, worries about relatives.</seg>
          <seg id="4">When talk to Maryna, the Ukrainian refugee, you can feel her confusion regarding adaptation to new conditions in which she finds herself and her children.</seg>
          <seg id="5">However, the woman believes in herself and tries to adjust to life in Prague while still wanting to return to Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="6">From Nikopol to Prague</seg>
          <seg id="7">Maryna is originally from Nikopol located in Dnipropetrovsk region.</seg>
          <seg id="8">That's where she met her husband and gave birth to two children – son and daughter.</seg>
          <seg id="9">She worked as architect in a public institution in Nikopol.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"By education, I'm an architect of buildings and structures, I finished Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Before that, I went to school of art and graduated the lyceum in the specialty of graphic designer," – told Maryna.</seg>
          <seg id="12">And everything was fine, but on February 24 her life has changed.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Like millions of Ukrainians, who were escaping from Russia's aggression in Ukraine, Maryna left Ukraine with her children without hesitation.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Prague became a shelter for the woman.</seg>
          <seg id="15">"Of course, this is a new city for us, it is big and crowded… There is a new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian therefore I understand much of what Czechs tell me.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Besides, I'm not ashamed to ask Czechs for help and I have never felt any aggression from them.</seg>
          <seg id="18">I appreciate that," – shared Maryna.</seg>
          <seg id="19">According to her, people who have lived in Prague for years helped her in resolving issues in regard to finding accommodation, visa and insurance processing, applying for benefits.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But still many problems she has to solve on her own.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The lack of place in kindergarten</seg>
          <seg id="22">Maryna wished to find a job after she had obtained the visa.</seg>
          <seg id="23">"Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.</seg>
          <seg id="24">But employers shrug their shoulders when finding out that I have two children…" – told her.</seg>
          <seg id="25">"We were not accepted to kindergarten because there are no places.</seg>
          <seg id="26">People say, we have to look for adaptation groups for children, but where to find them nobody knows exactly.</seg>
          <seg id="27">I met one girl who speaks Czech fluently.</seg>
          <seg id="28">She wanted to help me find a place in kindergarten for children, making calls to a number of various instances, but…" – continues Maryna.</seg>
          <seg id="29">"In general, I'm very concerned about my children's condition, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become moody and naughty.</seg>
          <seg id="30">I cannot say that children bother me, but if they visit kindergarten, I would be able to quietly attend Czech courses.</seg>
          <seg id="31">One day, I came to Czech class with children, they played a little and then started to misbehave.</seg>
          <seg id="32">I, like a normal mother, distracted and couldn't study properly… I wish there were language courses for adults with children or someone, who would play with children during classes… But my daughter is so attached to me," – the woman sighs.</seg>
          <seg id="33">"Of course, my children and I attend different free events created especially for Ukrainian refugees, and I'm grateful to the Czech Republic for them," – added Maryna.</seg>
          <seg id="34">When the children sleep, Maryna is engaged in self-education and studies Czech online because she understands that it will help her find a job and somehow self-organize in a foreign country.</seg>
          <seg id="35">In support of Ukraine</seg>
          <seg id="36">One day, Maryna was looking for vacancies on the Internet and saw the following announcement: "As part of the initiative of the Association "Spolek Zaedno" with support of EU in the Czech Republic "12 stars for Ukraine" we are organizing a one-day art workshop in the Building of National Minorities in Prague.</seg>
          <seg id="37">We are looking for Ukrainian painters, brushes and colors are provided.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The participants are required only creative imagination…"</seg>
          <seg id="39">Maryna couldn't pass up this opportunity.</seg>
          <seg id="40">"I plucked up the courage and applied for participation.</seg>
          <seg id="41">All interested persons were invited to a meeting where we painted throughout the day.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Before that, I didn't sleep and was worried.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Besides, I didn't hold a brush for six years," – told the Ukrainian woman.</seg>
          <seg id="44">During the art meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on the canvas of dimensions 80 х 60 cm were created, 12 of which are works of Ukrainian artists.</seg>
          <seg id="45">"The theme of paintings was open, but we agreed to use Ukraine as a theme for our works – as a palette basis we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Therefore, the blue and yellow colors prevail in the collection of paintings," – added Maryna.</seg>
          <seg id="47">30 candidates participated in the event and only 12 of them were chosen.</seg>
          <seg id="48">Maryna was among them.</seg>
          <seg id="49">On June 1, they will host an exhibition of paintings in Prague with support of EU in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="50">"Here's how it happens in life.</seg>
          <seg id="51">All of your acquired knowledge and skills may be useful and support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," – pointed out Maryna.</seg>
          <seg id="52">"In the meantime, I try to become a painter.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Every step is a fight with my fears and myself.</seg>
          <seg id="54">But I have to do something…" – told the woman.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Maryna is grateful to the Czech Republic for hospitality and friendliness, and she believes that the war will end soon, and she comes back to Ukraine with her children.</seg>

          <seg id="4">In the conversation with Maryna, a refugee from Ukraine, one can see her confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she found herself with her children.</seg>
          <seg id="5">But the woman believes in her own strength and is trying to adapt to life in Prague, without abandoning the idea of returning to Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="6">From Nikopol to Prague</seg>
          <seg id="7">Marina is from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region.</seg>
          <seg id="8">It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children - a son and a daughter.</seg>
          <seg id="9">She worked as an architect at the Nikopol State Institution.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"By education I am an architect of buildings and structures, I graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Before that, she studied at an art school, graduated from a lyceum with a specialty of "artist-decorator", - said Marina.</seg>
          <seg id="12">And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina, without thinking twice, left Ukraine with her children.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Prague became a refuge for the woman.</seg>
          <seg id="15">"Of course, it's a new city, big, crowded... It's a new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs say to me.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In addition, I am not ashamed to ask for help from the Czechs and I have never felt any aggression from them.</seg>
          <seg id="18">I thank them for that," Marina shared.</seg>
          <seg id="19">According to her, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time in solving issues related to finding housing, obtaining a visa and insurance, and submitting documents to receive benefits.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But she has to solve many problems on her own.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Lack of space in the kindergarten</seg>
          <seg id="22">After receiving a tolerated stay visa, Marina dreamed of finding a job.</seg>
          <seg id="23">"Of course, I want to find a job in my field.</seg>
          <seg id="24">But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands..." she said.</seg>
          <seg id="25">"They didn't take us to kindergarten because there are no places.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They say that it is necessary to look for adaptation groups for children, but no one specifically knows where they are.</seg>
          <seg id="27">I met a girl who speaks Czech well.</seg>
          <seg id="28">She tried to help me find a place in a kindergarten for children, calling a number of different authorities, but..." Marina continues.</seg>
          <seg id="29">"In general, I am very concerned about the state of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient.</seg>
          <seg id="30">I can't say that the children are bothering me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to attend Czech language courses.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Once I went to a Czech class with the little ones, so they played a little, and then they started to behave restlessly.</seg>
          <seg id="32">As a normal mother, I was distracted, I couldn't study properly... If there were language courses for adults with children or with small ones, someone would be there during the training... But my daughter is so attached to me," the woman sighs.</seg>
          <seg id="33">"Of course, together with our children, we go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which we are very grateful to the Czech Republic," Marina added.</seg>
          <seg id="34">When the children sleep, Marina engages in self-education, learns Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.</seg>
          <seg id="35">In support of Ukraine</seg>
          <seg id="36">One day, Marina was looking at vacancies on the Internet and saw an announcement: "Within the framework of the initiative of the Association "Spolek Zaedno" with the support of the EC representation in the Czech Republic, "12 stars for Ukraine", we are organizing a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague.</seg>
          <seg id="37">We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes and paints.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Only creative imagination is required from the participants...".</seg>
          <seg id="39">Marina could not fail to take advantage of this opportunity.</seg>
          <seg id="40">"I gathered courage and applied for participation.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Everyone was invited to a meeting, where we painted all day.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Before that, I didn't sleep, I worried.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Besides, I haven't picked up a paintbrush in six years," said the Ukrainian woman.</seg>
          <seg id="44">During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists.</seg>
          <seg id="45">"The theme of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use the Ukrainian theme in our works - we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.</seg>
          <seg id="46">That's why the collection of paintings is dominated by blue-yellow colors," Marina added.</seg>
          <seg id="47">30 applicants took part in the event, of which only 12 were selected.</seg>
          <seg id="48">Marina was among them.</seg>
          <seg id="49">On June 1, an exhibition of paintings will be held in Prague with their participation, with the support of the EU representation in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="50">"That's how it is in life.</seg>
          <seg id="51">All your once-acquired knowledge and skills can come in handy, and also support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," Marina noted.</seg>
          <seg id="52">"Now I'm trying to realize myself as an artist.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Every step is a fight against your fears and yourself.</seg>
          <seg id="54">But something must be done...", the woman said.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Marina is indebted to the Czech Republic for its hospitality and friendliness, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.</seg>

          <seg id="36">Once Maryna looked at vacancies on the Internet and saw the announcement: “As part of the initiative of the Association “Spolek Zaedno” with the support of the EC Delegation in the Czech Republic “12 Stars for Ukraine”, we organize a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague.</seg>
          <seg id="37">We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.</seg>

          <seg id="40">“I gathered the courage and applied for participation.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Everyone was invited to a meeting where we painted all day.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Before that, I did not sleep, worried.</seg>
          <seg id="43">In addition, I have not taken a brush in my hands for six years,” the Ukrainian woman said.</seg>
          <seg id="44">During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, including 12 paintings — works of Ukrainian artists.</seg>
          <seg id="45">“The themes of the paintings were free, but we still agreed that we would use Ukrainian themes in our works — we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Therefore, blue-yellow colors prevail in the collection of paintings,” added Marina.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The event was attended by 30 applicants, of which only 12 were chosen.</seg>
          <seg id="48">Marina was among them.</seg>
          <seg id="49">On June 1, an exhibition of paintings with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic will take place in Prague with their participation.</seg>
          <seg id="50">“This is how it happens in life.</seg>
          <seg id="51">All your once acquired knowledge and skills can be useful, and even support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic,” said Maryna.</seg>
          <seg id="52">“Now I am trying to become an artist.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.</seg>
          <seg id="54">But we have to do something...” the woman said.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Our editorial staff spoke with Ukrainian refugee Marina, who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.</seg>
          <seg id="2">" Now I am trying to realize myself as an artist, " said the Ukrainian woman.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, worries for relatives.</seg>
          <seg id="4">In a conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, one can see the confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she found herself with her children together.</seg>
          <seg id="5">But the woman believes in herself and tries to adapt to life in Prague, without giving up the idea of returning to Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="6">From Nikopol to Prague.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Marina is from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region.</seg>
          <seg id="8">It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children  a son and a daughter.</seg>
          <seg id="9">She worked as an architect in the Nikopol State Institution.</seg>
          <seg id="10">“ By education, I am an architect of buildings and structures, graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Before that, she studied at an art school, graduated from the lyceum with a degree in "artist-designer", "said Marina.</seg>
          <seg id="12">And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina, without thinking, left Ukraine with her children.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Prague became a refuge for women.</seg>
          <seg id="15">“ Of course, a new city, big, crowded... A new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs say to me, I understand the Czech, I understand a lot of what the Czechs say.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In addition, I am not ashamed to seek help from the Czechs and have never felt any aggression from them.</seg>
          <seg id="18">I thank them for that,” Marina shared.</seg>
          <seg id="19">According to her, in solving issues related to finding housing, obtaining a visa and insurance, submitting documents for benefits, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time.</seg>
          <seg id="20">But she has to solve many problems on her own.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Lack of space in the kindergarten.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Having received a tolerated stay visa, Marina dreamed of finding a job.</seg>
          <seg id="23">“ Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.</seg>
          <seg id="24">But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands...” she said, “ she said.”</seg>
          <seg id="25">“ They didn't take us to kindergarten, because there are no places to live.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They say that it is necessary to look for adaptation groups for children, and where they are, no one specifically knows what they are.</seg>
          <seg id="27">I met a girl who speaks Czech well.</seg>
          <seg id="28">She sought to help me find a place in the kindergarten for children, calling a number of different authorities, but...”, continues Marina, continuing.</seg>
          <seg id="29">"In general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient, they have become capricious and disobedient.</seg>
          <seg id="30">I can't say that children interfere with me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to safely attend Czech language courses.</seg>
          <seg id="31">One day I went with the little ones to classes in Czech, so they played a little, and then they began to behave restlessly, and then they began to behave restlessly.</seg>
          <seg id="32">I, like a normal mother, was distracted, could not study normally... If there were language courses for adults with children or with children, someone was during the training... But my daughter is so attached to me, "the woman sighs, "the woman sighs, "as if there were language courses for adults with children or with children."</seg>
          <seg id="33">"Of course, together with our children, we go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which we are very grateful, " added Marina, "the Czech Republic, "added.</seg>

          <seg id="7">У турецькій Анталії на зборах відбувся конфлікт між гравцями українського футбольного клубу "Минай" з прем'єр-ліги та російського "Шинника".</seg>
          <seg id="8">Сторони підтвердили, що йшлося про бійку на території місцевого готелю, де випадково поселилися обидві команди.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Спочатку про конфлікт, який стався 13 лютого, писали українські та російські ЗМІ.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Потім бійку підтвердили обидва клуби.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Відповідно до офіційної заяви ФК "Минай", конфлікт спровокували росіяни.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Начебто один з них був нетверезим та чіплявся до співробітниці готелю, а український гравець втрутився.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"Бійка дійсно відбулась, але вже на поверсі, де зупинились росіяни, й у рівних складах.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Кількість постраждалих зі сторони "Шинника" лише підтверджує той факт, що росіяни своїх ще й як "кидають", - йдеться в заяві.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Клуб заявляє, що вже після закінчення сутички росіяни продовжили бійку між собою, довелось втрутитися місцевій поліції.</seg>
          <seg id="16">"Перед початком зборів головною вимогою ФК "Минай" до організаторів була відсутність у готелі російських команд.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Самі ж організатори стверджують, що поселити "Шинник" погодився готель", - йдеться в заяві.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Футбольний журналіст Роман Бебех, який одним з перших у твіттері повідомив про ситуацію, виклав фото українського гравця, який захищав співробітницю.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Російська сторона підтверджує, що бійка була, але запевняє, що спровокували конфлікт українці.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Зокрема, телеграм-канал Baza пише, що представники "Миная" підійшли до гравців ярославського "Шинника" та стали вимагати заспівати український гімн.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Українці це заперечили.</seg>
          <seg id="22">"Кількісна перевага була на їхньому боці.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Декілька людей напали на нашого хлопця.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Ярославці заступилися за нього та відстояли.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Наших було п'ять-шість осіб, українців набагато більше", - розповіло близьке до російського клубу джерело виданню "Коммерсант".</seg>
          <seg id="26">У результаті кілька російських гравців отримали ушкодження.</seg>
          <seg id="27">"Ярославських футболістів оглянув лікар, серед пошкоджень - розсічення губи, перелом пальця на нозі та підозра на забій ребер", - пише "Коммерсант".</seg>
          <seg id="28">"Я не розумію, звідки в готелі могли взятися українці, бо коли ми бронювали готель, була умова, що там не буде команд з України", - обурився гендиректор "Шинника" Сергій Кулаков в коментарі журналістам.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Згодом Кулаков розповів російському агентству "РИА Новости", що росіяни виїжджають з готелю, але підкреслив, що їх не виселяють, вони вирішили виїхати самі.</seg>

          <seg id="7">In Antalya, Turkey, there was a conflict between players of the Ukrainian Premier League football club Minaj and Russian Shinnik at a meeting.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The parties confirmed it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams happened to be staying.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Initially, the conflict that occurred on February 13 was reported by Ukrainian and Russian media.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Then both clubs confirmed the fight happened.</seg>
          <seg id="11">According to the official statement from Minaj FC, the Russians provoked the conflict.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Allegedly, one of them was drunk and was harassing a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.</seg>
          <seg id="13">“There was indeed a fight, but it happened on the floor where the Russians were staying and in equal numbers.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The number of people injured on the Shinnik side only confirms the fact that the Russians are also ‘abandoning’ their own,” the statement said.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The club claims that after the fight ended, the Russians continued fighting among themselves, and the local police had to intervene.</seg>
          <seg id="16">“Before the start of the meeting, Minaj FC’s main request to the organizers was that there were no Russian teams in the hotel.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The organizers themselves claim that it was the hotel that agreed to accommodate Shinnik,” the statement reads.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Roman Bebekh, a football journalist, who was one of the first to tweet about the situation, posted a photo of the Ukrainian player who defended the employee.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The Russian side confirms that there was indeed a fight, but insists that it was provoked by the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="20">In particular, the Baza telegram channel writes that representatives of Minaj approached the players of the Yaroslavl’s Shinnik and demanded that they sing the Ukrainian anthem.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The Ukrainians objected to this.</seg>
          <seg id="22">“They had a numerical advantage on their side.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Several people attacked our guy.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The guys from Yaroslavl stood up for him and defended him.</seg>
          <seg id="25">There were five or six of us and many more of the Ukrainians,” a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.</seg>
          <seg id="26">As a result, several Russian players were injured.</seg>
          <seg id="27">“The Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, and their injuries included a split lip, a broken toe and what is suspected to be bruised ribs,” Kommersant reports.</seg>
          <seg id="28">“I don’t understand how there could be Ukrainians in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine,” Shinnik CEO Serhiy Kulakov said in a comment to reporters.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Later, Kulakov told the RIA Novosti, Russian news agency, that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but emphasized that they were not being forced to leave, they had decided to leave on their own.</seg>

          <seg id="2">І до чого тут ліки для діабетиків</seg>
          <seg id="3">7 хвилин (и) тому</seg>
          <seg id="4">Ін'єкції, що набирають популярності, допомагають скинути до 15% ваги, але мають чимало побічних ефектів.</seg>
          <seg id="5">У Британії роздрібним аптекам дозволять продавати ін'єкції для схуднення Wegovy, якими користуються деякі відомі люди, зокрема, Ілон Маск.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Головний компонент Wegovy - семаглутид, що допомагає впоратись з ожирінням при діабеті другого типу.</seg>
          <seg id="7">У його застосуванні зізнавались Ілон Маск та Кім Кардаш"ян, які мають велику аудиторію у соцмережах.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Препарат також популярний серед відомих блогерів і зірок Голлівуду.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Семаглутид та інші засоби для лікування діабету другого типу дійсно можуть сприяти зниженню ваги.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Впливаючи на специфічні рецептори в організмі, вони пригнічують апетит й уповільнюють травлення їжі.</seg>
          <seg id="11">В результаті людина рідше відчуває голод, швидше насичується й споживає менше калорій.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Однак експерти попереджають, що це не швидке рішення і не диво-ліки, які допомагають скинути вагу без будь-яких зусиль.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Лікування відбувається під наглядом фахівця й підкріплюється дієтою і фізичним навантаженням.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Як і будь-які ліки, Wegovy може мати побічні ефекти.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Серед найбільш поширених - нудота або розлад шлунка, здуття живота та гази.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Крім того, швидке схуднення може призвести до втрати жиру на обличчі, а в деяких людей - до западання щік та появи новий зморшок.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Цей ефект лікарі назвали "обличчя Оземпік", від назви ще одного препарату для лікування діабету, який також приймають для схуднення.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Медики радять приймати Wegovy не більше двох років.</seg>

          <seg id="4">На деяких ділянках фронту ЗСУ вдалося відновити раніше втрачені позиції і закріпитися там.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Про це заявив головнокомандувач ЗСУ Валерій Залужний під час розмови з головою об'єднаного комітету начальників штабів США генералом Марком Міллі.</seg>
          <seg id="6">За словами Залужного, найбільш напружена ситуація сьогодні на Донецькому напрямку, де росіяни щодня здійснюють до 50 атак.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Запеклі бої тривають в районі Вугледара і Марʼїнки, де за словами Залужного, ЗСУ надійно тримають оборону.</seg>

          <seg id="11">Зараз це місто - головна ціль армії РФ.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Очільник російського міністерства оборони Сергій Шойгу заявив 7 лютого, що ситуація біля Бахмуту для його військ "розвивається успішно".</seg>

          <seg id="16">10 лютого Росія завдала по Україні нового ракетного удару.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Внаслідок цього є руйнування у столиці та багатьох регіонах.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Європейський Союз у річницю повномасштабного військового вторгнення Росії в Україну запровадить нові санкції щодо РФ.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Про це заявив канцлер Німеччини Олаф Шольц (Olaf Scholz), виступаючи в середу, 8 лютого, з урядовою заявою в Бундестазі напередодні надзвичайного саміту ЄС.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Шольц пообіцяв, що ЄС підтримуватиме Україну "настільки довго, скільки це буде необхідно".</seg>
          <seg id="5">Канцлер зазначив, що Німеччина є однією з країн, які надають Києву найбільшу фінансову підтримку.</seg>
          <seg id="6">"У постачанні зброї та боєприпасів ми теж далеко попереду всіх у континентальній Європі", - додав він.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Водночас Шольц розкритикував "публічні торги під девізом: бойові танки, підводні човни, літаки - хто вимагатиме ще більше".</seg>
          <seg id="8">За його словами, від таких дискусій та розбіжностей виграє лише російський президент та його пропаганда.</seg>

          <seg id="10">Шольц: НАТО не має стати однією зі сторін конфлікту</seg>
          <seg id="11">Крім того, німецький канцлер вкотре наголосив, що, попри всю допомогу, яка надається Україні, Північноатлантичний альянс (НАТО) не повинен стати однією зі сторін у військовому конфлікті з Росією.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Він також пообіцяв і надалі тісно координувати з партнерами постачання зброї Києву.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Шольц нагадав про обіцянку, яку він дав Україні на саміті ЄС у червні 2022 року, про підтримку на шляху до європейської інтеграції.</seg>
          <seg id="14">На майбутньому надзвичайному саміті країни Євросоюзу мають намір підтвердити свою відданість європейському шляху України, наголосив він.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Україна належить до Європи, а її майбутнє - в складі Євросоюзу, додав канцлер.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Надзвичайний саміт Євросоюзу пройде 9-10 лютого в Брюсселі.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Однією з головних тем стане війна Росії проти України.</seg>
          <seg id="18">За даними агенції Reuters, у саміті лідерів ЄС візьме участь президент України Володимир Зеленський.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Президентка Європарламенту Роберта Мецола під час засідання у четвер, 9 лютого, в ході якого виступив президент України Володимир Зеленський, закликала надати Україні літаки та далекобійну зброю.</seg>
          <seg id="3">"Держави-члени ЄС повинні швидко розглянути, як наступний крок, надання систем дальнього радіусу дії та винищувачів, необхідних вам для захисту свободи, яку багато хто сприймає як належне", - заявила Мецола.</seg>
          <seg id="4">За її словами, відповідь має бути пропорційна загрозі, яка є дуже серйозною.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"Україна - це Європа, і майбутнє вашої нації - в Європейському Союзі", - сказала вона, звертаючись до Зеленського.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Зеленський: Україна не дозволить РФ знищити європейський спосіб життя</seg>
          <seg id="7">Зеленський, своєю чергою, також зауважив, що Україна вже на шляху до членства в ЄС.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Ми наближаємось до Євросоюзу.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Україна буде членом Євросоюзу.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Україна, що перемагає, - членом Євросоюзу, що перемагає", - заявив Зеленський у своєму виступі перед європарламентарями.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Він також зазначив, що Україна разом з Європою захищається від "найбільш антиєвропейської сили сучасного світу".</seg>
          <seg id="12">"Український європейський спосіб життя намагаються знищити тотальною війною.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Але для чого?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Щоб після українського європейського способу життя знищити європейський шлях як такий.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Для кожного з усіх 27 елементів європейського способу життя, 27 країн Євросоюзу.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Ми цього не дозволимо", - наголосив президент України.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Зеленський проситиме пришвидшити поставки зброї</seg>
          <seg id="18">Напередодні DW повідомляла, що Зеленський прибув до Брюсселя, щоб отримати підтримку Європейської Ради та пришвидшити надання Україні критично необхідної зброї.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Як нагадало джерело видання з передової дипломатичної команди Зеленського, під час візиту Зеленського до США наприкінці грудня минулого року, Київ отримав "домовленість про передачу Україні зенітних ракетних комплексів Patriot і значну фінансову підтримку, за яку проголосував Конгрес".</seg>
          <seg id="20">"Тому президент України очікує подібних результатів, коли особисто їде в інші столиці", - сказав співрозмовник.</seg>
          <seg id="21">При цьому дипломат зазначив, що, "звичайно, такі рішення - не справа Євроради, а рішення країн-членів".</seg>
          <seg id="22">Очікується, що Зеленський озвучить потреби України в зброї під час саміту Євроради та поспілкується особисто з кожним із 27 лідерів країн-членів Європейського Союзу.</seg>
          <seg id="23">За словами співрозмовника, Україна потребує передусім артилерійських систем дальнього радіусу та багато амуніції.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Російські війська почали великий наступ у Луганській області, вважають в американському Інституті вивчення війни ISW.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Темпи російських операцій уздовж лінії Сватове-Кремінна на заході регіону помітно зросли за останній тиждень, йдеться у звіті аналітиків за 8 лютого.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Там також зазначається, що геолокаційні кадри бойових дій підтвердили російські наступальні успіхи в районі Дворічного на північний захід від Сватового.</seg>
          <seg id="5">ЗСУ не дають РФ досягти значних успіхів</seg>
          <seg id="6">На думку експертів, залучення значних частин щонайменше трьох великих російських дивізій до наступальних операцій у цьому секторі вказує на те, що російський наступ розпочався, навіть якщо українські сили поки що не дають російським військам досягти значних успіхів.</seg>
          <seg id="7">В ISW припускають, що наступ РФ ще не набрав повного темпу, російське командування ще не ввело в дію частини 2-ї мотострілецької дивізії (1-а гвардійська танкова армія, Західний військовий округ), яка була перекинута в Луганську область в січні після розгортання в Білорусі.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Хоча російські сили в Луганській області зараз володіють ініціативою (в тому сенсі, що російські сили встановлюють умови бою, закінчуючи період української ініціативи з серпня 2022 року), повне залучення цих сил може призвести до їхньої остаточної кульмінації на лінії Сватове-Кремінна без досягнення цілей щодо захоплення всієї Луганської та Донецької областей", - йдеться у звіті.</seg>
          <seg id="9">За прогнозами аналітиків, ця кульмінація, ймовірно, може створити вікно можливостей для українських сил, яке вони зможуть використати для власного контрнаступу.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Водночас в ранковому зведенні Генштаб ЗСУ повідомив, що війська РФ, намагаючись взяти під повний контроль Донецьку та Луганську області України, і далі зосереджують основні зусилля на ведені наступальних дій на п"яти напрямках: Куп"янському, Лиманському, Бахмутському, Авдіївському та Новопавлівському в районах Кремінної, Бахмута, Авдіївки, Опитного, Мар"їнки і Вугледара.</seg>

          <seg id="12">Данілов: Можливий наступ на Харківщині і Запоріжжі</seg>
          <seg id="13">Напередодні секретар Ради національної безпеки та оборони Олексій Данілов припустив, що новий наступ Росії, який прогнозують у лютому, може відбутися не лише у Донецькій та Луганській областях, але і на інших напрямках.</seg>
          <seg id="14">"Спроби наступу як на харківському, так і на запорізькому напрямку, звичайно, будуть, - сказав він в інтерв'ю Reuters.</seg>

          <seg id="2">In the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), they think that Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the western part of the region has increased significantly over the past week, say analysts in a February 8 report.</seg>
          <seg id="4">In addition, the report noted that geolocation footage of the combat operations confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvorichne, northwest of Svatove.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The UAF prevents Russia from achieving significant success</seg>
          <seg id="6">In the opinion of experts, the involvement of significant units of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this area indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces have so far prevented Russian troops from achieving significant success.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The ISW assumes that the offensive of the Russian Federation has not yet gained full speed, as the Russian command has not yet put into operation units of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after being deployed in Belarus.</seg>
          <seg id="8">“Although Russian forces in Luhansk region currently have the initiative ( meaning that Russian forces are setting the terms of battle, ending the period of Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full engagement of these forces could lead to a final culmination at the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving their goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions,” the report says.</seg>
          <seg id="9">According to analysts, this culmination could likely create a window of opportunity for the Ukrainian forces, which could be used for their own counteroffensive.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, in a morning report, the General Staff of the UAF said that Russian troops, while trying to take full control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on offensive operations in five areas: Kupyansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka in the areas of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Maryinka and Vuhledar.</seg>

          <seg id="14">“Attempts to launch an offensive on both the Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia directions will certainly be made,” he said in an interview with Reuters.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Радник керівника Офісу президента України Михайло Подоляк у четвер, 9 лютого, закликав американську компанію SpaceX визначитися, чи підтримує вона Київ у війні, розв'язаній Росією.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Таким чином він відреагував на інформацію про те, що компанія Ілона Маска обмежила можливості українських військових управляти дронами за допомогою системи супутникового інтернету Starlink.</seg>
          <seg id="4">"Компанії мають для себе вирішити: або вони на стороні права на вільне життя і України - і тоді не вигадують, як нашкодити; або вони на стороні РФ та її "права" на вбивства, захоплення територій", - написав Подоляк у Twitter.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Starlink не має бути зброєю</seg>
          <seg id="7">Напередодні головна операційна директорка SpaceX Гвінн Шотуелл заявила, що Starlink, який українська армія активно використовує у протидії російській агресії, "ніколи не був призначений для використання у вигляді зброї".</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Однак українці використовують її непередбаченим чином, що не є частиною будь-якої угоди.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Ми знаємо, що військові використовують її для зв'язку, і це нормально.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Але ми ніколи не хотіли, щоб вони використовували її в наступальних цілях", - цитує директорку агенція Reuters.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Зокрема, коментуючи використання Starlink Збройними силами України для керування дронами, Шотуелл зауважила, що SpaceX може "обмежити їхню здатність робити це".</seg>
          <seg id="12">"Є те, що ми можемо зробити, і вже зробили", - додала вона.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Яких саме заходів вжила компанія, вона уточнити відмовилась.</seg>
          <seg id="14">SpaceX "торгувалася" з міноборони США за Starlink для України</seg>
          <seg id="15">Відразу після повномасштабного вторгнення Росії в Україну SpaceX передала Києву безкоштовно системи Starlink для забезпечення населення інтернетом.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Утім у вересні SpaceX повідомила міністерству оборони США (Пентагон), що більше не може продовжувати фінансування Starlink в Україні та попросила перебрати це питання на себе.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Тоді вона оцінювала необхідне фінансування до кінця 2022 року в 120 мільйонів доларів, а протягом наступних 12 місяців - приблизно в 400 мільйонів доларів.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Питання забезпечення фінансування обговорювалося на політичному рівні, як в Україні і США, так і в Європейському Союзі, однак невдовзі власник компанії Маск заявив, що SpaceX відкликала своє прохання до американського оборонного відомства перебрати на себе витрати.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Президент України Володимир Зеленський вважає, що відносини Берліна та Києва на тлі російської агресії розвиваються "хвилеподібно" - у них є "підйоми та спади".</seg>
          <seg id="3">Таку позицію він озвучив в інтерв'ю німецькому щотижневому журналу Der Spiegel, оприлюдненому в четвер, 9 лютого.</seg>
          <seg id="4">"За природою я - швидка людина.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Інші діють повільніше, що також може бути пов'язане з їхньою бюрократією", - зазначив Зеленський, додавши, що в умовах війни Україна не має тижнів і місяців, а від розвитку ситуації щомиті залежать життя людей.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Пожвавлення з ППО</seg>
          <seg id="7">Президент України зазначив, що на певному етапі "консервативне ставлення" Німеччини змінилося і він отримав підтримку канцлера Олафа Шольца (Olaf Scholz).</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Потім я, нарешті, отримав підтримку і від Штайнмаєра (президент ФРН Франк-Вальтер Штайнмаєр (Frank-Walter Steinmeier) - Ред.), з яким у мене раніше були складнощі, особливо - через так звану "формулу Штайнмаєра", - зазначив Зеленський.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Він наголосив, що була проведена "хороша робота", яка дозволила змінити стосунки.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"Ми отримали системи протиповітряної оборони (ППО) IRIS-T, за що я дуже вдячний Німеччині.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Вони врятували багато життів", - зазначив президент України.</seg>
          <seg id="12">За оцінками Зеленського, Берліну вдалося наростити темпи виробництва цих систем.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Раніше Німеччина пообіцяла передати Україні ще три комплекси IRIS-T у 2023 році.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Гальмування з танками</seg>
          <seg id="15">Однак дебати навколо постачання бойових танків Leopard Києву повернули відносини з Німеччиною "у складну фазу", зазначив президент України.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Він назвав дискусії з цього приводу "емоційними та складними".</seg>
          <seg id="17">"Мені доводиться змушувати його (Шольца - Ред.) допомагати Україні та постійно переконувати його, що ця допомога потрібна не нам, а європейцям", - пояснив Зеленський.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Категоричність щодо винищувачів</seg>
          <seg id="19">Після того як союзники, в тому числі Німеччина, згодилися постачати Києву бойові танки, почалися дискусії щодо передачі винищувачів, на чому наполягає Україна.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Тут Шольц зайняв категоричну позицію: Німеччина в жодному разі не передаватиме бойові літаки.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Водночас канцлер продовжує запевняти, що його країна підтримуватиме Київ "доти, доки це буде необхідно".</seg>
          <seg id="22">Відповідні заяви він робив і після зустрічі з Зеленським і президентом Франції Еммануелем Макроном 8 лютого, і перед самітом лідерів країн Європейського Союзу в четвер.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, believes that relations between Berlin and Kyiv are developing “in a wave-like manner” in the wake of Russian aggression, with “ups and downs.”</seg>
          <seg id="3">This position was voiced in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.</seg>
          <seg id="4">“I am a fast person by nature.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Others act more slowly, which may also be due to their bureaucracy,” Zelenskyy said, and added that in a time of war, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people’s lives depend on the development of the situation every moment.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Acceleration of the situation with air defense</seg>
          <seg id="7">The President of Ukraine pointed out that at a certain stage the “conservative attitude” of Germany changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.</seg>
          <seg id="8">“Then I finally also received support from Steinmeier (German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I previously had some difficulties, especially because of the so-called ‘Steinmeier formula’,” Zelenskyy said.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He emphasized that a “good job” had been done that allowed the relationship to change.</seg>
          <seg id="10">“We received IRIS-T air defense systems, and I am very grateful to Germany for that.</seg>
          <seg id="11">They saved many lives,” the President of Ukraine said.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In Zelenskyy’s opinion, Berlin has managed to increase the speed of production of these systems.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T systems to Ukraine in 2023.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Deceleration of the situation with tanks</seg>
          <seg id="15">However, the discussions over the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kyiv have brought relations with Germany “back to a difficult phase,” the President of Ukraine noted.</seg>
          <seg id="16">He called the discussions on the matter “emotional and difficult.”</seg>
          <seg id="17">“I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and keep convincing him that it is not us who need this help, but the Europeans,” Zelenskyy explained.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Being adamant about fighter jets</seg>
          <seg id="19">After the allies, including Germany, agreed to provide Kyiv with battle tanks, discussions began about supplying fighter aircraft, which Ukraine insists on.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Scholz was adamant about this: Under no circumstances will Germany provide combat aircraft.</seg>
          <seg id="21">However, at the same time, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv “as long as necessary.”</seg>
          <seg id="22">He made similar statements after his meeting with Zelenskyy and the President of France Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of EU leaders on Thursday.</seg>

          <seg id="3">Це рішення ухвалили після консультацій з президенткою країни Майєю Санду, повідомила Гаврилиця в п'ятницю, 10 лютого.</seg>
          <seg id="4">"Після півтора року роботи в уряді настав час оголосити про мою відставку.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Ми прийшли до влади в кризовому уряді та проводили політику розвитку, боротьби з корупцією та інтеграції в Європейський Союз", - заявила вона.</seg>
          <seg id="6">За її словами, за час роботи уряд "зіткнувся з енергетичним шантажем".</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Вони думали, що ми здамося і вчинимо, як попередні уряди, які зрадили національні інтереси, але це було не так. Ми працювали в режимі безперервної кризи", - наголосила Гаврилиця.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Причини рішення звільнитися вона не уточнила, посилаючись лише на відсутність "підтримки та довіри вдома".</seg>
          <seg id="9">Санду подякувала прем'єрці "за величезну жертву та зусилля", теж зазначивши, що Гаврилиця очолила уряд у період криз.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"Попри безпрецедентні виклики, країною керували відповідально, з великою увагою та самовідданою роботою.</seg>
          <seg id="11">У нас стабільність, мир і розвиток - там, де інші хотіли війни та банкрутства", - заявила президентка Молдови.</seg>

          <seg id="15">На заміну Гаврилиці Санду вже запропонувала свого радника з питань безпеки, нинішнього секретаря Ради безпеки Молдови і колишнього міністра внутрішніх справ країни Доріна Речана.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Його кандидатуру має затвердити парламент, у якому більшість має партія "Дія і солідарність".</seg>
          <seg id="17">Гаврилиця була її представницею, тож голосування за Речана не має бути проблемним питанням, зауважує агентство AFP.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Речан уже заявив, що планує продовжувати домагатися членства Молдови в Євроcоюзі.</seg>
          <seg id="19">За його словами, пріоритетами нового уряду будуть "порядок і дисципліна, подих нового життя в економіку, а також мир і стабільність", пише Reuters.</seg>

          <seg id="1">"Енергоатом" повідомив про нову загрозу для ЗАЕС - DW - 12.02.2023</seg>
          <seg id="2">Президент НАЕК "Енергоатом" Петро Котін назвав зниження росіянами води в Каховському водосховищі новою загрозою для Запорізької атомної електростанції (ЗАЕС).</seg>
          <seg id="3">"Дуже багато загроз на ЗАЕС.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Зниження води в Каховському водосховищі - це нова додалася загроза", - сказав Котін під час брифінгу на одній з АЕС у неділю, 12 лютого.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Він зазначив, що на вечір 11 лютого рівень водосховища становить 13,8 метра при нормальному рівні 16 метрів, "щоб станція отримувала підживлення для своїх генераторів, для конденсаторів турбін і для систем безпеки".</seg>
          <seg id="6">"В останні дні ми бачимо, що рівень стабілізувався і трохи підвищується, тому що доходило до 13,7 м, 13,6 м", - цитує Котіна "Інтерфакс-Україна".</seg>
          <seg id="7">Він пояснив, що росіяни, які контролюють шлюзи на Каховській ГЕС, почали менше скидати воду, водночас збільшився приплив вгорі Дніпра.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Президент "Енергоатому" уточнив, що за таких умов ставок-охолоджувач на ЗАЕС достатньо наповнений і поки що води вистачає, але в разі зниження рівня водосховища до критичної точки, це, за його словами, "буде велика проблема для ЗАЕС".</seg>
          <seg id="9">Котін наголосив, що критичним буде рівень 12 метрів, аварійним - 12,8 метра, і висловив сподівання, що міжнародне співтовариство за сприяння Міжнародного агентства з атомної енергії не допустить критичної ситуації.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Читайте також: Чи здатні мініелектростанції захистити енергосистему від наслідків російських атак</seg>
          <seg id="11">Як нагадує "Інтерфакс-Україна", Держатомрегулювання розпорядженням від 10 лютого 2023 року заборонила експлуатацію енергоблоків №3, 4, 5, 6 Запорізької АЕС на енергетичних рівнях потужності внаслідок неможливості усунення виявлених порушень вимог ядерної та радіаційної безпеки.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Читайте також: Звіт МАГАТЕ: що представники місії побачили на ЗАЕС</seg>
          <seg id="13">Під час повномасштабного вторгнення Росії в Україну 4 березня 2022 року ЗАЕС захопили російські війська.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Відтоді сстанцію продовжує обслуговувати український персонал під контролем РФ.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Поблизу станції також фіксуються обстріли територій, внаслідок чого пошкоджень зазнають будівлі ЗАЕС.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Російська та українська сторони обвинувачують у цьому одна одну, незалежних даних про те, хто обстрілює ЗАЕС, немає.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Petro Kotin, the President of NNEGC Energoatom, has called the draining of water in the Kakhovka reservoir by the Russians a new threat to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).</seg>
          <seg id="3">“There are many threats at ZNPP.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The decrease in water in the Kakhovka Reservoir is an additional threat,” Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.</seg>
          <seg id="5">He pointed out that as of the evening of February 11, the level of the reservoir was 13.8 meters, while the normal one is 16 meters, “to ensure that the plant receives power for its generators, turbine capacitors and security systems.”</seg>
          <seg id="6">“In recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and is growing a little bit, because it reached 13.7 meters, 13.6 meters,” Interfax-Ukraine quoted Kotin as saying.</seg>
          <seg id="7">He explained that the Russians, who control the gateways at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, began to reduce the amount of water released, while the inflow in the upper part of the Dnipro increased.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The president of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pool at ZNPP is filled enough and there is currently sufficient amount of water, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, according to him, “it would be a big problem for ZNPP.”</seg>
          <seg id="9">Kotin emphasized that the critical level would be 12 meters, while the emergency level would be 12.8 meters, and expressed his hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, would prevent a critical situation.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The president of NAEK "Energoatom" Petro Kotin called the reduction of water by the Russians in the Kakhov reservoir a new threat to the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).</seg>
          <seg id="3">"There are many threats to the nuclear power plant.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Water depletion in the Kakhov reservoir is a new added threat", Kotin said during a briefing at a nuclear power plant on Sunday, February 12.</seg>
          <seg id="5">He noted that on the evening of February 11, the water level of the reservoir was at 13.8 meters at a normal level of 16 meters "so that the plant could receive power for its generators, for the turbine capacitors and for the safety systems".</seg>
          <seg id="6">"In recent days we see that the level has stabilized and slightly rises, as it reached 13.7 meters, 13.6 meters", quotes Kotin "Interfax-Ukraine".</seg>
          <seg id="7">He explained that the Russians who control the locks at the Kahovska HPP were starting to dump less water, while the floods at the top of the Dnieper increased.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The president of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions the cooling plant at the nuclear power plant is sufficiently filled and there is still enough water, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, this, he said, "will be a big problem for the nuclear power plant".</seg>
          <seg id="9">Mr. Cotine noted that the critical level would be 40 feet [12 m], the emergency level 40 feet [12.8 m], and expressed hope that the international community, with the help of the International Atomic Energy Agency, would prevent a critical situation.</seg>

          <seg id="3">У цей же день глави МЗС двох держав Нікос Дендіас та Мевлют Чавушоглу провели несподівану зустріч, на якій, як зафіксували камери грецького телебачення, навіть обійнялися.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Греція одна з перших допомогла Анкарі</seg>
          <seg id="5">Чавушоглу подякував Дендіасу за те, що Греція стала однією з перших країн, яка надала негайну допомогу Туреччині після стихійного лиха.</seg>

          <seg id="7">"Допомога Греції турецькому народу на цьому не закінчується", - наголосив глава грецького МЗС.</seg>
          <seg id="8">За його словами, Афіни "зроблять все" - на двосторонньому рівні, а також в рамках ЄС - щоб допомогти Туреччині.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Дендіас став першим міністром закордонних справ ЄС, який відвідав зону стихійного лиха.</seg>

          <seg id="18">Греція ніби порушує міжнародні договори, зберігаючи там військову присутність.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Афіни виправдовують розташування військ на островах загрозою численних десантних суден на турецькому західному узбережжі та правом кожної держави на самооборону.</seg>

          <seg id="2">У Брюсселі розпочалося дводенне засідання міністрів оборони країн НАТО, в рамках якого у віторок, 14 лютого, проводиться також зустріч у так званому форматі "Рамштайн".</seg>
          <seg id="3">На порядку денному заходу - подальше нарощування підтримки України у війні та збільшення темпів виробництва боєприпасів.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Генеральний секретар НАТО Єнс Столтенберг заявив пред засіданням, що НАТО має забезпечити Україну зброєю, необхідною їй "для перемоги у цій війні".</seg>
          <seg id="5">"Ми не бачимо жодних ознак того, що президент Путін готується до миру, ми бачимо протилежне, він готується до нової війни, нових наступальних дій і нових атак", - цитує його Reuters.</seg>
          <seg id="6">"Це війна на виснаження, а отже, битва за логістику", - додав Столтенберг, маючи на увазі потребу України в більшій кількості зброї та перемовини про можливе надання Україні бойових літаків.</seg>

          <seg id="9">"Союзники обговорять інвестування в оборону, а також як захищати нашу критичну інфраструктуру", - цитує Столтенберга "Інтерфакс-Україна".</seg>
          <seg id="10">Чого чекати від дев'ятого "Рамштайну"</seg>
          <seg id="11">Цього самого дня у штаб-квартирі НАТО в Брюсселі засідає очолювана США Контактна групи для обговорення термінових потреб для України, участь у якому бере міністр оборони України Олексій Резніков.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Також глава українського оборонного відомства долучиться до спеціальній сесії засідання міністрів оборони НАТО.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"Понад 50 країн-учасниць Контактної групи єдині з вами в цій боротьбі за суверенітет і самооборону України", - написав очільник Пентагону Ллойд Остін в Twitter, розміщуючи відео зустрічі з українським колегою.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Українське військово-політичне керівництво раніше висловлювало сподівання, що на черговому засіданні "Рамштайн" партнери могли б ухвалити рішення про надання бойових літаків західного зразка та далекобійних ракет.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Київ також очікує, що за результатами цієї зустрічі союзники оголосять точну кількість і терміни надання танків Україні.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The two-day meeting of defense ministers of NATO countries has begun in Brussels, where a meeting in the so-called Ramstein format is also being held on Tuesday, February 14.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The agenda of the event focuses on further increasing support for Ukraine in the war and increasing the speed of ammunition production.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Before the meeting, Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary General the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said that NATO should provide Ukraine with the weapons it requires “to win this war.”</seg>
          <seg id="5">“We do not see any signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensives and new attacks,” Reuters quoted him as saying.</seg>
          <seg id="6">“This is a war of exhaustion, and therefore a battle for logistics,” Stoltenberg added, referring to the need of Ukraine for more weapons and negotiations about the possible provision of fighter aircraft to Ukraine.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Україна хоче заборони на гастролі російських артистів у ЄС - DW - 14.02.2023</seg>
          <seg id="2">Україна збирає дані про російських діячів культури, які активно пропагують політику російського президента Володимира Путіна, підтримують війну Росії проти України або працюють в установах і організаціях, які фінансуються з держбюджету РФ, аби включити їх у новий пакет санкцій ЄС.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Про це в інтерв'ю DW повідомила заступниця міністра культури та інформаційної політики України Галина Григоренко.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Культура, як зброя Росії</seg>
          <seg id="5">Як наголосила Григоренко, Росія використовує культуру для просування своєї мілітаристської агресивної політики та виправдання війни, яку вона веде в Україні.</seg>
          <seg id="6">"Культура є стратегічною зброєю Росії.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Наприклад, в одному зі своїх інтерв"ю директор російського музею Ермітаж дуже чітко говорить, що виставкові проєкти музею за кордоном - це їхня спеціальна операція", - каже Григоренко.</seg>
          <seg id="8">На її думку, нині діалог через культуру з Росією неможливий.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Тому часто українські митці відмовляються виступати на одній сцені у європейських країнах з російськими артистами, поетами, музикантами, пояснила заступниця міністра культури України.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Так, нещодавно хор Національної опери України та оркестр Національної філармонії України відмовилися виступати на одній сцені з російською оперною співачкою Анною Нетребко, яка в 2012 році була зареєстрована як довірена особа Володимира Путіна у його передвиборчій кампанії, а у 2014 році підтримувала дії проросійських бойовиків так званих "ДНР" на Донбасі.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Читайте також: Українські митці відмовляються виступати на одній сцені з Анною Нетребко</seg>
          <seg id="12">Санкції ЄС офіційно позбавлять можливості російських артистів гастролювати</seg>
          <seg id="13">Однак, на переконання Григоренко, цього замало і тим представникам культури РФ, які підтримують політику Путіна, все одно вдається гастролювати в Європі.</seg>
          <seg id="14">"Аби скасувати офіційно такі тури, потрібно мати прізвища в європейських санкційних списках", - каже Григоренко і додає: "Ми працюємо над тим, щоб діячі культури РФ, які пропагують російські наративи поза межами Росії, стали частиною наступного санкційного пакету.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Це дасть можливість на території ЄС офіційно забороняти їхню економічну діяльність, зокрема проведення концертів".</seg>
          <seg id="16">За словами Григоренко, цим питанням в Україні займається міністерство економіки, Національне агентство запобігання корупції, міністерство культури та інформаційної політики та спеціальна робоча група при Офісі президента України.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Як повідомлялося раніше, президентка Єврокомісії Урсула фон дер Ляєн на спільній пресконференції з президентом України Володимиром Зеленським у Брюсселі 9 лютого зазначила, що він на саміті у Києві попросив її ввести санкції проти російських пропагандистів.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Вона пообіцяла, що багато пропагандистів будуть включені у санкційний список десятого пакету.</seg>
          <seg id="19">В Україні є свій санкційний список діячів культури та медіасфери РФ, в якому міститься більше 300 прізвищ.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Ukraine is gathering information about Russian artists who actively promote the policy of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support the Russia’s war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations that are funded by the Russian state budget in order to include them in the new EU sanctions package.</seg>
          <seg id="3">This was reported by Halyna Hryhorenko, Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, in an interview with DW.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Culture as a weapon of Russia</seg>
          <seg id="5">As Hryhorenko emphasized, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and to justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="6">“Culture is a strategic weapon of Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="7">For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum clearly states that the museum’s exhibition projects abroad are their own special operation,” Hryhorenko said.</seg>
          <seg id="8">In her opinion, a dialogue through culture with Russia is currently impossible.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform in European countries on the same stage as Russian artists, poets, and musicians, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine explained.</seg>
          <seg id="10">For example, the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine recently refused to perform on the same stage with Anna Netrebko, a Russian opera singer who was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign in 2012 and supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called “DPR” in Donbas in 2014.</seg>

          <seg id="12">EU sanctions will officially deny Russian artists the opportunity to tour</seg>
          <seg id="13">However, in Hryhorenko’s opinion, this is not enough, as those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin’s policy still manage to go on tours in Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="14">“In order to cancel such tours officially, it is necessary to have names in the European sanctions lists,” says Hryhorenko and adds: “We are working on ensuring that Russian artists who promote Russian narratives outside of Russia become part of the next sanctions package.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This will provide an opportunity to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts, in the EU.”</seg>
          <seg id="16">According to Hryhorenko, in Ukraine, this matter is being dealt with by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, and a special working group under the Office of the President of Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="17">As was reported earlier, on February 9, Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, at a joint press conference with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, said that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at the summit in Kyiv.</seg>
          <seg id="18">She promised that a lot of propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Ukraine has its own sanctions list of cultural and media workers from the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 names.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Генсек НАТО закликав США бути готовими до довгої війни РФ в Україні</seg>
          <seg id="2">Можливість відправлення Україні винищувачів для захисту у війні проти РФ - не зняте з порядку денного, заявив прем'єр-міністр Великої Британії Ріші Сунак під час прес-конференції із президентом України Володимиром Зеленським.</seg>
          <seg id="3">"Першим кроком у забезпеченні передових літаків є наявність солдатів або авіаторів, які здатні їх використовувати.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Це процес, який потребує деякого часу.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Ми розпочали цей процес сьогодні, - сказав Сунак про оголошену раніше програму навчання українських пілотів у Британії.</seg>
          <seg id="6">- Нічого не зняте з порядку денного, і наше лідерство в цьому питанні є тим, чим ми всі разом маємо пишатися".</seg>
          <seg id="7">Сунак також оголосив, що обіцяні раніше танки Challenger 2 прибудуть в Україну вже "наступного місяця" і заявив, що Україна "ніколи більше не повинна залишитися вразливою для нападу", а також закликав "озброїти Україну в короткостроковій перспективі, але зміцнити Україну в довгостроковій перспективі".</seg>
          <seg id="8">За його словами, Велика Британія погодилася розширити свою програму навчання, за якою за останні шість місяців було підготовлено 10 тисяч військовослужбовців, й пообіцяв, як пише CNN, "прискорити доставку нашого обладнання", щоб забезпечити досягнення України на лінії фронту в найближчі "дні і тижні, а не роки".</seg>
          <seg id="9">Президент Зеленський під час прес-конференції висловив вдячність за підтримку України: "Сьогодні зрозуміло, що ми маємо підтримку Великої Британії.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Дякую всьому народу Великої Британії, дякую за ці 350 днів єдності".</seg>
          <seg id="11">Також, говорячи про програму навчань для українських пілотів, він вкотре повторив заклик про надання Україні західних винищувачів і додав, що "чув від пана прем'єр-міністра про бажання надати винищувачі" Києву.</seg>
          <seg id="12">У російському посольстві в Лондоні вже заявили, що рішення Британії про надання Україні винищувачів матиме "військово-політичні наслідки" для всього світу.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Нині міністр закордонних справ Дмитро Кулеба заявив у Twitter, що Київ продовжує говорити із західними партнерами про можливість надання бойових літаків: "Я говорив з міністром закордонних справ Нідерландів Вопке Гукстра, щоб скоординувати наші міжнародні кроки, оскільки повномасштабне вторгнення Росії наближається до річної позначки.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Я подякував за останнє рішення щодо танків.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Я також піднімав питання про F-16.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Ми продовжуємо наш діалог з Нідерландами та іншими щодо бойової авіації".</seg>
          <seg id="17">Речник Повітряних сил ЗСУ Юрій Ігнат в коментарі для CNN заявив, що Україні знадобляться десятки західних бойових літаків, щоб перемогти у війні проти Росії.</seg>
          <seg id="18">При цьому оглядачі кажуть, що Захід має невеликий проміжок часу, щоб допомогти Україні новою воєнною технікою до початку очікуваного нового наступу Росії навесні чи навіть у лютому.</seg>
          <seg id="19">За деякими оцінками Кремль уже намагається відновити великий наступ в Україні від початку січня.</seg>

          <seg id="2">The possibility of sending fighters to Ukraine to defend itself in the war against the Russian Federation is not off the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak claimed during the press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi.</seg>
          <seg id="3">“The first step in providing advanced aircraft is to have soldiers or aviators who can use them.</seg>
          <seg id="4">It’s a process that takes some time.</seg>
          <seg id="5">We started this process today,” Sunak said about the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.</seg>
          <seg id="6">“Nothing is removed from the agenda, and our leadership on this issue is something we should all be proud of.”</seg>
          <seg id="7">Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks will arrive in Ukraine as early as “next month” and said that Ukraine “should never again be left vulnerable to attack,” and also called for “arming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term.”</seg>
          <seg id="8">According to his words, the UK agreed to expand its training program, according to which 10 thousand troops were trained over the past six months, and promised, according to CNN, to “accelerate the delivery of our equipment” to ensure Ukraine’s achievements on the front line in the coming “days and weeks, not years.”</seg>
          <seg id="9">During the press conference, President Zelenskyi expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: “Today it is obvious that we have the support of the UK.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity.”</seg>

          <seg id="13">These days Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba claimed on Twitter that Kyiv continues to talk with Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: “I talked to Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra to coordinate our international steps as Russia’s full-scale invasion approaches the annual mark.</seg>
          <seg id="14">I thanked for the last decision on tanks.</seg>
          <seg id="15">I also raised the question of the F-16.</seg>
          <seg id="16">We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation.”</seg>
          <seg id="17">A spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Forces, Yurii Ignat, said in a commentary for CNN that Ukraine would need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="18">At the same time, observers say that the West has a short period of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the start of the expected new Russian offensive in the spring or even in February.</seg>

          <seg id="1">На заваді вакцинації стоять "політика та прибутки"</seg>
          <seg id="2">Генеральний директор Всесвітньої організації охорони здоров"я заявив у неділю, що якщо країни не використовуватимуть ефективно існуючі інструменти для боротьби з пандемією, з нею не вдасться покінчити.</seg>
          <seg id="3">"Пандемія закінчиться, коли світ вирішить покінчити з нею", - сказав Тедрос Адан Гебреєсус, виступаючи на Всесвітньому саміті охорони здоров'я, глобальному форумі, що вдібувся у Німеччині.</seg>
          <seg id="4">"У нас є всі необхідні інструменти - ефективні засоби охорони здоров'я та ефективні медичні інструменти.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Але світ погано використав ці інструменти", - сказав Тедрос, звертаючись до учасників зі 100 країн світу.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Перешкодами на шляху до досягнення мети ВООЗ щодо вакцинації 40% населення кожної країни від коронавірусу є "політика та прибутки", сказав керівник ВООЗ, "а не виробництво".</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Країни, які вже досягли мети 40%, включно з усіма країнами G-20, повинні поступитися своїм місцем у черзі доставки вакцин на користь COVAX та африканського фонду придбання вакцин", - сказав Тедрос.</seg>
          <seg id="8">COVAX - це міжнародна ініціатива співпраці, створена для справедливого розподілу вакцини проти COVID.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Гебреєсус також наголосив, що жодна країна не може покінчити із пандемією COVID-19 окремо від решти світу.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"І жодна країна не може захистити здоров'я її власного народу, без співпраці для захисту інших народів.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Разом!" - відзначив Гебреєсус у соціальній мережі Twitter.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Офіційний представник ВООЗ також закликав виробників вакцин "зробити пріоритетом та виконувати свої контракти з COVAX та AVAT [африканським фондом придбання вакцин]" та стати "набагато прозорішим щодо того, що куди спрямовується".</seg>
          <seg id="13">AVAT-це ініціатива Африканського Союзу, спрямована на забезпечення доступу до вакцин проти COVID-19 по всій Африці.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Посадовець закликав виробників вакцин "обмінюватися ноу-хау, технологіями та ліцензіями та відмовитися від прав інтелектуальної власності".</seg>
          <seg id="15">Раніше Каррен Аттіа, дописувачка видання The Washington Post закликала адміністрацію США поділитись зі світом "рецептом" вакцини Moderna.</seg>
          <seg id="16">"Адміністрація США розтрубила про вакцини, які вона пожертвувала у світі.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Але, коли багата країна вдається до пожертв у вигляді вакцин замість поширення знань це не добросердечна філантропія; це зверхність.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Бідніші країни не просили благодійності у формі вакцин; вони від початку просили про справедливу нагоду", - відзначила оглядачка.</seg>
          <seg id="19">"Ми не просимо про благодійність, - сказав Тедрос, - ми закликаємо до розумних інвестицій у глобальне відновлення".</seg>
          <seg id="20">Як повідомляв "Голос Америки", раніше цього року адміністрація Байдена закликала відмовитись від патентного захисту на вакцини проти COVID-19.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Така відмова має, за задумом адміністрації США, дозволити біднішим країнам виробляти препарати-аналоги запатентованих вакцин.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Проти виступили фармацевтичні кампанії, ЄС, та ін.</seg>
          <seg id="23">У серпні фармацевтичні компанії Moderna і Pfizer оголосили про підвищення цін на свої вакцини проти коронавірусу.</seg>

          <seg id="1">“Politics and profits” stand in the way of vaccination</seg>
          <seg id="2">The Director General of the World Health Organization claimed on Sunday that if countries do not effectively use existing tools to fight the pandemic, it cannot be ended.</seg>
          <seg id="3">“The pandemic will end when the world decides to put an end to it,” said Tedros Adan Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum hosted by Germany.</seg>
          <seg id="4">“We have all the necessary tools—effective health care tools and effective medical equipment.</seg>
          <seg id="5">But the world has used these tools poorly,” Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Obstacles on the way to achieve the WHO’s goal of vaccinating 40% of each country’s population against the coronavirus are “politics and profits,” the WHO chief said, “not the production.”</seg>
          <seg id="7">“Countries that have already achieve the goal of 40%, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue in favor of COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust,” Tedros said.</seg>
          <seg id="8">COVAX is an international cooperation initiative created to equitably distribute the COVID vaccine.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Ghebreyesus also underlined that no country can put an end to COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.</seg>
          <seg id="10">“And no country can protect the health of its own nation without cooperation to protect other nations.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Together!”, noted Ghebreyesus in the social network Twitter.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The WHO official representative also called on vaccine manufacturers to “make priority and execute their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust]” and become “much more transparent about wherever everything is directed.”</seg>
          <seg id="13">AVAT is an African Union initiative aimed at providing access to COVID-19 vaccines throughout Africa.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The official called on vaccine manufacturers to “share know-how, technology and licenses and waive the intellectual property rights.”</seg>
          <seg id="15">Earlier, Karren Attia, a correspondent for The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share the “recipe” of the Moderna vaccine with the world.</seg>
          <seg id="16">“The US administration has proclaimed about the vaccines it has donated to the world.</seg>
          <seg id="17">But when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, this is not kind-hearted philanthropy; it’s haughtiness.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they initially asked for a fair chance,” said the observer.</seg>
          <seg id="19">“We’re not asking for charity,” Tedros said, “we’re calling for reasonable investments into global recovery.”</seg>
          <seg id="20">As Voice of America reported, earlier this year the Biden administration called for waiving patent protections on COVID-19 vaccines.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Such a refusal should, according to the US administration, allow poorer countries to produce analogous drugs to patented vaccines.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, and others stood against this.</seg>
          <seg id="23">In August, Moderna and Pfizer pharmaceutical companies announced about the increase of the prices of their coronavirus vaccines.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center reported on Monday that it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Армія Росії протягом двох тижнів, ймовірно, зазнала найбільших втрат від початку війни - британська розвідка</seg>
          <seg id="2">Президент Польщі Анджей Дуда заявив, що рішення про відправку літаків F-16 для України буде "дуже серйозним рішенням", яке "нелегко прийняти".</seg>
          <seg id="3">Про це один з найближчих союзників України заявив в інтерв"ю телекомпанії CNN на тлі обговорень нових поставок зброї України.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Як повідомляє кореспондентка CNN Лора Кюнсберг, у Варшаві в ексклюзивному інтерв"ю, яке вийде в ефір у неділю, президент Дуда сказав, що надсилання літаків F-16 створить "серйозну проблему" для Польщі, тому що, у польських військово-повітряних сил є менше 50 літаків, і самим полякам "їх недостатньо... і нам знадобиться набагато більше".</seg>
          <seg id="5">Також Дуда наголосив, що бойові літаки, як і F-16, мають "дуже серйозну потребу в обслуговуванні", тому "недостатньо просто відправити кілька літаків".</seg>
          <seg id="6">Ці зауваження президента Дуди пролунали на тлі обговорень нових поставок зброї України, включно зі західними танками та протиракетними установками більшої давності.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Польща є одним з найближчих союзників України, і Варшава наполегливо переконувала своїх союзників по НАТО, щоб вони надіслали до Києва установки Patriot та танки західного виробництва, такі як німецьки танки Leopard.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Президент України Володимир Зеленський цього тижня здійснив неоголошене європейське турне, під час якого він закликав західних партнерів України надати їй засоби боротьби з Росією в повітрі.</seg>
          <seg id="9">У Лондоні президент Зеленський назвав бойову авіацію "крилами свободи" Україні.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Це ж послання Зеленський повторив у Парижі та Брюсселі.</seg>
          <seg id="11">У своїй промові до членів Європейського парламенту Зеленський сказав, що "дуже вдячний" за надану допомогу, і сподівається, що наступні переговори про надання Україні авіації, також будуть успішними.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"Я чув від деяких європейських лідерів про готовність надати нам необхідну зброю, включно з авіацією.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Зараз у мене є низка двосторонніх переговорів, ми будемо піднімати питання винищувачів та іншої авіації.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Тому ми продовжуємо нашу роботу тут, у Брюсселі", - сказав Зеленський.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Як повідомляв "Голос Америки", минулого тижня прем"єр-міністр Польщі Матеуш Моравецький заявив, що його країна готова передати Україні свої винищувачі F-16 у "повній координації" з країнами НАТО.</seg>
          <seg id="16">А минулого місяця міністр закордонних справ Нідерландів Вопке Гукстра сказав, що його уряд розглянув би запит Києва на F-16.</seg>
          <seg id="17">На початку місяця президент США Джо Байден заперечив постачання літаків F-16 зі США, але західні експерти вважають, що ці літаки можуть надійти до України від європейських країн.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Зокрема, оглядачі вказують на те, що вже раніше зброя, яку відмовлялися постачати США, зрештою потрапляла в Україну, якщо її погоджувалися передати європейські союзники по НАТО.</seg>

          <seg id="15">As VOA reported earlier, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said last week that his country was ready to hand over its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.</seg>

          <seg id="2">КИШИНІВ, Молдова (АП).</seg>
          <seg id="3">У понеділок президентка Молдови заявила про змову Москви використати зовнішніх диверсантів для повалення уряду країни, переведення країни "у розпорядження Росії" та зриву її прагнень вступити до Європейського Союзу.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Брифінг президентки Маї Санду відбувся через тиждень після того, як президент України Володимир Зеленський заявив, що його країна перехопила плани російських спецслужб знищити Молдову, що пізніше підтвердили представники молдовської розвідки.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"План на наступний період передбачає залучення диверсантів з військовою підготовкою, закамуфльованих у цивільний одяг, які вдаватимуться до силових дій, атакуватимуть деякі державні будівлі та навіть захоплять заручників", - сказала Санду журналістам на брифінгу.</seg>
          <seg id="6">"Мета цих дій - повалити конституційний лад, змінити легітимну владу Кишинева на нелегітимну, - сказала Санду, - що перевело б нашу країну в розпорядження Росії і зупинило процес євроінтеграції".</seg>
          <seg id="7">Вона пообіцяла: "Спроби Кремля принести насильство в нашу країну не матимуть успіху".</seg>
          <seg id="8">Російські офіційні особи не відреагували на заяви Санду.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Відколи Росія вторглася в Україну, Молдова, колишня радянська республіка з населенням близько 2,6 мільйона людей, намагалася налагодити тісніші стосунки зі своїми західними партнерами.</seg>
          <seg id="10">У червні минулого року вона отримала статус кандидата в Європейський Союз, того ж дня, що й Україна.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Санду сказала, що в період з жовтня по грудень молдовська поліція та Служба розвідки та безпеки (SIS) втрутилися в "кілька випадків організації злочинних елементів і припинили спроби насильства".</seg>
          <seg id="12">За останній рік Молдова, яка не є членом НАТО, зіткнулася з низкою проблем.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Серед них серйозна енергетична криза після того, як Москва різко скоротила постачання газу; стрімка інфляція; а також кілька інцидентів за останні місяці, пов"язані з ракетами, які перетнули повітряний простір, і уламками, які були знайдені на його території.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Влада Молдови підтвердила, що ще одна ракета часів війни в Україні увійшла в її повітряний простір у п'ятницю.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Санду заявила, що Росія хоче використати Молдову у війні проти України і що інформація, отримана спецслужбами, містила те, що вона назвала інструкціями щодо правил в'їзду до Молдови для громадян Росії, Білорусі, Сербії, і Чорногорія.</seg>
          <seg id="16">"Я запевняю вас, що державні установи працюють над тим, щоб запобігти цим викликам і тримати ситуацію під контролем", - сказала Санду.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Вона сказала, що парламент Молдови повинен ухвалити законопроекти, щоб забезпечити Службу розвідки та безпеки, а також прокуратуру "необхідними інструментами для більш ефективної боротьби з ризиками для безпеки країни".</seg>
          <seg id="18">Президент додав, що план буде "покладатися на кілька внутрішніх сил, але особливо на злочинні групи", і продовжив імена двох молдовських олігархів, Ілана Шора та Володимира Плахотнюка, обидва з яких зараз перебувають у вигнанні.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Минулого року проти обох чоловіків ввели санкції США та Велика Британія.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Минулої осені серія масових антиурядових протестів, організованих популістською, дружньою до Росії партією Шора, також сколихнула Молдову в умовах енергетичної кризи.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Прес-брифінг президента в понеділок відбувся після того, як у п'ятницю подала у відставку прем'єр-міністерка Молдови Наталія Гавриліта.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Того ж дня Санду призначила свого радника з оборони та безпеки, прозахідного економіста Доріна Речана, наступником Гавриліти.</seg>
          <seg id="23">У п'ятницю, після того, як влада Молдови підтвердила ракетний інцидент, заступник речника Державного департаменту США Ведант Патель заявив журналістам у Вашингтоні, що "Росія роками підтримувала кампанії впливу та дестабілізації в Молдові, які часто передбачають використання корупції у вигляді зброї для досягнення своїх цілей".</seg>

          <seg id="4">The President Maia Sandu’s briefing had been held a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that his country had intercepted plans by Russian intelligence services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.</seg>
          <seg id="5">“The plan for the next period is designed to involve the spies with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will use force, attack some state buildings and even take hostages,” Sandu told reporters at the briefing.</seg>

          <seg id="16">“I assure you that government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control,” Sandu said.</seg>
          <seg id="17">She said Moldova’s parliament should adopt draft laws to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the prosecutor’s office, with “necessary tools to more effectively combat the country’s security risks.”</seg>
          <seg id="18">The President added that the plan would “rely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups,” and suggest names of two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Volodymyr Plakhotniuk, both of whom are now in exile.</seg>

          <seg id="3">On Monday, Moldova's president said Moscow is conspiring to use foreign saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country "at Russia's disposal", and derail its aspirations to join the European Union.</seg>
          <seg id="4">President Maja Sandu's briefing came a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had intercepted plans by Russian secret services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"The plan for the next period is to involve military trained saboteurs, camouflaged as civilians, who would resort to force, attack some government buildings and even take hostages", Sandu told reporters at a briefing.</seg>
          <seg id="6">"The aim of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change Kishinev's legitimate government to an illegitimate one", Sandu said, "which would put our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration".</seg>
          <seg id="7">She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence into our country will not succeed".</seg>
          <seg id="8">Russian officials have not responded to Sandu's statements.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of some 2.6 million people, has sought closer ties with its Western partners.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In June last year, it received candidate status to the European Union on the same day as Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Sandu said that between October and December the Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several instances of organizing criminal elements and stopped attempts of violence".</seg>
          <seg id="12">Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a NATO member, has faced a number of challenges.</seg>
          <seg id="13">These include a serious energy crisis after Moscow dramatically cut off gas supply; rapid inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed its airspace and debris that was found on its territory.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Sandu stated that Russia wanted to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the intelligence obtained contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry into Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.</seg>
          <seg id="16">"I assure you that the government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control", Sandu said.</seg>
          <seg id="17">She said the Moldovan parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the Prosecutor's Office, with "the necessary tools to more effectively address risks to the country's security".</seg>
          <seg id="18">The president added that the plan would "rely on a few internal forces, but especially criminal groups", and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilana Shora and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Both men were sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. last year.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shora party also shook Moldova amid the energy crisis.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The president's press briefing on Monday followed the resignation of Moldova's Prime Minister Natalia Gavrillit on Friday.</seg>
          <seg id="22">On the same day, Sandu appointed her defence and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorine Rechan, as Gavrillit's successor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has for years supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova that often involve the use of corruption as a weapon to achieve their goals".</seg>

          <seg id="17">She said Moldova's parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service as well as the prosecutor's office "with the necessary tools to more effectively deal with risks to the country's security."</seg>
          <seg id="18">The president added that the plan would "rely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups, " and continued the names of two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Volodymyr Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Last year, both men were sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by Shor's populist, Russia-friendly party also rocked Moldova amid the energy crisis.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The president's press briefing on Monday came after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.</seg>
          <seg id="22">On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Rechan, to succeed Gavrilita.</seg>
          <seg id="23">On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, US State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova for years, which often involve the use of corruption as a weapon to achieve its goals."</seg>

          <seg id="2">І оправу треба купити, якісну... подивилася деякі сайти з оправами, то була приємно вражена - тут дешевше аніж в Україні.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Я замовляла окуляри 2 роки назад, заплатила за них близько 300 доларів, оправа була середнього рівня (або навіть нижче).</seg>
          <seg id="4">Я не знаю які оправи у магазинах, але ціни в онлайн магазинах досить нормальні.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Але, що стосується деякої косметики, то можу точно сказати, що тут дорожче.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Щей набагато.</seg>
          <seg id="7">У нас мультифокальні лінзи в окуляри дуже дорого коштують (це якщо порівнювати із нашими середніми заробітними платами).</seg>
          <seg id="8">Враховуючи бюджет нашої сім'ї (особливо той факт, що треба наймати житло), то 300 доларів за окуляри, то досить висока сума.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Вам лікарі не пропонували штучний мультифокальний кристалик?</seg>
          <seg id="10">Я 10 років користувалася м'якими контактними лінзами, потім почалася непереносимість лінз, ще рік після того я носила жорсткі лінзи, почалася сильна алергія майже на всі косметичні засоби.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Вже 4 роки ношу постійно окуляри, лінзи одягаю дуже рідко.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Так, я теж читала, що ковід впливає на зір.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Також після 40 років є потреба в окулярах для читання.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Моїй мамі пропонували мультифокальні окуляри, ціна була більше 1000 доларів,то дуже дуже дорого.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Так, окуляри зараз модні.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Я питала в одного лікаря чому він не носить лінзи чи не зробить собі лазерну корекцію, так він відповів, що окуляри - це стильно)</seg>
          <seg id="17">Для пенсіонера з пенсією 1500 грн - це сума нереальна</seg>

          <seg id="9">Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.</seg>
          <seg id="10">“Traces of the operation were found on eight social networks, including Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok,” the statement said.</seg>

          <seg id="1">За останні сто років Росія провела 31 військову кампанію.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Найдовший мирний період у неї тривав 12 років: між нападом на Угорщину 1956-го та нападом на Чехословаччину 1968-го.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Росія межує з 14 країнами.</seg>
          <seg id="4">На 10 з них вона нападала.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Більшість сучасної території Росії свого часу займали кочові племена, які відчутно вплинули на формування культурного підґрунтя росіян.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Культ загарбництва й набігів мав успіх протягом усієї історії Росії: у Російській імперії, Радянському союзі, а потім – 20 років путінського режиму.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ці культурні особливості сформували державні інституції, які культивують політику ненависті та імперіалізму.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Більшість росіян схвалюють загарбницькі війну, оскільки вірять: їхня країна – найвеличніша й має право нападати на інші держави.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Росіяни поки не відчули повною мірою наслідків економічних санкцій.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Рівень життя в них не погіршився настільки, щоби спровокувати масові протестні рухи всередині РФ.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Тому вимагайте посилення санкцій, щоб спонукати росіян змінювати свою країну зсередини!</seg>
          <seg id="12">Росія створює загрозу нового Чорнобиля та Фукусіми.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Російські військові обстрілюють і захоплюють атомні електростанції на території України.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Знеструмили Чорнобильську АЕС.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Обстріляли з танків і взяли під свій контроль Запорізьку АЕС – найбільшу в Європі.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Російські ракети були зафіксовані й над Південноукраїнською АЕС у Миколаївській області.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Своїми діями Росія порушує 15 статтю Женевської конвенції, яка забороняє атакувати АЕС.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Влучання ракети, перегрів реактора чи відпрацьованого палива через збої в постачанні електрики та води можуть призвести до витоку радіації.</seg>
          <seg id="19">В Україні розташовано 15 ядерних реакторів.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Росії не обов’язково натискати «червону кнопку», щоб спричинити катастрофу планетарного масштабу.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Підтримуйте Україну – російську загрозу можна здолати тільки разом!</seg>
          <seg id="22">Росіяни грабують українських фермерів і незаконно вивозять з України зерно, пальне, агротехніку та перші врожаї.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Такі випадки зафіксовані в чотирьох областях України, тимчасово окупованих РФ.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Це свідома політика Росії: наприклад, місцева влада Красноярського краю ухвалила рішення про «експропріацію надлишків врожаю минулого та цього року» з півдня України.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Окупаційна влада забирає в аграріїв посівний матеріал, але водночас вимагає від них успішно провести посівну, щоб потім відправити до Росії нові врожаї.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Забороняє платити податки до держбюджету України.</seg>
          <seg id="27">У разі незгоди – погрожує фізичною розправою.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Росія повторює політику СРСР із масового грабунку українських селян наприкінці 1920-х.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Так почався Голодомор у 1932-33 роках та була знищена приватна власність на українських землях.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Під виглядом «визвольної війни з нацистами» Росія зокрема провокує голод на окупованих територіях та знищує Україну як конкурента на міжнародному ринку продовольства.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Не купуйте російські товари!</seg>
          <seg id="32">І вимагайте, щоб ваша країна відмовилася від будь-якої співпраці з Росією!</seg>
          <seg id="33">Російські солдати на тимчасово окупованій території України беруть у заручники дітей.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Змушують їхніх матерів вивідувати місця розташування українських військових, за відмову – погрожують вбити дітей.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Людей штовхають до жорсткого вибору: втратити дітей або стати зрадниками Батьківщини й понести за це покарання.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Уповноважена з прав людини в Україні Людмила Денісова неодноразово повідомляла і про масове викрадення дітей сиріт державою-агресором.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Їх вивозять на територію Росії і віддають у російські сім’ї.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Путін навіть ініціював внесення зміни до законодавства «для організації прискореної процедури щодо усиновлення дітей із Донбасу».</seg>
          <seg id="39">Закликайте свою владу й міжнародну спільноту не допускати викрадення українських дітей!</seg>

          <seg id="4">Я напевно сама не зможу виїхати якщо у нього тривалий робити,і він може не дати дозвіл на вивіз дітей в Чехію</seg>

          <seg id="9">No, at the moment he does not have anyone, that’s for sure. I think the reason is that children want a lot of things in Czechia, asking him to buy toys or to go to Mac Donald's, screaming, running around the house.and he used to quiet when no one bothers him and does not ask for anything.and then we came and everything annoys him and he need to spend money on us, and he is such an economizer.it is better for him that we live in Ukraine.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">Дякую за листа, і висловлюю мою особисту позицію, яка не завжди співпадає з думкою інших психологів з України.</seg>
          <seg id="2">На мою думку питання вилучення чи не вилучення асоціації російських психологів європейських асоціацій є дуже непростим.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Члени організації можуть мати різні думки з приводу нападу Росії на Україну.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Але на мою думку захист базових людських прав і право на життя є головним.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Приведу аналогію.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Якщо в пісочниці одна дитина забере в іншої дитини іграшку, то швидше за все дорослі, які дивляться за дітьми попробують дітей помирити і за якийсь час гра продовжується.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Якщо ж одна дитина в пісочниці починає лопаткою бити по обличчю іншій, то таку дитину надовго ізолюють, і ніхто не буде гратися з нею.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Мені сподобалося і аналогія однієї російської колеги-психолога з приводу того, що коли хтось із сусідньої квартири когось вбиває, то в тюрьму не садять весь багатоквартирний будинок.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Серед українських психологів є багато дискусій на тему виключення російських асоціації з європейських багато хто відчуває наскільки болі, що не може витримати комунікацію з російськими психологами.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Особисто я відчуваю також багато болю і суму з приводу війни в Україні але я готовий і надалі співпрацювати із кількома психологами із Росії, яких я знаю, і ділитися знаннями для того щоб лікувати травми клієнтів з обох сторін.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Я знаю російських психологів і маю російських клієнтів, які глибоко засуджують напад російських військ на Україну, і які на своєму рівні намагаються зробити багато речей для розвитку загальнолюдських цінностей в Росії.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Тому я точно за диференційований підхід до різних людей і різних організацій.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Я переконаний, що в Росії війну підтримує 5-10% населення, а інші цифри в соцопитуваннях домальовує пропаганда.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Thank you for your letter, I express my personal opinion which not always matches the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="2">In my opinion the matter of excluding or not excluding the association of Russian psychologists from European associations is very difficult.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The organization members might have different opinions regarding Russia’s attack on Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="4">But in my opinion the protection of basic human rights and right to life are paramount.</seg>
          <seg id="5">I”ll give an analogy.</seg>
          <seg id="6">If in the sandbox one child takes away a toy from another child, the adults supervising the children most likely will try to reconcile the children and after some time their game goes on.</seg>
          <seg id="7">But if one child in the sandbox begins to hit another child in the face with a showel, this child will be isolated, and no one will play with that child.</seg>
          <seg id="8">I liked another analogy from a counterpart Russian psychologist regarding that fact that if somebody from an apartment nearby kills someone, all the residents of the apartment building will not be put to the jail.</seg>
          <seg id="9">There is a lot of controversy among Ukrainian psychologists regarding the exclusion of Russian associations from European ones, many people feel so much pain and therefore can stand a communication with Russian psychologists.</seg>
          <seg id="10">I personally feel a lot of pain and sadness about war in Ukraine but I am ready to continue a collaboration with several psychologists from Russia which I know, and to share knowledge in order to treat traumas of the clients from both sides.</seg>
          <seg id="11">I know Russian psychologists and have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who are trying to do a lot of things on their level for development of universal human values in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="12">That’s why I definitely endorse the differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.</seg>
          <seg id="13">I firmly believe that in Russia only 5-10% of population support war, and different figures in social surveys are drawn by propaganda.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Як змінилося ставлення до українців і чому ЄС не платить за біженців – аналітика від експерта</seg>
          <seg id="2">Польща і Чехія не отримують допомоги на біженців від ЄС – це найбільш обговорювана тема на зустрічах президентів цих двох країн.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Анджей Дуда відвідав Чехію на запрошення Мілоша Земана.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Президент Чехії зауважив, що з початку війни в Україні, Польща стала головним захисником європейських цінностей і взяла на себе вирішення багатьох проблем.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Вона надала притулок 2 млн українцям, допомогла з житлом і надала фінансову допомогу.</seg>
          <seg id="6">До Чехії прибуло приблизно 500 тис.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Українці ніколи не забудуть такої потужної підтримки сусідів – Польщі та Чехії – і будуть невтомно дякувати!</seg>
          <seg id="8">Як Польща переживає неочікувану хвилю біженців та фінансове навантаження редакція ProUkraїnu запитала Ярослава Кота – координатора та перекладача Центру для біженців у Любліні.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Він також є засновником Інституту глобальної і регіональної аналітики, який має представництво не тільки в Польщі, але й в Канаді, Україні та Казахстані.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Як Польща допомагає українцям</seg>
          <seg id="11">Чехія прийняла до півмільйона українців і це суттєво позначилося на життєдіяльності чехів.</seg>
          <seg id="12">В урядах праці великі черги, значне підвищення цін у магазинах.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Що відбувається в Польщі, де мільйони українських біженців?</seg>
          <seg id="14">Уряд Польщі винятково швидко організувався і почав надавати допомогу, коли почалися військові дії.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Це було передбачено.</seg>
          <seg id="16">У Польщі говорили упродовж останніх місяців, що буде така величезна проблема.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Навіть в Україні менше готувалися до того, що відбудеться, а в Польщі активно готувалися.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Так, наприклад, у прикордонних областях Польщі з Україною ще перед початком війни, вже були певні плани, де будуть розміщувати біженців з України.</seg>
          <seg id="19">В Україні навіть не думали, що таке може статися.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Я чув, що усміхалися з приводу страху Польщі перед біженцями.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Але це було дуже виважено: готуватися ще до початку війни до цих усіх подій.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Зазначу, були виділені надзвичайно великі кошти з регіональних та державного бюджетів на те, щоби допомогти українцям, які втікають від бомбардувань, від російського агресора.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Перш за все допомога в логістиці – пересуванні територією Польщі.</seg>
          <seg id="24">З України до Польщі є спеціальні потяги, серед них і медичні, для поранених і хворих.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Це літаки, які пересуваються територією Польщі між містами, також чартерні рейси до країн ЄС.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Я мав досвід співпраці з такими рейсами до Португалії, Франції, Румунії та Іспанії з Любліна.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Хоча місто Люблін за величиною схоже на Луцьк, а не мільйоник, як хтось може думати.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Транспортне питання залишається надзвичайно важливим.</seg>
          <seg id="29">У Польщі скасовано оплату за проїзд для українців.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Вони можуть безкоштовно їздити в потягах і в громадському транспорті.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Крім того, Польща домовилася з німецькими перевізниками, що організували безкоштовні потяги до Німеччини з кількох польських міст.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Тобто біженці мають можливість безкоштовно доїхати до місць, де вони планують зупинитися.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Друге питання – проживання біженців в об’єктах, які надають органи місцевого самоврядування.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Здебільшого це закриті шкільні невеликі стадіони, комплекси, де влаштовуються тимчасові зали з ліжками.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Там організовується безкоштовне харчування, безкоштовна медична перша допомога.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Біженці мають можливість відпочити та перебути кілька днів, і вже там на місці їм шукають можливості для переїзду в якісь більш комфортні умови.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Дуже активізувалися великі міста Варшава, Гданськ, Вроцлав, де тепер створилися цілі українські квартали.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Приклад Варшави взагалі є унікальним в тому сенсі, що вони домоглися від посольства РФ забрати об’єкти, які були покинуті мешканцями цього посольства.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Великі житлові комплекси десятиліттями стояли в занедбаному стані, але туди росіяни нікого не пускали.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Польська місцева влада це націоналізувала, скажімо так.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Забрала на користь українців, там будуть мешкати українські родини.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Це багатоквартирні будинки, де може розміститися одразу 200-300 сімей.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Туди буде підведена вода, електрика, вони утеплені.</seg>
          <seg id="44">За тиждень-два там уже можуть мешкати біженців з України.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Третій аспект – соціальна допомога.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Після 24 лютого Польща зробила унікальний крок – Сейм прийняв, а Сенат затвердив закон щодо втікачів з України.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Відповідно до нього українські громадяни мають право легального перебування в Польщі протягом 18 місяців.</seg>
          <seg id="48">Вони мають право працювати без дозволу на працю, який є обов’язковим у всіх країнах Євросоюзу.</seg>
          <seg id="49">Цей закон передбачає медичне обслуговування.</seg>
          <seg id="50">Крім того є приватний фонд, який виділив десять мільйонів злотих на безкоштовну допомогу на ліки українцям.</seg>
          <seg id="51">Потрібно тільки написати смс, отримати код на телефон.</seg>
          <seg id="52">І в перерахунку на 5 тисяч гривень безкоштовно отримати ліки в Польщі.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Соціальна допомога – це триста злотих, які надаються безповоротно кожному біженцю з України незалежно від віку.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Поширені різні фонди, в тому числі Карітас, Червоний хрест, які дають пакунки з їжею, хімією, одягом.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Як кажуть поляки: «Niespotykana skala».</seg>
          <seg id="56">Тобто «подія, яка не має аналогів».</seg>
          <seg id="57">Така величезна відкритість.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Для польської держави це величезні видатки.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Євросоюз до сьогоднішнього часу ані одного євро не виділив Польщі.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Насправді, це є надзвичайно великий удар по польському бюджету.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Яка найбільша проблема в адаптації українців у Польщі?</seg>
          <seg id="62">Мовна проблема.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Питання починаються від поліклінік, де українці не можуть собі дати раду без перекладача.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Часто зі складними проблемами, хворобами.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Друга проблема – школи, де учні особливо старших класів теж на початку зовсім не дають собі ради, не можуть зрозуміти термінологію.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Зауважу, що українські діти часто приїжджають з рівнем знань набагато вищим, ніж у відповідному класі.</seg>
          <seg id="67">Це часто дивує польських вчителів.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Діти мають знання не тільки добре володіють англійською, але і загалом їхній рівень є вищим, ніж клас, в який вони потрапляють.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Це теж цікаво.</seg>
          <seg id="70">Тобто українська система освіти є доброю.</seg>
          <seg id="71">І, насправді, діти гарно вчаться в Україні, якщо тут вони оцінюються так високо.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Звичайно, мова важлива під час працевлаштування.</seg>
          <seg id="73">На жаль, працівник, який в Україні працював лікарем, бухгалтером, адвокатом, тут цю роботу опанувати набагато важче.</seg>
          <seg id="74">Адвокатом чи бухгалтером, я взагалі таких випадків не знаю.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Лікарі зараз з’являються в певних пунктах, зокрема в Любліні, компанія створила власну невелику поліклініку з українськими лікарями.</seg>
          <seg id="76">Це польська ініціатива, де українські лікарі мають можливість приймати тих самих українців на легальних підставах.</seg>
          <seg id="77">Мовна проблема часто є причиною, яка спонукає родини через кілька тижнів перебування тут, вертатися назад додому.</seg>
          <seg id="78">Таких випадків є дуже багато.</seg>
          <seg id="79">В останні кілька тижнів маємо цілу хвилю біженців, які втікали в перші тижні війни, тепер вони повертаються назад.</seg>
          <seg id="80">Це Закарпаття та західні регіони України, де таких активних військових дій немає.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Тут вони не освоїлися, не знайшли роботи.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Там, де вони мешкають, умови не відповідають їхнім потребам і відповідно їм зручніше повернуться додому.</seg>
          <seg id="83">Це теж одна з таких проблем, яка виникає в останні тижні.</seg>
          <seg id="84">Як змінилось ставлення до українців</seg>
          <seg id="85">Зі слів посла України в Чехії сталися суттєві зміни.</seg>
          <seg id="86">Якщо раніше чеське суспільство вважало українців винятково трудовими мігрантами, то нині пишається стійкістю українців, які захищають свою країну.</seg>
          <seg id="87">Як ставляться поляки до мільйонів українських біженців?</seg>
          <seg id="88">У Польщі є схожа ситуація.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Тут всі телевізійні канали часто цитують вислів Президента Польщі Леха Качинського, який трагічно загинув у Смоленську.</seg>
          <seg id="90">Коли були події нападу Росії на Грузію, разом із президентом Ющенком та іншими керівниками держав, він був у Тбілісі.</seg>
          <seg id="91">Там сказав знаменну фразу, що російська агресія напевно не зупиниться на Грузії, а потім може бути Україна.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Потім можуть бути країни Балтії, може дійти і до Польщі.</seg>
          <seg id="93">Тобто він це якби передбачав.</seg>
          <seg id="94">Фактично українці нині захищають Польщу своєю кров’ю, своєю відданістю, своїми героїчними вчинками.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Польща і поляки це належно оцінюють, тому відкривають свої будинки, допомагають так безкорисливо українським біженцям.</seg>
          <seg id="96">Загрозу в Польщі бачать.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Незважаючи на те, що Польща є в НАТО, незважаючи на те, що тут є американські військові бази, відчувається певний страх від того, що війна може теж постукати у наші двері.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Тому й ставлення змінилося до позитивного.</seg>
          <seg id="99">Український прапор, український гімн тепер у Польщі не “пісня націоналістів” чи якихось ворогів.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Звичайно, залишилися невеличкі групи серед населення, які не змінили своїх поглядів, вони є в кожній країні.</seg>
          <seg id="101">Але, на щастя, більшість громадян у суспільстві думає тепер зовсім інакше про українців, ніж раніше.</seg>
          <seg id="102">Твердження про націоналістів в Україні смішне.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Путін та інші російські політики постійно твердять, що в Україні націоналісти, яких треба ліквідувати.</seg>
          <seg id="104">Це в Польщі сприймається просто зі сміхом, тому що ці, так звані, “націоналісти” виявилися абсолютно іншими людьми, якихось політичних підтекстів у них немає.</seg>
          <seg id="105">І це напевно вражає, бо цей безпосередній контакт вплинув на зміну громадської думки тих верств суспільства, які ще сумнівалися в якихось історичних питаннях.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Тепер виявилося, що ці сумніви не підтвердилися.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Українці є героями.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Поляки, коли починають думати, що може бути війна, відразу починають розуміти, що вони б не змогли так протистояти та віддавати своє життя, як це відбувається нині в Україні.</seg>
          <seg id="109">Тут постійно говорять про людей із Маріуполя, Бучі та інших українських міст.</seg>
          <seg id="110">Як Польша сприймає погрози Росії</seg>
          <seg id="111">Україна вірить у перемогу, але готується до гіршого сценарію, бо триває страшна війна.</seg>
          <seg id="112">Але нині про власну безпеку серйозно міркують Польща та Чехія, які вже отримали погрози.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Росія лякає, що вдарить ядерною зброєю в покарання за підтримання України.</seg>
          <seg id="114">Як реагує влада та суспільство Польщі?</seg>
          <seg id="115">Хочеш миру – готуйся до війни.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Власне, Польща це робить, вона має дуже добрі контакти з США, іншими країнами НАТО.</seg>
          <seg id="117">Збільшився військовий контингент.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Нині в Польщі відбувається додатковий набір у війська територіальної оборони.</seg>
          <seg id="119">Тобто така підготовка до різноманітних військових сценаріїв відбувається.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Відчутно для громадян, що держава готується до таких подій.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Серед цього і недавно ухвалений новий закон про оборону вітчизни, де бюджет значно збільшено на військові потреби Польщі.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Змінено вимоги до набору військових, багато моментів, які власне, пов’язані з можливою мілітарної загрози.</seg>
          <seg id="123">Знаю вас, як фахового експерта з аналітики майбутнього.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Ваші прогнози стали реальністю в Сирії, ви попереджали про напад Росії.</seg>
          <seg id="125">Що скажете з аналізу ситуації: коли перемога України та чи вдасться світу попередити ядерну війну?</seg>
          <seg id="126">Це найгірший сценарій.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Щодо ядерного удару, я не сильно вірю.</seg>
          <seg id="128">Але такий сценарій є.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Такий ядерний удар має бути більш показовим для країн НАТО, і Польщі також.</seg>
          <seg id="130">Він міг би відбутися, за різними оцінками, на території Волинської області.</seg>
          <seg id="131">Зауважу, я б не хотів цього, але це найгірший сценарій.</seg>
          <seg id="132">Удар невеликої потужності, але щоби всі телевізійні канали показали цей “грибок”.</seg>
          <seg id="133">Щоби його побачили з Польщі, країн Балтії.</seg>
          <seg id="134">У цьому випадку росіяни очікують, що станеться втеча та втрата боєздатності військ НАТО.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Позитивні сценарії пов’язані з вичерпання фізичним і фінансовим російського війська, проблемами оточення Путіна, олігархів, які нині дуже страждають від фінансових проблем, різні регіональні проблеми у Росії.</seg>
          <seg id="136">Ми ж маємо факти загоряння ГЕС на Сахаліні, певні свідчення того, що люди починають обурюватися цінами.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Такі проблеми регіонального характеру будуть впливати на цілісність російської держави.</seg>
          <seg id="138">В одному з моїх прогнозів я написав, що Росія розпадеться на 19 невеликих країн.</seg>
          <seg id="139">Маємо теж тенденції мирного залагодження війни.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Різні країни Євросоюзу, зокрема, Німеччина та Угорщина, налаштовані на те, щоби зупинити істотну військову агресію в Україні через свої потреби в російських енергоресурсах.</seg>
          <seg id="141">Максимально це затягнеться до кінця цього року.</seg>
          <seg id="142">Як жити без російського газу</seg>
          <seg id="143">Чехія обговорює можливе припинення газопостачання.</seg>
          <seg id="144">Це буде дуже відчутним ударом, бо Чехія залежна від російського газу майже на 100%.</seg>
          <seg id="145">У той же час Росія повністю зупинила поставки газу до Польщі та Болгарії.</seg>
          <seg id="146">Як це позначилося на польських громадянах?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Оскільки я аналітик, то це передбачив.</seg>
          <seg id="148">Я просто заздалегідь відключив газ у свому будинку.</seg>
          <seg id="149">Моя родина не буде страждати від втрати цього ресурсу.</seg>
          <seg id="150">Але є дуже величезна кількість, мільйони польських родин, які відчують зростання цін.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Громадяни цього не відчують перші декілька місяців, але однозначно ціни на всі ресурси почнуть підніматися вгору.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Зараз шукають різні шляхи до певних альтернативних джерел.</seg>
          <seg id="153">Крім того, маємо вже декілька фірм, які везуть скраплений газ до Польщі, є дуже величезний порт у Польщі.</seg>
          <seg id="154">Щодо нафти, маємо яскравий фактор, що прем’єр-міністр Угорщини насправді співпрацює з Путіним.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Нині відбуватиметься викуп заправних станцій у Польщі, власне, угорськими компаніями, які будуть експлуатувати російську нафту.</seg>
          <seg id="156">Це теж теми дуже болючі, які торкаються геополітичних і міжнародних проблем.</seg>
          <seg id="157">Якби Європа відмовилася від російських енергоносіїв, це була б втрата джерела фінансування РФ свого війська.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Навіть школяр розуміє, без продажу нафти і газу, Росія просто втратить можливість існування і збанкрутує дуже швидко.</seg>

          <seg id="160">Володимир Зеленський дав інтерв’ю польським ЗМІ.</seg>
          <seg id="161">Що про це розповідають у польських медіа?</seg>
          <seg id="162">Рейтинг Президента України дуже сильно зріс.</seg>
          <seg id="163">І цей ріст оцінюється, як безпрецедентний.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Володимир Зеленський дякує за допомогу, говорить про реальні речі, які відбуваються поряд, він перебуває у місті, що у зоні військових дій.</seg>
          <seg id="165">Тобто дії президента оцінюються і політиками, і аналітиками, і представниками влади, як дуже активні.</seg>
          <seg id="166">Вони свідчать, що українська влада максимально націлена, щоби отримати військову та фінансову допомогу, щоби забезпечити біженців, які виїжджають з України.</seg>
          <seg id="167">У ЗМІ обговорюються ці теми в дуже позитивному контексті щодо української влади.</seg>
          <seg id="168">Немає негативу, який іноді трапляється в українських медіа щодо певного саботажу чи регіональних проблем.</seg>
          <seg id="169">Тут цього не чути.</seg>
          <seg id="170">І на мою думку, це дуже добре, бо імідж України в сенсі героїзму, витривалості, вміння боротися з ворогом дуже істотно зріс.</seg>
          <seg id="171">Він не згасає та не падає.</seg>
          <seg id="172">Оце найважливіше, тобто немає іміджевих втрат.</seg>
          <seg id="173">Насправді імідж України тримається, і це дуже важливо.</seg>

          <seg id="1">How has the attitude toward Ukrainians changed, and why isn't the EU paying for refugees — expert analysis</seg>
          <seg id="2">Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive any refugee assistance from the EU — it’s the most discussed topic in meetings of the presidents of these two countries.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The President of the Czech Republic noted that Poland has become the primary defender of European values and has taken upon itself the responsibility of resolving many issues since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It has provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, offered housing assistance, and provided financial aid.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Approximately 500 thousand people have arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget the vigorous support of neighboring countries, Poland and the Czech Republic, and will be endlessly grateful!</seg>
          <seg id="8">The ProUkraїnu newsroom interviewed Yaroslav Kot, a coordinator and translator at the Refugee Centre in Lublin, about how Poland is managing the sudden wave of refugees and the financial burden.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analytics, which has representative offices not only in Poland but also in Canada, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How does Poland provide assistance to Ukrainians</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic has hosted up to half a million Ukrainians, which has had a significant impact on the Czechs' daily life.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There are long queues at labor offices, and significant price increases are being observed in shops.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is currently happening in Poland, which has hosted millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="14">When hostilities broke out, the Polish government quickly organized and commenced providing assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="15">It was anticipated.</seg>
          <seg id="16">In recent months, there have been discussions in Poland about the emergence of such a significant issue.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, there was much less preparation for what was going to happen, while Poland was actively preparing.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For instance, there were already plans in place regarding the placement of refugees from Ukraine in the border regions of Poland and Ukraine, even prior to the onset of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, there hasn't even been a consideration that such a thing could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I have heard that there was mockery regarding Poland's fear of the refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">However, it was a well-considered decision to prepare for all of these events before the onset of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I would like to emphasize that a substantial amount of funding was allocated from regional and state budgets to assist Ukrainians fleeing from the bombing by the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First and foremost, assistance was provided in logistics, specifically in facilitating movement throughout the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">There are airplanes flying through the territory of Poland, connecting cities within the country, as well as charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I have had the experience of collaborating with flights to Portugal, France, Romania, and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although Lublin is comparable in size to Lutsk, it does not have a population exceeding one million, as one might assume.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The transportation issue remains of great importance.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The passenger fare for Ukrainians has been waived in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel on trains and public transport free of charge.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Furthermore, Poland has reached an agreement with German carriers who have organized free trains from several Polish cities to Germany.</seg>
          <seg id="32">This means that refugees have the opportunity to reach their intended destinations free of charge.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Another important aspect is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local self-government authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Typically, these consist of small enclosed school stadiums or complexes where temporary halls are equipped with beds.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Additionally, free meals and medical first aid are provided at these facilities.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for several days, while on-site efforts are made to explore possibilities for relocating them to more comfortable conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Cities like Warsaw, Gdansk, and Wroclaw have recently intensified their activities, leading to the establishment of entire Ukrainian neighborhoods in these areas.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The case of Warsaw is unique in that they were able to negotiate with the Russian Embassy to reclaim the facilities that were vacated by the embassy staff.</seg>
          <seg id="39">For decades, large residential complexes remained abandoned, with Russians not granting access to anyone.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The Polish local authorities effectively nationalized these complexes.</seg>
          <seg id="41">They took them over for the benefit of Ukrainians, and now Ukrainian families will reside there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are multi-family housing units that can accommodate 200–300 families at once.</seg>
          <seg id="43">The buildings will be provided with water and electricity, and they have been insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Refugees from Ukraine will be able to begin living there within a week or two.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social care.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24th, Poland took a unique step: the Sejm passed a law on refugees from Ukraine, which was later approved by the Senate.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to this law, Ukrainian citizens are granted the right to legally stay in Poland for a period of 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all European countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law includes provisions for medical services.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotych for providing free medication assistance to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You simply need to send an SMS message and receive a code on your phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And you can receive medications in Poland for free, up to the equivalent amount of 5,000 hryvnias.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social care includes an amount of three hundred zlotych, which is given to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age, and is provided without the need for repayment.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Various funds, such as Caritas and the Red Cross, are widely available, providing packages containing food, household items, and clothing.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: “Niespotykana skala”.</seg>
          <seg id="56">It means “an event that is one of a kind”.</seg>
          <seg id="57">It showcases immense hospitality.</seg>
          <seg id="58">These costs pose a significant burden on the Polish State.</seg>
          <seg id="59">The European Union has not allocated not a single euro to Poland thus far.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In reality, it represents a significant blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the greatest challenge in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">A language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">The challenges begin with polyclinics, as Ukrainians often require an interpreter to navigate their way through.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often, they encounter complex medical issues and illnesses.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Another challenge is faced in schools, where students, particularly those in higher grades, struggle to cope with and understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">It is worth noting that Ukrainian children often possess a higher level of knowledge compared to their corresponding grade level.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often comes as a big surprise to Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Children come well-prepared with knowledge, demonstrating not only a good command of English but also a level that exceeds their grade level.</seg>
          <seg id="69">It’s also interesting.</seg>
          <seg id="70">This indicates that Ukraine has a strong educational system.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Indeed, children in Ukraine excel academically as they receive high value and recognition here.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Undoubtedly, language proficiency plays a crucial role for employment opportunities.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, professionals who have worked as doctors, accountants, lawyers, and other similar occupations in Ukraine may face greater challenges in adapting and pursuing the same career here.</seg>
          <seg id="74">A lawyer or accountant, I am not aware of any such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="75">In certain premises, particularly in Lublin, there is a company that has established its own small polyclinic where Ukrainian doctors are now practicing.</seg>
          <seg id="76">This Polish initiative allows Ukrainian doctors the opportunity to legally provide medical treatment to fellow Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="77">The language barrier often becomes a significant reason for families to return to their home country after a few weeks of staying here.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are a lot of such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the past few weeks, there has been an influx of refugees who initially fled during the early weeks of the war and are now returning back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are the regions of Zakarpattia and western Ukraine, where there are currently no active military actions.</seg>
          <seg id="81">They have faced challenges in settling down and finding employment here.</seg>
          <seg id="82">The living conditions in their current location do not meet their needs, making it more convenient for them to choose to return home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This has also been one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How has the attitude towards Ukrainians changed</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the Ukrainian ambassador in the Czech Republic, significant changes have taken place.</seg>
          <seg id="86">While there was a time when the Czech embassy regarded Ukrainians solely as labor migrants, they now acknowledge and admire the resilience of Ukrainians defending their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How did the Polish people treat the millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">A similar situation can be observed in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="89">In Poland, all television channels often quote the phrase of the President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">He was in Tbilisi with President Yushchenko and other leaders when Georgia came under attack by Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="91">He made a remarkable statement there, suggesting that Russian aggression might not stop at Georgia and that Ukraine could be the next target.</seg>
          <seg id="92">The Baltic States could become involved later, and even Poland might be affected.</seg>
          <seg id="93">So it was a sort of prediction.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians are currently defending Poland with their blood, demonstrating their loyalty and heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and its residents deeply appreciate it, which is why they open their homes and selflessly assist the Ukrainian refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="96">Poland is perceived as a threat.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite Poland's NATO membership and the presence of American military bases, there is a sense of apprehension that the war might eventually reach our country.</seg>
          <seg id="98">That's why the attitude has changed to a positive one.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag and anthem are no longer seen as the “song of the nationalists” or associated with enemies in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are small groups within the population who have not altered their views; such groups exist in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now hold a significantly different perspective on Ukrainians compared to before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The statement regarding nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians frequently assert that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eradicated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">In Poland, these so-called "nationalists" are often perceived with humor, as they have turned out to be individuals who are completely unrelated to any political implications.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And that is indeed impressive, as this face-to-face contact has influenced the change in public opinion among social groups who previously harbored doubts regarding certain historical issues.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turns out that these doubts have been dispelled.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are the heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">When Poles start thinking that there might be a war, they immediately realize that they wouldn't be able to resist and sacrifice their lives as is happening in Ukraine now.</seg>
          <seg id="109">Here, people constantly talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha, and other Ukrainian cities.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How does Poland perceive the Russian threats</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in its victory but prepares for the worst-case scenario because this terrifying war continues.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are deeply concerned about their own safety.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons as a response to the support for Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How does the government and society of Poland react?</seg>
          <seg id="115">Wish for peace, but be prepared for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Actually, that's what Poland does: it maintains very good contacts with the USA and other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military forces have been increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Currently, additional recruitment for the provincial armed forces is taking place in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="119">So they are actively preparing for various military scenarios.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Citizens feel that the state is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Additionally, a new law on homeland defense was recently enacted, which has substantially increased the budget allocated to Poland's military requirements.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Requirements for military recruitment have been revised, with many aspects directly related to potential military threats taken into consideration.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions became a reality in Syria; you warned about a potential Russian invasion.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What can you say after analyzing the situation: when will Ukraine achieve victory, and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">It’s the worst scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">I don't really believe in a nuclear attack.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But such a scenario is possible.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear attack should be more indicative for NATO countries, including Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="130">According to various estimates, such an attack could potentially occur in the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">To be clear, I hope it never happens, but it is indeed the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A strike of small magnitude, but one that would generate a “mushroom cloud” visible on all television channels.</seg>
          <seg id="133">So that it would be visible in Poland and the Baltic States.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, Russians anticipate a retreat and the loss of combat capability of the NATO forces.</seg>
          <seg id="135">The positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian forces, problems with Putin and the surrounding oligarchs who are currently facing financial difficulties, and various regional issues in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have reports of fires at the hydroelectric power plants in Sakhalin and indications that people are becoming outraged by the rising prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such regional issues will have an impact on the integrity of the Russian Federation.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I suggested that Russia would disintegrate into 19 smaller countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have tendencies towards a peaceful resolution of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Different EU countries, including Germany and Hungary, are motivated to prevent significant military aggression in Ukraine as they rely on Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">This is expected to continue until the end of this year at most.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">There are discussions in the Czech Republic regarding the potential cessation of gas supply.</seg>
          <seg id="144">It'll be an inconvenience since the Czech Republic almost entirely relies on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia has completely halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did it affect Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">As an analyst, I made that prediction.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just cut off the gas supply in my home in advance.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family won't be adversely affected by the lack of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there are a vast number of Polish families, millions of them, who will experience the impact of rising prices.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens may not experience it in the first few months, but prices for all resources will certainly begin to rise.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Now they are exploring various opportunities for alternative sources of energy.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, there are already several companies in Poland involved in the importation of liquefied gas, and there is a large port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">Regarding oil, it is worth noting that the Prime Minister of Hungary is cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Currently, there is a process underway where Hungarian companies are acquiring gas stations in Poland to utilize Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are indeed the sore subjects that involves geopolitical and international issues.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe were to stop relying on Russian energy resources, Russia would have lost a source of financing for its troops.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Russia would just lose the ability to exist and would go bankrupt very quickly if it were to stop selling oil and gas, this is a well-known fact and easily understandable.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in Polish media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What is being said about it in the Polish media?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the President of Ukraine has significantly increased.</seg>
          <seg id="163">This growth is considered unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Volodymyr Zelenskyy expresses gratitude for the assistance and talks about the real things happening around; he is in a city within a war zone.</seg>
          <seg id="165">So politicians, analysts, and government representatives evaluate the President’s actions as highly active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They highlight that the Ukrainian government is prioritizing the acquisition of military and financial aid to provide support for the refugees fleeing Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">In the media, these topics are being discussed in a highly positive context regarding the Ukrainian government.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity, which sometimes occurs in the Ukrainian media regarding sabotage or regional issues.</seg>
          <seg id="169">We don't have that here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my view, it is great because the image of Ukraine has significantly improved in terms of heroism, resilience, and the ability to fight the enemy.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It doesn’t wane or decline.</seg>
          <seg id="172">That's the most important thing, as the image remains unaffected.</seg>
          <seg id="173">The image of Ukraine indeed holds a strong position, and that is crucial.</seg>

          <seg id="20">I heard that they were laughing about Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was very calculated: preparing for all these events even before the war began.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I should note, extraordinarily large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to assist Ukrainians fleeing from bombings, from the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First and foremost, assistance in logistics - moving around the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">From Ukraine to Poland, there are special trains, including medical ones, for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">These are airplanes that travel across Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I have had experience working with flights to Portugal, France, Romania, and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, not a million-plus city as someone might think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The transportation issue remains extremely important.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In Poland, the fare for Ukrainians has been cancelled.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can ride for free on trains and public transportation.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland has arranged with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">This means that refugees have the opportunity to travel for free to the places where they plan to stop.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local government bodies.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Mostly these are closed small school stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are set up.</seg>
          <seg id="35">There, free meals and free first aid medical assistance are provided.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and from there, opportunities are sought for them to move to more comfortable conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The big cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been established.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The example of Warsaw is unique in the sense that they managed to get the Russian embassy to take over the properties that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large residential complexes stood neglected for decades, but the Russians didn't let anyone in.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The Polish local authority nationalized it, so to speak.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Took for the benefit of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Water and electricity will be supplied there, they will be insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine may already be living there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm adopted, and the Senate approved, a law regarding refugees from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all European Union countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical services.</seg>
          <seg id="50">Additionally, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medical aid to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You just need to send a text message and receive a code on your phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And to get medicines for free in Poland when converted to 5,000 hryvnias.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are given unconditionally to every refugee from Ukraine regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Various funds are widespread, including Caritas, Red Cross, which provide packages with food, chemicals, clothing.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".</seg>
          <seg id="56">That is, "an event without analogues".</seg>
          <seg id="57">Such immense openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">For the Polish state, this is a huge expense.</seg>
          <seg id="59">The European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland to date.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">Language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">The issues start from the clinics, where Ukrainians can't manage without a translator.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems, diseases.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem - schools, where students, especially older ones, initially struggle and cannot understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I note that Ukrainian children often arrive with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Children not only have a good command of English, but their overall level is higher than the class they are placed in.</seg>
          <seg id="69">This is also interesting.</seg>
          <seg id="70">That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And, actually, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important during employment.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, a worker who worked as a doctor, accountant, or lawyer in Ukraine will find it much harder to master this job here.</seg>
          <seg id="74">As a lawyer or accountant, I don't know of any such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors are now appearing at certain points, including in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">This is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to treat the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.</seg>
          <seg id="77">The language barrier is often the reason that prompts families to return home after a few weeks of staying here.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are many such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks, we have had a wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are returning back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">This is Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military actions.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Here they did not adapt, did not find work.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and therefore it is more convenient for them to return home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This is also one of those problems that has arisen in the last few weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed</seg>
          <seg id="85">Significant changes have occurred according to the ambassador of Ukraine in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="86">If before, Czech society considered Ukrainians solely as labor migrants, now it takes pride in the resilience of Ukrainians who are defending their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles feel about millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">There is a similar situation in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here all television channels often quote the statement of the President of Poland, Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When the events of Russia's attack on Georgia took place, he was in Tbilisi along with President Yushchenko and other state leaders.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There he uttered the significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then it could be Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then it could be the Baltic countries, it could even reach Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">In other words, he somehow foresaw it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians are currently defending Poland with their blood, their dedication, their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and the Polish people appreciate this, therefore they open their homes and selflessly help Ukrainian refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="96">They see a threat in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war could also knock on our door.</seg>
          <seg id="98">That's why the attitude has changed to positive.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem are now in Poland not a "song of nationalists" or some enemies.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there remain small groups among the population who have not changed their views, they exist in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think very differently about Ukrainians than before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is funny.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians constantly claim that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">This is simply laughed at in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they have no political subtext.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those layers of society that still had doubts about some historical issues.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turns out that these doubts were not confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">When Poles start to think that there could be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is happening now in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">Here they constantly talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How Poland perceives Russia's threats</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, as a terrible war continues.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously considering their own safety.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia threatens to strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How does the government and society of Poland react?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Actually, Poland is doing this, it has very good contacts with the USA, other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent has increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Currently in Poland, there is an additional recruitment for the territorial defense forces.</seg>
          <seg id="119">In other words, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="120">It is noticeable to citizens that the state is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among this is the recently passed new law on homeland defense, where the budget has been significantly increased for Poland's military needs.</seg>
          <seg id="122">The requirements for military recruitment have been changed, many points, which are actually related to a possible military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions have become reality in Syria, you warned about Russia's attack.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What do you make of the situation analysis: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">Regarding a nuclear strike, I don't really believe it.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But such a scenario exists.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more demonstrative for NATO countries, and for Poland as well.</seg>
          <seg id="130">According to various estimates, it could have taken place in the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">I should note, I wouldn't want this, but it's the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A small-scale strike, but one that all television channels would show this "mushroom".</seg>
          <seg id="133">To be seen from Poland, the Baltic countries.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect a retreat and loss of combat readiness of NATO forces.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are associated with the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian military, problems surrounding Putin, oligarchs who are currently suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have facts of a power plant fire on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are starting to be outraged by prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such regional issues will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my forecasts, I wrote that Russia will break up into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have tendencies towards peaceful resolution of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are inclined to halt significant military aggression in Ukraine due to their need for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">At most, this will be delayed until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">Czech Republic discusses possible cessation of gas supply.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very significant blow, as the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did this affect Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Since I'm an analyst, I foresaw this.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My homeland will not suffer from the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there are a huge number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the price increase.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens won't feel this for the first few months, but undoubtedly the prices for all resources will start to rise.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Now they are looking for various ways to certain alternative sources.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very large port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">Regarding oil, we have a clear factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Now, the buyout of gas stations in Poland will take place, actually, by Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international issues.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe were to refuse Russian energy carriers, it would mean the loss of a source of funding for Russia's military.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolboy understands, without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the ability to exist and will go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in Polish media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelensky gave an interview to Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What are the Polish media saying about this?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the President of Ukraine has significantly increased.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this growth is assessed as unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Volodymyr Zelensky thanks for the help, talks about real things happening nearby, he is in a city that is in a zone of military action.</seg>
          <seg id="165">That is, the actions of the president are evaluated as very active by politicians, analysts, and representatives of the authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They testify that the Ukrainian government is fully committed to receiving military and financial aid to support refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">The media discusses these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian government.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">You can't hear that here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, resilience, ability to fight the enemy has significantly increased.</seg>
          <seg id="171">He does not fade or fall.</seg>
          <seg id="172">This is the most important thing, meaning there are no image losses.</seg>
          <seg id="173">In fact, Ukraine's image is being maintained, and this is very important.</seg>

          <seg id="1">How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees - analysis from an expert</seg>
          <seg id="2">Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Approximately 500 thousand arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors - Poland and the Czech Republic - and will tirelessly thank you!</seg>
          <seg id="8">How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden, the ProUkrainu editorial board asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has offices not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How Poland is helping Ukrainians</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians, and this significantly affected the livelihoods of Czechs.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In labor governments, long queues, significant price increases in stores.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is happening in Poland, where millions of Ukrainian refugees are?</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This has been foreseen.</seg>
          <seg id="16">In Poland, they have been saying for the past months that there will be such a huge problem.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, they were less prepared for what was going to happen, while in Poland they were actively preparing.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the start of the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I heard that they were smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was very balanced: To prepare for all these events even before the start of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I note that extremely large funds were allocated from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing from bombing, from the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, assistance in logistics - movement through the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical ones, for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">These are planes that move between cities on the territory of Poland, as well as charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I had experience of cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as someone may think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The transport issue remains extremely important.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In Poland, the payment for travel for Ukrainians was canceled.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel for free on trains and public transport.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland has agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">That is, refugees have the opportunity to get to the places where they plan to stay for free.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local self-government bodies.</seg>
          <seg id="34">For the most part, these are closed school small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Free meals, free medical first aid are organized there.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, and Wroclaw became very active, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been created.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The example of Warsaw is generally unique in the sense that they managed to take away objects from the Russian Embassy that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large residential complexes stood in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone in there.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The Polish local authorities have nationalized it, let's say.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Taken away for the benefit of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.</seg>
          <seg id="43">There will be water, electricity, they are insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm adopted and the Senate approved the law on refugees from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to stay legally in Poland for 18 months.</seg>

          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medical assistance to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You just need to write an SMS, get the code on the phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, you can get medicine for free in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Various funds are distributed, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which give packages with food, chemicals, and clothes.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala."</seg>
          <seg id="56">That is, "an event that has no analogues."</seg>
          <seg id="57">Such a huge openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">For the Polish state, this is a huge expense.</seg>
          <seg id="59">To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely large blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">The language problem as well.</seg>
          <seg id="63">The questions begin with polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems, diseases.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem is schools, where students, especially in the upper grades, also do not understand themselves at all at the beginning, they cannot understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Children have the knowledge not only to speak English well, but in general their level is higher than the class they enter.</seg>
          <seg id="69">This is interesting, too.</seg>
          <seg id="70">That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important during employment.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine, it is much more difficult to master this job here.</seg>
          <seg id="74">A lawyer or an accountant, I do not know such cases at all.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors are now appearing in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small polyclinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.</seg>
          <seg id="77">The language problem is often the reason that prompts families to return home after a few weeks of staying here.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are a lot of such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military operations.</seg>
          <seg id="81">They did not settle down here, did not find work.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, it will be more convenient for them to return home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This is also one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, significant changes have occurred.</seg>
          <seg id="86">If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do the Poles feel about the millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">There is a similar situation in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here, all television channels often quote the statement of the President of Poland, Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When the events of Russia's attack on Georgia took place, together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will certainly not stop at Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then there may be the Baltic countries, it may reach Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">That is, if he had foreseen it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and the Poles appreciate this properly, that's why they open their homes, help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.</seg>
          <seg id="96">The threat is seen in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Therefore, the attitude has changed to positive.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem are now not a "song of nationalists" or some enemies in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are still small groups among the population who have not changed their views, they exist in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The claim about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who must be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">This is simply laughed at in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they have no political overtones.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those sections of society that still doubted some historical issues.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are the heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">When Poles begin to think that there may be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives in the way that is happening now in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">People from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities are constantly talked about here.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How Poland perceives Russia's threats</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia fears that it will strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How does the Polish government and society react?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">In fact, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent has increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Currently, additional recruitment to the Territorial Defense Forces is taking place in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="119">That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="120">It is tangible for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among this is the recently adopted new law on the defense of the homeland, where the budget has been significantly increased for Poland's military needs.</seg>
          <seg id="122">The requirements for the recruitment of the military have been changed, many points that are actually related to a possible military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a professional expert on future analytics.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions became a reality in Syria, you warned about Russia's attack.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What do you say about the analysis of the situation: When will Ukraine win and will the world manage to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for a nuclear strike, I don't believe much.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But there is such a scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and for Poland as well.</seg>
          <seg id="130">It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">I note, I wouldn't want that, but that's the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A blow of small power, but so that all television channels show this "fungus."</seg>
          <seg id="133">To be seen from Poland, the Baltic countries.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and a loss of combat capability of NATO troops.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, the problems of Putin's entourage, oligarchs who are currently suffering from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have the facts of the hydroelectric power plant catching fire on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are beginning to resent the prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have a tendency towards peaceful settlement of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">At the most, it will be delayed until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing the possible termination of gas supplies.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did this affect Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Since I am an analyst, I predicted this.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the increase in prices.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but the prices for all resources will definitely start to rise.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">Regarding oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Currently, gas stations in Poland will be bought out, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe refused Russian energy carriers, it would be the loss of a source of financing for the Russian Federation's army.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in the Polish media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What do the Polish media say about this?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the President of Ukraine has grown very much.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in the zone of military operations.</seg>
          <seg id="165">That is, the actions of the president are evaluated by politicians, analysts, and representatives of the authorities as very active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They testify that the Ukrainian authorities are aiming as much as possible to receive military and financial assistance in order to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity, which sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">You don't hear that here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, and the ability to fight the enemy has grown significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It does not fade or fall.</seg>
          <seg id="172">This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.</seg>
          <seg id="173">In fact, the image of Ukraine is holding up, and this is very important.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees - an analyst from an expert</seg>
          <seg id="2">Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the Presidents of these two countries.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Miloš Zeman.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken over the solution of many problems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">She provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Approximately 500,000 people arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget such strong support for their neighbors - Poland and the Czech Republic - and will tirelessly thank you!</seg>
          <seg id="8">As Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, the editorial office of ProUkrainu asked Yaroslav Kot - coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analytics, which has a representative office not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How Poland helps Ukrainians</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the life of the Czechs.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Labor governments have big queues, big price hikes in stores.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This was foreshadowed.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Poland has said in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, less prepared for what will happen, and in Poland actively prepared.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the border areas of Poland with Ukraine even before the war began, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be placed.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, they didn't even think that this could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I heard that they were smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was very balanced: to prepare even before the war began for all these events.</seg>
          <seg id="22">It should be noted that extremely large funds from regional and state budgets were allocated to help Ukrainians fleeing from bombings from the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, assistance in logistics - movement through the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">From Ukraine to Poland there are special trains, among them medical, for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">These are planes that travel through the territory of Poland between cities, also charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I had experience of cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is the largest like Lutsk, not a millionaire, as someone might think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The transport issue remains extremely important.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In Poland, the payment for travel for Ukrainians has been canceled.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel for free on trains and public transport.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland has agreed with German carriers that have organized free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">That is, refugees have the opportunity to get to the places where they plan to stay free of charge.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the residence of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.</seg>
          <seg id="34">For the most part, these are closed school small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.</seg>
          <seg id="35">There is organized free meals, free medical first aid.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The major cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian neighborhoods have now been created.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they have managed to take from the Embassy of the Russian Federation the objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large apartment complexes have stood in a derelict state for decades, but no one was allowed there by the Russians.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The Polish authorities nationalized it, let's say.</seg>
          <seg id="41">It was taken in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings, which can accommodate 200-300 families at once.</seg>
          <seg id="43">There will be water, electricity, they are insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Within a week or two refugees from Ukraine can already live there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm passed, and the Senate approved a law on fugitives from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to him, Ukrainian citizens have the right to stay legally in Poland for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical care.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free drug assistance to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You just need to write sms, get a code on the phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And in the conversion of 5 thousand hryvnia free to get the medicine in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance  is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Widespread various funds, including Caritas, Red Cross, which give packages with food, chemistry, clothing.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: Niespotykana skala.</seg>
          <seg id="56">That is, event, which has no analogues .</seg>
          <seg id="57">Such a huge openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">For the Polish state, this is a huge expense.</seg>
          <seg id="59">To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">The language is the problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">The questions start with polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot help themselves without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems, diseases.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem  schools where students, especially high school students, also do not give themselves advice at all at the beginning, cannot understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the appropriate class.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Children not only have a good command of English, but in general their level is higher than the class in which they enter.</seg>
          <seg id="69">It's interesting too.</seg>
          <seg id="70">That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And, in fact, children learn well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important during employment.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, an employee who worked in Ukraine as a doctor, accountant, lawyer, it is much more difficult to master this job.</seg>
          <seg id="74">As a lawyer or accountant, I don't know of any such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors are now appearing in certain locations, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">This is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.</seg>
          <seg id="77">The language problem is often the reason that prompts families, after a few weeks here, to head back home.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are so many such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military actions.</seg>
          <seg id="81">They didn't get comfortable here, they didn't find work.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, they are more comfortable to return home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This is also one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, there have been significant changes.</seg>
          <seg id="86">While Czech society used to consider Ukrainians exclusively as migrant workers, today it prides itself on the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">Poland has a similar situation.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here, all television channels often quote the statement of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When the events of Russia's attack on Georgia occurred, along with President Yushchenko and other state leaders, he was in Tbilisi.</seg>

          <seg id="92">Then there may be the Baltic States, and may come to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">That is, he would have predicted it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians now defend Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, help so selflessly Ukrainian refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="96">They see the threat in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Therefore, the attitude has changed to positive.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem, is now not a song of nationalists or any enemies in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are still small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they are in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think very differently about Ukrainians than before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians have consistently argued that Ukraine has nationalists who need to be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">This is perceived in Poland simply with laughter, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they have no political subtext.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact has affected the change of public opinion of those sections of society who still doubted any historical issues.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turns out that these doubts have not been confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">The Ukrainians are heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is now in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">People from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities are constantly being talked about here.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How Poland perceives Russia's threats</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for a worst-case scenario, as a terrible war continues.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously considering their own security.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia fears it will use nuclear weapons to punish Ukraine for its support.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How does Poland's government and society react?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent has increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Now in Poland there is an additional set of territorial defense troops.</seg>
          <seg id="119">That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="120">It is noticeable to citizens that the state is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among these and recently adopted a new law on the defense of the homeland, where the budget is significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="122">The requirements for the recruitment of military personnel have been changed, many points that are actually associated with a possible military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a specialist analyst of the future.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions became a reality in Syria, you warned about the Russian attack.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What will you say from the analysis of the situation: when Ukraine's victory and whether the world will be able to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for the nuclear strike, I don't believe much.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But there is such a scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative of NATO countries, and so should Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="130">It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">I wouldn't want that, mind you, but it's a worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">The impact of a small power, but that all television channels showed this hrybok.</seg>
          <seg id="133">It was seen from Poland, the Baltic States.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are related to the exhaustion of the physical and financial Russian troops, the problems of Putin's environment, oligarchs, who are now suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have the facts of the burning of hydroelectric power plants in Sakhalin, some evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such problems of a regional nature will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would collapse into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have tendencies of peaceful settlement of war.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, in particular Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine due to their needs for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">It will be delayed to the maximum until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing the possible cessation of gas supply.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did this affect Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Because I'm an analyst, I predicted it.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just shut off the gas in my house beforehand.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there are a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will experience rising prices.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely the prices for all resources will start to rise.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, we already have several companies that bring liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">As for oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Now there will be a purchase of gas stations in Poland, in fact, Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe were to give up Russian energy, it would be a loss of the source of Russian funding for its troops.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in Polish media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelensky gave an interview to the Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What does the Polish media say about this?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased very much.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this growth is estimated to be unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about the real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in a zone of military action.</seg>
          <seg id="165">That is, the actions of the president are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They say that the Ukrainian authorities are aiming as much as possible to obtain military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">In the media, these topics are discussed in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity that sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">You don't hear that here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, the ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It does not fade and does not fall.</seg>
          <seg id="172">This is the most important thing, that is, there is no image loss.</seg>
          <seg id="173">In fact, the image of Ukraine is maintained, and this is very important.</seg>

          <seg id="1">How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed and why the EU is not paying for refugees  Expert analyst</seg>
          <seg id="2">Poland and the Czech Republic are not receiving EU refugee aid - this is the most discussed topic in the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Miloš Zeman.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The Czech President noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It has provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="6">About 500,000 of them arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors  Poland and the Czech Republic  and will be tirelessly grateful!</seg>
          <seg id="8">As Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial strain, ProUkraina asked Jaroslaw Kota, the coordinator and translator of the Refugee Center in Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analytics, which has representation not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How Poland Helps Ukrainians</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this had a significant impact on the life of the Czechs.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There are long lines at the labor government, and there are big price increases at the store.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is happening in Poland, where millions of Ukrainian refugees are living?</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Polish government was exceptionally quick to organize and provide assistance when hostilities broke out.</seg>
          <seg id="15">It was predicted.</seg>
          <seg id="16">In Poland, they've been saying for the last few months that there's going to be this huge problem.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, there was less preparation for what was going to happen, and in Poland, there was a lot of preparation.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the war began, there were already certain plans to accommodate refugees from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, they didn't even think that this could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I heard them laughing about Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was very deliberate to prepare for all these events before the war started.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I will note that there has been an enormous amount of money from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing bombing by the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, help with logistics  moving around the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">From Ukraine to Poland there are special trains, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">These are planes that fly across the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I had experience of working on such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, it is not a millionaire as one might think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Transportation remains a major issue.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In Poland, the payment for travel for Ukrainians has been canceled.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel free on trains and public transport.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland had agreements with German carriers, who arranged free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">This means that refugees are able to travel free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Mostly these are closed school small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.</seg>
          <seg id="35">There's free food, free medical first aid.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees are given a place to rest and stay for a few days, and on the spot they are given opportunities to move to more comfortable accommodations.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The big cities of Warsaw, Gdańsk, Wroclaw, where whole Ukrainian quarters have now been created, have become very active.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The Warsaw case is unique in the sense that they managed to take objects from the Russian Embassy that were abandoned by the residents of the embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large housing complexes had been abandoned for decades, but the Russians would not let anyone in.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The Polish local government nationalized it, so to speak.</seg>
          <seg id="41">It's for Ukrainians, and Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200 to 300 families at a time.</seg>
          <seg id="43">They'll have water, electricity, they'll be insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine could be living there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland made a unique move  The Sejm passed, and the Senate approved the law on refugees from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legal stay in Poland for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is compulsory in all EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical care.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private foundation that has provided ten million zlotys for free medical aid to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">All you have to do is text, get the code to your phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And for 5,000 hryvnia, you can get free medicine in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance  is three hundred zlotys, which is provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">There are various foundations, including Caritas, the Red Cross, that give out food packages, chemicals, clothing.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala" - the scale of the earth.</seg>
          <seg id="56">It is an "event without precedent".</seg>
          <seg id="57">It's such a huge opening.</seg>
          <seg id="58">This is a huge expense for the Polish state.</seg>
          <seg id="59">The European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland to date.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, it's an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">The language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Questions start from the clinics where Ukrainians can't help themselves without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems, illnesses.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem is that in school, especially in the upper grades, students are also at first very confused, they can't understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I notice that Ukrainian children often come with a much higher level of knowledge than their class.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">The children have knowledge not only of good English, but also of a general level higher than the class they are in.</seg>
          <seg id="69">That's interesting too.</seg>
          <seg id="70">So the Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And, in fact, children do well in Ukraine, if they are valued so highly.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important in the workplace.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine, has a much harder time mastering this job here.</seg>
          <seg id="74">I'm not a lawyer or an accountant. I don't know any of those cases.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors are now appearing in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">It's a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors are able to accept the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.</seg>
          <seg id="77">Language problems are often the reason why families return home after a few weeks here.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are many such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled the wars in the first few weeks, and now they're coming back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are the Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there is no such active military action.</seg>
          <seg id="81">They didn't get the hang of it, they didn't get the job.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, conditions do not meet their needs and they are more comfortable returning home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This is another one of those problems that has been going on for the last few weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How Attitudes Toward Ukrainians Have Changed</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, there have been significant changes.</seg>
          <seg id="86">If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively as labor migrants, now it is proud of the steadfastness of Ukrainians who defend their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles feel about the millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">Poland has a similar situation.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here all the TV channels often quote the words of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When the events of the Russian attack on Georgia took place, together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then there could be the Baltic states, it could go to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">I mean, he would have seen it coming.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and the Poles appreciate it, so they open their homes, they help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.</seg>
          <seg id="96">The threat is seen in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also be knocking on our door.</seg>
          <seg id="98">So the attitude changed to a positive one.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem is now in Poland not a "song of nationalists" or some enemies.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are small groups of people who have not changed their views, and they exist in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But fortunately, most citizens in society now think about Ukrainians very differently than before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The claim about Ukrainian nationalists is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">This is just laughed at in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they have no political undertones.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this is probably quite remarkable, because this direct contact has had the effect of changing the public opinion of those sections of society that were still skeptical about some historical questions.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turned out that those doubts were not confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">When Poles start thinking that there may be a war, they immediately begin to realize that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is happening in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">People from Mariupol, Butch and other Ukrainian cities are constantly mentioned here.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How Poland Views the Russian Threat</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but prepares for the worst, because there is a terrible war.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are taking their own security seriously.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia is afraid of using nuclear weapons to punish Ukraine for its support.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How are the Polish government and society reacting?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">In fact, Poland does, it has very good relations with the United States, other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent has increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">There is a recruitment process in Poland for the Territorial Defense Forces.</seg>
          <seg id="119">So this is how preparation for various war scenarios happens.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Citizens sense that the government is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among these is the recently passed new law on the defense of the homeland, where the budget has been significantly increased for Poland's military needs.</seg>
          <seg id="122">There's been a change in recruitment requirements, a lot of it actually related to the potential military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a specialist in future analysis.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions have come true in Syria, you warned of a Russian attack.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What do you think about the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for the nuclear strike, I'm not so sure.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But there is a scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more visible to NATO countries, and Poland as well.</seg>
          <seg id="130">It could take place, according to various estimates, in the territory of the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">I mean, I don't want to do this, but it's the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A small blow, but I want all the TV channels to show this mushroom.</seg>
          <seg id="133">I want him to be seen in Poland, the Baltic states.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that there will be a flight and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, problems surrounding Putin, oligarchs who are currently suffering from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have the facts of the Sakhalin HPP fire, some evidence that people are starting to be outraged by the price.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have a tendency to settle wars peacefully.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, notably Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop substantial military aggression in Ukraine because of their need for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">At most, it will last until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to Live Without Russian Gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing a possible gas supply cut.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very significant blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did this affect the Polish people?</seg>
          <seg id="147">As an analyst, I've seen this coming.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there are a very large number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the price increase.</seg>
          <seg id="151">The citizens won't feel it for the first few months, but the prices of all resources will definitely start to go up.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Now they're looking for different ways to get to certain alternative sources.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, we already have several companies that are transporting liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very large port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">On the oil front, we have the bright factor that the Hungarian prime minister is actually working with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">They're going to buy out gas stations in Poland, actually, by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international issues.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe were to abandon Russian energy carriers, it would be a loss of a source of funding for the Russian military.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolboy understands that without selling oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the ability to exist and go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in Polish media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelensky gave an interview to the Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What is the Polish media saying about this?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The President of Ukraine's rating has risen very much.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this increase is being estimated as unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Vladimir Zelensky thanks for the help, talks about the real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city in the war zone.</seg>
          <seg id="165">So the president's actions are judged by politicians and analysts and officials as very active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They show that the Ukrainian authorities are very focused on getting military and financial aid to provide for the refugees who are leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">The media discusses these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity that sometimes happens in Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">You can't hear it here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And I think that's very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, resilience, ability to fight the enemy has grown very much.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It does not fade or fall.</seg>
          <seg id="172">That's the most important thing, so there's no image loss.</seg>
          <seg id="173">In fact, Ukraine's image is holding up, and that's very important.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU  is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Miloš Zeman.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It has provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="6">About 500,000 arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support of their neighbors  Poland and the Czech Republic  and will be thankful tirelessly!</seg>
          <seg id="8">As Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, ProUkraina asked Yaroslav Kotha  coordinator and translator of the Refugee Center in Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analysis, which has representation not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How Poland Helps Ukrainians</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this had a significant impact on the life of Czechs.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There are long lines at the Labour Governments, substantial price increases in the shops.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is happening in Poland, where millions of Ukrainian refugees are?</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Polish government was exceptionally quick to organize and provide aid when hostilities broke out.</seg>
          <seg id="15">It was predicted.</seg>
          <seg id="16">In Poland, they've said over the last few months that this is going to be a huge problem.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, there was less preparation for what would happen, and in Poland, there was a lot of preparation.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the war, there were already plans to place refugees from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, they didn't even think that this could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I heard them laughing about Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was very sensible to prepare before the war started for all these events.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I will note that an extraordinary amount of money has been allocated from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing from bombing by the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, help with the logistics of  moving through the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">From Ukraine to Poland there are special trains, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">It includes planes flying through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I had experience of working with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Luzhkov, not a millionaire as one might think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Transport remains an important issue.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In Poland, the toll for Ukrainians has been removed.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel free on trains and public transport.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers, who arranged free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">This means that refugees have free access to the places where they plan to stay.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the housing of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Most are indoor school small stadiums, complexes that accommodate temporary halls with beds.</seg>
          <seg id="35">There's free food, free medical first aid.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees are given an opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and on the spot they are given opportunities to move to something more comfortable.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw, where now whole Ukrainian quarters have been created, became very active.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The case of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they managed to get from the Russian Embassy objects that were abandoned by the inhabitants of this embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large housing complexes had been abandoned for decades, but the Russians wouldn't let anyone in.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The local Polish government nationalized it, so to speak.</seg>
          <seg id="41">For the benefit of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200 to 300 families at a time.</seg>
          <seg id="43">There'll be water, electricity, they'll be insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Ukrainian refugees could be living there in a week or two.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step  The Sejm adopted and the Senate approved the law on the refugees from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is compulsory in all EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical care.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medical assistance to the Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">All you have to do is text, get the code on your phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And the 5 thousand hryvnia to get free medicine in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance  is three hundred zlotys, which is given irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Various foundations are widespread, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which donate packages of food, chemicals, clothing.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles would say: "Niespotykana skala".</seg>
          <seg id="56">This is an "unprecedented event".</seg>
          <seg id="57">There's a huge openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">This is a huge expense for the Polish state.</seg>
          <seg id="59">To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">The language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">The questions begin in the medical clinics, where Ukrainians cannot help themselves without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems, diseases.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem is school, where students, especially in the upper grades, don't really get along at first either. They can't understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I noticed that Ukrainian children often come with a much higher level of knowledge than their respective classes.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">And the students not only have good knowledge of English, but they also have a higher level than the class they're in.</seg>
          <seg id="69">That's interesting too.</seg>
          <seg id="70">So the Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And actually, kids do study well in Ukraine, if they are valued so highly.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important in employment.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, an employee that worked as a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer in Ukraine is much more difficult to master here.</seg>
          <seg id="74">A lawyer or an accountant, I don't know any of those cases.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors are now appearing in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">It is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors are able to accept the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.</seg>
          <seg id="77">The language problem is often the reason why families return home after a few weeks here.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are many such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks, we've had a whole wave of refugees, who fled during the first few weeks of the war, now they're going back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there is no such active military action.</seg>
          <seg id="81">They didn't fit in, they couldn't get a job.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, conditions do not meet their needs and accordingly, it's more convenient for them to return home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This also is one of the problems that has arisen in the last few weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How Attitudes to Ukrainians Have Changed</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, there has been a significant change.</seg>
          <seg id="86">If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians to be exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the steadfastness of Ukrainians defending their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles feel about the millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">Poland has a similar situation.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here, all television channels often quote the words of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When the events of the Russian attack on Georgia, together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There, he made a seminal statement that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then it could be Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then there might be the Baltic countries, it might even go to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">I mean, if he could have seen it coming.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians today are defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, helping so selflessly with Ukrainian refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="96">The threat in Poland is seen.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases, there is a certain fear that war might also come knocking on our door.</seg>
          <seg id="98">So the attitude has changed for the better.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem is now in Poland not "a song of nationalists" or some enemies.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are small groups of the population that have not changed their opinions, they are in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think about Ukrainians very differently than they used to.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The claim about Ukrainian nationalists is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">This is simply laughed at in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people with no political overtone.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this must have been quite striking, because this direct contact was influential on changing the public opinion of those sections of society that were still undecided in some of their historical questions.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">When the Poles begin to think that there can be a war, they immediately begin to realize that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as is happening now in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">They keep talking about people from Mariupol, Butch and other Ukrainian cities.</seg>
          <seg id="110">Poland's Response to the Russian Threat</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine is confident of victory, but is preparing for the worst because a terrible war is going on.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are taking their own security seriously.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia is afraid that it will use nuclear weapons in retaliation for its support for Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How is the Polish government and society reacting?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">In fact, Poland does this, it has very good relations with the United States, with other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent has increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">There is an additional recruitment of the territorial defense forces in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="119">So this is how preparation for all sorts of war scenarios take place.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Citizens sense that the government is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among these, the recently passed new law on the defense of the motherland, where the budget has been significantly increased for Poland's military needs.</seg>
          <seg id="122">Changed recruitment requirements, a lot of things that are actually related to the potential military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a specialist in analyzing the future.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions came true in Syria, you warned of a Russian attack.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What about the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for the nuclear strike, I'm not so sure.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But there is a scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more visible to NATO countries, and to Poland as well.</seg>
          <seg id="130">It could be, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">I mean, I don't like this, but this is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A small strike, but I want all TV channels to show this mushroom.</seg>
          <seg id="133">To be seen from Poland, the Baltic States.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that there will be a desertion and a loss of combat capability of the NATO troops.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian forces, the problems with Putin's entourage, oligarchs who are now very suffering from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We do have the facts of the fires on Sakhalin, some evidence that people are starting to resent prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have a tendency to settle wars peacefully.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, especially Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop substantial military aggression in Ukraine because of their need for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">At most, this will last until the end of the year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to Live Without Russian Gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing a possible gas supply cut.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very significant blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did this affect the Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">As an analyst, I predicted that.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there are a very large number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the price increases.</seg>
          <seg id="151">The citizens won't feel it for the first few months, but all the prices of all the resources will start to go up definitely.</seg>
          <seg id="152">They're now searching for different routes to certain alternative sources.</seg>
          <seg id="153">Besides, we already have companies that ship liquefied gas to Poland, there's a very large port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">As for oil, we have the bright side that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually working with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Now they're going to buy the gas stations in Poland, actually by Hungarian companies that will exploit the Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">Those are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international issues.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe were to abandon Russian energy carriers, it would be a loss of the source of Russia's military funding.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a school kid understands that without selling oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the ability to exist and will go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>

          <seg id="166">They indicate that the Ukrainian authorities are very keen to get military and financial aid in order to secure the refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>

          <seg id="6">About 500 thousand people arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget such strong support of their neighbors – Poland and the Czech Republic – and will tirelessly thank!</seg>
          <seg id="8">How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, ProUkraїnu editorial office asked Jarosław Kot, coordinator and translator of the Centre for Refugees in Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analysis, which has offices not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How Poland helps Ukrainians</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the livelihoods of the Czechs.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There are long queues in labor governments, significant price increases in stores.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Polish government organized itself extremely quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This was foreseen.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Poland has been saying in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, there were fewer preparations for what would happen, while in Poland they were actively preparing.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the border regions of Poland and Ukraine, even before the start of the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be placed.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I heard people smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was very balanced: to prepare for all these events before the start of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I would like to note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing from the bombing from the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, assistance in logistics – movement through the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">These are planes moving through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I had experience of cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as some may think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The transport issue remains extremely important.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In Poland, abolished fare for Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel free of charge on trains and public transport.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland made an agreement with German carriers that organized free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">That is, refugees have the opportunity to get free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.</seg>
          <seg id="34">For the most part, these are closed small school stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Free meals, free medical first aid are organized there.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for several days, and already there on the spot they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been created.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they got the Russian embassy to take away objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large residential complexes stood in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not allow anyone there.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Polish local authorities nationalized this, so to speak.</seg>
          <seg id="41">It was taken in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Water, electricity will be supplied there, they are insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step – the Sejm passed, and the Senate approved the law on fugitives from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical care.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free assistance for medicines to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You just need to write SMS, get the code on the phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias to receive medicines for free in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are irrevocably provided to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Various funds are distributed, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which give packages with food, chemistry, clothing.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".</seg>
          <seg id="56">That is, "an event that has no analogues."</seg>
          <seg id="57">Such a huge openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">For the Polish state, this is a huge expenditure.</seg>
          <seg id="59">To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">Language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">The questions start from clinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems, diseases.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem is schools, where students, especially high school students, also at the beginning do not cope at all, cannot understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Children not only have a good command of English, but in general their level is higher than the class they enter.</seg>
          <seg id="69">This is also interesting.</seg>
          <seg id="70">That is, Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine if they are valued so highly here.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important during employment.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine is much more difficult to master this job here.</seg>
          <seg id="74">As a lawyer or accountant, I don't know such cases at all.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors are now appearing in certain locations, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small polyclinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">This is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians legally.</seg>
          <seg id="77">The language problem is often the reason that prompts families to return home after a few weeks here.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are a lot of such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are Transcarpathia and western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active hostilities.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Here they did not get comfortable, did not find work.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, it is more convenient for them to return home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This is also one such problem that has arisen in recent weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How has the attitude towards Ukrainians changed?</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, significant changes have taken place.</seg>
          <seg id="86">If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">Poland has a similar situation.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here, all television channels often quote the statement of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When there were events of Russia's attack on Georgia, he was in Tbilisi with President Yushchenko and other heads of state.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression probably will not stop at Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then there may be the Baltic countries, maybe it can reach Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">That is, he would have foreseen it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.</seg>
          <seg id="96">They see a threat in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that the war may also knock on our door.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Therefore, the attitude has changed to positive.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag Ukrainian anthem is no longer a "song of nationalists" or any enemies in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they are in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think quite differently about Ukrainians than before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The claim about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians have consistently argued that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">This is perceived simply with laughter in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political overtones.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those segments of society that still doubted some historical issues.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">When the Poles begin to think that there could be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is now in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">There is constant talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How Poland perceives Russia's threats</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia fears that it will strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How does the Polish authorities and society react?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Actually, Poland is doing this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Currently, Poland is undergoing additional recruitment for territorial defense troops.</seg>
          <seg id="119">That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="120">It is tangible for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among this, a new law on the defense of the homeland was recently adopted, where the budget has been significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="122">The requirements for recruiting military personnel have been changed, many aspects that are actually related to a possible military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions have become reality in Syria, you have warned of a Russian attack.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What can you say from the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for a nuclear strike, I don't have much faith.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But there is such a scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well.</seg>
          <seg id="130">It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">I wouldn't want that, but it's the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A blow of low power, but for all television channels to show this "fungus".</seg>
          <seg id="133">To be seen from Poland, the Baltic countries.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are associated with the exhaustion of the physical and financial Russian army, the problems of Putin's environment, oligarchs who are now suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have facts of the fire of hydroelectric power plants on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such problems of a regional nature will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have tendencies of peaceful settlement of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">As much as possible, this will be delayed until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing a possible cessation of gas supply.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did this affect Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Since I am an analyst, I predicted this.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families who will feel the price increase.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely prices for all resources will begin to rise.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Now they are looking for different paths to certain alternative sources.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, we already have several companies that carry liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">As for oil, we have a striking factor that the Hungarian Prime Minister is actually cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Now there will be a buyout of gas stations in Poland, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe abandoned Russian energy, it would be a loss of Russia's source of financing for its army.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolboy understands that without selling oil and gas, Russia will simply lose its ability to exist and go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in Polish media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What is told about this in the Polish media?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things happening nearby, he is in a city in the war zone.</seg>
          <seg id="165">That is, the actions of the president are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They indicate that Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused to receive military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in the Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">You can't hear it here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, endurance, ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It does not fade or fall.</seg>
          <seg id="172">This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.</seg>
          <seg id="173">In fact, the image of Ukraine holds, and this is very important.</seg>

          <seg id="21">But it was very well thought out: to prepare for all these events even before the start of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I would like to note that extremely large funds were allocated from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombings and the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, help in logistics - movement on the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains for the wounded and sick.</seg>

          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as some might think.</seg>

          <seg id="30">They can ride trains and public transport for free.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">That is, refugees have the opportunity to travel for free to the places where they plan to stay.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local self-government bodies.</seg>
          <seg id="34">For the most part, these are closed small school stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Free food and free medical first aid are organized there.</seg>

          <seg id="43">Water and electricity will be supplied there, they are insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm adopted and the Senate approved the law on refugees from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to stay legally in Poland for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical care.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private fund that allocated ten million zlotys for free medical assistance to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You only need to write an SMS and get the code on your phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, you can get medicine for free in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which is irrevocably provided to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">There are various funds, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which provide packages with food, chemicals, and clothes.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".</seg>
          <seg id="56">That is, "an event that has no analogues."</seg>
          <seg id="57">Such a huge openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">For the Polish state, these are huge expenses.</seg>
          <seg id="59">To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely large blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">Language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Questions start with polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot help themselves without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems, diseases.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem is schools, where students, especially in the upper grades, are also at a loss at the beginning, unable to understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">The children have the knowledge not only to speak English well, but in general their level is higher than the class they enter.</seg>
          <seg id="69">This is also interesting.</seg>
          <seg id="70">That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important during employment.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, or lawyer in Ukraine, it is much more difficult to master this job here.</seg>
          <seg id="74">As a lawyer or an accountant, I do not know such cases at all.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors now appear in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small polyclinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">This is a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on a legal basis.</seg>
          <seg id="77">The language problem is often the reason that prompts families to return home after a few weeks of being here.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are many such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks we have had a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are coming back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military operations.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Here they did not get used to it, did not find a job.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, it will be more convenient for them to return home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This is also one of such problems that has arisen in recent weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the ambassador of Ukraine, significant changes have taken place in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="86">If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively migrant workers, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles feel about millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">There is a similar situation in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here, all television channels often quote the statement of the President of Poland, Lech Kaczyński, who died tragically in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When the events of Russia's attack on Georgia took place, he was in Tbilisi together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There he said the famous phrase that Russian aggression will certainly not stop at Georgia, and Ukraine may come next.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then there may be the Baltic countries, it may even reach Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">That is, if he had foreseen it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians are currently protecting Poland with their blood, their loyalty, and their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and the Poles appreciate it properly, that is why they open their homes and help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.</seg>
          <seg id="96">The threat is seen in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Therefore, the attitude changed to a positive one.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag and the Ukrainian national anthem are now not the "song of nationalists" or some enemies in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are still small groups among the population who have not changed their views, they exist in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who must be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">In Poland, this is simply accepted with a laugh, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political undertones.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change of public opinion of those strata of society that still had doubts about some historical issues.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">When the Poles start to think that there might be a war, they immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives in the way that is happening now in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">People from Mariupol, Buchi and other Ukrainian cities are constantly being talked about here.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How Poland perceives Russia's threats</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia threatens to strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How are the Polish authorities and society reacting?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the USA and other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent has increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Currently, Poland is undergoing additional recruitment into the Territorial Defense Forces.</seg>
          <seg id="119">That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Citizens feel that the state is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among them is the recently adopted new law on the defense of the homeland, where the budget has been significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="122">The requirements for the recruitment of the military have been changed, many points that are actually related to a possible military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions became a reality in Syria, you warned of an attack by Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What do you say about the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world manage to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for a nuclear strike, I don't have much faith.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But there is such a scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and for Poland as well.</seg>
          <seg id="130">It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">Note, I wouldn't want that, but it's the worst case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A blow of low power, but all television channels would show this "mushroom".</seg>
          <seg id="133">To see it from Poland, the Baltic countries.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that NATO troops will flee and lose their combat capability.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, the problems of Putin's entourage, the oligarchs who are currently suffering from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have the facts of the hydroelectric power station catching fire on Sakhalin, some evidence that people are beginning to resent the prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia will break up into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have tendencies towards peaceful settlement of war.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various countries of the European Union, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">It will be delayed until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing the possible termination of gas supply.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did it affect Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Since I am an analyst, I predicted this.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there is a very large number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the increase in prices.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but the prices for all resources will definitely start to rise.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Various routes to certain alternative sources are now being sought.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very large port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">Regarding oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Currently, gas stations in Poland will be bought out by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe were to abandon Russian energy carriers, it would be the loss of a source of funding for the Russian Federation's military.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in the Polish media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Polish mass media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What do the Polish media say about it?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased greatly.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in the zone of military operations.</seg>
          <seg id="165">That is, the actions of the president are evaluated by politicians, analysts, and representatives of the authorities as very active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They testify that the Ukrainian authorities are aiming as much as possible to receive military and financial aid in order to provide for the refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">These topics are discussed in the mass media in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity, which sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">This is not heard here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, ability to fight the enemy has grown significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It does not fade or fall.</seg>
          <seg id="172">This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.</seg>
          <seg id="173">In fact, the image of Ukraine is holding up, and this is very important.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees-expert analysis</seg>
          <seg id="2">Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive refugee assistance from the EU – this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The Czech president noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="6">About 500 thousand people arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors-Poland and the Czech Republic – and will thank you tirelessly!</seg>
          <seg id="8">The editors of Proukrainu asked Jaroslaw Kot, coordinator and translator of the refugee center in Lublin, how Poland is experiencing the unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute for global and regional Analytics, which has a representative office not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How Poland helps Ukrainians</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic received up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the life of the Czechs.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Labor governments have long queues, significant price increases in stores.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began providing assistance when hostilities broke out.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This was predicted.</seg>
          <seg id="16">In Poland, they have said in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, they prepared less for what would happen, while in Poland they actively prepared.</seg>
          <seg id="18">So, for example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the war began, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be placed.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, they didn't even think that this could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I heard that they smiled at Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was very balanced: to prepare for all these events before the war began.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombing from the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, assistance in logistics – movement on the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">These are planes that move between cities in Poland, as well as charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I have had experience working with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not millionik, as some might think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The transport issue remains extremely important.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In Poland, travel fees for Ukrainians have been canceled.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel for free on trains and public transport.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers that organized free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">In other words, refugees have the opportunity to travel free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.</seg>
          <seg id="34">For the most part, these are closed School small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Free meals and free medical first aid are organized there.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there on the spot they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The big cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, and Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian neighborhoods have now been created.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The example of Warsaw is generally unique in the sense that they got the Russian embassy to take away objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large residential complexes have been in a neglected state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone in there.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The Polish local authorities nationalized it, let's just say.</seg>
          <seg id="41">I took it in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Water and electricity will be supplied there, and they will be insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step – the Sejm adopted and the Senate approved a law on fugitives from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical care.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medical assistance to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You just need to write a text message and get the code to your phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias to get medicines for free in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Various funds are distributed, including Caritas, the Red Cross, which give packages with food, chemicals, and clothing.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".</seg>
          <seg id="56">That is,"an event that has no analogues".</seg>
          <seg id="57">Such a huge openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">This is a huge expense for the Polish state.</seg>
          <seg id="59">The European Union has not yet allocated a single euro to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">Language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Questions start from polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems and illnesses.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem is that schools where students, especially high school students, also do not give themselves any advice at all at the beginning, they cannot understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I note that Ukrainian children often come with a much higher level of knowledge than in the corresponding class.</seg>

          <seg id="83">This is also one of these problems that has been emerging in recent weeks.</seg>

          <seg id="85">According to the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, significant changes have taken place.</seg>
          <seg id="86">If earlier the Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles feel about millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">Poland has a similar situation.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here, all TV channels often quote the statement of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When there were events of the Russian attack on Georgia, together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then maybe Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then there may be the Baltic states, and it may reach Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">That is, if he had foreseen it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their loyalty, and their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and poles appreciate this, which is why they open their homes and help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.</seg>
          <seg id="96">They see the threat in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is a member of NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also come knocking on our doors.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Therefore, the attitude has changed to a positive one.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian national anthem is no longer a “song of nationalists” or any enemies in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are still small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they exist in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But, fortunately, most citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The statement about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">This is perceived simply with laughter in Poland, because these so-called “nationalists” turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political overtones.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in the public opinion of those segments of society who still doubted some historical issues.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as much as is happening now in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">Here they constantly talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How does Poland perceive Russia's threats</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst-case scenario, because there is a terrible war going on.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia fears that it will strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How does the Polish government and society react?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent has increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Currently, additional recruitment to the Territorial Defense Forces is taking place in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="119">In other words, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="120">It is noticeable for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among this is the recently adopted new law on defense of the Fatherland, where the budget is significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="122">The requirements for recruiting military personnel have been changed, and there are many issues that are actually related to a possible military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions have become a reality in Syria, and you warned about a Russian attack.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What do you say from the analysis of the situation: when Will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for a nuclear strike, I don't really believe it.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But there is such a scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well.</seg>
          <seg id="130">It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">I'll note that I wouldn't want to, but this is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A low-power strike, but so that all TV channels show this “fungus”.</seg>
          <seg id="133">To be seen from Poland and the Baltic states.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are associated with the exhaustion of the physical and financial Russian army, the problems of Putin's entourage, oligarchs who are now suffering greatly from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have the facts of the fire of a hydroelectric power station on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia will break up into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have tendencies to settle the war peacefully.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, in particular Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">This will be delayed as much as possible until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing a possible termination of gas supply.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very significant blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia has completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did this affect Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Since I'm an analyst, I predicted this.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there are a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the price increase.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely prices for all resources will start to rise up.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, there are already several companies that carry liquefied gas to Poland, and there is a very huge port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">As for oil, we have a striking factor that the Hungarian Prime Minister is actually cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Currently, there will be a purchase of gas stations in Poland, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very painful topics that relate to geopolitical and international problems.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe abandoned Russian energy sources, it would be the loss of the Russian Federation's source of funding for its troops.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in Polish media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Vladimir Zelensky gave an interview to the Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What do the Polish media say about this?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the president of Ukraine has grown very much.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Vladimir Zelensky thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city that is in a war zone.</seg>
          <seg id="165">In other words, the president's actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They show that the Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused on receiving military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity that sometimes happens in the Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">You can't hear it here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, endurance, and the ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It doesn't fade or fall off.</seg>
          <seg id="172">This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.</seg>
          <seg id="173">In fact, the image of Ukraine holds up, and this is very important.</seg>

          <seg id="1">How attitudes toward Ukrainians have changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees - expert analysis</seg>
          <seg id="2">Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive refugee aid from the EU - this is the most discussed topic at meetings between the presidents of these two countries.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The Czech President noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on many problems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It has provided asylum to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Approximately 500 thousand people arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors, Poland and the Czech Republic, and will be tirelessly grateful!</seg>
          <seg id="8">ProUkraine asked Jaroslaw Kot, coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin, how Poland is coping with the unexpected wave of refugees and the financial burden.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has offices not only in Poland but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How Poland helps Ukrainians</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic has hosted up to half a million Ukrainians, and this has had a significant impact on the life of the Czechs.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There are long lines at labor offices and significant price increases in stores.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Polish government organized exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when the hostilities began.</seg>
          <seg id="15">It was foreseen.</seg>
          <seg id="16">People in Poland have been saying for months that there would be such a huge problem.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, they were less prepared for what was going to happen, while in Poland they were actively preparing.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the war began, there were already certain plans for where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I heard that they laughed about Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was a very deliberate thing to do: to prepare for all these events before the war began.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I would like to note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombing and the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, assistance in logistics - transportation on the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">These are airplanes that travel between cities in Poland, as well as charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I have had experience with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania, and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, it is not a million-plus city, as some may think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The transportation issue remains extremely important.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Poland abolishes tolls for Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel for free on trains and public transportation.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland has agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">That is, refugees have the opportunity to travel free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Mostly these are closed school stadiums, small stadiums, and complexes where temporary halls with beds are set up.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Free meals and free medical first aid are organized there.</seg>
          <seg id="36">The refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for a few days, and already there they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The major cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, and Wroclaw have become very active, with entire Ukrainian neighborhoods now established.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The example of Warsaw is unique in the sense that they managed to get the Russian Embassy to take back the facilities that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large residential complexes had been in a state of disrepair for decades, but the Russians would not let anyone in.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The Polish local authorities nationalized it, so to speak.</seg>
          <seg id="41">I took it in favor of Ukrainians, and Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Water and electricity will be supplied there, and they will be insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine may already be living there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step - the Sejm passed and the Senate approved a law on fugitives from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to the law, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical care.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private foundation that has allocated ten million zlotys for free medicines to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You just need to write an SMS and get a code on your phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And in the amount of 5 thousand hryvnias, you can get medicines in Poland for free.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which is granted irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Various foundations are widespread, including Caritas and the Red Cross, which provide packages of food, chemicals, and clothing.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala".</seg>
          <seg id="56">That is, "an event that has no analogues."</seg>
          <seg id="57">There is such a huge openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">This is a huge expense for the Polish state.</seg>
          <seg id="59">The European Union has not yet allocated a single euro to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">The language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">The issues start with polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems and illnesses.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem is schools, where students, especially in high school, are also at a loss at first, unable to understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I would note that Ukrainian children often arrive with a level of knowledge much higher than that of their respective grade.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Not only do the children have a good command of English, but their overall level is higher than the grade they are in.</seg>
          <seg id="69">This is also interesting.</seg>
          <seg id="70">That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine if they are rated so highly here.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important when applying for a job.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, for an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, or lawyer in Ukraine, it is much more difficult to master this job here.</seg>
          <seg id="74">As a lawyer or accountant, I don't know of any such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors are now appearing in certain locations, in particular in Lublin, and the company has set up its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to treat the same Ukrainians legally.</seg>
          <seg id="77">The language problem is often the reason why families return home after a few weeks of staying here.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are many such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks, we have had a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, and now they are coming back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active hostilities.</seg>
          <seg id="81">They did not settle down here, did not find work.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, the conditions do not meet their needs, and therefore they would prefer to return home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This is also one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How attitudes toward Ukrainians have changed</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, there have been significant changes.</seg>
          <seg id="86">Whereas earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians to be exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles feel about millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">Poland has a similar situation.</seg>

          <seg id="90">When Russia attacked Georgia, he was in Tbilisi together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state.</seg>
          <seg id="91">He said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop with Georgia, and then maybe Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then there may be the Baltic states, and it may even reach Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">That is, he seemed to foresee it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, and their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes and help Ukrainian refugees so unselfishly.</seg>
          <seg id="96">Poland sees the threat.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is a member of NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.</seg>

          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst-case scenario, as a terrible war continues.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously considering their own security.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How are the Polish authorities and society reacting?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Actually, Poland is doing this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.</seg>

          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for a nuclear strike, I don't really believe it.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But such a scenario exists.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative of NATO countries, including Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="130">According to various estimates, it could take place in the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">I would not like this to happen, but it is the worst case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A low-powered strike, but one that all TV channels would show this "fungus".</seg>
          <seg id="133">To be seen in Poland and the Baltic States.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that NATO troops will escape and lose their combat capability.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are associated with the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, problems of Putin's entourage, oligarchs who are now suffering from financial problems, and various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have the facts of the Sakhalin hydroelectric power plant fire, and some evidence that people are beginning to resent the prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my forecasts, I wrote that Russia would split into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">There are also trends toward a peaceful resolution of the war.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, such as Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop a significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their need for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">At most, it will take until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing a possible suspension of gas supplies.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very significant blow because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did this affect Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Since I am an analyst, I foresaw this.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I simply turned off the gas in my house in advance.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there are a very large number, millions of Polish families who will feel the price increase.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens won't feel it for the first few months, but prices for all resources will definitely start to rise.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Now they are looking for different ways to certain alternative sources.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, and there is a very huge port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">Regarding oil, we have a striking factor that the Hungarian prime minister is actually cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Currently, gas stations in Poland are being bought out by Hungarian companies that will use Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very sensitive topics that touch on geopolitical and international issues.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe refused to buy Russian energy, it would be a loss of a source of funding for Russia's military.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolchild understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose its ability to exist and go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in the Polish media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What do the Polish media say about this?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the President of Ukraine has increased dramatically.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this growth is considered unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about the real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city in the war zone.</seg>
          <seg id="165">In other words, the president's actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They show that the Ukrainian authorities are maximizing their efforts to obtain military and financial assistance to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">The media discusses these topics in a very positive context in relation to the Ukrainian government.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in the Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">You don't hear that here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my opinion, this is very good, because Ukraine's image in terms of heroism, endurance, and ability to fight the enemy has grown significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It does not fade or fall.</seg>
          <seg id="172">That's the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.</seg>
          <seg id="173">In fact, Ukraine's image is holding up, and this is very important.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees — the analyst from the expert</seg>
          <seg id="2">Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU — this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Miloš Zeman.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">She provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="6">About 500 thousand arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget such strong support from their neighbors — Poland and the Czech Republic — and will thank you tirelessly!</seg>
          <seg id="8">How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, the editors of ProUkraineNU asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Refugee Centre in Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has offices not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How Poland helps Ukrainians</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the life of the Czechs.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There are long queues in labor governments, a significant increase in prices in stores.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.</seg>
          <seg id="15">It was foreseen.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Poland has said in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, they were less prepared for what would happen, and in Poland they were actively preparing.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine before the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I heard that they smiled about Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was very balanced: to prepare even before the beginning of the war for all these events.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing from the bombing, from the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, assistance in logistics — movement through the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">From Ukraine to Poland there are special trains, including medical ones, for the wounded and sick.</seg>
          <seg id="25">These are airplanes that move through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to the EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I have had experience working with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as anyone might think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The transport issue remains extremely important.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In Poland, the fare for Ukrainians has been canceled.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel free of charge on trains and public transport.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">That is, refugees have the opportunity to get free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the residence of refugees in facilities provided by local self-government bodies.</seg>
          <seg id="34">For the most part, these are closed school small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.</seg>
          <seg id="35">There is organized free meals, free medical first aid.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for several days, and already there on the spot they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw became very active, where now whole Ukrainian quarters have been created.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they managed to collect objects from the Embassy of the Russian Federation that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large residential complexes have been in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone there.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Polish local authorities nationalized this, let's say.</seg>
          <seg id="41">I took it in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings, which can accommodate 200-300 families at once.</seg>
          <seg id="43">There will be supplied water, electricity, they are insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step — the Sejm passed, and the Senate approved the law on fugitives from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical care.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free aid for medicines to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You just need to write an SMS, get a code on the phone.</seg>
          <seg id="52">And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, get free medicine in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Various funds are common, including Caritas, Red Cross, which give packages of food, chemistry, clothing.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: “Niespotykana skala”.</seg>
          <seg id="56">That is, “an event that has no analogues.”</seg>
          <seg id="57">Such a huge openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">For the Polish state, this is a huge expenditure.</seg>
          <seg id="59">The European Union has not yet allocated a single euro to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">Language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Questions start from polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot give advice without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems, diseases.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem is schools, where students of especially high school students also do not give themselves advice at all at all at all at all, cannot understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Children not only have a good command of English, but in general their level is higher than the class in which they fall.</seg>
          <seg id="69">This is also interesting.</seg>
          <seg id="70">That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important during employment.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine, here it is much more difficult to master this work.</seg>
          <seg id="74">As a lawyer or accountant, I do not know of such cases at all.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors now appear in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.</seg>
          <seg id="77">A language problem is often the reason that prompts families, after a few weeks of being here, to go back home.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are a lot of such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are returning.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military actions.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Here they did not get used to it, did not find work.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, conditions do not meet their needs and accordingly they will be more comfortable returning home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This is also one of these problems that has occurred in recent weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the Ambassador of Ukraine, significant changes have occurred in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="86">If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians defending their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">There is a similar situation in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here, all television channels often cite the statement of the President of Poland Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When there were events of Russia's attack on Georgia, along with President Yushchenko and other state leaders, he was in Tbilisi.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression certainly will not stop in Georgia, and then maybe Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then there can be the Baltic countries, it can reach Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="93">That is, if he had foreseen it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians now defend Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.</seg>
          <seg id="96">The threat is seen in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Therefore, the attitude has changed to the positive.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem now in Poland is not a “song of nationalists” or any enemies.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they are in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The claim about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians constantly insist that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">This in Poland is perceived simply with laughter, because these so-called “nationalists” turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political subtexts.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those segments of society that still doubted some historical issues.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is now in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">They constantly talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How Poland perceives Russia's threats</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously considering their own security.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia is afraid that it will hit with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How is Poland's government and society reacting?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Now in Poland there is an additional recruitment of territorial defense troops.</seg>
          <seg id="119">That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="120">It is tangible for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among this, a new law on the defense of the fatherland was recently adopted, where the budget has been significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="122">The requirements for recruitment of military personnel have been changed, many points that are actually related to a possible military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a professional expert in the analytics of the future.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions have become a reality in Syria, you warned of an attack by Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What can you say from the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for a nuclear strike, I don't believe much.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But there is such a scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well.</seg>
          <seg id="130">It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">Note, I would not want this, but this is the worst case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A blow of low power, but so that all television channels show this “fungus”.</seg>
          <seg id="133">To be seen from Poland, the Baltic States.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are related to the exhaustion of the physical and financial Russian troops, the problems of Putin's entourage, the oligarchs who are currently suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have facts of the fire of hydroelectric power station on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such problems of a regional nature will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have tendencies of peaceful settlement of war.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">This will last as much as possible until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing a possible termination of gas supply.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How did this affect Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Since I am an analyst, I predicted that.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will experience rising prices.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely prices for all resources will begin to rise up.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Different avenues to certain alternative sources are now being sought.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, we already have several companies that carry liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="154">As for oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Now there will be a purchase of gas stations in Poland, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe abandoned Russian energy, it would be the loss of Russia's source of funding for its troops.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in Polish Media</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What does the Polish media say about it?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the President of Ukraine has greatly increased.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in the city, which is in the zone of military operations.</seg>
          <seg id="165">That is, the president's actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They show that the Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused to receive military and financial assistance in order to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">This is not heard here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It does not fade or fall.</seg>
          <seg id="172">This is the most important thing, that is, there is no image loss.</seg>

          <seg id="1">How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees  analysis from an expert from the EU</seg>
          <seg id="2">Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU  this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Miloš Zeman.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.</seg>
          <seg id="5">She provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Approximately 500, 000 people arrived in the Czech Republic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Ukrainians will never forget such strong support from their neighbors  Poland and the Czech Republic  and will tirelessly thank them.</seg>
          <seg id="8">How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, ProUkraine editors asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="9">He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has a representative office not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.</seg>
          <seg id="10">How Poland helps Ukrainians?</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the life of the Czechs.</seg>
          <seg id="12">There are long queues in labor governments, a significant increase in prices in stores.</seg>
          <seg id="13">What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.</seg>
          <seg id="15">This was foreseen.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Poland has said in recent months that there will be such a huge problem in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Even in Ukraine, there were fewer preparations for what would happen, while in Poland they were actively preparing for what would happen in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="18">For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine even before the start of the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I heard that they were smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="21">But it was very deliberate: to prepare for all these events before the start of the war on all these events.</seg>
          <seg id="22">I note that extremely large funds were allocated from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombing, from the Russian aggressor.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, assistance in logistics  movement through the territory of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="24">There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical ones, for the wounded and sick, etc.</seg>
          <seg id="25">These are planes moving through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I had experience of cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as some might think.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The transport issue remains extremely important.</seg>
          <seg id="29">In Poland, fare for Ukrainians has been canceled.</seg>
          <seg id="30">They can travel for free on trains and public transportation.</seg>
          <seg id="31">In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.</seg>
          <seg id="32">That is, refugees have the opportunity to get free of charge to the places where they plan to stay where they plan to stay.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.</seg>
          <seg id="34">For the most part, these are closed small school stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.</seg>
          <seg id="35">It organizes free meals, free medical first aid, and free medical first aid.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for several days, and already there on the spot they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been created.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they managed to take away from the Russian embassy objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Large residential complexes have been in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone in there, but they did not let anyone there.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Polish local authorities nationalized this, let's say, it was nationalized.</seg>
          <seg id="41">It was taken in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.</seg>
          <seg id="42">These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Water and electricity will be supplied there, they are insulated.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.</seg>
          <seg id="45">The third aspect is social assistance.</seg>
          <seg id="46">After February 24, Poland took a unique step  the Sejm passed, and the Senate approved, a law on fugitives from Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="47">According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months for 18 months.</seg>
          <seg id="48">They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.</seg>
          <seg id="49">This law provides for medical care.</seg>
          <seg id="50">In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free assistance for medicines to Ukrainians.</seg>
          <seg id="51">You just need to write an SMS, get a code to your phone,</seg>
          <seg id="52">And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, get free medicines in Poland for free.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age, regardless of age.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Various funds are distributed, including Caritas and the Red Cross, which provide packages with food, chemistry, clothing and other items.</seg>
          <seg id="55">As the Poles say: “ Niespotykana skala”</seg>
          <seg id="56">That is, “ an event that has no analogues” .</seg>
          <seg id="57">Such a huge openness.</seg>
          <seg id="58">For the Polish state, these are huge expenses.</seg>
          <seg id="59">To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="60">In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.</seg>
          <seg id="61">What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?</seg>
          <seg id="62">Language problem.</seg>
          <seg id="63">Questions start from polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.</seg>
          <seg id="64">Often with complex problems, diseases.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The second problem is schools, where especially high school students also do not give themselves advice at all at the beginning, they cannot understand the terminology.</seg>
          <seg id="66">I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.</seg>
          <seg id="67">This often surprises Polish teachers.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Children not only have a good command of English, but in general their level is higher than the class they fall into.</seg>
          <seg id="69">This is also interesting.</seg>
          <seg id="70">That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.</seg>
          <seg id="71">And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here, they are rated here.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Of course, language is important during employment.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine, it is much more difficult to master this work here.</seg>
          <seg id="74">As a lawyer or accountant, I do not know such cases at all.</seg>
          <seg id="75">Doctors are now appearing in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="76">This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on a legal basis.</seg>
          <seg id="77">A language problem is often the reason that prompts families, after a few weeks of being here, to return home.</seg>
          <seg id="78">There are a lot of such cases.</seg>
          <seg id="79">In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are returning back.</seg>
          <seg id="80">These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military actions.</seg>
          <seg id="81">Here they did not get used to it, did not find work, did not find a job.</seg>
          <seg id="82">Where they live, conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, they will be more comfortable returning home.</seg>
          <seg id="83">This is also one such problem that has arisen in recent weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="84">How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed?</seg>
          <seg id="85">According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, significant changes have taken place.</seg>
          <seg id="86">If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.</seg>
          <seg id="87">How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?</seg>
          <seg id="88">Poland has a similar situation.</seg>
          <seg id="89">Here, all television channels often quote the statement of the President of Poland Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolenskyi.</seg>
          <seg id="90">When Russia attacked Georgia, along with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.</seg>
          <seg id="91">There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression probably will not stop in Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="92">Then there can be the Baltic countries, it can reach Poland as well.</seg>
          <seg id="93">That is, he would have foreseen it if he had foreseen it.</seg>
          <seg id="94">In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.</seg>
          <seg id="95">Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly, and help Ukrainian refugees.</seg>
          <seg id="96">They see a threat in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="97">Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that the war may also knock on our door.</seg>
          <seg id="98">Therefore, the attitude has changed to a positive one.</seg>
          <seg id="99">The Ukrainian flag, Ukrainian anthem is now not a " song of nationalists" or any enemies in Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="100">Of course, there are small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they are in every country.</seg>
          <seg id="101">But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.</seg>
          <seg id="102">The claim about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.</seg>
          <seg id="103">Putin and other Russian politicians have consistently argued that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.</seg>
          <seg id="104">In Poland, this is perceived simply with laughter, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political undertones, they do not have any political overtones.</seg>
          <seg id="105">And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those segments of society that still doubted some historical issues.</seg>
          <seg id="106">Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.</seg>
          <seg id="107">Ukrainians are heroes.</seg>
          <seg id="108">Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives in the way that is happening now in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="109">People from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities are constantly talked about here.</seg>
          <seg id="110">How Poland perceives Russia's threats.</seg>
          <seg id="111">Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.</seg>
          <seg id="112">But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.</seg>
          <seg id="113">Russia is afraid that it will strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="114">How the Polish authorities and society react?</seg>
          <seg id="115">If you want peace, prepare for war.</seg>
          <seg id="116">Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.</seg>
          <seg id="117">The military contingent has increased.</seg>
          <seg id="118">Currently, Poland is undergoing additional recruitment for territorial defense troops.</seg>
          <seg id="119">That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.</seg>
          <seg id="120">Citizens feel that the state is preparing for such events.</seg>
          <seg id="121">Among this, a new law on the defense of the homeland was recently adopted, where the budget has been significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.</seg>
          <seg id="122">The requirements for recruiting military personnel have been changed, many points that are actually related to a possible military threat.</seg>
          <seg id="123">I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.</seg>
          <seg id="124">Your predictions have become a reality in Syria, you have warned of a Russian attack.</seg>
          <seg id="125">What can you say from the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?</seg>
          <seg id="126">This is the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="127">As for a nuclear strike, I don't have much faith in it.</seg>
          <seg id="128">But there is such a scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="129">Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well, too.</seg>
          <seg id="130">It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.</seg>
          <seg id="131">Note, I wouldn't want that, but it's the worst-case scenario.</seg>
          <seg id="132">A blow of low power, but for all television channels to show this “ fungus” .</seg>
          <seg id="133">To be seen from Poland, the Baltic countries.</seg>
          <seg id="134">In this case, the Russians expect that NATO troops will flee and lose their combat capability.</seg>
          <seg id="135">Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, the problems of Putin's entourage, the oligarchs who are now suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.</seg>
          <seg id="136">We have facts of the fire at hydroelectric power plants in Sakhalin, some evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.</seg>
          <seg id="137">Such problems of a regional nature will affect the integrity of the Russian state.</seg>
          <seg id="138">In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.</seg>
          <seg id="139">We also have tendencies of peaceful settlement of war.</seg>
          <seg id="140">Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.</seg>
          <seg id="141">As much as possible, this will be delayed until the end of this year.</seg>
          <seg id="142">How to live without Russian gas?</seg>
          <seg id="143">The Czech Republic is discussing a possible cessation of gas supply.</seg>
          <seg id="144">This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.</seg>
          <seg id="145">At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.</seg>
          <seg id="146">How this affected Polish citizens?</seg>
          <seg id="147">Since I am an analyst, I predicted that.</seg>
          <seg id="148">I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.</seg>
          <seg id="149">My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.</seg>
          <seg id="150">But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the increase in prices.</seg>
          <seg id="151">Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely prices for all resources will begin to rise up.</seg>
          <seg id="152">Different avenues to certain alternative sources are now being sought.</seg>
          <seg id="153">In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland, there is a very huge port.</seg>
          <seg id="154">As for oil, we have a bright factor that the Hungarian Prime Minister is actually cooperating with Putin.</seg>
          <seg id="155">Now there will be a redemption of gas stations in Poland, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.</seg>
          <seg id="156">These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.</seg>
          <seg id="157">If Europe abandoned Russian energy, it would be the loss of a source of funding for the Russian Federation's troops.</seg>
          <seg id="158">Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="159">Ukraine in Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="160">Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to Polish media.</seg>
          <seg id="161">What is told about this in the Polish media?</seg>
          <seg id="162">The rating of the President of Ukraine has greatly increased.</seg>
          <seg id="163">And this growth is estimated to be unprecedented.</seg>
          <seg id="164">Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in the city that is in the war zone.</seg>
          <seg id="165">That is, the president's actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.</seg>
          <seg id="166">They indicate that the Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused to receive military and financial assistance in order to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="167">The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.</seg>
          <seg id="168">There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.</seg>
          <seg id="169">This is not heard here.</seg>
          <seg id="170">And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.</seg>
          <seg id="171">It does not fade or fall.</seg>
          <seg id="172">This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.</seg>
          <seg id="173">In fact, the image of Ukraine holds, and this is very important.</seg>
