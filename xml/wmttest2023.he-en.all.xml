          <seg id="13">"המצב שלהם חמור באופן קיצוני", אמר אכברי וציין כי הברדלסים נפלו קורבן לבצורת באזורי המחיה שלהם, לציד ואף לתאונות דרכים.</seg>
          <seg id="14">הברדלס נחשב לחיה המהירה בעולם שמסוגלת להגיע למהירות של כ-100 קמ"ש.</seg>

          <seg id="2">World's fastest animal falls victim to brutal hunting, droughts and deadly car crashes across the Islamic Republic</seg>
          <seg id="3">This resulted in fewer than 20 cheetahs falling in number.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Three Asian cheetah cubs recently emerged into the world's air in the Islamic Republic of Iran.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It's a rare birth that only slightly improves the endangered animal's status in the country due to droughts, hunters and fatal car crashes.</seg>
          <seg id="6">This is the first birth of a cheetah in captivity in Iran.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in nature.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Iranian news agency IRNA said the veterinary team, which trusts Thoran National Park in the northern province of Semnan, decided on a captive birth.</seg>
          <seg id="9">It also noted that fewer than 20 cheetahs have been recorded in seven different provinces of the country in recent times.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Due to the threat of extinction, the United Nations implemented a defence plan for them back in 2001.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Now, Iran is hoping the new puppies can bring about cheetah population growth in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In January, Iran's deputy environment minister Hassan Akbari said the country's cheetah population had dramatically decreased from 100 in 2010.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their habitat, hunting and even car accidents.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world capable of reaching speeds of about 100 km / h.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cheetahs can be found in various places across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.</seg>

          <seg id="1">ספוטיפיי רוצה לשדרג לכם את הרכב: בדקנו את ה-Car Thing</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="2">בשקט בשקט, ספוטיפיי החלה לנסות את מזלה גם בעולם החומרה •</seg>
          <seg id="3">אחרי שנים של פיתוח - Car Thing נחשף והושק כניסוי קטן בארה"ב •</seg>
          <seg id="4">שמנו יד על המכשיר הראשון בישראל •</seg>
          <seg id="5">החזון: להפוך את הרכבים הישנים שלכם לחכמים</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="6">ה-Car Thing הוא מוצר החומרה הראשון של ספוטיפיי, ונבנה במיוחד על מנת לספק פתרון לאנשים בעלי רכבים ישנים.</seg>
          <seg id="7">לפני כמה שבועות, קיבלתי הזדמנות ראשונית לנסות את המוצר החדש, שזמין כרגע רק לנסיינים בודדים בארה"ב, כאן בישראל.</seg>
          <seg id="8">עבורי, הטיימינג של המשלוח היה יוצא מן הכלל, שכן הרכב הביתי שלנו התקלקל ונאלצנו לנהוג במשך כמה ימים עם רכב חליפי בעל מערכת ישנה.</seg>
          <seg id="9">אחרי שבועיים של השתעשעות, הבנתי כיצד ה-Car Thing יכול להפוך בקלות לחלק בלתי נפרד מהמערכת של אנשים רבים.</seg>
          <seg id="10">ומנגד, עם רשימת המתנה ארוכה וחוסר וודאות בנוגע להשקה עולמית, אני מאמין שרבים יעדיפו כבר להשתמש בפתרונות אחרים.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">מרעיון למציאות</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">אי שם בשנת 2018, משתמשי ספוטיפיי החלו לקבל הצעה מעניינת בתיבת האימייל שלהם - אפשרות לרכוש מכשיר חדש עם שליטה קולית וחיבוריות דור רביעי, שיהפוך כל מערכת ישנה לרכב לחכמה.</seg>
          <seg id="13">השמועות אט אט דעכו עד שנה לאחר מכן, כשאתר Financial Times חשף כי החברה מתכננת להציג בקרוב מוצר חדש לרכב המדמה רדיו חכם עם חיבוריות בלוטות'.</seg>
          <seg id="14">כמה חודשים לאחר מכן, השמועות הללו חזרו שוב לכותרות אחרי ששירות המוזיקה התעדכן עם מצב הרכב - אותו אחד שאנו מכירים כיום מהאפליקציה - המופעל ברגע שהסמארטפון מזהה חיבור למערכת באוטו.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="15">שנתיים עברו מאז.</seg>
          <seg id="16">אחרי אינספור שמועות והדלפות, ספוטיפיי חשפה בחודש אפריל האחרון את "Car Thing", המערכת החכמה שלה לכלי רכב.</seg>
          <seg id="17">ספוטיפיי בחרה לשחרר את המכשיר החדש באופן מוגבל מאוד, עם רשימת המתנה ארוכה ועיכובים רבים בכל הנוגע למשלוחים.</seg>
          <seg id="18">אז כמובן, מיד אחרי מסיבת העיתונאים שקיימה, נכנסתי לאתר ונרשמתי.</seg>
          <seg id="19">חודשיים לאחר מכן, ההודעה המיוחלת הגיעה.</seg>
          <seg id="20">התחברות מחודשת לאתר תקנה לי את האפשרות לרכוש את המכשיר עם הפתעה קטנה - הוא לא יעלה לי דבר.</seg>
          <seg id="21">אחרי חודש נוסף של המתנה, השליח סוף סוף דפק לי בדלת, מלווה בקופסה קטנה עם הלוגו של ספוטיפיי עליה.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="22">ה-Car Thing</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="23">בראש ובראשונה, המכשיר של ספוטיפיי הרשים אותי מאוד באיכות הבנייה שלו.</seg>
          <seg id="24">וא מעט יותר קטן מהאייפון 11 שלי וכולל בקדמתו מסך מגע גדול, בהיר וחד משציפיתי.</seg>
          <seg id="25">כמו כן, תוכלו למצוא לצד המסך כפתור עגול וחוגה שתוכלו לסובב כדי לנווט בין מסכי הממשק.</seg>
          <seg id="26">ולמרות החוגה הענקית, אותה אתם יכולים לראות בתמונות, ה-Car Thing מצליח לשמור על פרופיל דקיק יחסית ולא לבלוט יותר מדי מהדשבורד.</seg>
          <seg id="27">באופן אישי, הייתי מעדיף שהחברה תאפשר לשנות את פעילות החוגה על מנת שאוכל לשלוט בווליום של הסמארטפון, שכן אני יכול לנווט גם באמצעות מסך המגע.</seg>
          <seg id="28">אולי זה יתאפשר בעדכון גרסה עתידי.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="29">המכשיר מגיע בקופסת קרטון קטנה ומינימליסטית, הכוללת בין היתר כבל USB Type C ומתאמים שונים להתקנתו.</seg>
          <seg id="30">רבים מכם בטח זוכרים כיצד בעבר היינו נוהגים לנתק את מכשירי הרדיו ולהחביא אותם במגירה אחרי היציאה מהרכב.</seg>
          <seg id="31">ה-Car Thing ללא ספק מחזיר את ההרגשה הזאת עם צורת הבנייה שלו.</seg>
          <seg id="32">כלל המתאמים התחברו לגוף המכשיר באמצעות מגנט שהיה חזק מאוד, מה שמנע ממנו ליפול גם בעת נסיעה על כבישי עפר.</seg>
          <seg id="33">נוסף על כך, לאורך כל חלקו העליון ניתן למצוא כפתורים קטנים, אותם אפשר להגדיר בקלות להפעלת פלייליסטים שונים או פודקאסטים.</seg>
          <seg id="34">באמצעות לחיצה ארוכה על אחד מהכפתורים בזמן השמיעה, או באמצעות בקשה מהעוזרת הקולית, הגדרתי כמה פלייליסטים שאני שומע באופן תכוף ואת תכנית הרדיו שאני מאזין לה מדי בוקר בדרכים.</seg>
          <seg id="35">בכך, הפיצ'ר גרם לי להרגיש שה-Car Thing הוא יותר כמו רדיו לרכב מאשר הרחבה של הסמארטפון שלי.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="36">מרכב ישן לרכב חכם</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="37">אחרי התקנה פיזית פשוטה למדי, חיברתי את ה-Car Thing לחשמל.</seg>
          <seg id="38">הופתעתי לטובה מתהליך ההגדרה.</seg>
          <seg id="39">ההוראות היו ברורות, החיבור לאפליקציית ספוטיפיי לקח פחות מ-5 דקות, וכמה רגעים לאחר מכן הגעתי למסך הבית.</seg>
          <seg id="40">למעשה, המכשיר מתחבר לסמארטפון דרך בלוטות' ושולט על האפליקציה כמו שלט, ולכן יכול להעתיק ממנה את כל המידע על החשבון שלנו.</seg>
          <seg id="41">משמע, עדיין תהיו חייבים לחבר את הסמארטפון שלכם לרכב, בין אם דרך בלוטות' או דרך כבל AUX על מנת לשמוע את המוזיקה.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="42">מסך הבית מוכר לכל המשתמשים באפליקציה, שכן כמו היישום בסמארטפון, הוא שם דגש על תמונות האלבומים ורשימות ההשמעה.</seg>
          <seg id="43">כמו כן, במסך הבית, כמו זה שבאפליקציה, תוכלו למצוא המלצות למוזיקה בהתאם לטעם שלכם, את מסך החיפוש ואת הספריה האישית שלכם.</seg>
          <seg id="44">כאמור, תוכלו לנווט בין המסכים השונים באמצעות מסך המגע או באמצעות המחוגה הידנית.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="45">יתרה מכך, תוכלו בכל רגע נתון לקרוא לעוזרת הקולית של המכשיר באמצעות אמירת "היי ספוטיפיי".</seg>
          <seg id="46">באמצעותה, תוכלו להפעיל שירים, פלייליסטים, אלבומים ואפילו לחפש פודקאסטים.</seg>
          <seg id="47">מניסוני היא זיהתה די בקלות את הקול שלי גם כשהמוזיקה התנגנה ברקע והמזגן נשף ישירות על המכשיר.</seg>
          <seg id="48">זאת ככל הנראה הודות לארבעת המיקרופונים שהותקנו בחלקו העליון.</seg>
          <seg id="49">חשוב לציין שכרגע העוזרת הקולית אינה תומכת בעברית, ונכון לעת פרסום הכתבה, אין מידע על מתי עדכון שכזה יגיע.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="50">אז האם שווה לחכות לו?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="51">חוויית השימוש שלי במכשיר הייתה נהדרת, וזו הפתעה חיובית בעיניי בהתחשב בכך שהוא עדיין בשלב שחרור ראשוני.</seg>
          <seg id="52">גם בשימוש אינטנסיבי בנסיעות ארוכות, המכשיר המשיך לעבוד בצורה חלקה מבלי להתנתק מהסמארטפון שלי.</seg>
          <seg id="53">בכל זאת, מדי פעם נרשם גמגום קטן בממשק, אבל אני מאמין שספוטיפיי תטפל בבאגים שכאלה עם עדכוני גרסה עתידיים.</seg>
          <seg id="54">ניכר שהחברה השבדית עבדה עליו הרבה בשנים האחרונות, ומבין הגרסאות השונות שדלפו באינטרנט בתקופה הזו, העיצוב של המוצר הסופי הוא כנראה האהוב עליי.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="55">עדיין, כשראיתי את ה-Car Thing בפעם הראשונה, תהיתי למי בדיוק החברה מנסה לייעד אותו.</seg>
          <seg id="56">הרי פעילותו מסתכמת בשליטה על האפליקציה בסמארטפון, ולא הרבה מעבר לזה.</seg>
          <seg id="57">מה זה שונה מלקנות מעמד לרכב בכמה שקלים ולחבר אותו כך שהסמארטפון יהיה קרוב יותר אלינו בעת נהיגה?</seg>
          <seg id="58">השאלה הזו מתחזקת בעת התחשבות בכך שמכשירי אייפון ואנדרואיד חזקים בהרבה מזה של ספוטיפיי, וברוב הפעמים יקנו למשתמש הרבה יותר פונקציונליות.</seg>
          <seg id="59">למרות כל זאת, ככל שהשתמשתי ב-Car Thing יותר ויותר, הבנתי כיצד ביכולתו לשפר את חוויית הנהיגה.</seg>
          <seg id="60">היכולת לראות את ה-Waze על גבי מסך הסמארטפון שלי ולשלוט במוזיקה על גבי מסך אחר לחלוטין, זו אחת שלמדתי להעריך בשבועיים האחרונים.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="61">שאלה אחת נותרה - האם ספוטיפיי בכלל תשיק את המכשיר לקהל הרחב?</seg>
          <seg id="62">ואם כן, האם הוא יושק גם כאן במדינתנו הקטנה?</seg>
          <seg id="63">החברה השבדית לא מספרת כרגע הרבה.</seg>
          <seg id="64">היא אפילו לא שיתפה כמה נסיינים למכשיר היא מפעילה כרגע ברחבי העולם, וכמה היא מתכננת להוסיף בהשקה המצומצמת בארצות הברית.</seg>
          <seg id="65">הדבר היחיד שאנו יודעים בוודאות זה המחיר שצפוי לעמוד על 79 דולרים (כ-255 שקלים).</seg>
          <seg id="66">לבינתיים, ה-Car Thing מספק הצצה ראשונית לקונספט שספוטיפיי מנסים לפצח כבר שנים.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="67">מספוטיפיי ישראל נמסר כי אין מידע כרגע על תכנית להשקת המכשיר בארץ</seg>

          <seg id="1">Spotify wants to upgrade your car: we tested the Car Thing</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="2">Quietly, Spotify began trying to enter the hardware world as well •</seg>
          <seg id="3">After years of development—Car Thing was revealed and launched as a small experiment in the USA •</seg>
          <seg id="4">We got a hold on the first device in Israel •</seg>
          <seg id="5">The vision: to make your old vehicles smart</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="6">The Car Thing is Spotify’s first hardware product, and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with old cars.</seg>
          <seg id="7">A few weeks ago, I got an preliminary opportunity to try out the new product here in Israel, which is currently only available to individual testers in the US.</seg>
          <seg id="8">For me, the timing of the delivery was incredible, as our home vehicle broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle equipped with an old system.</seg>
          <seg id="9">After two weeks of trying it, I came to understand how Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people’s systems.</seg>
          <seg id="10">On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">From idea to reality</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email inbox—an opportunity to purchase a new device with voice control and 4th generation connectivity, which will make any old car system smart.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The rumors slowly died down until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company was planning to soon introduce a new car product simulating a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.</seg>
          <seg id="14">A few months later, these rumors made headlines again after the music service was updated with the vehicle mode—the same one we know today from the app—which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="15">Two years have passed since then.</seg>
          <seg id="16">After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify revealed "Car Thing" in last April, its smart system for vehicles.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited edition, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipments.</seg>
          <seg id="18">So of course, right after the press conference that took place, I entered the website and registered.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Reconnecting to the website will give me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise—it won’t cost me a thing.</seg>
          <seg id="21">After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="22">The Car Thing</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="23">First and foremost, Spotify’s device impressed me greatly with its structure materials quality.</seg>
          <seg id="24">It is slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and has a larger, brighter and sharper touch screen than I expected on its front</seg>
          <seg id="25">You will also find a round button and a dial next to the screen that allows you to navigate between the interface screens.</seg>
          <seg id="26">And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Personally, I would have preferred the company to allow changing the dial activity so that I’ll be able to control the smartphone volume, since I can also navigate using the touch screen.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Maybe this will be enabled in a future version update.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="29">The device comes in a small and minimalist cardboard box, which also includes, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after leaving the car.</seg>
          <seg id="31">The Car Thing certainly brings back that feeling with its construction.</seg>
          <seg id="32">All the adapters connected to the device with a very strong magnet, which prevented it from falling even while driving on dirt roads.</seg>
          <seg id="33">In addition, along its entire upper part you can find small buttons, which can be easily configured to activate different playlists or podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="34">By long-pressing one of the buttons while listening, or by asking the voice assistant, I set some playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio program that I listen to every morning on the go.</seg>
          <seg id="35">In doing so, the feature made me feel like the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="37">After a fairly simple physical setup, I plugged in the Car Thing.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the application like a remote control, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Meaning, you will still have to connect your smartphone to the car, either via Bluetooth or via an AUX cable in order to hear the music.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="42">The home screen is familiar to all users of the application, since like the smartphone application, it emphasizes the album images and playlists.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Also, on the home screen, like the one in the application, you can find music recommendations according to your liking, the search screen and your personal library.</seg>
          <seg id="44">As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or the manual dial.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="45">Moreover, at any given moment, you can call the device’s voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify".</seg>
          <seg id="46">Using it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="47">In my experience, the voice assistant recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was blowing directly on the device.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed in the upper part.</seg>
          <seg id="49">It is important to note that currently the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publishing the article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="50">So is it worth waiting for?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="51">My user experience of the device was great, and this is quite a surprise for me considering that this is still in an initial release stage.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Even for intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting off my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Still, every now and then a small glitch in the interface occurs, but I believe that Spotify will address such bugs in future version updates.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Evidently the Swedish company has labored on the device recent years, and this final design of the product is probably my favorite among the different versions that have leaked online during this period.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="55">Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered to whom exactly was the company trying to target it to.</seg>
          <seg id="56">After all, its activity amounts to controlling the application on the smartphone, and not much else.</seg>
          <seg id="57">How is this different from buying a cheap car stand and connecting it so that the smartphone stands closer to us while driving?</seg>
          <seg id="58">This question gets crucial when considering that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify’s device, and in most cases will supply the user with much more functionality.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Despite this, as I used Car Thing more frequently, I came to understand how it may improve the driving experience.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Being able to view the Waze app on my smartphone screen and control the music on a completely different screen is one feature I’ve come to appreciate in the last couple of weeks.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="61">One question remains—will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?</seg>
          <seg id="62">And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?</seg>
          <seg id="63">The Swedish company is not saying much at the moment.</seg>
          <seg id="64">It hasn’t even shared how many testers for the device it’s currently running around the world, and how many devices will Spotify add in to the limited launch in the United States.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The only thing we validate is the expected price of 79 dollars (about 255 NIS).</seg>
          <seg id="66">Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides a first look at a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>

          <seg id="2">Quietly, Spotify has also started to try its luck in the hardware world.</seg>
          <seg id="3">After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small pilot in the USA.</seg>
          <seg id="4">We got our hands on the first device in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The vision: To turn your old cars into smart ones.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and it was specifically designed to provide a solution for people with older cars.</seg>
          <seg id="7">A few weeks ago, I got the first opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to a few testers in the US, here in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="8">For me, the timing of the delivery was exceptional, as our family car broke down and we had to drive for a few days with a replacement car with an old system.</seg>
          <seg id="9">After two weeks of playing around, I understood how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's system.</seg>
          <seg id="10">On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty about the global launch, I believe many would prefer to use other solutions.</seg>
          <seg id="11">From concept to reality.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users started receiving an interesting offer in their email inbox - the opportunity to purchase a new device with voice control and 4G connectivity, which would turn any old car system into a smart one.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The rumors gradually died down until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.</seg>
          <seg id="14">A few months later, these rumors returned to the headlines after the music service updated with a car mode - the same one we know today from the app - activated when the smartphone detects a connection to the car system.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Two years have passed since then.</seg>
          <seg id="16">After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify revealed its smart car system, "Car Thing", last April.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays regarding deliveries.</seg>
          <seg id="18">So of course, immediately after the press conference she held, I went to the website and registered.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Two months later, the long-awaited message arrived.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Reconnecting to the site gave me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise - it won't cost me anything.</seg>
          <seg id="21">After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The Car Thing</seg>
          <seg id="23">First and foremost, I was very impressed by the build quality of Spotify's device.</seg>
          <seg id="24">It's slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a large, bright, and sharp touch screen on the front.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Also, next to the screen, you can find a round button and a dial that you can rotate to navigate through the interface screens.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively slim profile and not protrude too much from the dashboard.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Personally, I would prefer if the company allowed to change the dial function so I could control the smartphone's volume, as I can also navigate using the touch screen.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Maybe it will be possible in a future version update.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes among other things a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radio devices and hide them in the drawer after leaving the car.</seg>
          <seg id="31">The Car Thing definitely brings back that feeling with its construction.</seg>
          <seg id="32">All the adapters were connected to the device body using a very strong magnet, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.</seg>
          <seg id="33">In addition, along its top part, you can find small buttons, which can be easily set to play different playlists or podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="34">By long pressing one of the buttons during playback, or by asking the voice assistant, I set up several playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio program that I listen to every morning on the road.</seg>
          <seg id="35">In doing so, the feature made me feel like the Car Thing is more like a car radio rather than an extension of my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="36">From an old vehicle to a smart car.</seg>
          <seg id="37">After a simple physical installation, I connected the Car Thing to the power.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.</seg>

          <seg id="13">The rumors slowly died down until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company was planning to soon introduce a new product for a smart radio simulation vehicle with glandular connections.</seg>
          <seg id="14">A few months later, these rumors made headlines again after the music service updated the car's status -- the same one we know today from the app -- which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the car's system.</seg>
          <seg id="15">It's been two years.</seg>
          <seg id="16">After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled Car Thing last April, its smart car system.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited release, with a long waiting list and many delays in shipping.</seg>
          <seg id="18">So of course, right after the press conference that was held, I went on the website and signed up.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Two months later, the long-awaited message arrived.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Reconnecting to the site will buy me the option to purchase the device with a little surprise - it won't cost me anything.</seg>
          <seg id="21">After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a little box with the Spotify logo on it.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The Car Thing.</seg>
          <seg id="23">First of all, the Spotify device really impressed me with its build quality.</seg>
          <seg id="24">And it's a little bit smaller than my iPhone 11 and it has a bigger, brighter, more compact touchscreen on the front than I expected.</seg>
          <seg id="25">You'll also find a round button and a circle next to the screen that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.</seg>
          <seg id="26">And despite the giant circle, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Personally, I'd prefer if the company allowed me to change the activity of the loop so that I could control the volume of the smartphone, because I can also navigate through the touchscreen.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Maybe this will be possible in a future update.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes a USB Type-C cable and various adapters for its installation.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Many of you probably remember how we used to turn off the radios and hide them in the drawer after we got out of the car.</seg>
          <seg id="31">The Car Thing definitely brings that feeling back with its construction.</seg>
          <seg id="32">All the adapters connected to the body of the device by a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.</seg>
          <seg id="33">In addition, along the top you can find small buttons, which can be easily set to play different playlists or podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="34">By long pressing of one of the buttons while listening, or by requesting from the voice assistant, I set some playlists that I hear frequently and the radio program that I listen to every morning on the road.</seg>
          <seg id="35">In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="36">From old car to smart car</seg>
          <seg id="37">After a fairly simple physical installation, I connected the Car Thing to electricity.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I was surprised at the quality of the setup process.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The instructions were clear, it took less than five minutes to sign in to Spotify, and a few moments later I was on my home screen.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through a node and controls the app like a control panel, so it can copy all of our account information from it.</seg>
          <seg id="41">So you'll still have to connect your smartphone to the car, whether it's through a spindle or through an AUX cable to hear the music.</seg>
          <seg id="42">The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, because like the smartphone app, it emphasizes album photos and playlists.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations to suit your taste, your search screen, and your personal library.</seg>
          <seg id="44">As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or using the manual scrollbar.</seg>
          <seg id="45">What's more, you can call your device's voice assistant at any time by saying "Hey Spotify".</seg>
          <seg id="46">With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums, and even search for podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="47">In my experience, she recognized my voice fairly easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was dancing directly on the device.</seg>
          <seg id="48">That's probably because of the four microphones we put on top of it.</seg>
          <seg id="49">It is important to note that the voice assistant currently does not support Hebrew, and at the time of publication, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.</seg>
          <seg id="50">So is it worth waiting for?</seg>
          <seg id="51">My experience with the device has been great, which is a positive surprise to me considering it's still in its early release.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="53">However, there have been occasional slight glitches in the interface, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future release updates.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The Swedish company has obviously been working on it a lot over the last few years, and of the different versions that have been leaked online during that time, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to target it for.</seg>
          <seg id="56">After all, it's all about controlling the app on your smartphone, not much more.</seg>
          <seg id="57">What's different about buying a car for a few cents and connecting it so that the smartphone is closer to you when you're driving?</seg>
          <seg id="58">This question is reinforced when you consider that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify, and will often buy the user much more functionality.</seg>
          <seg id="59">However, the more I used Car Thing, the more I realized how it could improve the driving experience.</seg>
          <seg id="60">The ability to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I've learned to appreciate in the last couple of weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="61">One question remains - will Spotify even release the device to the general public?</seg>
          <seg id="62">And if so, will it be launched here in our little country?</seg>
          <seg id="63">The Swedish company isn't saying much right now.</seg>
          <seg id="64">She didn't even share how many signals to the device she's currently running around the world, and how many she plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The only thing we know for sure is the expected price of $79.</seg>
          <seg id="66">In the meantime, the Car Thing provides a first glimpse into a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.</seg>
          <seg id="67">Israel's Spotify says there's no word yet on a plan to launch the device in the country.</seg>
          <seg id="68">I'm not going anywhere.</seg>

          <seg id="9">After two weeks of fun, I realized how easily the car thing could become an integral part of many people's systems.</seg>

          <seg id="60">The ability to see the Waze on my smartphone screen and control the music on a completely different screen is something that I've learned to appreciate in the last two weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="61">One question remains -- will Spotify ever release the device to the general public?</seg>
          <seg id="62">And if so, will it be established here in our little country?</seg>
          <seg id="63">The Swedish society isn't saying much right now.</seg>
          <seg id="64">She didn't even share how many new features for the device she is currently rolling out around the world, and how many she plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The only thing we know for sure is that the price is expected to be $79.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides a first glimpse into a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Spotify wants to upgrade your car: we tested the Car Thing</seg>
          <seg id="2">Quietly, Spotify has begun to try its luck in the hardware world as well •</seg>
          <seg id="3">After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small trial in the US •</seg>
          <seg id="4">We got our hands on the first device in Israel •</seg>
          <seg id="5">The vision: Make your old cars smart</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, built specifically to provide a solution for people with older cars.</seg>
          <seg id="7">A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try out the new product, which is currently only available to a few experimenters in the US, here in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="8">For me, the timing of the delivery was outstanding, as our home car broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.</seg>
          <seg id="9">After two weeks of playing around, I realized how Car Thing can easily become an integral part of many people's systems.</seg>
          <seg id="10">On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.</seg>
          <seg id="11">From idea to reality</seg>
          <seg id="12">Way back in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email inbox - the possibility of purchasing a new device with voice control and 4G connectivity, which will make any old car system smart.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.</seg>
          <seg id="14">A few months later, those rumors made headlines again after the music service was updated with the condition of the vehicle — the same one we now know from the app — that activates as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Two years have passed since then.</seg>
          <seg id="16">After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled Car Thing, its smart system for vehicles, last April.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to deliveries.</seg>
          <seg id="18">So, of course, right after the press conference, I went to the website and signed up.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Reconnecting to the site will give me the option to purchase the device with a small surprise - it won't cost me anything.</seg>
          <seg id="21">After another month of waiting, the delivery person finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The Car Thing</seg>
          <seg id="23">First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me with its build quality.</seg>
          <seg id="24">And it's slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and has a bigger, brighter and sharper touchscreen on the front than I expected.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Also, you will find next to the screen a round button and a dial that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.</seg>
          <seg id="26">And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively slim profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Personally, I would prefer the company to allow the dial to be changed so that I can control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate using the touchscreen.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Perhaps this will be possible in a future version update.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters for installing it.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to unplug the radios and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.</seg>
          <seg id="31">The Car Thing undoubtedly brings that feeling back with the way it is built.</seg>
          <seg id="32">All adapters were attached to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.</seg>
          <seg id="33">On top of that, there are small buttons all along the top, which you can easily set up to play various playlists or podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="34">By pressing and holding one of the buttons while listening, or by asking my voice assistant, I set up some playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio show I listen to every morning on the go.</seg>
          <seg id="35">In doing so, the feature made me feel that Car Thing was more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="36">From old body to smart car</seg>
          <seg id="37">After a fairly simple physical installation, I plugged in the Car Thing.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.</seg>
          <seg id="41">This means you'll still have to connect your smartphone to your car, either via Bluetooth or via an AUX cable to hear the music.</seg>
          <seg id="42">The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, since, like the application on a smartphone, it emphasizes album photos and playlists.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations according to your taste, the search screen and your personal library.</seg>
          <seg id="44">As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touchscreen or using the manual dial.</seg>
          <seg id="45">What's more, you can call your device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify" at any given moment.</seg>
          <seg id="46">With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums, and even search for podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="47">From Nissoni, she recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This is probably due to the four microphones installed at the top.</seg>
          <seg id="49">It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of this article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.</seg>
          <seg id="50">So is it worth waiting for?</seg>
          <seg id="51">My experience using the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me considering it's still in the initial release phase.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Still, there is a little stuttering in the interface from time to time, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.</seg>
          <seg id="54">It's clear that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and of the various versions that leaked online during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to target it for.</seg>
          <seg id="56">After all, his activity boils down to controlling the app on a smartphone, and not much else.</seg>
          <seg id="57">What's different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and attaching it so that the smartphone is closer to us when driving?</seg>
          <seg id="58">This question is reinforced when you consider that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and in most cases will give the user much more functionality.</seg>
          <seg id="59">However, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.</seg>

          <seg id="40">In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote, so can copy all our account information from it.</seg>
          <seg id="41">This means you'll still have to connect your smartphone to the car, either via Bluetooth or via an AUX cable in order to hear the music.</seg>
          <seg id="42">The home screen is familiar to all app users, since like the app on a smartphone, it places an emphasis on album photos and playlists.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations based on your tastes, your search screen and your personal library.</seg>
          <seg id="44">As mentioned above, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or the manual dial.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Better yet, you can at any given moment call the device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify."</seg>
          <seg id="46">Through it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="47">From my experience she quite easily recognized my voice even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly onto the device.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This is probably due to the four microphones installed at the top.</seg>
          <seg id="49">It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.</seg>
          <seg id="50">Is it worth waiting for?</seg>
          <seg id="51">My experience of using the device has been great, which is a positive surprise to me considering it is still in an initial release phase.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Even when used intensively on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Still, occasionally a little stutter is recorded in the interface, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.</seg>
          <seg id="54">It's evident that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and of the various versions that have leaked online in this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Still, when I saw the Car Thing for the first time, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to designate it for.</seg>
          <seg id="56">After all, it comes down to controlling the app on a smartphone, and not much else.</seg>
          <seg id="57">What's different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and plugging it in so the smartphone is closer to us while driving?</seg>
          <seg id="58">That question is reinforced when you consider that iPhones and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and most of the time will buy the user a lot more functionality.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Even so, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Being able to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I've learned to appreciate over the past two weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="61">One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?</seg>
          <seg id="62">And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?</seg>
          <seg id="63">The Swedish company is not saying much at the moment.</seg>
          <seg id="64">It hasn't even shared how many testers for the device it currently operates around the world, and how many it plans to add at its upcoming launch in the United States.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The only thing we know for sure is that the price is expected to be 79 dollars (about 255 shekels).</seg>
          <seg id="66">In the meantime, Car Thing provides an initial glimpse into a concept Spotify has been trying to crack for years.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Spotify wants to upgrade your car: we tested the Car Thing</seg>
          <seg id="2">Quietly, Spotify has begun to try its luck in the hardware world as well •</seg>
          <seg id="3">After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the US •</seg>
          <seg id="4">We put our hands on the first device in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Vision: Make your old vehicles smart</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with older vehicles.</seg>
          <seg id="7">A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently available only to individual experimenters in the US, here in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="8">For me, the timing of the delivery was outstanding, as our home vehicle broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.</seg>
          <seg id="9">After two weeks of toying around, I realized how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's system.</seg>
          <seg id="10">And on the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.</seg>
          <seg id="11">From idea to reality</seg>
          <seg id="12">Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email box - the possibility of purchasing a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which will turn any old car system into a smart one.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Rumors slowly waned until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.</seg>
          <seg id="14">A few months later, these rumors returned to the headlines again after the music service updated with the mode of the vehicle - the same one that we know today from the app - that is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Two years have passed since then.</seg>
          <seg id="16">After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled “Car Thing” last April, its smart system for vehicles.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to shipments.</seg>
          <seg id="18">So of course, right after the press conference she held, I went onto the site and signed up.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.</seg>
          <seg id="20">A re-connection to the site will buy me the opportunity to purchase the device with a little surprise - it will not cost me anything.</seg>
          <seg id="21">After another month of waiting, the messenger finally knocked my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The Car Thing</seg>
          <seg id="23">First and foremost, Spotify's device has greatly impressed me with its build quality.</seg>
          <seg id="24">And a slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a big, bright, sharp touch screen on its front than I expected.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Also, you will find next to the screen a round button and a dial that you can rotate to navigate through the interface screens.</seg>
          <seg id="26">And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the photos, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively flimsy profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Personally, I would prefer that the company allowed the activity of the dial to be changed so that I could control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate using the touch screen.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Perhaps this will be possible in a future version update.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes, among other things, a USB Type C cable and various adapters to install it.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after leaving the car.</seg>
          <seg id="31">The Car Thing undoubtedly brings back that feeling with its build form.</seg>
          <seg id="32">All adapters were connected to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.</seg>
          <seg id="33">On top of that, along the entire top you can find small buttons, which can be easily configured to play various playlists or podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="34">By long pressing one of the buttons while hearing, or using a request from the voice assistant, I set up some playlists that I hear frequently and the radio show I listen to every morning on the go.</seg>
          <seg id="35">In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="36">From old car to smart car</seg>
          <seg id="37">After a fairly simple physical setup, I plugged the Car Thing into power.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I was pleasantly surprised by the set-up process.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The instructions were clear, the connection to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through Bluetooth and controls the application like a remote, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.</seg>
          <seg id="41">That means you will still have to connect your smartphone to your car, either via Bluetooth or AUX cable in order to hear the music.</seg>

          <seg id="46">Using it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="47">From Sony she quite easily recognized my voice even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed at the top.</seg>
          <seg id="49">It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of the article, there is no information about when such an update will arrive.</seg>

          <seg id="23">First and foremost, Spotify's device impressed me greatly with the quality of its construction.</seg>
          <seg id="24">And a little smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a large, bright, sharp touch screen in front of it than I expected.</seg>
          <seg id="25">You'll also find a circular button and dial next to the screen that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.</seg>
          <seg id="26">And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Personally, I would prefer that the company allow me to change the dial activity so that I can control the volume of the smartphone, since I can also navigate through the touch screen.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Perhaps this will be possible in a future revision.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The device comes in a small and minimalist cardboard box, which includes a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Many of you may remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radios and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.</seg>
          <seg id="31">The Car Thing certainly brings that feeling back with its construction form.</seg>
          <seg id="32">All the adapters connected to the body of the device using a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when traveling on dirt roads.</seg>
          <seg id="33">In addition, all along the top you can find small buttons, which can be easily configured to play different playlists or podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="34">By pressing one of the buttons while listening, or by asking the voice assistant, I set up some of the playlists I listen to frequently and the radio show I listen to every morning on the road.</seg>
          <seg id="35">In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="36">An old car for a smart car</seg>
          <seg id="37">After a fairly simple physical installation, I plugged in the Car Thing.</seg>
          <seg id="38">I was pleasantly surprised by the process.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The instructions were clear, the connection to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote control, and therefore can copy all the information about our account from it.</seg>
          <seg id="41">That means you'll still have to connect your smartphone to your car, whether through Bluetooth or an AUX cable to hear the music.</seg>
          <seg id="42">The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, since like the application on a smartphone, it emphasizes album photos and playlists.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations according to your taste, the search screen, and your personal library.</seg>
          <seg id="44">As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or using the hand dial.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Moreover, at any given moment, you can call the device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify."</seg>
          <seg id="46">With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.</seg>
          <seg id="47">From my experience, she recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This is probably due to the four microphones installed at the top.</seg>
          <seg id="49">It is important to note that at the moment the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publication of the article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.</seg>
          <seg id="50">Is it worth waiting for him?</seg>
          <seg id="51">My experience using the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me considering that it is still in the initial release stage.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Nevertheless, from time to time there is a small stutter in the interface, but I believe Spotify will handle such bugs with future version updates.</seg>
          <seg id="54">It is evident that the Swedish company has worked on it a lot in recent years, and among the various versions leaked on the Internet during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to designate it to.</seg>
          <seg id="56">After all, his activity comes down to controlling the smartphone app, and not much else.</seg>
          <seg id="57">What's different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and connecting it so that the smartphone will be closer to us when driving?</seg>
          <seg id="58">This question is reinforced when considering that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and in most cases will buy the user much more functionality.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Nevertheless, as I used Car Thing more and more, I realized how it could improve the driving experience.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Being able to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I've come to appreciate over the past two weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="61">One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?</seg>
          <seg id="62">And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?</seg>
          <seg id="63">The Swedish company isn't saying much right now.</seg>
          <seg id="64">It hasn't even shared how many test-takers it's currently running worldwide, and how much it plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The only thing we know for sure is that the price is expected to be $79 (about NIS 255).</seg>
          <seg id="66">In the meantime, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse of a concept Spotify has been trying to crack for years.</seg>
          <seg id="67">Spotify Israel said that there is currently no information on a plan to launch the device in Israel.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Spotify wants to upgrade your car: We tested the Car Thing.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Quietly, Spotify began to try its luck in the world of hardware as well.</seg>
          <seg id="3">After years of development, Car Thing was revealed and launched as a small experiment in the USA•</seg>
          <seg id="4">We got our hands on the first device in Israel•</seg>
          <seg id="5">Vision: Make your old vehicles smart.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, built specifically to provide a solution for people who own older cars.</seg>
          <seg id="7">A few weeks ago, I got an initial opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to individual experimenters in the US, here in Israel, and now in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="8">For me, the timing of the delivery was outstanding, as our home car broke down and we had to drive for several days with a replacement vehicle with an old system.</seg>
          <seg id="9">After two weeks of playing around, I realized how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's systems.</seg>
          <seg id="10">On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty regarding a global launch, I believe that many will already prefer to use other solutions.</seg>
          <seg id="11">From idea to reality, it's from reality.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users began to receive an interesting offer in their email inbox  the possibility of purchasing a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity, which will make any old car system smart, making any old car system smart and smart.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times website revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.</seg>
          <seg id="14">A few months later, these rumors made headlines again after the music service updated with the vehicle mode - the same one we know today from the app - which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the system in the car in the car.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Two years have passed since then.</seg>
          <seg id="16">After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled Car Thing, its smart car system, in April.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to deliveries.</seg>
          <seg id="18">So of course, right after the press conference she held, I went to the website and signed up.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Two months later, the long-awaited announcement arrived.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Reconnecting to the site will give me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise - it won't cost me anything.</seg>
          <seg id="21">After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.</seg>

          <seg id="7">כלומר, המשק עדיין נמצא בשוק עבודה שנשלט ברובו על-ידי העובדים והדבר נכון שבעתיים בכל הנוגע לעובדים הנחשקים ביותר – הטאלנטים.</seg>
          <seg id="8">בכל הנוגע לאותם אנשי מקצוע ומנהלים המהווים מוקדי ידע, ניסיון ויכולת מוכחים – המגמות בשוק העבודה מלמדות כי התחרות עליהם, הטאלנטים כפי שהם מכונים על-ידי המעסיקים, עדיין קיימת במלוא הכוח.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="9">המשמעות של זה עבור מעסיקים היא שבמצב שוק העבודה הנוכחי אין להם את הלוקסוס של לנוח על זרי הדפנה אפילו דקה לאחר גיוסו של טאלנט נחשק, שכן ברגע שהוא יכנס בשערי החברה – חברה אחרת כבר תנסה לחטוף אותו אליה.</seg>
          <seg id="10">כלומר, התחרות על הטאלנטים כה עזה שרבים שגם לאחר גיוסם הם ימשיכו לקבל שלל הצעות עבודה מפתות, כאשר 30% מהעובדים אכן עוזבים כחודש בלבד מקבלת המשרה ותחילת העבודה.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">זו הסיבה שמעסיקים נבונים יעברו באופן מידי משלב גיוס הטאלנט לשלב השימור שלו, כאשר הדרך מתחיל בראש ובראשונה בהיערכות מראש ונקיטת יצירתיות כבר בתהליך הקליטה שלו.</seg>
          <seg id="12">תהליך קליטה יעיל, מובנה ומתחשב יגרום לטאלנט להתלהב ממקום העבודה החדש שלו כבר מהיום הראשון ואף לצפות לבאות.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="14">זה לא סוד - שיתוף ומוכנות הארגון |</seg>
          <seg id="15">שתפו את הגורמים שיעבדו איתו על גיוסו, הסבירו להם מדוע הוא חיוני וחשוב לחברה ולתפקיד, וכיצד אתם רואים את תרומתו.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="17">ידע הוא כוח - תיאום ציפיות |</seg>
          <seg id="18">כבר ביום הראשון ערכו עם הטאלנט שיחת תיאום ציפיות.</seg>
          <seg id="19">הכירו את הרקע המקצועי שלו ובדקו איפה הוא רואה את עצמו בעתיד, כדי שתוכלו להציג לו את הכלים המגוונים והייחודיים שאתם ומקום העבודה יכולים לספק לו כדי להגיע לשם.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="20">כולנו אנשים – הכרות אישית |</seg>
          <seg id="21">במהלך ימי הקליטה נסו להכיר את הטאלנט מעבר לתכונותיו המקצועיות והתעניינו בתחביבים ובתחומי העניין שלו.</seg>
          <seg id="22">עובד חדש שמגלים בו עניין ומאפשרים לו לממש ולבטא את עצמו מעבר לגבולות תפקידו יעריך זאת וירצה לשמור על כך.</seg>

          <seg id="23">הסקרנות מקדמת |</seg>
          <seg id="24">כבר בשלב הקליטה אתם יכולים ליצור אטרקטיביות שתגרום לטאלנט לרצות להשתלב מהר.</seg>
          <seg id="25">עשו זאת לאו דווקא על-ידי שיח של בונוסים והטבות, אלא על-ידי חשיפתו לתחום מלהיב או לטכנולוגיה מעניינת, שכן גירויים מסוג זה ליצירתיות מובילים לסקרנות ולעניין גובר במקום העבודה.</seg>
          <seg id="26">כמו כן, עודדו את הטאלנט להשמיע את מחשבותיו ודעותיו לפרויקטים השונים בחברה והבהירו לו שהן חשובות לארגון.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Did you recruit a talent for the company?</seg>
          <seg id="2">That’s how you’ll keep your competitors from "hijacking" them from you.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The economy is still in the labor market that is largely controlled by the workers, and this is more true for the most desirable workers—the talents •</seg>
          <seg id="4">Here are some tips to help you keep the talent working for the company</seg>
          <seg id="5">.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Despite the increase registered in the last month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be one of the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among the OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the CBS).</seg>
          <seg id="7">Meaning, the economy is still in the labor market that is largely controlled by the workers, and this is more true for the most desirable workers—the talents.</seg>
          <seg id="8">As far as those professionals and managers, the centers of proven knowledge, experience and ability, are concerned—the trends in the labor market show that the competition for the talents—as they are named by the employers, is still on.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="9">The meaning of this for employers is that in the current state of the labor market, they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after the recruitment of a desirable talent, because as soon as they enter the company’s gates—another company will already try to kidnap them.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In other words, the competition for talent is so intense that many, even after being hired, will continue to receive a handful of tempting job offers, when 30% of employees actually leave only a month after accepting the position and starting work.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">This is the reason why wise employers will immediately move from the phase of recruiting talent to the phase of retaining it, this begins first and foremost with preparation in advance and being creative early during the process of integration.</seg>
          <seg id="12">An efficient, structured and thoughtful integration process will make the talent enthusiastic about his/her new workplace from the very first day and even look forward to the future.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="13">Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a correct integration process that will help in retaining the new talent:</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="14">It’s not a secret—sharing and organization’s readiness |</seg>
          <seg id="15">Share the factors that will work with them on their recruitment, explain to them why they are essential and important to the company and the position, and how you see their contribution.</seg>
          <seg id="16">A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and understands his/her value, will feel welcome and strive to prove the expectations placed on him/her.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="17">Knowledge is power—coordination of expectations |</seg>
          <seg id="18">Already on the first day, have a meeting with the talent to coordinate expectations.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Get to know their professional background and check where they see themselves in the future, so that you can show them the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide them to get there.</seg>
        </p>

          <seg id="6">Despite the increase registered in the last month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be one of the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among the OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the CBS).</seg>
          <seg id="7">In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is mostly controlled by the workers and this is doubly true when it comes to the most desirable workers - the talents.</seg>
          <seg id="8">As far as those professionals and managers who are centers of proven knowledge, experience and ability are concerned - the trends in the labor market show that the competition for them, the talents as they are called by the employers, still exists in full force.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The meaning of this for employers is that in the current state of the labor market, they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after the recruitment of a desirable talent, because as soon as he enters the company's gates - another company will already try to kidnap him.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In other words, the competition for talent is so intense that many, even after being hired, will continue to receive a host of tempting job offers, when 30% of employees actually leave only a month after accepting the position and starting work.</seg>
          <seg id="11">This is the reason why wise employers will immediately move from the phase of recruiting talent to the phase of retaining it, when the path begins first and foremost with preparation in advance and taking creativity already in the process of absorbing it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">An efficient, structured and thoughtful absorption process will make the talent enthusiastic about his new workplace from the very first day and even look forward to the future.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a correct absorption process that will help in retaining the new talent:</seg>
          <seg id="14">It's not a secret - sharing and organization readiness</seg>
          <seg id="15">Share the factors that will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is essential and important to the company and the position, and how you see his contribution.</seg>
          <seg id="16">A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and understands his value, will feel welcome and strive to prove the expectations placed on him.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Knowledge is power - coordination of expectations</seg>
          <seg id="18">Already on the first day, have a meeting with the talent to coordinate expectations.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Get to know his professional background and check where he sees himself in the future, so that you can show him the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him to get there.</seg>
          <seg id="20">We are all people - personal acquaintance</seg>
          <seg id="21">During the days of absorption, try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and take an interest in his hobbies and interests.</seg>
          <seg id="22">A new employee who shows interest in him and allows him to realize and express himself beyond the limits of his role will appreciate it and want to keep it that way.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Curiosity promotes</seg>
          <seg id="24">Already in the absorption phase you can create an attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Do this not necessarily by talking about bonuses and benefits, but by exposing him to an exciting field or an interesting technology, since this type of stimulation for creativity leads to increased curiosity and interest in the workplace.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Also, encourage the talent to voice their thoughts and opinions on the various projects in the company and make it clear to them that they are important to the organization.</seg>

          <seg id="6">According to the report, this cost is embodied in the consumer electricity tariff, which is expected to rise in the coming months because of the dearth of coal.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In addition, in 2023, an additional surplus of coal use of approximately 900,000 tons is expected, so this will result in an additional cost to the electricity sector for not closing the coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas will remain significantly lower relative to the price of coal.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The report said that the reduction of about one billion shekels in the electricity tariff in 2022 meant a reduction of about 4% in the electricity consumption rate for the household consumer.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about NIS 1 billion, and the total discount that could have been for the home consumer is about 4%.</seg>
          <seg id="10">It should be noted that as part of the reform of the electricity sector, it was decided, inter alia, to establish a subsidiary of the IEC, which will establish units powered by natural gas, designed to replace the 4-1 coal units at the Orot Rabin site.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Following this decision, a government decision was made in July 2018, stating that the 4-1 coal production units at the Orot Rabin power plant should be discontinued.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The decision set timetables, so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, and accordingly the coal production units 4-1 will cease operating at that time.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The IEC said in response: "The policy on the use of fuels is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.</seg>
          <seg id="14">According to the ministry's decisions, for several years a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas."</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="6">האינפלציה המחריפה בישראל, שכבר הגיעה לקצב של יותר מ־4% בשנה האחרונה, תאלץ את בנק ישראל להעלות את הריבית על השקל כבר בשבוע הבא.</seg>
          <seg id="7">הערכות האנליסטים מדברות על שיעור העלאה שנע בין 0.25% ל־0.5%.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="8">אם אכן תעלה הריבית בשיעור של חצי אחוז, היא תעמוד כבר על 1.25%, הרמה הגבוהה זה תשע שנים.</seg>
          <seg id="9">זאת, לאחר שבמשך שנים הריבית במשק היתה קרובה לאפס.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">העלייה החדה בשיעור הריבית מייקרת במאות שקלים את החזרי המשכנתאות ומכבידה בצורה דרסטית על משקי הבית.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">בעזרת שי צרור, מומחה למשכנתאות, בדקנו כמה נשלם יותר ומה מומלץ לעשות כבר עכשיו.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">אם הריבית תעלה בחצי אחוז - בכמה יתייקר התשלום החודשי על המשכנתא?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="13">במשכנתא בסכום של 1.2 מיליון שקל, שמורכבת מ־40% מסלול ריבית פריים, ההחזר החודשי יעלה ב־125 שקלים.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="14">בכמה התייקרה המשכנתא הממוצעת מתחילת השנה?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="15">מתחילת השנה מדובר בעלייה חדה יותר באופן משמעותי.</seg>
          <seg id="16">זאת, משום שגם הריביות ביתר המסלולים שמרכיבים משכנתא (ולא רק במסלול פריים) עלו - במסלול צמוד מדד ובמסלול הריבית הקבועה.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="17">אם הריבית אכן תעלה בחצי אחוז, ההתייקרות תסתכם, לפי הערכתו של צרור, בכ־620 שקלים במשכנתא של כ־1.2 מיליון שקלים.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="18">מסלול הפריים (40% במסלול הזה) ישלים התייקרות של כ־280 שקלים, בהנחה שתהיה עלייה של עוד 0.5% בחודש הבא.</seg>
          <seg id="19">מסלול הריבית המשתנה צמודת מדד (26.7% במסלול הזה) ישלים התייקרות של כ־120 שקלים.</seg>
          <seg id="20">מסלול הריבית הקבועה - לא צמוד מדד (33.3% במסלול הזה) יתייקר ב־220 שקלים.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="21">אז מה מומלץ לעשות כיום?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="22">עבור מי שיש להם משכנתא שרובה צמוד למדד, צרור ממליץ לשקול מיחזור למסלולים שאינם צמודים.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="23">לנוטלי משכנתאות שההחזר החודשי עלה מבחינתם בצורה משמעותית וקשה להם לעמוד בהחזרים - הוא ממליץ לבחון לבצע מיחזור משכנתא ולפרוס אותה מחדש לתקופה ארוכה יותר.</seg>
          <seg id="24">זאת, כדי להפחית את התשלומים למרות העלייה בריבית, שכן עדיף תמיד לעמוד בהחזרים ולא להיות בחדלות פירעון.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="25">לגבי נוטלי משכנתאות חדשים - הוא ממליץ מאוד להכיר את המסלולים השונים ולהתאים את המשכנתא ליכולותיהם הכלכליות.</seg>
          <seg id="26">כך גם בעתיד כשהריביות יירדו הם יוכלו לעשות מיחזור משכנתא עם מינימום עמלות פירעון מוקדם.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="27">לגבי רוכשי דירות מקבלן - צרור ממליץ להקדים תשלומים לקבלן ולקחת משכנתא כעת.</seg>
          <seg id="28">יש להביא בחשבון כי "מדד תשומות הבנייה" מעלה את מחיר הנכס באופן משמעותי גם לאחר שנחתם חוזה הרכישה.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="6">The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the NIS as early as next week.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The analysts’ estimates mention an increase rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.</seg>
        </p>

          <seg id="9">This rise, after the interest rate in the economy has been registered as close to zero for years.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">The sharp increase in the interest rate increases the mortgage repayments by hundreds of NIS and drastically burdens the households.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">With the help of Shai Zror, a mortgage expert, we checked how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">If the interest rate increases by half a percent—how much more expensive will the monthly payment on the mortgage be?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="13">For a mortgage in the amount of 1.2 million NIS, which consists of a 40% prime interest plan, the monthly repayment will increase by 125 NIS.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="14">By how much has the average mortgage become more expensive since the beginning of this year?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="15">Since the beginning of the year, there has been a significantly sharper increase.</seg>
          <seg id="16">This is due to the interest rates have also gone up on the other plans that comprise a mortgage (and not just the prime track)—of the index-linked track and the fixed interest plan.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="17">If the interest rate does go up by half a percent, the increase in price will amount, according to Zror’s estimate, to about 620 NIS on a mortgage of about 1.2 million NIS.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="18">The prime route (40% in this route) will complete a price increase of about 280 NIS, assuming there will be another 0.5% increase next month.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The index-linked variable interest rate (26.7% on this rate) will add up to a price increase of about 120 NIS.</seg>
          <seg id="20">The index-linked variable interest rate (33.3% on this rate) will add up to a price increase of about 220 NIS.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="21">So what is recommended to do today?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="22">For those who have an mostly index-linked mortgage, Zror recommends considering recycling to routes that are not index-linked.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="23">For mortgage holders whose monthly repayments have increased significantly and it is difficult for them to meet the repayments—he recommends looking into recycling a mortgage and redeploying it for a longer period.</seg>
          <seg id="24">This may be done to reduce payments despite the increase in interest, since it is always better to meet the repayments and not be insolvent.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="25">Regarding new mortgage takers—he strongly recommends getting to know the different plans and adapting the mortgage to their financial abilities.</seg>
          <seg id="26">This way in the future, when interest rates drop, they will be able to recycle a mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="27">Regarding apartment purchasers from a contractor—Zror recommends to make early payments to the contractor in advance and to take out a mortgage now.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It should be taken into account that the "construction input index" raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract has been signed.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="29">The price index of residential construction inputs increased by 6.6% in the last year.</seg>
          <seg id="30">considering the price increase of this index, on the day before yesterday the bank supervision authority announced that it is considering ordering the creation of a plan that would allow to include index linked within the mortgages, but the final decision on the issue has not yet been made.</seg>

          <seg id="7">The analysts' estimates talk about an increase rate ranging between 0.25% to 0.5%.</seg>
          <seg id="8">If indeed the interest rate increases by half a percent, it will already stand at 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.</seg>
          <seg id="9">This, after for years the interest rate in the economy was close to zero.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The sharp increase in the interest rate significantly raises the mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and drastically burdens the household economy.</seg>
          <seg id="11">With the help of Shai Tzror, a mortgage expert, we checked how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.</seg>
          <seg id="12">If the interest rate increases by half a percent - how much will the monthly mortgage payment increase?</seg>
          <seg id="13">In a mortgage of 1.2 million shekels, composed of 40% prime interest rate, the monthly repayment will increase by 125 shekels.</seg>
          <seg id="14">How much has the average mortgage increased since the beginning of the year?</seg>
          <seg id="15">Since the beginning of the year, there has been a significantly sharper increase.</seg>
          <seg id="16">This is because the interest rates in the other mortgage components (not just in the prime track) have also increased - in the index-linked track and in the fixed interest rate track.</seg>
          <seg id="17">If the interest rate indeed rises by half a percent, the increase will amount to about 620 shekels, according to Tzror's estimate, on a mortgage of about 1.2 million shekels.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The Prime track (40% in this track) will complete an increase of about 280 shekels, assuming there will be another 0.5% increase next month.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The variable interest rate track linked to the index (26.7% in this track) will complete an increase of about 120 shekels.</seg>
          <seg id="20">The fixed interest rate track - not linked to the index (33.3% in this track) will increase by 220 shekels.</seg>
          <seg id="21">So what is recommended to do today?</seg>
          <seg id="22">For those who have a mortgage that is mostly linked to the index, Tsror recommends considering recycling to non-linked tracks.</seg>
          <seg id="23">For those with mortgages who find their monthly repayments have significantly increased and are struggling to meet them - he recommends considering a mortgage recycling and spreading it over a longer period.</seg>
          <seg id="24">This is to reduce the payments despite the interest rate increase, as it is always better to meet the repayments and not to be in default.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Regarding new mortgage borrowers - he highly recommends getting to know the different paths and adjusting the mortgage to their economic capabilities.</seg>
          <seg id="26">In the future, when the interest rates drop, they will be able to refinance their mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Regarding those who purchase apartments from a contractor - Tzror recommends making payments to the contractor in advance and taking a mortgage now.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It should be taken into account that the "construction inputs index" significantly increases the property price even after the purchase contract has been signed.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The residential construction cost index has risen by 6.6% in the last year.</seg>
          <seg id="30">In light of the increase in this index, the Banking Supervision recently announced that it is considering requiring the inclusion of indexation within mortgages, however, the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.</seg>

          <seg id="6">The worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The analysts' estimates speak of an increase rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.</seg>
          <seg id="8">If the interest rate does rise by half a percent, it will already stand at 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.</seg>
          <seg id="9">This, after for years the interest rate in the economy was close to zero.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The sharp increase in the interest rate increases the mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and drastically burdens the households.</seg>
          <seg id="11">With the help of Shai Zror, a mortgage expert, we checked how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.</seg>
          <seg id="12">If the interest rate increases by half a percent - how much more expensive will the monthly payment on the mortgage be?</seg>
          <seg id="13">For a mortgage in the amount of NIS 1.2 million, which consists of a 40% prime interest track, the monthly repayment will increase by NIS 125.</seg>
          <seg id="14">How much has the average mortgage become more expensive since the beginning of the year?</seg>
          <seg id="15">Since the beginning of the year, this is a significantly sharper increase.</seg>
          <seg id="16">This is because the interest rates on the other tracks that make up a mortgage (and not just the prime track) have also gone up - in the index-linked track and the fixed interest track.</seg>
          <seg id="17">If the interest rate does go up by half a percent, the increase in price will amount, according to Zror's estimate, to about NIS 620 on a mortgage of about NIS 1.2 million.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The prime route (40% in this route) will complete a price increase of about NIS 280, assuming there will be another 0.5% increase next month.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The index-linked variable interest rate (26.7% on this rate) will add up to a price increase of about NIS 120.</seg>
          <seg id="20">The fixed interest track - not linked to an index (33.3% in this track) will become more expensive by NIS 220.</seg>
          <seg id="21">So what is recommended to do today?</seg>
          <seg id="22">For those who have an index-linked rifle mortgage, Saror recommends considering recycling to routes that are not index-linked.</seg>
          <seg id="23">For mortgage holders whose monthly repayments have increased significantly and it is difficult for them to meet the repayments - he recommends looking into recycling a mortgage and redeploying it for a longer period.</seg>
          <seg id="24">This is to reduce payments despite the increase in interest rates, since it is always better to meet the repayments and not be insolvent.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Regarding new mortgage takers - he strongly recommends getting to know the different routes and adapting the mortgage to their financial capabilities.</seg>
          <seg id="26">So also in the future when the interest rates will drop, they will be able to recycle a mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Regarding apartment buyers from a contractor - Seror recommends making payments to the contractor in advance and taking out a mortgage now.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It should be taken into account that the "construction input index" raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract has been signed.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The price index of residential construction inputs increased by 6.6% in the last year.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Against the background of the increase in the price of this index, on Tuesday the supervision of the banks announced that it is considering mandating the creation of a mechanism that would allow the linkages to be included in the mortgages, but the final decision on the issue has not yet been made.</seg>

          <seg id="6">היא מרוויחה על קמפיינים יותר מוונדר וומן, היא יפה מדי, היא יודעת להעמיד במקום את דנה ויס, וכשצריך - גם לסנגר על השותף העסקי שלה.</seg>
          <seg id="7">היא אמא וגם אשת קריירה שמפרסמת בנקים ומזגנים, מדגמנת ומובילה סדרות ותוכניות ריאליטי, ומשמשת עבור בנות צעירות מודל חיקוי בלתי מושג.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Strange to see the comedian, X Comedy Store, host of the Channel 14 show Kabbalah, where he tastes removals and gives mostly men a platform.</seg>
          <seg id="3">If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question What reminds you of the concept of Saturday preparations?</seg>
          <seg id="4">Say: sponges and cleanliness, gas pots and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi, but it would be weird if someone said Gil Sassover.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Because Gil Sassover in the middle of the sponge and cooking is the most unrelated thing that TV can offer.</seg>
          <seg id="6">And really, Kabbalah Shabbat, the new show he hosts on Friday afternoon on Channel 14, is spiritually cut off from the time it airs.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Along half of it - Sassover stands.</seg>
          <seg id="8">He speaks quickly, holding a microphone in his hand even as he tastes dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punchlines and conversations about sainthood.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In his defence, the poverty of the budget is felt, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, what was also felt in the premiere show, which aired yesterday from Benjamin's headquarters, is a clear gender divide.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The men sang, played, danced, spoke Torah, marketed restaurants and factories, while the women made do with a small sewing shop.</seg>

          <seg id="5">"</seg>
          <seg id="6">ניק קייב ביטל מוקדם יותר השבוע הופעה ברוסיה בשל המלחמה והכריז כי הוא "ניצב לצד אוקראינה ומתפלל שהטירוף יסתיים בקרוב".</seg>
          <seg id="7">בכך הצטרף הזמר האוסטרלי המוערך לאמנים וללהקות כמו איגי פופ, גרין דיי ופרנץ פרדיננד, שביטלו גם הם הופעות במדינה הפולשת.</seg>
          <seg id="8">אבל במקרה של קייב הודעת הביטול שלו קיבלה תפנית מעט שונה.</seg>
          <seg id="9">מעריץ טורקי בשם אחמט הטיח בזמר שהוא צבוע, שכן ב-2017 סירב קייב לבטל שתי הופעות שהתקיימו בישראל, למרות הביקורת הרבה שספג מטעם ארגונים פרו-פלשתיניים.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">בעת ביקורו בארץ אמר אז קייב לתקשורת המקומית: "בסופו של דבר, אני נמצא כאן משתי סיבות: הסיבה הראשונה היא מפני שאני אוהב את ישראל ואת הישראלים, והסיבה השנייה היא שאני נגד כל מי שמנסה לצנזר ולהשתיק מוזיקאים".</seg>
          <seg id="11">אותו אחמט זכר היטב את אמירותיו של קייב בעד מוזיקה ונגד פוליטיזציה.</seg>
          <seg id="12">המעריץ אף פרסם באתרו האישי והלא מצונזר של הזמר, "The Red Hand Files", פוסט נוקב שבו טען שגם ישראל היא מדינה כובשת, ולכן מצבה של פלשתין זהה למצבה של אוקראינה.</seg>

          <seg id="13">"מה שמפריע לי לגבי ההודעה שלך על אוקראינה", כתב אחמט. "זה שלא תמכת כך בפלשתינים, הסובלים גם הם ממשטר ברוטאלי.</seg>

          <seg id="15">זה מעציב אותי מאוד, שכן אתה מייצג פה מוסר כפול", סיכם המעריץ הטורקי.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="16">אבל הסיפור לא נגמר כאן, שכן קייב בחר להשיב לאחמט במכתב ארוך ומפורט, שבו הדגיש כי "הפלישה של רוסיה לאוקראינה שונה מאוד מהקונפליקט המתמשך בין ישראל לפלשתינים.</seg>
          <seg id="17">המצב הראשון הוא תקיפה ללא התגרות קודמת של מדינה אחת בשכנתה, בתקווה לשנות את הסדר הביטחוני של אירופה כולה.</seg>
          <seg id="18">המצב השני הוא חיכוך מורכב בין שני עמים.</seg>
          <seg id="19">הקונפליקטים אמנם דומים בכך שאנשים תמימים, אשר חולקים גורל טרגי, נאלצים להסתתר במקלטים.</seg>
          <seg id="20">אני חש סימפתיה רבה לכל הקהילות הללו - לא משנה היכן הן נמצאות ובמי מדובר".</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="21">קייב הוסיף כי אף שהוא לא מעוניין לפרט את דעותיו בנוגע לקונפליקט הישראלי-פלשתיני, הוא בהחלט תומך גם בפלשתינים, וציין שב-20 השנים האחרונות הרבה להשתתף באירועי התרמה למענם.</seg>
          <seg id="22">"אבל זה לא זמן לוויכוחים, אחמט", הבהיר הזמר, "זה זמן להתאחד ולתמוך באוקראינים, שכרגע מתחוללת על אדמתם קטסטרופה.</seg>
          <seg id="23">יש לי מעריצים נהדרים ברוסיה, ואני יודע שרוסים רבים מתנגדים בתוקף לפעולות משטרו של פוטין.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Nick Cave responds to criticism</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="3">The singer addressed the criticism thrown at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of having double standards •</seg>
          <seg id="4">The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict</seg>
          <seg id="5">“</seg>
          <seg id="6">Earlier this week, Nick Cave canceled a show in Russia due to the war and declared that he "stands by Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon".</seg>
          <seg id="7">In doing so, the acclaimed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled performances in the invading country.</seg>
          <seg id="8">But in Cave’s case his cancellation announcement took a slightly different turn.</seg>
          <seg id="9">A Turkish fan named Ahmet announced the singer to be a hypocrite, since in 2017 Cave refused to cancel two concerts that took place in Israel, despite the heavy criticism he received from pro-Palestinian organizations.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">During his visit to Israel, Cave told the local media: "Ultimately, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians".</seg>
          <seg id="11">The same Ahmet remembered very well Cave’s statements in favor of music and against politicization.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The fan even published on the singer’s personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", a poignant post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying country, and therefore the situation of Palestine is the same as that of Ukraine.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="13">"What bothers me about your message about Ukraine", Ahmet wrote. "Is the fact that you did not support the Palestinians the same way, since they also suffer from a brutal regime.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is first and foremost the factor responsible for the Palestinian suffering.</seg>
          <seg id="15">It saddens me a lot, as you present double standard here", the Turkish fan concluded.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="16">But the story does not end here, as Cave chose to reply to Ahmet in a long and detailed letter, in which he emphasized that "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The first situation is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, hoping to change the security order of Europe as a whole.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The second situation is a complex friction between two nations.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The conflicts are indeed similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I feel a lot of sympathy for all these communities—no matter where they are and who it is".</seg>

          <seg id="2">Nick Cave responds to criticism.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The singer responded to criticism leveled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."</seg>
          <seg id="5">"</seg>
          <seg id="6">Earlier this week, Nick Cave cancelled a performance in Russia due to the war and announced that he "stands with Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon."</seg>
          <seg id="7">In doing so, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands like Iggy Pop, Green Day, and Franz Ferdinand, who also cancelled performances in the invading country.</seg>
          <seg id="8">But in the case of Kiev, his cancellation notice took a slightly different turn.</seg>
          <seg id="9">A Turkish fan named Ahmet accused the singer of being hypocritical, as in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two performances that took place in Israel, despite the heavy criticism he received from pro-Palestinian organizations.</seg>
          <seg id="10">During his visit to the country, Kaye told the local media: "Ultimately, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."</seg>
          <seg id="11">The same Achmat vividly remembered Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The fan even published on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", a pointed post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying country, therefore Palestine's situation is identical to Ukraine's.</seg>
          <seg id="13">"What bothers me about your statement on Ukraine," wrote Achmet, "is that you didn't similarly support the Palestinians, who are also suffering from a brutal regime."</seg>
          <seg id="14">In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is primarily the party responsible for the Palestinian suffering.</seg>
          <seg id="15">"It saddens me a lot, because you represent a double standard here," concluded the Turkish fan.</seg>
          <seg id="16">But the story doesn't end here, as Kyiv chose to respond to Achmat with a long and detailed letter, emphasizing that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The first scenario is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, in the hope of changing the entire security order of Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The second situation is a complex conflict between two nations.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.</seg>
          <seg id="20">I feel a lot of sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are and who they are.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Kyiv added that although he does not want to detail his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly also supports the Palestinians, and noted that he has participated in many fundraising events for them over the past 20 years.</seg>
          <seg id="22">"But this is not a time for arguments, Achmat," clarified the singer, "It's a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, as a catastrophe is currently happening on their land."</seg>

          <seg id="1">דו"ח מבקר המדינה: התקציב בפועל ברוב שנות פעילות ועדת סל התרופות – קטן מהתקציב המומלץ</seg>
          <seg id="2">על פי הדו"ח של מתניהו אנגלמן, במשך יותר מ-20 שנות פעילות הסל – משרד הבריאות לא פיקח על פעילות הוועדה •</seg>
          <seg id="3">עוד נכתב בדו"ח כי פרוטוקולי הישיבות הישיבות מתפרסמים באיחור משמעותי, אם בכלל •</seg>
          <seg id="4">כמו כן, המבקר ממליץ להגביר את שקיפות פעילות ועדת המשנה – ולעדכן את נהלי עבודת הסל •</seg>
          <seg id="5">ליקוי נוסף שנמצא נוגע לכך שמאז שהוועדה החלה את פעילות, משרד הבריאות לא ביקש מקופות החולים דיווחים על היקף השימושים וניצול התרופות שבסל – מה שהיה מאפשר לנתח ולבקר את התקציב שניתן להן.</seg>
          <seg id="6">ועדת סל התרופות היא אחת הוועדות הציבוריות המשפיעות ביותר על חיי היומיום שלנו ועל בריאותנו.</seg>
          <seg id="7">מדי שנה, מחליטה הוועדה על תרופות חדשות שיינתנו לציבור ללא תשלום באמצעות קופות החולים – אך דו"ח חדש של מבקר המדינה שפורסם היום (שלישי) מתריע כי זו פועלת במשך יותר מ-20 שנה מבלי שנעשו דו"חות בקרה על פעילותה ומבלי שמשרד הבריאות ומועצת הבריאות מפקחים ובוחנים את פעילותה.</seg>
          <seg id="8">כתב "ישראל היום", רן רזניק, מוסיף כי חקירת מבקר המדינה נערכה בעקבות החשיפות המתמשכות ב״ישראל היום״ על מחדלי סל התרופות.</seg>
          <seg id="9">על פי הדו"ח של מתניהו אנגלמן, הוא ממליץ "לבצע בתהליך הרחבת הסל תיקונים ושיפורים, שיביאו למיצוי איכותי יותר של תקציב סל שירותי הבריאות שהציבור זכאי לו".</seg>
          <seg id="10">לאורך כל שנות קיומו של מנגנון התוספת לסל התרופות, בשנים 2021-1998 נוספו לתקציב המדינה תרופות בסך שמונה מיליארד שקלים – כאשר התוספת נעה מדי שנה בסכומים שנעים בין 0 ל-500 מיליון שקלים.</seg>
          <seg id="11">בשנים 2019, 2020 ו-2021 הוגשו בקשות להוספת כ-800 תרופות וטכנולוגיות חדשות לסל שירותי הבריאות, בעלות שנתית כוללת של יותר משני מיליארד שקלים.</seg>
          <seg id="12">בפועל, התקציב שהוקצה להרחבת הסל היה קטן מהיקף הבקשות.</seg>
          <seg id="13">ברוב שנות פעולת הוועדה (90% מהזמן), גובה התוספת התקציבית היה קטן מ-1.5% של סל הבריאות, שיעור שהומלץ על ידי ועדות שונות כשיעור התוספת הרצוי.</seg>
          <seg id="14">המבקר מציין כי יש צורך לבחון ולהסדיר את גובה התוספת השנתית במטרה לאפשר ודאות ותכנון ארוך טווח.</seg>
          <seg id="15">עוד ציין אנגלמן כי "מודל השקיפות בעבודת הסל לוקה בחסר".</seg>
          <seg id="16">כך, למשל, נוהל עבודת ועדת הסל קובע כי פרוטוקולי הישיבות, שהינן סגורות לציבור, יתפרסם בתוך 60 ימים, אך בפועל הפרוטוקולים מתפרסמים בעיכוב 160-109 ימים, כאשר לעיתים פרוטוקולי הישיבות הסופיות לא מתפרסמים כלל.</seg>
          <seg id="17">"העיכוב בפרסום הפרוטוקולים פוגע בשקיפות ההחלטות; בשל כך, עלולה להיפגע היכולת של מגישי ההצעות – ארגוני חולים וחברות התרופות – להגיש בקשות חוזרות בהקדם האפשרי והרלוונטי, לאחר שהפיקו לקחים מדחיית הצעותיהם, ניתחו את הסיבות לאי-הצלחתם בסבב הקודם, שיפרו ותיקנו את הצעותיהם וביצעו הערכה מחודשת באשר להיתכנות לקבלתן בסבב הבא", ציין המבקר בדו"ח.</seg>
          <seg id="18">"על משרד הבריאות לפרסם את הפרוטוקולים בהתאם ללוחות הזמנים הקבועים בנוהל".</seg>
          <seg id="19">מתוך אלפי הגשות – הוגשה רק הערה כלכלית אחת</seg>
          <seg id="20">ביקורת נוספת של אנגלמן נוגעת להליך מקדמי של הערכת הטכנולוגיות המוגשות לסל התרופות.</seg>
          <seg id="21">המבקר מצא שכמחצית (46%) מהטכנולוגיות שהוגשו לא עברו את השלב הזה, אך משרד הבריאות לא מפרסם את הנימוקים לדחייה.</seg>
          <seg id="22">ליקוי נוסף נוגע לפעילות ועדת המשנה של סל התרופות שסגורה לתקשורת ולציבור, ושבה נידונים מספרי חולים ועלויות של תרופות.</seg>
          <seg id="23">המבקר ממליץ לצרף נציג ציבור או לבחון אפשרות לפרסם לציבור את הדיונים ללא פרטים מסחריים חסויים.</seg>
          <seg id="24">בנוהל שלפיו פועלת ועדת סל שירותי הבריאות נקבע כי "יש להגיש הערכה כלכלית" לבקשה להוספת תרופה לסל.</seg>
          <seg id="25">אך בפועל, לאורך השנים הוגשה רק הערכה כלכלית אחת מתוך אלפי הגשות – והוועדה מקבלת את החלטותיה ללא הערכה כלכלית.</seg>
          <seg id="26">לדוגמה, לדיוני ועדת הסל לשנים 2021-2019 הוגשו בקשות להוסיף לסל תרופות נגד השמנה.</seg>
          <seg id="27">מהדו"ח עלה כי לבקשות לא צורפו הערכות כלכליות, לרבות הערכה של הסכום שהיה אפשר לחסוך בשל צמצום נזקי מחלות שמקורן בהשמנה או בשל היכולת להימנע מניתוחי קיצור קיבה.</seg>
          <seg id="28">עוד עולה כי החלטות ועדת סל התרופות לא עולות בקנה אחד עם היעדים והאסטרטגיה של משרד הבריאות.</seg>
          <seg id="29">כך, למשל, משרד הבריאות הגדיר ב-2019 את הרפואה המונעת וההיערכות לטיפול בגידול במחלות כרוניות כיעדים, אך במסגרת ההחלטות בדבר הרחבת הסל לא הושם דגש על הצורך בהשגת יעדים אלו.</seg>
          <seg id="30">המבקר מתריע גם כי מאז 2011 נכללים בסל התרופות גם שירותים שאינם באחריות קופות החולים, בהם מכשירי שיקום וניידות וחיסונים שונים, שניתנים על ידי משרד הבריאות ("התוספת השלישית").</seg>
          <seg id="31">זאת, כאשר המסגרת החוקית לצעד זה מוסדרת רק בדיעבד.</seg>
          <seg id="32">בשש השנים האחרונות, נעשה שימוש ב-74 מיליון שקלים מהתוספת לסל התרופות עבור שירותים אלו.</seg>
          <seg id="33">אנגלמן ממליץ למשרד הבריאות לעדכן את נהלי עבודת הסל וגם לקבוע האם יש צורך בתוספת כספית נפרדת עבור שירותים אלו.</seg>
          <seg id="34">כשליש מתרופות החדשות שנכנסות לסל התרופות מוגדרות כ"תרופות ללא תוספת עלות", שהשימוש בהן אינו עולה לקופות החולים בסכום נוסף משום שהן מחליפות טיפול קיים.</seg>
          <seg id="35">המבקר מציע לבחון אפשרות שתרופות אלו יידונו במסלול אחר ומקוצר, כך שניתן יהיה לעדכן את סל התרופות מספר פעמים בשנה ולא רק אחת לשנה.</seg>
          <seg id="36">אין פיקוח על השימוש בתרופות יקרות במיוחד.</seg>
          <seg id="37">מהביקורת עולה גם כי מאז החלה עבודת ועדת הסל לפני 20 שנה, משרד הבריאות לא ביקש מקופות החולים לדווח ולא פיקח על היקף השימושים וניצול התרופות שבסל, מידע שיכול היה לאפשר למשרד לנתח ולבקר את התקציב שניתן לקופות.</seg>
          <seg id="38">לאורך השנים פורסמו רק שני דו"חות שמתייחסים לשנים 2009-2006, וגם אלה פורסמו באיחור ניכר (האחרון פורסם השנה ועסק בניצול התקציב בשנים 2009-2007).</seg>
          <seg id="39">"העיכוב בביצוע בדיקות עלול להביא לקושי באיסוף הנתונים ובניתוחם, לאי-רלוונטיות של המסקנות העולות מהבדיקה אחרי תקופה כה ארוכה, לתמחור לא מיטבי של ועדת המשנה ולקבלת החלטות המבוססות על ממצאים לא סופיים", נכתב בדו"ח.</seg>
          <seg id="40">כמו כן, המשרד גם לא מבקר ומפקח על השימושים בתרופות יקרות במיוחד ולא ביצע הפקת לקחים.</seg>
          <seg id="41">מדובר על 10 תרופות שהיוו 62% מהתוספת לסל (1.7 מיליארד שקלים בשנים 2021-2016).</seg>
          <seg id="42">על כך, כתב המבקר: "מומלץ כי משרד הבריאות יבצע בקרות פרטניות על תרופות וטכנולוגיות אלו וינתח את היקף השימוש בהן לעומת האומדנים.</seg>
          <seg id="43">בקרות וניתוח יאפשרו להסיק מסקנות מערכתיות על תהליך העבודה של ועדת הסל וועדת המשנה, ועל אופן הכנת האומדנים בעת תמחור התרופות והטכנולוגיות ולשפרם".</seg>

          <seg id="1">The State Comptroller’s report: the actual budget in most years of activity of the Medicines Basket Committee is smaller than the recommended budget</seg>
          <seg id="2">According to the report by Matanyahu Engelman, for more than 20 years of activity of the Medicines Basket – the Ministry of Health did not supervise the activity of the committee •</seg>
          <seg id="3">The report also states that the protocols of the meetings are published at a significant delay, if at all •</seg>
          <seg id="4">Also, the comptroller recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee’s activity – and updating the procedures for the work of the basket •</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another discrepancy found relates to the fact that ever since the committee began its activities, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the scope of uses and utilization of the medicines in the basket – which would have allowed for the analysis and control of the budget given to them.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Medicines Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Every year, the committee decides on new medicines that will handed to the public free of charge through the health insurance funds – but a new report by the State Comptroller published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without issuing any controlled reports on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervise and review its activities.</seg>
          <seg id="8">“Israel Hayom” correspondent, Ran Reznik, adds that the State Comptroller’s investigation was conducted following the ongoing expose in “Israel Hayom” about the failures of the medicine basket.</seg>
          <seg id="9">According to Matanyahu Engelman’s report, he recommends “to carry out corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will lead to a better utilization of the health services basket budget that the public is entitled to”.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Throughout the years of the existence of the mechanism of the addition to the basket of medicines, in the years 1998–2021, medicines totaling eight billion shekels were added to the state budget – with the addition varying annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new medicines and technologies to the basket of health services, with a total annual cost of more than two billion shekels.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In practice, the budget allocated to expand the basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.</seg>
          <seg id="13">In most of the years of the commission’s operation (90% of the time), the amount of the budget supplement was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The comptroller points out that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual supplement in order to enable certainty and long-term planning.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Engelman also noted that “the transparency model in the basket work is lacking”.</seg>
          <seg id="16">This is how, for example, the work procedure of the basket’s committee determines that the meetings’ protocols, which are closed to the public, will be published in 60 days, but in reality the protocols get published with a delay of 109–160 days, while the final meetings’ protocols sometimes don’t get published at all.</seg>
          <seg id="17">“The delay in publishing the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; because of this, the ability of the bidders – patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies – to submit repeated applications as soon as possible and relevant, after they have learned from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and corrected their proposals and carried out a renewed assessment regarding the possibility of accepting them in the next round”, the comptroller noted in the report.</seg>
          <seg id="18">“The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules established in the procedure”.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Out of thousands of submissions – only one financial comment was submitted</seg>
          <seg id="20">Another criticism of Engelman concerns the preliminary procedure of the evaluation of the technologies submitted to the medicine basket.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The comptroller found that about half (46%) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for rejection.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Another shortcoming concerns the activity of the sub-committee of the medicine basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The comptroller recommends to add a representative of the public or to examine a possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without the commercial details that are confidential.</seg>
          <seg id="24">In the procedure according to which the health services basket committee operates, it is established that “an economic evaluation must be submitted” for a request to add a drug to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="25">But in practice, over the years, only one economic evaluation was submitted out of thousands of submissions – and the committee makes its decisions without an economic evaluation.</seg>
          <seg id="26">For example, for the discussions of the basket committee for the years 2019–2021, requests were submitted to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="27">What derived from the report was that the requests were not accompanied by economic assessments, including an assessment of the amount that could be saved due to reducing the damage caused by obesity-related diseases or due to the ability to avoid gastric bypass surgery.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It also appears that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparation for the treatment of the increase in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The comptroller also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the health insurance funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccinations, provided by the Ministry of Health (“the third supplement”) have also been included in the medicine basket.</seg>
          <seg id="31">This, when the legal framework for this step is regulated only retrospectively.</seg>
          <seg id="32">In the last six years, 74 million NIS from the addition to the medicine basket were used for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the procedures for the work of the basket and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is necessary for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="34">About a third of the new drugs that enter the medicine basket are defined as “drugs without additional cost”, the use of which does not cost the health insurance funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.</seg>
          <seg id="35">The comptroller suggests examining the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and shortened route, so that the basket of medicines can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.</seg>
          <seg id="36">There is no supervision of the use of particularly expensive drugs.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The comptroller also shows that since the basket committee’s work began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health did not ask the health funds to report and did not monitor the scope of uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and control the budget given to the funds.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Over the years, only two reports have been published that refer to the years 2006–2009, and these were also published considerably late (the last one was published this year and dealt with the utilization of the budget in 2007–2009).</seg>
          <seg id="39">“The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulty in collecting the data and analyzing it, to the irrelevance of the conclusions emerging from the test after such a long period of time, to suboptimal pricing by the subcommittee and to making decisions based on inconclusive findings”, the report states.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Also, the ministry does not audit nor supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not learned lessons.</seg>
          <seg id="41">These are 10 medicines that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion NIS in 2016–2021).</seg>
          <seg id="42">On this, the comptroller wrote: “It is recommended that the Ministry of Health carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the scope of their use compared to the estimates.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the sub-committee, and about how the estimates are prepared when pricing the drugs and technologies and improve them”.</seg>

          <seg id="16">For example, the work procedure of the Basket Committee stipulates that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, should be published within 60 days, but in practice, the minutes are published with a delay of 109-160 days, and sometimes the final meeting minutes are not published at all.</seg>
          <seg id="17">"The delay in publishing the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; as a result, the ability of the proposal submitters - patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies - to submit repeat requests as soon as possible and relevantly may be impaired, after they have learned from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and corrected their proposals and conducted a renewed assessment of the likelihood of their acceptance in the next round," the auditor stated in the report.</seg>
          <seg id="18">"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols according to the schedules set in the procedure."</seg>
          <seg id="19">Out of thousands of submissions - only one economic comment was submitted.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Another criticism by Engelman relates to the preliminary process of evaluating the technologies proposed for the drug basket.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The reviewer found that nearly half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for rejection.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Another deficiency relates to the subcommittee's activity on the drug basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where the number of patients and the cost of drugs are discussed.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The reviewer recommends adding a public representative or examining the possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without private commercial details.</seg>
          <seg id="24">According to the procedure by which the Health Services Basket Committee operates, it is determined that "an economic assessment" must be submitted for a request to add a drug to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="25">But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions - and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.</seg>
          <seg id="26">For example, for the 2019-2021 basket committee discussions, requests were submitted to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The report revealed that economic assessments were not attached to the requests, including an estimate of the amount that could be saved by reducing damage from diseases caused by obesity or the ability to avoid gastric bypass surgeries.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It also appears that the decisions of the Drug Basket Committee do not align with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.</seg>
          <seg id="29">For example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparation for treating the increase in chronic diseases as goals, but in the decisions regarding the expansion of the health basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The auditor also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the health funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health ("the third supplement"), have been included in the drug basket.</seg>
          <seg id="31">This, when the legal framework for this step is only arranged retrospectively.</seg>
          <seg id="32">In the last six years, 74 million shekels from the addition to the drug basket have been used for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Engelman recommends the Ministry of Health to update the basket work procedures and also to determine whether there is a need for a separate financial supplement for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="34">A third of the new drugs added to the medicine basket are defined as "no additional cost drugs", which do not cost the health funds any additional amount because they replace an existing treatment.</seg>
          <seg id="35">The reviewer suggests examining the possibility that these drugs will be handled in a different and shorter track, so that the drug basket can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.</seg>
          <seg id="36">There is no supervision over the use of particularly expensive drugs.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The review also reveals that since the Basket Committee began its work 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds to report and has not supervised the extent of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and control the budget given to the funds.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Over the years, only two reports have been published that refer to the years 2006-2009, and even these were published with a noticeable delay (the last one was published this year and dealt with the budget utilization in the years 2007-2009).</seg>
          <seg id="39">"The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulties in data collection and analysis, irrelevance of the conclusions drawn from the test after such a long period, suboptimal pricing of the subcommittee, and decisions based on preliminary findings," the report states.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Also, the office does not monitor and supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not conducted a lesson learning process.</seg>
          <seg id="41">We are talking about 10 drugs that constituted 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion shekels in the years 2021-2016).</seg>
          <seg id="42">Regarding this, the critic wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct private inspections on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use compared to the estimates.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Audits and analysis will allow systemic conclusions to be drawn about the work process of the Basket Committee and the subcommittee, and about the method of preparing estimates when pricing drugs and technologies, and to improve them.</seg>

          <seg id="2">According to Netanyahu Engelman's report, for more than 20 years of the basket's activity - the Ministry of Health did not supervise the committee's activities •</seg>
          <seg id="3">The report also states that the minutes of the sittings are published significantly late, if at all •</seg>
          <seg id="4">In addition, the auditor recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activities - and updating the basket work procedures •</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another defect that was found concerns the fact that since the committee began its activities, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the extent of use and utilization of the drugs in the basket - which would have made it possible to analyze and audit the budget given to them.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Medicines Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Every year, the committee decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the health funds - but a new report by the State Comptroller published on Tuesday warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without control reports on its activities and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervising and examining its activities.</seg>
          <seg id="8">"Israel Hayom" correspondent Ran Resnik adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing disclosures in "Israel Hayom" about the omissions in the drug basket.</seg>
          <seg id="9">According to Netanyahu Engelman's report, he recommends "making corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will lead to a better utilization of the health care basket budget that the public is entitled to."</seg>
          <seg id="10">Throughout the years of the existence of the addition mechanism to the basket of medicines, in the years 1998-2021, medicines totaling eight billion shekels were added to the state budget - with the addition ranging annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the health care basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In practice, the budget allocated for expanding the basket was smaller than the volume of requests.</seg>
          <seg id="13">In most of the years of the committee's operation (90% of the time), the amount of the budget supplement was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The auditor notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual increment in order to allow certainty and long-term planning.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Engelman also noted that "the transparency model in the basket work is lacking."</seg>
          <seg id="16">Thus, for example, the procedure for the work of the basket committee states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 160-109 days, when sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.</seg>

          <seg id="21">The auditor found that about half (46%) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Another deficiency concerns the activities of the drug basket subcommittee, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The auditor recommends that a public representative be attached or that the possibility be explored of publishing the discussions to the public without confidential commercial details.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The procedure according to which the Health Services Basket Committee operates states that "an economic assessment must be submitted" for an application to add a medicine to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="25">But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions - and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.</seg>
          <seg id="26">For example, for the 2021-2019 basket committee hearings, applications were submitted to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.</seg>

          <seg id="36">There is no oversight of the use of extremely expensive drugs.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The audit also shows that since the work of the basket committee began 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds to report and has not monitored the extent of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the funds.</seg>

          <seg id="40">The ministry also does not audit and monitor the use of extremely expensive drugs and has not learned any lessons.</seg>
          <seg id="41">These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2021-2016).</seg>

          <seg id="5">Another flaw is that since the committee started, the Ministry of Health has not asked the hospitals to report on the volume of use and utilization of the drugs in Basel X, which would allow them to analyze and control the budget given to them.</seg>

          <seg id="14">The complainant notes that the amount of the annual premium should be reviewed and adjusted in order to allow for certainty and long-term planning.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Angelman also noted that "the transparency model in basketball work is lacking".</seg>
          <seg id="16">Thus, for example, the rules of procedure of the Basketball Committee stipulate that minutes of meetings, which are closed to the public, are to be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published 160-109 days late, with sometimes the final minutes of meetings not being published at all.</seg>
          <seg id="17">"The delay in publishing protocols impairs the transparency of decisions; therefore, it may affect the ability of proposers  hospital organizations and pharmaceutical companies  to reapply as soon as possible and appropriately, after having learned from their rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and corrected their proposals, and made a reassessment as to their readiness to be accepted in the next round", the reviewer noted in the report.</seg>
          <seg id="18">"The Ministry of Health should publish the protocols according to the schedules established in the protocol".</seg>
          <seg id="19">Of the thousands of submissions, only one financial comment was submitted.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Another criticism of Engelman concerns the preliminary procedure of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.</seg>

          <seg id="22">Another deficiency concerns the operation of the subcommittee of the drug basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.</seg>

          <seg id="24">The procedure of the Health Services Basket Committee states that "an economic assessment" must be submitted for a request to add a drug to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="25">But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.</seg>
          <seg id="26">For example, for the 2021-2019 Basket Committee hearings, requests were made to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.</seg>

          <seg id="29">For example, the Ministry of Health in 2019 defined prevention medicine and preparation for the treatment of cancer growth in chronic diseases as targets, but the decisions on the expansion of the basket did not emphasize the need to achieve these goals.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The complainant also warns that since 2011 the medicine basket has also included non-hospital insurance services, including rehabilitation and portable devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health ("third supplement").</seg>
          <seg id="31">That's when the legal framework for this step is only set in the past tense.</seg>
          <seg id="32">In the last six years, 74 million shekels from the supplement to the medicine basket have been used for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Angelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="34">About one-third of the new drugs that come into the drug basket are defined as "no-cost drugs", which don't cost the health insurance companies extra because they replace existing treatments.</seg>
          <seg id="35">The reviewer proposes to explore the possibility of these drugs being marketed in a different and shorter route, so that the medicine basket can be updated several times a year instead of just once a year.</seg>

          <seg id="39">"Delays in testing may lead to difficulties in data collection and analysis, irrelevance of conclusions after such a long time, subcommittee bias and decisions based on incomplete findings", the report said.</seg>

          <seg id="15">Engelmann also noted that "the transparency model of basketwork is flawed".</seg>
          <seg id="16">For example, the Hassel Committee's working procedure states that minutes of meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 160-109 days, while sometimes the minutes of final meetings are not published at all.</seg>

          <seg id="19">Of the thousands of submissions, only one economic comment was submitted.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Another criticism of Engelmann concerns the preliminary process of assessing technologies submitted to the drug basket.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The reviewer found that half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the postponement.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Another discrepancy concerns the activities of the subcommittee of the medicine basket which is closed to the media and the public, and in which patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The critic recommends that a public representative be included or that the public debate be made public without any commercial details being kept confidential.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The procedure that the Health Care Basket Committee follows states that "a financial evaluation must be submitted" to a request to add a drug to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="25">But in practice, over the years, only one economic evaluation has been submitted out of thousands of submissions  and the committee makes its decisions without an economic evaluation.</seg>

          <seg id="27">The report found that the requests were not accompanied by economic estimates, including an estimate of the amount that could be saved by reducing the damage of obesity-related diseases or by being able to avoid gastric bypass surgery.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It also appears that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.</seg>
          <seg id="29">For example, the Ministry of Health in 2019 defined preventive medicine and the evaluation of the treatment of tumors in chronic diseases as targets, but in the framework of the decisions on the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these targets.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The critic also warns that since 2011 the medicine basket also includes services that are not the responsibility of the hospital funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, given by the Ministry of Health ("Third Supplement").</seg>
          <seg id="31">That is, when the legal framework for this step is only vaguely regulated.</seg>
          <seg id="32">In the last six years, NIS 74 million from the supplement to the drug basket has been used for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Engelmann recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work protocols and also determine whether a separate fee is required for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="34">About a third of the new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as "no-cost drugs", which do not cost the patient any extra money because they replace existing treatment.</seg>
          <seg id="35">The reviewer suggests that the possibility of these drugs being tested on a different, shorter route be considered, so that the drug basket can be updated several times a year instead of just once a year.</seg>
          <seg id="36">There's no oversight of the use of very expensive drugs.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The audit also found that since the Basel Committee began its work 20 years ago, the Health Department has not asked the health funds to report and has not monitored the extent of the use and utilization of Basel medications, information that would have allowed the department to analyze and control the budget allocated to the funds.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Over the years, only two reports were published, relating to the years 2009-2006, and these were also published with considerable delay (the last one was published in 2007 and dealt with the use of the budget in 2009-2007).</seg>
          <seg id="39">"Delays in testing may result in difficulty in data collection and analysis, in irrelevant conclusions from testing after such a long period, in subcommittee bias and in decisions based on incomplete findings", the report said.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The office also doesn't inspect and monitor the use of very expensive drugs and hasn't conducted any tests.</seg>
          <seg id="41">These 10 drugs accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion NIS in 2021-2016).</seg>
          <seg id="42">On this, the reviewer wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct individual inspections of these drugs and technologies and analyze their use versus estimates.</seg>
          <seg id="43">The controls and analysis will allow systematic conclusions to be drawn about the work process of the Basel Committee on Subcommittees, and how to prepare and improve estimates when pricing drugs and technologies".</seg>

          <seg id="1">State Comptroller Report: The actual budget for most years of the Medicare Basket committee  is less than the recommended budget</seg>
          <seg id="2">According to the report by Matthew Engelmann, for more than 20 years of the Hassle activity, the Ministry of Health did not supervise the activities of the committee.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The report also states that the minutes of the meetings are published with substantial delay, if at all.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The evaluator also recommends increasing the transparency of the sub-committee's work and updating the procedures for the work of the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another deficiency found concerns the fact that since the commission began operation, the Ministry of Health has not asked the hospital funds for reports on the extent of use and utilization of the drugs in the database  which would allow to analyze and control the budget allocated to them.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Drug Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees in our daily lives and our health.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Every year, the committee decides on new medicines that will be given to the public free of charge through the hospital funds. But a new report by the State Auditor published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without being monitored and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council monitored and investigated its activity.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Israel Today reporter Ren Reznik adds that the state complainant was investigated following Israel Today's ongoing disclosures of drug cartels.</seg>
          <seg id="9">According to the report by Mathieu Engelman, he recommends "reforms and improvements in the expansion of the basket, leading to a better utilization of the health care basket budget to which the public is entitled".</seg>
          <seg id="10">Over the years of the existence of the drug basket supplement mechanism, in the years 2021-1998 drugs were added to the state budget for a total of eight billion NIS, with the supplement moving annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million NIS.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add some 800 new drugs and technologies to the health care basket, with a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In practice, the budget allocated to the expansion of the basket was less than the scope of the requests.</seg>
          <seg id="13">For most of the commission's tenure (90% of the time), the size of the budget surcharge was less than 1.5% of the health care basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired surcharge rate.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The critic points out that the annual supplement needs to be examined and adjusted in order to allow certainty and long-term planning.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Engelman also noted that "the transparency model of basket work is lacking".</seg>
          <seg id="16">For example, the ESC's working procedure stipulates that the minutes of meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 160-109 days, while sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.</seg>
          <seg id="17">"The delay in publication of protocols impairs the transparency of decisions; therefore, it may harm the ability of bidders  patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies  to re-apply as soon as is practicable and relevant, after having learnt lessons from their bids that were rejected, analysed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and revised their bids and reevaluated their re-admission to the next round", the reviewer stated in the report.</seg>
          <seg id="18">"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols according to the timeframes established in the protocol".</seg>
          <seg id="19">Out of thousands of submissions, only one economic comment was submitted.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Another criticism of Engelman concerns the preliminary process of assessing technologies submitted to the drug basket.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The reviewer found that half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the postponement.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Another discrepancy concerns the activities of the Medicine Basket subcommittee, which is closed to the media and the public and in which patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The critic recommends attaching a public representative or exploring the possibility of making the discussions public without commercial details that are confidential.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The policy under which the Health Care Board operates is that "a financial assessment must be submitted" for a request to add a drug to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="25">But in practice, over the years, only one economic evaluation has been submitted out of thousands of submissions and the commission makes its decisions without a financial evaluation.</seg>
          <seg id="26">For example, the 2021-2019 Basket Committee hearings were requested to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The report found that economic calculations were not added to the requests, including an estimate of the amount that could be saved by reducing the harms of obesity-related disease or by being able to avoid gastric bypass surgery.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It also appears that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and evaluation for the treatment of cancer in chronic diseases as targets, but in the framework of decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The critic also warns that since 2011, the medication basket also includes services that are not the responsibility of the hospital funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, given by the Ministry of Health ("The Third Supplement").</seg>
          <seg id="31">That's when the legal framework for this step is only loosely regulated.</seg>
          <seg id="32">For the last six years, NIS 74 million from the pharmacy fund has been used for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Engelmann recommends that the Health Ministry update the basket work protocols and also determine if a separate surcharge is required for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="34">About a third of the new drugs coming into the marketplace are defined as "no-cost drugs", which don't cost the patient extra money because they replace existing treatment.</seg>
          <seg id="35">The critic proposes to study the possibility of these drugs being administered in a different and shorter route, so that the drug basket can be updated several times a year rather than just once a year.</seg>
          <seg id="36">There's no control over the use of very expensive drugs.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The audit also shows that since the Basel Committee started its work 20 years ago, the health ministry hasn't required the health funds to report nor monitored the extent of use and utilization of Basel medicines, information that would have allowed the office to analyze and control the budget allocated to the funds.</seg>

          <seg id="39">"Delayed testing may result in difficulty in data collection and analysis, the irrelevance of conclusions from testing after such a long period, poor subcommittee evaluation and decisions based on incomplete findings", said the report.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Also, the office doesn't inspect and monitor the use of particularly expensive drugs or conduct sampling.</seg>
          <seg id="41">These 10 drugs accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion NIS in 2021-2016).</seg>

          <seg id="1">State Comptroller's Report: The actual budget for most years of the Pharmaceutical Basket Committee's activity-smaller than the Recommended budget</seg>
          <seg id="2">According to the report by Matanya Engelman – for more than 20 years of Hessel's activity, the Ministry of Health did not supervise the committee's activities •</seg>
          <seg id="3">The report also said that meeting protocols are being published significantly late, if at all •</seg>
          <seg id="4">The comptroller also recommends increasing transparency of the subcommittee's activities – and updating basket work procedures •</seg>
          <seg id="5">Another flaw is that since the committee began its activity, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds for reports on the scope of the uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket – which would have allowed them to analyze and audit the budget given to them.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Drug Basket Committee is one of the public committees that most influence our daily lives and health.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Every year, the Committee decides on new drugs that will be given to the public free of charge through the health funds – but a new report by the State Comptroller published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without having made control reports on its activity and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Board monitoring and examining its activities.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Israel Hayom correspondent Ran Resnick adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted in the wake of the ongoing revelations in Israel Hayom about drug basket failures.</seg>
          <seg id="9">According to the report by Matanya Engelman, he recommends "making corrections and improvements in the process of expanding the basket, which will result in a higher quality utilization of the basket of health services that the public is entitled to."</seg>
          <seg id="10">Throughout the years of the addition mechanism to the drug basket, in the years 1998-2021, eight billion shekels were added to the state budget – with the addition each year in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new medicines and technologies to the health care basket, at a total annual cost of more than two billion shekels.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In practice, the budget allocated to expanding the basket was less than the scope of the requests.</seg>
          <seg id="13">In most years of the commission's operation (90% of the time), the budget supplement was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired supplement rate.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The auditor notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the height of the annual supplement in order to allow certainty and long-term planning.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Engelman also noted that"the model of transparency in basket work is lacking."</seg>
          <seg id="16">Thus, for example, the Basket Committee's working procedure states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 109-160 days, when sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.</seg>
          <seg id="17">"The delay in the publication of the protocols undermines the transparency of the decisions; as a result, the ability of the bidders – patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies – to submit repeated requests as soon as possible and relevant, after drawing lessons from the rejection of their proposals, analyzing the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improving and amending their proposals, and re-evaluating the feasibility of accepting them in the next round," he said. The reviewer in the report.</seg>
          <seg id="18">"The Ministry of Health should publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules set out in the procedure."</seg>
          <seg id="19">Out of thousands of submissions, only one financial comment was submitted</seg>
          <seg id="20">Engelman's other criticism concerns the preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The auditor found that about half (46%) of the submitted technologies did not pass this stage, but the Department of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Another flaw concerns the activities of the Drug basket subcommittee, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The auditor recommends bringing in a public representative or exploring the possibility of making the discussions public without confidential commercial details.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The procedure used by the Health Services Select Committee states that "an economic assessment should be submitted" for a request to add a drug to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="25">But in practice, over the years only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions – and the commission makes its decisions without an economic assessment.</seg>
          <seg id="26">For example, the Basket Committee hearings for the years 2019-2021 submitted requests to add to the basket of anti-obesity drugs.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The report found that the requests did not include economic estimates, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved by reducing the damage of obesity-related diseases or the ability to avoid gastric bypass surgery.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Further, the decisions of the Drug Basket Committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparedness to treat an increase in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The auditor also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the HMO are included in the drug basket, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health (the"third Supplement").</seg>
          <seg id="31">That is, when the legal framework for this measure is regulated only retrospectively.</seg>
          <seg id="32">In the past six years, NIS 74 million has been used from the addition to the drug basket for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Engelman recommends that the Department of Health update its basket work procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="34">About one-third of new drugs that enter the drug basket are defined as"no-cost drugs," whose use does not cost the health funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.</seg>
          <seg id="35">The comptroller proposes to examine the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and abbreviated route, so that the portfolio of drugs can be updated several times a year rather than just once a year.</seg>
          <seg id="36">There is no control over the use of expensive drugs.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The audit also shows that since the Basket Committee began its work 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the HMO to report and has not monitored the scope of the uses and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the Ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the funds.</seg>

          <seg id="39">"The delay in conducting tests can lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, to the irrelevance of the conclusions drawn from the examination after such a long period, to the underperformance of the subcommittee and to decisions based on non-final findings," the report said.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The ministry also does not audit and monitor the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not done any research.</seg>
          <seg id="41">These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in 2016-2021).</seg>

          <seg id="11">In 2019, 2020 and 2021, applications were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the healthcare basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.</seg>
          <seg id="12">In practice, the budget allocated for expanding the basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.</seg>
          <seg id="13">In most years of the committee's activity (90% of the time), the budgetary increase was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired increase rate.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The comptroller notes that it is necessary to examine and regulate the amount of the annual supplement in order to enable certainty and long-term planning.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Engelman also noted that "the transparency model in basket work is lacking."</seg>
          <seg id="16">Thus, for example, the Hassel Committee's work procedure states that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published with a delay of 160-109 days, when sometimes the minutes of the final meetings are not published at all.</seg>
          <seg id="17">"The delay in the publication of the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; as a result, the ability of the submitters of the proposals - hospital organizations and pharmaceutical companies - to submit repeated requests as soon as possible and as relevant, after they learned lessons from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and revised their proposals and reassessed the feasibility of accepting them in the next round," the Comptroller noted in the report.</seg>
          <seg id="18">"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedules set forth in the procedure."</seg>
          <seg id="19">Out of thousands of submissions, only one financial comment was submitted.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Another criticism of Engelman relates to the preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the basket of medicines.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The comptroller found that about half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Another impairment relates to the activities of the Drug Basket subcommittee, which is closed to the media and the public, and in which patient numbers and costs of drugs are discussed.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The Comptroller recommends that a public representative be appointed or that the possibility of publicizing the discussions to the public be examined without confidential commercial details.</seg>
          <seg id="24">According to the procedure by which the Health Services Basket Committee operates, "an economic assessment must be submitted" for a request to add a drug to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="25">But in practice, over the years only one of thousands of submissions has been submitted - and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.</seg>
          <seg id="26">For example, the Hassel Committee's hearings for 2021-2019 submitted requests to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.</seg>
          <seg id="27">The report found that the requests did not include economic estimates, including an estimate of the amount that could have been saved due to reducing the damage of obesity-related diseases or due to the ability to avoid gastric surgery.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It also emerges that the decisions of the Pharmaceutical Basket Committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Thus, for example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparations for the treatment of tumors in chronic diseases as goals, but in the framework of the decisions regarding the expansion of the basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The Comptroller also warns that since 2011, services that are not under the responsibility of the HMOs have also been included in the basket of medicines, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, which are given by the Ministry of Health (the "Third Supplement").</seg>
          <seg id="31">This is when the legal framework for this step is regulated only retroactively.</seg>
          <seg id="32">In the past six years, NIS 74 million of the supplement to the medical basket has been used for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.</seg>
          <seg id="34">About a third of the new drugs that enter the basket are defined as "drugs with no additional cost," whose use does not cost the health funds an additional amount because they replace existing treatment.</seg>
          <seg id="35">The Comptroller proposes to examine the possibility that these drugs will be discussed in a different and abbreviated track, so that the basket of drugs can be updated several times a year and not only once a year.</seg>
          <seg id="36">There is no control over the use of expensive drugs.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The criticism also indicates that since the ETF began its work 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked HMOs to report and has not supervised the scope of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have enabled the Ministry to analyze and audit the budget given to the health plans.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Over the years, only two reports relating to the years 2006-2009 were published, and these too were published with considerable delay (the last one was published this year and dealt with the utilization of the budget in 2007-2009).</seg>
          <seg id="39">"The delay in conducting examinations may lead to difficulty in collecting and analyzing the data, to the irrelevance of the conclusions arising from the examination after such a long period, to improper pricing of the subcommittee and to decisions based on inconclusive findings," the report said.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In addition, the Ministry also does not review and supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not learned any lessons.</seg>
          <seg id="41">These are 10 drugs that constituted 62% of the addition to the basket (NIS 1.7 billion in the years 2021-2016).</seg>
          <seg id="42">The comptroller wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use in comparison with the estimates.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Controls and analysis will make it possible to draw systemic conclusions about the work process of the basket committee and the subcommittee, and about how to prepare and improve estimates when pricing drugs and technologies. "</seg>

          <seg id="3">Chairman of the committee, MK Silman: “If the people there cared about the kitchen being like at home – it wouldn’t look like this”.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old patient from the “Beit Dafna” daycare center in Holon died of food poisoning, her medical parameters were taken which were normal, the director of the daycare center claimed today (Tuesday) at the hearing of the health committee.</seg>
          <seg id="5">“We have night nurses who check during the night and there is a nurse who makes rounds.</seg>
          <seg id="6">There were several reports of cases of diarrhea and the same tenant actually, last time her measurements were taken 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.</seg>
          <seg id="7">She was monitored like the other daycare workers with diarrhea.</seg>
          <seg id="8">She is a nursing patient, we went to get a lever to help transfer her and then the same resident did not respond.</seg>
          <seg id="9">We started CPR and called the clinic nurse”, the director of the daycare center described what happened last Sunday morning at the daycare center.</seg>
          <seg id="10">This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized and in total about a quarter of the residents of the daycare center (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea after eating contaminated golesh meat.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The director of the daycare center said these things against the background of the claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of the caregivers.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Dr. Naama Noss, head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, stated that “We cannot determine unequivocally what caused the three deaths.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Only blood tests were taken from them”.</seg>
          <seg id="14">It was also brought up in the discussion that even from the tenants admitted to the hospital it was no longer possible to collect a stool sample because they didn’t have diarrhea anymore and therefore it is not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.</seg>
          <seg id="15">An engineer from the Ministry of Health also stated that “the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary condition of kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or at the request of a license renewal”.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that the investigation committee has not yet been appointed for this case and for the previous case of patients’ abuse that happened three months ago at the “Bnei Zion” institution in the Sharon.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Chairman of the committee, MK Silman, said during the discussion: “If the people there cared about the kitchen being like at home – it wouldn’t look like this.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The residents in the welfare dormitories need more.</seg>
          <seg id="19">They are health sensitive and need extra supervision and care.</seg>
          <seg id="20">It is shocking and unimaginable what happened there.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The horrible findings that were discovered are even after they knew that the Ministry of Health was coming to check.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Where is the supervision and responsibility of the offices?</seg>
          <seg id="23">How come in such a discussion the ministers and the CEOs of the ministries are not present to give an explanation of what is happening here?”</seg>
          <seg id="24">Yigal Nahtumi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who manages the daycare center and even ran the daycare center himself, said “Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire organization stand up with only one goal: to do good to people.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The people who passed away are people I personally cared for.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I anesthetized one of the tenants on my hands.</seg>
          <seg id="27">This is a shocking event for us”.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Samdar Ona, a former resident of an identical residence in Gilo, burst out at him and said that “enough with the lies and nice words.</seg>
          <seg id="29">I was there”.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Gali Barmi, parent representative at Akim Israel: “We have already complained about the food in the past and they did not accept the criticism”.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Oren Hellman, founder of an equal opportunity initiative for the integration of people with disabilities, protested that the names of the deceased guardians were not published: “We don’t know their names at all.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Are they worth less?</seg>

          <seg id="3">The committee chairman, MK Silman: "If people there cared that the kitchen would be like at home - it wouldn't look like this."</seg>
          <seg id="4">Ten minutes before the first victim, a 40-year-old woman from "Beit Dafna" in Holon, died from food poisoning, her medical measurements were taken and were normal, claimed the director of the institution today (Tuesday) at a health committee meeting.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"We have night caregivers who check during the night and a nurse who does rounds."</seg>
          <seg id="6">There were several reports of diarrhea and the last time the tenant had her vitals taken was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.</seg>
          <seg id="7">She was tracking like the rest of the hikers with diarrhea.</seg>

          <seg id="10">This is an event in which three residents died, six were hospitalized, and in total about a quarter of the home's residents (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea after eating contaminated meat.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The dormitory manager said these things against the backdrop of claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of supervision by the caregivers.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Dr. Naama Nos, the epidemiologist in charge at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, stated that "we cannot definitively determine what caused the three soldiers to pass away."</seg>
          <seg id="13">Only blood tests were taken from them.</seg>
          <seg id="14">It was also discussed that it was no longer possible to collect stool samples from the residents who were hospitalized because they did not defecate, therefore it was impossible to definitively determine the cause of death and illness.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The engineer from the Ministry of Health also noted that "The Ministry of Health checks the sanitary conditions in the kitchens of institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or for the renewal of a license."</seg>
          <seg id="16">The Welfare Ministry admitted that an investigation committee has not yet been appointed for this case and for a previous case of abuse in shelters that occurred three months ago at the "Bnei Zion" institution in Sharon.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The Chair of the Health Committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the discussion: "If people cared that the kitchen would be like at home - it wouldn't look like this.</seg>

          <seg id="24">Yigal Nachtomi, the CEO of Beit Eckstein who manages the home and even ran the home himself said "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire system wake up with only one goal: to do good for people."</seg>

          <seg id="1">" Shocking and unimaginable": A stormy discussion in the Health Committee about the poisoning in Beit Dafna.</seg>
          <seg id="2">The indicators of the first deceased Jose were normal ten minutes before her death.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Committee Chairman, MK Silman: “ If people there cared about the kitchen being like home, it wouldn't look like this.”</seg>
          <seg id="4">Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old woman from the Beit Dafna residence in Holon died of food poisoning, medical indicators were taken that were normal, the director of the daycare center claimed Tuesday at a hearing of the health committee.</seg>
          <seg id="5">“ We have night caregivers checking in during the night and there is a nurse who does rounds and turns.</seg>
          <seg id="6">There were several reports of cases of diarrhea and the same resident actually the last time her measurements were taken was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal and they were normal.</seg>
          <seg id="7">She was monitored like the other Dickers with diarrhea.</seg>
          <seg id="8">She is a nursing patient, we went to get a baby to assist in her transfer and then that resident did not respond.</seg>
          <seg id="9">We started CPR and called the nurse, ” the director described what had happened last Sunday morning at the residence.</seg>
          <seg id="10">This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized, and a total of about a quarter of the residents of the residence ( 33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea to host contaminated goulash meat.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The director of the daycare center said the remarks against the backdrop of claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of follow-up on the part of caregivers.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Dr. Naama Noss, head of epidemiology at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, said: “ We cannot determine unequivocally what caused the three deaths.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Only blood tests were taken from them."</seg>
          <seg id="14">It was also brought up at the hearing that even from the residents admitted to the hospital, it was no longer possible to obtain a stool sample because they were not diarrhea and therefore it was not possible to determine with certainty the cause of death and morbidity.</seg>
          <seg id="15">An engineer on behalf of the Ministry of Health also noted that “ the Ministry of Health checks the sanitary condition in kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs or at the request of renewal of a license” .</seg>
          <seg id="16">The Ministry of Social Affairs admitted that a committee of inquiry has not yet been appointed for this case and for a previous case of allegations against Hosim that took place three months ago at the “ Bnei Zion” institution in the Sharon region.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Health Committee Chairwoman Idit Silman said during the discussion: “ If people there cared about the kitchen being like home, it wouldn't look like this.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The welfare dormitories rooms need more.</seg>
          <seg id="19">They are health sensitive and need extra supervision and care.</seg>
          <seg id="20">It is shocking and incomprehensible what happened there.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The terrible findings were discovered even after they knew that the Ministry of Health had come to check them.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Where the supervision and responsibility of the ministries are.</seg>
          <seg id="23">How in such a discussion the ministers and the CEOs of the ministries are not present to give an explanation of what is happening here. “</seg>
          <seg id="24">Yigal Nachtomi, CEO of Beit Eckstein, who runs the daycare center and even ran the daycare center himself, said, "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire system are established with only one goal: Do good to people: Do good to people."</seg>
          <seg id="25">The people who died are people I personally cared for.</seg>
          <seg id="26">I anesthetized one of the tenants on my hands.</seg>
          <seg id="27">This is a shocking event for us."</seg>

          <seg id="29">I was there” .</seg>
          <seg id="30">Gali Barmi, Parent Representative at Akim Israel: “ We have complained before about the food and have not accepted the criticism.”</seg>
          <seg id="31">Oren Hellman founder of Equal Chance for Integration of Persons with Disabilities protested that the names of the deceased Hosts had not been published: “ Their names don't even know their names at all.</seg>
          <seg id="32">They are worth less than that.</seg>

          <seg id="4">ביה"ח: "הוא מוערך ומנוסה"</seg>
          <seg id="5">פרסום ראשון: טעות מחרידה התרחשה בבית החולים הממשלתי וולפסון שבחולון, כאשר במהלך ניתוח הרופא ביצע קרע בליבו של המטופל, מה שהוביל למותו הטרגי.</seg>
          <seg id="6">הניתוח בחולה סרטן ריאה בן 83 נערך ב־19 באפריל.</seg>
          <seg id="7">זה היה הניתוח הראשון שביצע ד"ר פראס אבו עכר בבית החולים, לאחר שמונה למנהל היחידה לניתוחי חזה בוולפסון.</seg>
          <seg id="8">במהלך הניתוח, שנועד לנקז את האזור המקיף את ליבו של המטופל, המנתח גרם בטעות לקרע גדול בלב, שהוביל לדימום קשה וגרם למותו של המטופל.</seg>
          <seg id="9">אלא שהסיבוך החריג פתח תיבת פנדורה, שהעלתה שאלות קשות בכל הנוגע לניהול בית החולים.</seg>
          <seg id="10">מנהל המכון האונקולוגי ויו"ר ועד הרופאים, ד"ר רונן ברנר, דרש חקירה של הפרשה במכתב שהעביר למנהלת בית החולים, ד"ר ענת אנגל.</seg>
          <seg id="11">במכתב העלה טענות קשות ביותר על ההתנהלות של ד"ר אנגל ועל מינויו של ד"ר אבו עכר, זאת לאחר שמנהל היחידה הקודם, ד"ר בני צוקרמן, עבר לביה"ח שיבא בתל השומר.</seg>
          <seg id="12">חור ענק בלב</seg>
          <seg id="13">על פי מכתבו של ד"ר ברנר, החולה היה צלול, מתפקד וטופל על ידו בארבע השנים האחרונות.</seg>
          <seg id="14">לאחרונה חלה אצלו התפשטות של המחלה, והתגלתה הצטברות לא תקינה של נוזלים בתוך קרום הלב, שבתוכו נמצא שריר הלב.</seg>
          <seg id="15">כמו כן, המנתח ד"ר אבו עכר, התרשם שהוא יכול לבצע את הניתוח.</seg>
          <seg id="16">לפי התלונה, בניתוח אירעה תקלה חמורה, וד"ר חגי דקל, מנהל מחלקת ניתוחי לב וחזה בוולפסון, שהיה באותו זמן בניתוח של ילד בחדר הסמוך, "נקרא בבהילות לשולחן הניתוח וראה חור ענק בלב".</seg>
          <seg id="17">לדבריו, הלב היה מרוקן מדם, לחצי הדם היו אפסיים, והגישה הניתוחית היתה שגויה.</seg>
          <seg id="18">נוסף על כך, ד"ר ברנר סיפר כי ד"ר דקל פנה אליו ואמר לו כי ד"ר אבו עכר לא מתאים מבחינה מקצועית ואישית לניהול יחידת ניתוחי חזה בוולפסון.</seg>
          <seg id="19">עם זאת, על אף אזהרותיו המפורשות ואף שהיה אמור להיות המנהל הישיר של מנתח החזה, ד"ר אנגל ביצעה מכרז בלי לשתף אותו וקיבלה את ד"ר אבו עכר לתפקיד.</seg>
          <seg id="20">עוד ציין: "מדובר בהליך לא מסובך, שנמשך כמה דקות", והוסיף: "לא ניתן שלא להתייחס לתהליך הלקוי של קבלת ד"ר אבו עכר לתפקיד.</seg>
          <seg id="21">עולה השאלה אם קיימת אחריות ישירה של אנגל לכישלון הניתוח ולמות החולה".</seg>

          <seg id="23">בפני ״ישראל היום״ הועלו מידע וטענות של רופאים בכירים נוספים שמחזקים את השאלות שהעלה בפרשה ד״ר רונן ברנר.</seg>
          <seg id="24">ד"ר מרדכי שמעונוב, מנהל כירורגית א' בוולפסון, הגיב לתלונה של ברנר וכתב כי ד"ר אבו עכר הוא "אחד הכירורגים היותר מנוסים בארץ, אך כירורג חזה צעיר יחסית".</seg>
          <seg id="25">עוד הוסיף כי הוא נבחר במכרז תקין וד"ר דקל לא לקח בו חלק, בהתאם להצהרותיו על רצונו "להתנתק" מיחידת החזה.</seg>
          <seg id="26">עוד ציין: "גם אני לא הייתי שותף להליך, וייתכן שהייתי אמור להיו.</seg>
          <seg id="27">ד"ר שמעונוב כתב כי ד"ר פראס אבו עכר החל לעבוד ב־10 באפריל וזכאי ל־100 ימי חסד, "כל רופאי בית החולים התרשמו מהמקצועיות שלו ומהמוטיבציה והנכונות לעבוד.</seg>
          <seg id="28">הוא ביצע כבר עשרות מקרים של פרוצדורה דומה, ולצערי המקרה הנוכחי הסתיים כפי שהסתיים בצורה מצערת.</seg>
          <seg id="29">מבית החולים וולפסון נמסר בתגובה: "אנו משתתפים בצערה של המשפחה.</seg>
          <seg id="30">מדובר במטופל של האונקולוג ד"ר רונן ברנר.</seg>
          <seg id="31">מנתח החזה המוזכר בכתבה הוא מנתח מוערך ובעל ניסיון רב שנים, ונבחר במכרז לניהול יחידת כירורגיה חזה המשויכת למחלקת כירורגיה בבית החולים וולפסון.</seg>
          <seg id="32">"לדברי ד"ר חגי דקל, דבריו שצוטטו אינם מדויקים והוצאו מהקשרם.</seg>
          <seg id="33">יש לציין כי מדובר במטופל שהיה לצערנו במצב קשה מאוד.</seg>

          <seg id="11">In the letter, he made very serious allegations about the conduct of Dr. Engel and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, this after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.</seg>

          <seg id="7">This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Faras Abu Akhar at the hospital, after he was appointed director of the Thoracic Surgery Unit at Wolfson.</seg>
          <seg id="8">During the operation, which was intended to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.</seg>
          <seg id="9">But the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised difficult questions regarding the management of the hospital.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The director of the oncology institute and chairman of the board of doctors, Dr. Ronan Brenner, demanded an investigation of the affair in a letter he sent to the director of the hospital, Dr. Anat Engel.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In the letter, he made very serious allegations about the conduct of Dr. Engel and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, this after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.</seg>
          <seg id="12">A huge hole in the heart</seg>
          <seg id="13">According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient was lucid, functioning and had been treated by him for the past four years.</seg>

          <seg id="15">Also, the surgeon Dr. Abu Akhar, was impressed that he could perform the surgery.</seg>
          <seg id="16">According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred during the operation, and Dr. Hagai Dekal, director of the heart and thoracic surgery department at Wolfson, who was at the time operating on a child in the adjacent room, "was hurriedly called to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."</seg>
          <seg id="17">According to him, the heart was drained of blood, the blood pressures were zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In addition to that, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekal contacted him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar is not professionally and personally suitable for managing the thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.</seg>
          <seg id="19">However, despite his explicit warnings, and even though he was supposed to be the direct manager of the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without involving him and accepted Dr. Abu Akhar for the position.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He further stated: "This is an uncomplicated procedure, which lasts a few minutes", and added: "It is impossible not to refer to the poor process of accepting Dr. Abu Akhar for the position.</seg>

          <seg id="24">Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of Surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is "one of the most experienced surgeons in Israel, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon."</seg>
          <seg id="25">He also added that he was selected in a proper tender and Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements about his desire to "disassociate" himself from the chest unit.</seg>
          <seg id="26">He also stated: "I was not a party to the procedure either, and it is possible that I should have been.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Fras Abu Akhar started working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 grace days, "All the doctors at the hospital were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Suspected Wolfson failure: The surgeon caused a rupture in the heart - and the patient died.</seg>
          <seg id="2">This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Feras Abu 'Aker as director of the hospital's breast surgery unit.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The chairman of the doctors' committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, had been warned before his appointment.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The hospital: “ He is appreciated and experienced” .</seg>
          <seg id="5">First publication: A terrible mistake occurred at the Wolfson Government Hospital in Holon, when during surgery the doctor performed a rupture in the patient's heart, leading to his tragic death.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was conducted on April 19th.</seg>
          <seg id="7">This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Feras Abu Akhar at the hospital, after he was appointed director of Wolfson's Thoracic Surgery Unit at Wolfson.</seg>
          <seg id="8">During the operation, which was designed to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large rupture of the heart, which led to severe bleeding and caused the patient's death.</seg>
          <seg id="9">But the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, which raised difficult questions regarding the management of the hospital.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The director of the oncology institute and chairman of the doctors' committee, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation into the affair in a letter he sent to the hospital director, Dr. Anat Engel.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The letter raised very serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu 'Aker, after the previous director of the unit, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, moved to Sheba Hospital in Tel Hashomer.</seg>
          <seg id="12">A huge hole in the heart.</seg>
          <seg id="13">According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient was lucid, functioning and had been treated by him for the past four years.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Recently, he had a spread of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid was discovered inside the myocardium, in which the heart muscle is located.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Also, surgeon Dr. Abu 'Aker was impressed that he could perform the surgery.</seg>
          <seg id="16">According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred during the operation, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of Wolfson's cardiothoracic surgery department, who was operating on a child in the next room at the time, "was hurriedly called to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart, " and Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of Wolfson's cardiothoracic surgery department, who was operating on a child in the next room, " was rushed to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."</seg>
          <seg id="17">He said the heart was drained of blood, blood pressures were zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Dekel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu 'Aker was not professionally and personally suited to run a thoracic surgery unit at Wolfson.</seg>
          <seg id="19">However, despite his explicit warnings and even though he was supposed to be the direct manager of the thoracic surgeon, Dr. Engel made a tender without involving him and accepted Dr. Abu 'Aker for the position.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He further stated: “ This is an uncomplicated procedure, lasting a few minutes,” adding: “ It is impossible not to relate to the inadequate process of accepting Dr. Abu 'Aker for the position.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The question arises whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the operation and the patient's death.</seg>
          <seg id="22">An experienced surgeon.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Israel Hayom was presented with information and claims by other senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised by Dr. Ronen Brenner in the case.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, director of Surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint, stating that Dr. Abu 'Aker is "one of the most experienced surgeons in Israel, but a relatively young thoracic surgeon".</seg>
          <seg id="25">He added that he was chosen in a proper tender and that Dr. Dekel did not take part in it, in accordance with his statements of his desire to "disconnect" from the chest unit.</seg>
          <seg id="26">He further stated: “ I wasn't a party to the procedure either, and maybe I should have been.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Feras Abu Akhar began working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace,” all the hospital doctors were impressed by his professionalism and motivation and willingness to work.</seg>
          <seg id="28">He has already performed dozens of cases of a similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it sadly did.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Wolfson Hospital said in response: “ We share in the family's grief.</seg>
          <seg id="30">This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.</seg>
          <seg id="31">The thoracic surgeon mentioned in the article is a respected surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in the tender to manage the thoracic surgery unit associated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.</seg>
          <seg id="32">According to Dr. Hagai Dekel, his quoted words are inaccurate and taken out of context.</seg>
          <seg id="33">It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very serious condition.</seg>
          <seg id="34">The hospital is reviewing the details of the case transparently, and the Ministry of Health is familiar with the details of the case.</seg>

          <seg id="11">הוא זה שגרם לי לאהוב את תחום המחלות הזיהומיות והשפיע עלי לעסוק בו.</seg>

          <seg id="16">הדיונים איתו היו אנליטיים והגיוניים.</seg>
          <seg id="17">הוא היה רופא בכל נימי נשמתו, שאהב את החולים ולימד אותי לא לקבל דברים כמובנים מאליהם ולבדוק לעומק כל דבר.</seg>

          <seg id="20">הוא היה רופא מדהים, שהשפיע עלי ללכת לרפואה - אבל הוא גם מזכיר לי את מרווין שפירא.</seg>
          <seg id="21">שניהם, למשל, טבעו פתגמים שרופאים משתמשים בהם עד היום - למשל "טישו איז דה אישיו", כלומר, לקיחת ביופסיה של רקמה מהאיבר הנגוע מאפשרת לדעת אילו תרופות כדאי לתת; או "וון יו יוז איט, יו לוז איט", שנועד להסביר כי שימוש יתר באנטיביוטיקה מוביל לכך שהחיידקים נעשים עמידים לה.</seg>

          <seg id="30">על פרופ' שאול סוקניק ז"ל</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="31">מורה וחבר שתמך בי וגידל דורות של רופאים</seg>
          <seg id="32">.</seg>
          <seg id="33">את פרופ' שאול סוקניק ז"ל פגשתי לראשונה כשהייתי סטודנט בשנה הרביעית ללימודי הרפואה, והגעתי לסבב ברפואה פנימית במחלקה פנימית ד' שאותה ניהל.</seg>
          <seg id="34">בהמשך חזרתי למחלקה גם בסבב בשנה שישית, ואת עבודת הגמר של בית הספר לרפואה עשיתי בהנחייתו, בכתיבת סימולציה ממוחשבת על חולה עם פוליארתריטיס (דלקת במפרקים מרובים).</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="35">שאול השפיע על כל צומת משמעותי בחיי המקצועיים לאורך 20 שנה, והיה האיש המשמעותי ביותר בעיצוב דמותי כרופא; לא רק מקצועית, אלא גם - ובעיקר - מבחינה אישית ואנושית.</seg>
          <seg id="36">במהלך הסטאז' התלבטתי בין רפואת משפחה ורפואה פנימית, והתייעצתי איתו לגבי בחירת ההתמחות.</seg>
          <seg id="37">בסופו של דבר בחרתי להתמחות ברפואה פנימית אצלו בסורוקה.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="38">במהלך הההתמחות הוא סיפק לי הכוונה תמידית, במגוון אפיקים - בכתיבה מדעית (מצטער שאול, לא התמדתי מספיק), בקשר עם מטופלים, בעבודה בצוות רב-מקצועי - תחום שבו המחלקה הצטיינה - ובעצם, בכל היבט שקשור לרפואה.</seg>
          <seg id="39">עד היום אני מזהה אצלי, כרופא וכמנהל, מאפיינים שמגיעים משאול.</seg>
          <seg id="40">כאשר סיימתי את ההתמחות והתלבטתי אם לנסוע לתקופת השתלמות בחו"ל, שאול דחף וכיוון אותי, וסייע לי במכתבי המלצה ובעצות כיצד להתנהל.</seg>
          <seg id="41">תקופת ההשתלמות הייתה תקופה חשובה מאוד להתפתחות המקצועית שלי, וללא התמיכה והדחיפה של שאול לא בטוח שזה היה קורה.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="42">בשובי, כאשר קיבלתי הצעה להצטרף להנהלת בית החולים, שוב שאול היה זה שתמך וסייע.</seg>
          <seg id="43">בהמשך צלחנו יחד תקופות מורכבות בחטיבה לרפואה פנימית.</seg>
          <seg id="44">שאול ידע לשלב בצורה נפלאה את המורה, המנהל, החבר והשותף לצוות, בלי שתפקידיו השונים יפריעו זה לזה.</seg>
          <seg id="45">אני שואף להצליח כמוהו בשילוב המיוחד הזה.</seg>
          <seg id="46">הוא גידל דורות של סטודנטים, סטאז'רים ומתמחים, שנמצאים כיום ברחבי מערכת הרפואה בישראל, ומנציחים בעשייתם המצוינת את זכרו ופועלו.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="51">האיש שלימד אותי רפואה, ובעיקר הקשבה.</seg>
          <seg id="52">ד״ר טומי שינפלד, מייסדה ומנהלה לשעבר של היחידה לטיפול נמרץ במרכז שניידר לרפואת ילדים, לימד אותי להיות רופאת טיפול נמרץ, אבל יותר מזה - הוא לימד אותי לחשוב.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="53">המובן מאליו שלמדתי ממנו הוא לטפל בילדים המורכבים ביותר, החולים ביותר.</seg>
          <seg id="54">הילדים, שחלקם היו בריאים רק לפני רגע, ונמצאים כעת בין חיים ומוות.</seg>
          <seg id="55">המובן מאליו הוא לנהל שיחות קשות מאוד, אולי הקשות ביותר, עם משפחות שלא דמיינו שייקלעו למצבים המורכבים הללו ביחידת טיפול נמרץ עם הילדים שלהן.</seg>
          <seg id="56">נשמע מוזר, אבל זה המובן מאליו.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="57">אבל למדתי ממנו דברים משמעותיים ועמוקים אף יותר.</seg>
          <seg id="58">במבט לאחור, מכיוון שאני רופאה שהיא מנהלת ומנהלת שהיא רופאה, ברור לי היום הקשר בין העולמות; החינוך שקיבלתי מד״ר שינפלד מחבר ביניהם.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="59">ד״ר שינפלד לימד אותי להאזין ברוב קשב לדברים רבים: להקשיב לילדים, להקשיב למוניטור, להקשיב לאחיות המטפלות, לצוותים המטפלים הצעירים והמבוגרים כאחד, ולהקשיב להורים.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="60">את כל זה צריך לעשות לא רק כדי לתקשר באופן נכון יותר ומוצלח יותר, אלא כדי לאסוף כל העת מידע רב שיכול למנוע את ההידרדרות הבאה.</seg>
          <seg id="61">התהליכים המניעתיים בטיפול בילדים קיימים בכל מקום, וכמובן גם בטיפול נמרץ.</seg>
          <seg id="62">הקשבה ושיח מעוררים הבנה מעמיקה יותר, הן מצד הצוות המטפל והן מצד המטופלים ומשפחותיהם.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="63">ההבנה שלי היום כמנהלת היא שהתובנות הללו נכונות גם בהסתכלות על מערכת שלמה.</seg>
          <seg id="64">ככל שמתקיימת הבנה מעמיקה יותר וקפדנית יותר, המשלבת בשיח את כלל הגורמים המטפלים, כך תהליך קבלת ההחלטות יהיה מדויק יותר, מותאם לסיטואציה, ובעיקר - מוקדם דיו על מנת למנוע נזקים עתידיים, מיידיים או רחוקים.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="65">זו הסיבה שד״ר טומי שינפלד מהווה עבורי הרבה יותר מדמות מעוררת השראה.</seg>
          <seg id="66">הוא אדם שלימד אותי המון רפואה, אבל בעיקר לימד אותי לחשוב מהר ומדויק, להקשיב - ואז ליישם.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Three senior doctors, three teachers for life and profession: on this occasion, of Israeli Doctor’s Day, "Israel Hayom" invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to remember the figures who accompanied them at the beginning—and helped them become who they are today.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="9">The meeting that opened my eyes—and changed my life</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">If I hadn’t met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained a specialist in internal medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="11">He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue it.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, sometime in the 80s of the previous century.</seg>
          <seg id="13">For a moment I didn’t think I would leave internal medicine, as I liked the patient care itself; But Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, and in internal medicine, and practically in every kind of medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="14">I thank him for bringing me to this field.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="15">I liked his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The discussions with him were analytical and logical.</seg>
          <seg id="17">He was a doctor from every fiber of his being, who loved the patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.</seg>
          <seg id="18">He was a real and honest person, without ego, qualities that I really liked about him.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="19">Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine—but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Both of them, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day—for example "tissue is the issue", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ opens possibilities to know which drugs should be given; or "Once You Use It, You Lose It", which is intended to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="22">The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked in Hadassah and was a father of two daughters.</seg>
          <seg id="23">He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at the Sheevah, I cried.</seg>
          <seg id="24">He was unique—a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.</seg>
          <seg id="25">He has never complained, not even while enduring his severe illness.</seg>
          <seg id="26">He was one of the first doctors on the team of epidemics treatment, and he is sorely missed at this time.</seg>
          <seg id="27">If he were with us today, I’m sure I would have consulted him, and I’m sure he was one of the leaders of the team for dealing with epidemics.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="31">A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors</seg>
          <seg id="32">.</seg>
          <seg id="33">I met the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik for the first time when I was a student in the fourth year of medical studies, and I arrived to work rotation shifts in internal medicine at the 4th internal medicine department that he managed.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Later on I returned to the department in my sixth year rotation, and I did the final thesis of medical school under his guidance, writing a computer simulation about a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="35">Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life over 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; Not only professionally, but also—and above all—from a personal and humane point of view.</seg>
          <seg id="36">During the internship I couldn’t decide if I wanted family medicine or internal medicine, and I consulted him about the choice of specialization.</seg>
          <seg id="37">In the end I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="38">During the internship, he provided me constant guidance, in a variety of routes—in scientific writing (sorry Shaul, I was not persistent enough), in communication with patients, working in a multi-professional team—an area in which the department excelled—and basically, in every aspect related to medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="39">To this day, I recognize within myself, as a doctor and as a manager, features that originate from Shaul.</seg>
          <seg id="40">When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go for a training period abroad, Shaul encouraged and guided me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.</seg>
          <seg id="41">The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul’s support and encouragement I am not sure this would have happened.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="42">Upon my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital’s management, Shaul was once again the one who supported and helped.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Later we managed through complex periods together in the internal medicine division.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Shaul knew how to combine wonderfully being the teacher, the manager, the friend and the team partner, without his different roles interfering with each other.</seg>
          <seg id="45">I aspire to be as successful as him in this special combination.</seg>
          <seg id="46">He raised generations of students and interns, who are positioned today throughout the medical system in Israel, and perpetuate his memory and his work with their excellent work.</seg>
          <seg id="47">I am honored to be among this group.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="51">The man who taught me medicine, and especially how to listen.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld, founder and former director of the Intensive Care Unit at the Schneider Pediatric Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that—he taught me how to think.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="53">The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex and sickest children.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The children, which some were healthy just a moment ago, and are now between life and death.</seg>
          <seg id="55">The obvious thing is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who did not imagine that they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Sounds strange, but it goes without saying.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="57">But I learned significant and even deeper things from him.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Looking back, since I am a managing doctor and a medical manager, the connection between the worlds is clear to me today; The education I received from Dr. Scheinfeld connects them.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="59">Dr. Scheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the attending nurses, to the nursing teams both young and old, and to listen to the parents.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="60">All this should be done not only to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The preventive processes in child care exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.</seg>
          <seg id="62">Listening and conversing stimulate a deeper understanding, both from the treating staff and as well as from the patients and their families.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="63">My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at a system as a whole.</seg>
          <seg id="64">The more in-depth and rigorous understanding is, integrating all the treating crews in the discourse, the more accurate the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and above all—early enough in order to prevent future, immediate or distant damages.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="65">That’s the reason that Dr. Tommy Scheinfeld is much more than an inspirational figure to me.</seg>
          <seg id="66">He is a person who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think quickly and accurately, listen—and then apply.</seg>

          <seg id="34">Later, I returned to the department for a rotation in my sixth year, and I did my final project for medical school under his guidance, writing a computer simulation for a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation in multiple joints).</seg>
          <seg id="35">Saul has influenced every significant crossroad in my professional life over 20 years, and he was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; not only professionally, but also - and mainly - personally and humanly.</seg>
          <seg id="36">During the internship, I was torn between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted with him about choosing the specialty.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Eventually, I chose to specialize in internal medicine at Soroka.</seg>
          <seg id="38">During my specialization, he provided me with constant guidance, in various aspects - in scientific writing (sorry Saul, I didn't persist enough), in dealing with patients, in working in a multi-professional team - an area in which the department excelled - and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="39">To this day, I identify in myself, as a doctor and a manager, characteristics that come from Saul.</seg>
          <seg id="40">When I finished my specialization and was unsure whether to go abroad for further training, Shaul pushed and guided me, and helped me with recommendation letters and advice on how to proceed.</seg>
          <seg id="41">The training period was a very important time for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and encouragement, I'm not sure it would have happened.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Upon my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital management, again Saul was the one who supported and assisted.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Later on, we went through complex periods together in the internal medicine department.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Saul knew how to wonderfully combine the roles of teacher, manager, friend, and team member, without any of his roles interfering with each other.</seg>
          <seg id="45">I aspire to succeed like him in this special combination.</seg>
          <seg id="46">He nurtured generations of students, interns, and specialists, who are now spread throughout the medical system in Israel, and their excellent work commemorates his memory and actions.</seg>
          <seg id="47">It is an honor for me to be appointed with this group.</seg>

          <seg id="50">About Dr. Tommy Shinfield</seg>
          <seg id="51">The man who taught me medicine, and mainly listening.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Dr. Tommy Shinfield, the founder and former director of the Intensive Care Unit at Schneider Children's Medical Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that - he taught me to think.</seg>
          <seg id="53">The inherent lesson I learned from him is to care for the most complex, the sickest children.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The children, who were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.</seg>
          <seg id="55">The implicit meaning is to have very difficult, perhaps the most difficult, conversations with families who never imagined they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.</seg>
          <seg id="56">It sounds strange, but it's self-explanatory.</seg>
          <seg id="57">But I learned even more significant and profound things from him.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Looking back, as a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, I now clearly see the connection between the two worlds; the education I received from Dr. Shinfield bridges them.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Dr. Shinfield taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to the monitor, to the caring nurses, to both the young and old care teams, and to the parents.</seg>
          <seg id="60">All of this needs to be done not only to communicate more correctly and successfully, but also to constantly gather a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The preventive processes in treating children exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.</seg>
          <seg id="62">Listening and conversation foster a deeper understanding, both from the treatment team and from the patients and their families.</seg>
          <seg id="63">My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also correct when looking at a whole system.</seg>
          <seg id="64">The more in-depth and meticulous understanding that involves all the caregivers in the conversation, the more accurate, situation-appropriate, and primarily, the decision-making process will be timely in order to prevent future, immediate or distant damages.</seg>
          <seg id="65">That's why Dr. Tommy Weinfeld is much more than an inspirational figure to me.</seg>
          <seg id="66">He is a person who taught me a lot about medicine, but mainly taught me to think quickly and accurately, to listen - and then to implement.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Three senior doctors, three teachers of life and the profession: On the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, Israel Hayom invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to recall the figures who accompanied them at the beginning - and helped them become who they are today.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba &lt;unk&gt;</seg>
          <seg id="8">About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira</seg>
          <seg id="9">The meeting that opened my eyes - and changed my life</seg>
          <seg id="10">Had I not met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the infectious diseases unit at Hadassah Hospital, I would probably have remained a specialist in internal medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="11">He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to engage in it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">I met him in the hallways of Hadassah, sometime in the 1980s.</seg>
          <seg id="13">For a moment I did not think that I would leave the internal, because I loved the treatment of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, also in the internal, and in fact in every area.</seg>
          <seg id="14">I thank him for bringing me into this field.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Throughout, I loved his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The discussions with him were analytical and logical.</seg>
          <seg id="17">He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved the sick and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.</seg>
          <seg id="18">He was a genuine and honest man, devoid of ego, qualities I liked very much about him.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me most of all, I was going to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapiro.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day - for example, "tishu iz de ishio," meaning that taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ allows you to know which drugs should be given; or "wen yu yuz it, yu luz it," which is meant to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physical therapist who worked in Hadassah and had two daughters.</seg>
          <seg id="23">He died about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven, I cried.</seg>
          <seg id="24">He was something - a witty, smart epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.</seg>
          <seg id="25">He never complained, not even when he was sick.</seg>
          <seg id="26">He was one of the first doctors on the team to handle pandemics, and he is sorely missed during this time.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Had he been with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted with him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the team to handle epidemics.</seg>

          <seg id="39">To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from borrowing.</seg>
          <seg id="40">When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go for a period of study abroad, Shaul pushed and guided me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.</seg>

          <seg id="34">I later returned to the department again in my sixth year, and I did my medical school thesis under his guidance, writing a computer simulation on a patient with polyarthritis.</seg>

          <seg id="37">I ended up choosing to do an internal medicine residency with him in Soroca.</seg>
          <seg id="38">During my internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of areas -- in scientific writing (sorry, I wasn't persistent enough), in communicating with patients, in working with a multidisciplinary team -- an area in which the department excelled -- and, in fact, in every aspect of medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="39">To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and as a manager, traits that come from the underworld.</seg>
          <seg id="40">When I finished my internship and was hesitant to go abroad for a pay period, Saul pushed and guided me, and helped me with recommendation letters and advice on how to manage.</seg>
          <seg id="41">The recovery period was a very important time in my professional development, and without Saul's support and encouragement, I'm not sure it would have happened.</seg>

          <seg id="51">The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Dr. Tommy Schinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at Schneider Children's, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that -- he taught me to think.</seg>
          <seg id="53">The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, sickest children.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.</seg>
          <seg id="55">The obvious thing is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined they would be in these complex situations in the ICU with their children.</seg>
          <seg id="56">It sounds weird, but it's the obvious.</seg>
          <seg id="57">But I learned from him even more meaningful and profound things.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Looking back, because I'm a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, I now see the connection between the worlds; the education I received from Dr. Schinfeld connects them.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Dr. Schinfeldt taught me to listen carefully to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurses, to the nursing staff, both young and old, and to listen to the parents.</seg>
          <seg id="60">All of this needs to be done not just to communicate more correctly and more efficiently, but to constantly gather as much information as possible that can prevent the next downturn.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The motivational processes in pediatric care are everywhere, and of course in intensive care.</seg>
          <seg id="62">Listening and talking generates deeper understanding, both on the part of the care team and on the part of the patients and their families.</seg>
          <seg id="63">My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at the entire system.</seg>
          <seg id="64">The deeper and more rigorous the understanding, the more it incorporates all the relevant factors into the discussion, the more precise, the more tailored the decision-making process will be, and, most importantly, the sooner it can be done to prevent future, immediate or distant harm.</seg>
          <seg id="65">That's why Dr. Tommy Shinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.</seg>
          <seg id="66">He's a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, to listen - and then to apply.</seg>

          <seg id="11">He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, back in the 1980s.</seg>
          <seg id="13">For a moment I did not think that I would leave the inner one, as I loved the treatment of the patient himself; But Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also expressed in neurology, internal medicine, and in fact in every field.</seg>

          <seg id="15">All along, I've loved his investigative approach, one that gets to the root of the problem.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The discussions with him were analytical and logical.</seg>
          <seg id="17">He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything thoroughly.</seg>
          <seg id="18">He was a genuine and honest person, devoid of ego, qualities that I loved very much about him.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was my role model and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go to medicine—but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapiro.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors still use today - for example, "tissue iz de ishio", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the affected organ makes it possible to know which medicines should be given; Or "Won Yu Hughes It, Yu Luz It," which is meant to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.</seg>

          <seg id="52">Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at Schneider Children's Medical Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that, he taught me to think.</seg>
          <seg id="53">The obvious thing I learned from him was to take care of the most complex, sickest children.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.</seg>
          <seg id="55">The obvious is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Sounds strange, but it's the obvious.</seg>
          <seg id="57">But I learned even more meaningful and profound things from him.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Looking back, because I am a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, it is clear to me today that the connection between the two worlds is clear; The education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: listen to children, listen to monitors, listen to nurses, care teams young and old alike, and listen to parents.</seg>
          <seg id="60">All this must be done not only in order to communicate more correctly and successfully, but in order to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The preventive processes in the treatment of children exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.</seg>
          <seg id="62">Listening and dialogue stimulate deeper understanding, both on the part of the treating staff and on the part of patients and their families.</seg>
          <seg id="63">My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at an entire system.</seg>
          <seg id="64">The deeper and more rigorous understanding there is, which integrates all the caregivers into the discourse, the more precise the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and most importantly - early enough to prevent future, immediate or distant damage.</seg>
          <seg id="65">That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.</seg>
          <seg id="66">He is a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and precisely, to listen - and then to apply.</seg>

          <seg id="7">Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba</seg>
          <seg id="8">About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira</seg>
          <seg id="9">The meeting that opened my eyes - and changed my life</seg>
          <seg id="10">If I hadn't met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the infectious diseases unit at Hadassah Hospital, I would probably have remained a specialist in internal medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="11">He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue it.</seg>
          <seg id="12">I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, sometime in the 80s of the last century.</seg>
          <seg id="13">For a moment I didn't think I would leave internal medicine, as I liked the patient care itself; But Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, also in internal medicine, and basically in every field.</seg>
          <seg id="14">I thank him for bringing me to this field.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Throughout, I liked his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The discussions with him were analytical and logical.</seg>
          <seg id="17">He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved the patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.</seg>
          <seg id="18">He was a real and honest person, without ego, qualities that I really liked about him.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Both of them, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day - for example "tissue is de personio", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ makes it possible to know which drugs should be given; or "Once You Use It, You Lose It", which is intended to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.</seg>
          <seg id="22">The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked in Hadassah and father of two daughters.</seg>
          <seg id="23">He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at Sheva I cried.</seg>
          <seg id="24">He was something - a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for anything.</seg>
          <seg id="25">He never complained, not even during his severe illness.</seg>
          <seg id="26">He was one of the first doctors on the team to treat epidemics, and he is sorely missed at this time.</seg>
          <seg id="27">If he were with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted him, and I'm sure he was one of the leaders of the team for dealing with epidemics.</seg>

          <seg id="29">Dr. Shlomi Kodesh, director of Soroka Hospital</seg>
          <seg id="30">About the late Prof. Shaul Soknik</seg>
          <seg id="31">A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors</seg>
          <seg id="32">.</seg>
          <seg id="33">I met the late Prof. Shaul Suknik for the first time when I was a student in the fourth year of medical studies, and I did a rotation in internal medicine in the 4th internal medicine department that he managed.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Later I returned to the department also in the sixth year rotation, and I did the final thesis of the medical school under his guidance, writing a computer simulation about a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).</seg>
          <seg id="35">Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life over 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; Not only professionally, but also - and above all - from a personal and human point of view.</seg>
          <seg id="36">During the internship I was debating between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted him about the choice of specialization.</seg>
          <seg id="37">In the end I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him in Soroka.</seg>
          <seg id="38">During the internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways - in scientific writing (sorry Saul, I was not persistent enough), in communication with patients, working in a multi-professional team - an area in which the department excelled - and basically, in every aspect related to medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="39">To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from a question.</seg>
          <seg id="40">When I finished my internship and was debating whether to go for a training period abroad, Shaul pushed and guided me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.</seg>
          <seg id="41">The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and encouragement I am not sure that this would have happened.</seg>
          <seg id="42">On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital's management, Shaul was once again the one who supported and helped.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Later we managed complex periods together in the internal medicine division.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Shaul knew how to combine in a wonderful way the teacher, the manager, the friend and the partner of the team, without his different roles interfering with each other.</seg>
          <seg id="45">I aspire to be as successful as him in this special combination.</seg>
          <seg id="46">He raised generations of students, interns and interns, who are today throughout the medical system in Israel, and perpetuate his memory and his work with their excellent work.</seg>

          <seg id="32">.</seg>
          <seg id="33">I met Prof. Shaul Suknik for the first time when I was a student in the fourth year of medical school, and came to a rotation in internal medicine in the 4th internal department, which he ran.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Later, I also returned to the department in a sixth year rotation, and the medical school thesis I did under his direction, writing a computer simulation about a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation of multiple joints).</seg>
          <seg id="35">Saul influenced every significant intersection of my professional life over 20 years, and was the most significant man in shaping my figure as a physician; not only professionally, but also — especially — personally and humanely.</seg>
          <seg id="36">During the internship, I debated family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about the choice of internship.</seg>
          <seg id="37">In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him at Soroka.</seg>
          <seg id="38">During the internship, he provided me with constant guidance, on a variety of avenues - in scientific writing (sorry Saul, I wasn't persevered enough), in contact with patients, in working in a multi-professional team — an area in which the department excelled — and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="39">To this day, I recognize in me, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from the world.</seg>
          <seg id="40">When I finished the internship and was debating whether to travel for a period of continuing education abroad, Shaul pushed and oriented me, and assisted me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.</seg>
          <seg id="41">The continuing education period was a very important time for my professional development, and without Saul's support and push, I'm not sure it would have happened.</seg>
          <seg id="42">On my return, when I received an offer to join the management of the hospital, Saul was again the one who supported and assisted.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Later we have together complex periods in the Division of Internal Medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Saul knew how to wonderfully integrate the teacher, manager, friend and team partner, without his different roles interfering with each other.</seg>
          <seg id="45">I strive to be as successful as him in this special combination.</seg>
          <seg id="46">He raised generations of students, interns and interns who are now throughout the medical system in Israel, commemorating their excellent work and work.</seg>

          <seg id="51">The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Dr. Tommy Schinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at the Schneider Pediatrics Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that, he taught me to think.</seg>
          <seg id="53">The obvious I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, sickest children.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, and are now between life and death.</seg>
          <seg id="55">The obvious is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who did not imagine getting into these complex situations in an intensive care unit with their children.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Sounds weird, but that's the obvious one.</seg>
          <seg id="57">But I learned even more significant and profound things from him.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Looking back, because I am a doctor who is a director and a director who is a doctor, it is clear to me today the connection between the worlds; the education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen carefully to many things: listen to children, listen to the monitor, listen to the nurse-caregivers, young and adult caregiver teams alike, and listen to parents.</seg>
          <seg id="60">All this needs to be done not only in order to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The preventive processes in the treatment of children are present everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.</seg>
          <seg id="62">Listening and discourse inspire deeper understanding, both on the part of the attending team and on the part of patients and their families.</seg>
          <seg id="63">My understanding today as an administrator is that these insights are also true in looking at an entire system.</seg>
          <seg id="64">The deeper and more rigorous understanding takes place, which incorporates all the attending entities into the discourse, the more precise the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and especially early enough to prevent future damage, immediate or distant.</seg>
          <seg id="65">That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspiring figure to me.</seg>
          <seg id="66">He's a man who taught me a ton of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, listen - then apply.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Three senior doctors, three life and professional teachers: On the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, Israel Hayom invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to recall the characters who accompanied them in the beginning and helped them become who they are today.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of Sheba's Infectious Diseases Unit |</seg>
          <seg id="8">About the late Prof. Marvin Shapira.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The meeting that opened my eyes  and changed my life.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Had I not met the late Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained an expert physician in internal medicine.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It was he who made me love infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue them.</seg>
          <seg id="12">I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, back in the 1980s.</seg>
          <seg id="13">For a moment I did not think that I would leave internal medicine, as I loved the treatment of the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also reflected in neurology, also in internal medicine, and in fact in every area.</seg>
          <seg id="14">I thank him brought me to this field.</seg>
          <seg id="15">All along, I loved his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Discussions with him were analytical and logical.</seg>
          <seg id="17">He was a doctor with every fiber of his soul, who loved patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything in depth.</seg>
          <seg id="18">He was a real and honest person, devoid of ego, qualities that I loved about him very much.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me the most, I intended to choose my father, the late Dr. Joseph Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.</seg>
          <seg id="20">He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go to medicine  but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Both, for example, coined proverbs that doctors use to this day  for example, "tissue iz de ishio", that is, taking a biopsy of tissue from the infected organ makes it possible to know which drugs should be given; or "Won Yu Hughes It, Yu Hazel It", designed to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked at Hadassah and had two daughters.</seg>
          <seg id="23">He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven I cried.</seg>
          <seg id="24">He was something - a witty and clever epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.</seg>
          <seg id="25">He never complained, not even during his serious illness.</seg>
          <seg id="26">He was one of the first doctors on the team to treat epidemics, and he is sorely missed during this period.</seg>
          <seg id="27">If he were with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the leaders of the epidemic treatment team.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Brought to light: Meital Yasur Beit Or.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Dr. Shlomi Kodesh, director of Soroka Hospital |</seg>
          <seg id="30">About the late Prof. Shaul Sukenik</seg>
          <seg id="31">A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors.</seg>
          <seg id="32"/>
          <seg id="33">I met the late Prof. Shaul Suknik for the first time when I was a student in the fourth year of medical studies, and I came to a rotation in internal medicine in the 4th internal medicine department, which he managed.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Later I returned to the department also in the sixth year rotation, and the medical school thesis I did under his guidance, writing a computer simulation about a patient with polyarthritis ( inflammation of multiple joints) .</seg>
          <seg id="35">Shaul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life over 20 years, and was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; Not only professionally, but also  and above all  personally and humanly.</seg>
          <seg id="36">During the internship, I debated family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about the choice of specialization.</seg>
          <seg id="37">In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him at Soroka.</seg>
          <seg id="38">During the internship, he provided me with constant guidance, in a variety of ways  in scientific writing ( sorry Saul, I wasn't persistent enough), in contact with patients, in working in a multi-professional team  an area in which the department excelled  and basically, in every aspect related to medicine  and basically, in every aspect related to medicine  and basically, in every aspect related to medicine  and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine  in a scientific writing ( sorry Saul, I haven't persisted enough) .</seg>
          <seg id="39">To this day, as a doctor and as a manager, I recognize characteristics that come from a question.</seg>
          <seg id="40">When I finished my internship and was debating whether to travel abroad, Shaul pushed and directed me, and helped me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to conduct myself.</seg>
          <seg id="41">The training period was a very important period for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and push, I'm not sure it would have happened.</seg>
          <seg id="42">On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital's management, Shaul was again the one who supported and assisted.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Later, we managed complex periods together in the Internal Medicine Division.</seg>
          <seg id="44">Shaul knew how to integrate the teacher, the principal, the friend and the teammate wonderfully, without his different roles interfering with each other.</seg>
          <seg id="45">I aspire to be as successful as him in this special combination.</seg>
          <seg id="46">He raised generations of students, interns and interns who are now throughout the medical system in Israel, commemorating his memory and working with their excellent work and work.</seg>
          <seg id="47">I am honored to be part of this group.</seg>

          <seg id="49">Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of Schneider Children's Medical Center |</seg>
          <seg id="50">About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld.</seg>
          <seg id="51">The man who taught me medicine, and especially listening.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at the Schneider Pediatrics Center, taught me how to be an intensive care physician, but more than that, he taught me how to think about it - he taught me how to think about it.</seg>
          <seg id="53">The obvious thing I learned from him was to take care of the most complex, sickest children.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.</seg>
          <seg id="55">The obvious is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined that they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.</seg>
          <seg id="56">Sounds strange, but it goes without saying.</seg>
          <seg id="57">But I learned even more meaningful and profound things from him.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Looking back, since I am a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, it is clear to me today that the connection between the worlds is clear; The education I received from Dr. Sheinfeld connects them.</seg>
          <seg id="59">Dr. Sheinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: Listen to the children, listen to the monitor, listen to the nurses, young and old caregiver teams alike, and listen to the parents.</seg>
          <seg id="60">All this must be done not only in order to communicate more correctly and more successfully, but in order to constantly collect a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The preventive processes in child care exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.</seg>
          <seg id="62">Listening and dialogue stimulate a deeper understanding, both on the part of the treating staff and on the part of patients and their families.</seg>
          <seg id="63">My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also true when looking at a complete system as well.</seg>
          <seg id="64">The more in-depth and rigorous understanding exists, which integrates all the treating factors into the discourse, the more accurate the decision-making process will be, adapted to the situation, and especially early enough in order to prevent future, immediate or distant damage.</seg>
          <seg id="65">That's why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.</seg>
          <seg id="66">He's a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, listen  and then apply .</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="3">לידה היא אחד מהאירועים המשמחים והמרגשים ביותר בחייה של משפחה.</seg>
          <seg id="4">ואולם, למרבה הצער, לעתים מסתיימות לידות בנזקים חמורים הנגרמים ליולדת או ליילוד כתוצאה מהתרשלות הצוות הרפואי.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="5">במקרים שבהם הסתיימה הלידה בפגיעה גופנית, ליילוד או לאם, יש מקום לבחון את השתלשלות האירועים אשר הובילו לפגיעה ואף לשקול פנייה לקבלת ייעוץ משפטי.</seg>
          <seg id="6">עורך דין המתמחה בתחום הרשלנות הרפואית יבחן האם נפלו פגמים בהתנהלות הצוות הרפואי בשלבי הלידה השונים אשר גרמו לנזק וככל שימצא לנכון יפנה להיוועץ במומחה רפואי בתחום הרלונטי.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="7">יש להדגיש, כי לא כל טעות בטיפול מצד הצוות הרפואי עולה כדי רשלנות (במובן המשפטי של מונח זה) וכי סיבוכים שונים במהלך הלידה אינם מלמדים בהכרח שניהולה היה רשלני.</seg>
          <seg id="8">מתי אם כן מדובר ברשלנות?</seg>
          <seg id="9">כאשר טעותו של הרופא נבעה מחוסר מיומנות או סטתה מרמת הזהירות הסבירה, וחוסר המיומנות והסטייה מרמת הזהירות המקובלת גרמו נזק למטופל שלא היה נגרם אלמלא נהג כך הרופא.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">בכתבה זו נבחן את שלבי הלידה השונים, נסביר מהם הסיבוכים העלולים להתרחש בכל אחד מהשלבים ומתי הם עולים כדי רשלנות רפואית.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">שלב הצירים</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">שלב הצירים נמשך בממוצע בין 8 ל-14 שעות.</seg>
          <seg id="13">בשלב זה נפתח צוואר הרחם בהדרגה (על מנת לאפשר את מעבר העובר בעת הלידה) ובסוף התהליך אמור להגיע לקוטר של כעשרה סנטימטרים.</seg>
          <seg id="14">מרבית מקרי הרשלנות הרפואית בשלב הצירים עוסקים באי זיהוי מצוקה עוברית לקראת הלידה, אשר גרמה נזק ליילוד המתבטא לעתים אף בשיתוק מוחין.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="15">שיתוק מוחין (CP):</seg>
          <seg id="16">שיתוק מוחין עלול להיגרם כתוצאה מאי זיהוי או איחור בזיהוי תשניק סב-לידתי, אשר בא לידי ביטוי בכשל באספקת חמצן לרקמת מוחו של העובר.</seg>
          <seg id="17">ככלל, מעקב אחר מצבה של היולדת ופיענוח נכון של המוניטור העוקב אחר פעילות לב העובר אמורים להוביל לזיהוי מוקדם של התפתחות מצוקה עוברית, המאפשר לצוות הרפואי לפעול במהירות ולחלץ את היילוד לפני שנפגע באופן בלתי הפיך.</seg>
          <seg id="18">מקרים שבהם מתעלם הצוות הרפואי מסימנים המעידים על כך שהעובר סובל ממחסור בחמצן או שהצוות אינו מפרש נכון את נתונים שבפניו ובפרט המוניטור העוברי או מגיב באיחור למצוקה המתבטאת במוניטור – עלולים להוות התרשלות.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="19">שיתוק מוחין עלול להיגרם גם כתוצאה מצניחת חבל הטבור וכן כתוצאה מקרע ברחם שלא זוהה במועד.</seg>
          <seg id="20">גם באירועים קשים אלו ראוי לברר האם הצוות הרפואי פעל כראוי.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="21">כך למשל, מספרת עו"ד אנה רייף ליגנזה, ממשרד כספי סרור ושות' המתמחה בייצוג נפגעי רשלנות רפואית, כי משרדה טיפל בתביעה של ילד שנפגע במהלך לידתו לאחר שהמיילדת פקעה את שק מי השפיר כאשר ראש העובר היה גבוה מדי, ובכך הביאה לצניחת חבל הטבור (כאשר חבל הטבור מקדים את ראש העובר) ולפגיעה באספקת החמצן למוח העובר (כתוצאה מלחץ של ראש העובר על חבל הטבור) ולהיוולדו עם פגיעה נוירולוגית חמורה.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="22">במקרה אחר סיפרה עוה"ד, כי משרדה הגיש תובענה בשל רשלנות רפואית חמורה של צוות מחלקת יולדות בבי"ח גדול אשר במהלך הלידה לא זיהה במועד סימנים ברורים שחייבו חשד ממשי שהיולדת סובלת מקרע של הרחם באזור הצלקת הניתוחית של הריונה הקודם.</seg>
          <seg id="23">העובר אשר נפלט דרך הקרע ברחם אמו לחלל הבטן סבל ממצוקה עוברית קשה עד לחילוצו בשלב מאוחר כשהוא על סף המוות.</seg>
          <seg id="24">בשל הסבל העוברי הקשה במהלך לידתו נגרמה לילד נכות נוירולוגית מורכבת.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="25">נדגיש, כי על מנת לזכות בפיצויים, על התובעים להוכיח, בנוסף להתרשלות, כי מתקיים קשר סיבתי בין התרשלות הצוות הרפואי שהביאה לאי זיהוי התשניק לבין הנזק שנגרם ליילוד, כלומר שהנזק נגרם עקב הרשלנות כאמור ולא מאף סיבה או גורם אחרים.</seg>
          <seg id="26">בחינת הקשר הסיבתי תתבצע באמצעות בחינת מדדים רפואיים שעל פי הספרות הרפואית רק בהתקיימותם מתקיים קשר סיבתי בין התשניק לבין הפגיעה המוחית.</seg>
          <seg id="27">בין היתר נבחנים המדדים של רמת החומציות בדמו של העובר, ציוני האפגר שלו, קיומה של פגיעה נוירולוגית ומערכתית ועוד.</seg>

          <seg id="34">במצבים כאלה נהוג לבצע ניתוח קיסרי, על מנת למנוע נזקים שונים העלולים להיגרם לעובר עקב העיכוב בלידה.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="35">"ישנם מקרים בהם אי ביצוע ניתוח קיסרי במועד עלול לגרום נזק בלתי הפיך לעובר", הסבירה לנו עו"ד רייף-ליגנזה.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"לדוגמה, ניהלנו תביעת רשלנות רפואית של מות ילודה שנגרם בשל איחור משמעותי בביצוע ניתוח קיסרי.</seg>
          <seg id="37">בניגוד לכל פרקטיקה רפואית מוכרת, לא השכילו אנשי הצוות הרפואי לזהות את המצוקה העוברית ולבצע ניתוח קיסרי למרות התקדמות איטית במיוחד של הלידה.</seg>
          <seg id="38">האיחור בביצוע הניתוח גרם לנזק רב מערכתי לילודה אשר הוביל לבסוף למותה בסמוך לאחר לידתה".</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="39">רשלנות בלידת ואקום</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="40">במצבים בהם נשקפת לאם או לעובר סכנה משמעותית המחייבת סיום מהיר במיוחד של הלידה, מתבצעת לעתים לידת ואקום (שולפן ריק).</seg>
          <seg id="41">בתהליך זה מצמידים באמצעות ואקום "כיפה" לראשו של העובר ומושכים החוצה בכח את העובר.</seg>
          <seg id="42">מטבע הדברים פעולה זו כרוכה בסכנות ועלולה לגרום לנזקים הן לעובר והן ליולדת ועל כן מחייבת זהירות, דיוק ומיומנות רבה.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="43">באירועים אלו רשלנות רפואית עלולה להתבטא בכך שהרופא אינו מקפיד על ההנחיות המחייבות ומבצע את הפעולה למרות קיומה של התוויית נגד, כגון כאשר ראש העובר גבוה מדי באגן, או מבצע אותה במשך זמן ארוך מהמותר או כאשר למרות כישלון מספר ניסיונות רב ממשיך הרופא וחוזר על הפעולה יותר ממספר הניסיונות המותר.</seg>
          <seg id="44">במקרים אלו אם פעולת הוואקום הרשלנית גרמה ליילוד נזק – בין היתר היא עלולה לגרום לנזק גולגלתי ודימומים העלולים לגרום להתפתחות נזק מוחי – יש מקום להגשת תביעה נזיקית.</seg>

          <seg id="45">שיתוק על שם ERB</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="46">שיתוק על שם ארב, הנה פגיעה עצבית מולדת במקלעת הברכיאלית (צומת עצבים המחבר את עמוד השדרה לחלק העליון של הכתף) וכאשר היא מתרחשת במהלך הלידה ראוי לבדוק האם הנזק ארע כתוצאה מרשלנות הצוות המיילד.</seg>
          <seg id="47">הפגיעה מתבטאת בחולשת שרירי היד ויכולה להגיע עד שיתוק מלא של כל הזרוע.</seg>
          <seg id="48">שיתוק זה נגרם לא פעם בשל קושי בהוצאתו של היילוד בשל התרחשות 'פרע כתפיים' - מצב חירום מיילדותי המרחש כאשר כתפיו של העובר נכלאות בפנים תעלת הלידה לאחר שראשו יצא.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="49">מתי עליכם לחשוד שהשיתוק נגרם כתוצאה מרשלנות רפואית?</seg>
          <seg id="50">במקרים שבהם הערכת משקלו של העובר הצביעה על כך שמדובר בעובר מקרוסומי, כלומר שהוא צפוי להיוולד במשקל העולה על 4.5 קילוגרם ובהתאם להנחיות עדיף ליילד את האם בניתוח קיסרי.</seg>
          <seg id="51">כאשר המשקל של היילוד הינו מעל 4 קילוגרם יש לשקול ניתוח קיסרי לאור גורמי הסיכון ובהם סכרת הריון והתארכות השלב השני של הלידה.</seg>
          <seg id="52">במקרה שהצוות הרפואי מתעלם מהערכת משקל חריגה של העובר או מגורמי סיכון נוספים ובוחר להמשיך בלידה וגינלית ומתממש הסיכון לפרע כתפיים ושיתוק ע"ש ERB, קיימת אפשרות סבירה כי מדובר ברשלנות רפואית.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="53">ואכן, ב-ע"א 2694/90, קבע בית המשפט העליון כי "הסיכון שבמהלך לידה תתרחש היצרות כתפיים ניתן לחיזוי מראש במידה כזו או אחרת של דיוק, והדרך למניעתה של היצרות כתפיים, מקום בו קיים חשש להתרחשותה היא עריכת ניתוח קיסרי".</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="55">הפרדת השלייה מהרחם ויציאתה מתרחשת בשל התכווצות הרחם לאחר יציאת היילוד והיא מלווה בדימום.</seg>
          <seg id="56">התהליך נמשך במרבית המקרים עד חצי שעה מרגע יציאתו של התינוק ועל פי רב מתרחש באופן ספונטני, ללא מעורבות הצוות הרפואי.</seg>
          <seg id="57">לאחר יציאת השלייה, יבדוק הצוות הרפואי האם היא יצאה בשלמותה או שמא נותרו חלקי שליה ברחם.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="58">במסגרת שלב זה, עשויים להתרחש סיבוכים שעלולים לגרום נזקים חמורים ליולדת.</seg>
          <seg id="59">אחד הסיבוכים המוכרים כתוצאה מהיוותרות שאריות שלייה ברחם קרוי "תסמונת אשרמן", הצטלקות דופן הרחם תוצאת דלקת הנגרמת בשל היוותרות שאריות שלייה ברחם, תופעה הפוגעת ברירית הרחם באופן שלא מאפשר השרשת היריון.</seg>
          <seg id="60">לכן במקרים בהם לא זיהה הצוות הרפואי כי נותרו שאריות שליה או לא נקט בכל האמצעים למנוע פגיעה ברירית הרחם למרות החשד לשאריות שליה ברחם יתכן ומדובר ברשלנות רפואית והמקרה ראוי לבדיקה מעמיקה ע"י עורך דין מנוסה בתחום.</seg>

          <seg id="3">A birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family’s life.</seg>
          <seg id="4">However, unfortunately, births sometimes end with serious damage to the mother or the newborn due to negligence of the medical staff.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="5">In cases of a birth that ended in physical injury to the newborn or the mother, examining the chain of events that led to the injury is required, as well as considering to appeal for legal counseling.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A lawyer specializing in the field of medical negligence will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, as he deems appropriate, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="7">It must be emphasized that not every error in treatment by the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When is it regarded as negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor’s mistake is a consequence of lack of skill or a deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of caution, caused damage to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not operated this way.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">In this article we will examine the different stages of childbirth, we will explain the complications that may occur in each of the stages and when they amount to medical negligence.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">The dilation stage</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">The dilation stage lasts on average between 8 and 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (to allow the passage of the fetus during birth) and at the end of the process, should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most of the cases of medical negligence during the labor stage deal with failure to recognize fetal distress before birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes even manifesting itself as cerebral palsy.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral Palsy (CP):</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral Palsy may be due to failure to recognize or delay in recognizing perinatal asphyxia, which is manifested as lack of oxygen supply to the brain of the fetus.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In general, monitoring the condition of the mother and correct interpretation of the monitor that follows fetal cardio activity heart should lead to early detection of fetal distress, allowing the medical team to act quickly and deliver the newborn before it is irreversibly impacted.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases of the medical team ignoring signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from lack of oxygen or of the team not interpreting the data correctly, of the fetal monitor in particular, or reacting too late to the distress expressed on the monitor – this may constitute negligence.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy may also be caused by prolapse of the umbilical cord, as well as by a uterine rupture that was not detected on time.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult events, the appropriate mode of action is to find out whether the medical staff acted properly.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="21">For example, attorney Anna Raif Liganza, from the office of Caspi Seror &amp; Co., specializings in representing victims of medical negligence, says that her office handled the claim of a child who has sustained damage during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the fetus’s head was too high, thus causing the umbilical cord to prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and block the oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of the pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and to be born with severe neurological damage.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="22">In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to the serious medical negligence of the staff of the maternity ward at a large hospital who, during the birth, did not recognize clear signs at the time that implied a real possibility that the mother was suffering from a ruptured uterus in the area of a surgical scar since her previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The fetus that was delivered through the rupture in his mother’s womb into her abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress before he extracted at a later stage as he was on the verge of death.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to this severe fetal distress during his birth, the child sustained a complex neurological disability.</seg>

          <seg id="25">We emphasize that in order to gain compensations, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence the existence of a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the asphyxiation and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused by said negligence and not by any other reason or factor.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out through the examination of medical indicators which, according to the medical literature, only if those exist there is a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the indicators of the level of blood acidity of the fetus, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage and more are examined.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="30">The active labor stage begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="32">Delay in childbirth and avoidance of performing a caesarean section operation</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, a dysfunctional birth occurs, that is lack of progress during the active birth process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such situations, it is customary to perform a caesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in delivery.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="35">“There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section on time may cause irreversible damage to the fetus”, attorney Raif-Liganza explained to us.</seg>
          <seg id="36">“For example, we managed a medical malpractice claim for the death of a newborn child caused by a significant delay in performing a caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Contrary to any known medical practice, the medical staff did not know how to recognize the fetal distress and perform a caesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the surgery caused a lot of systemic damage to the newborn, which finally led to her death shortly after her birth”.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="39">Malpractice in vacuum delivery</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother or the fetus is in significant danger that requires an extremely quick termination of the birth, a vacuum birth (vacuum extractor) is sometimes performed.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, using a vacuum, a “cap” is attached to the fetus’s head and then the fetus is pulled out forcefully.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great care, precision and skill.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="43">In these events, medical negligence may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory instructions and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for a longer time than allowed or when, despite the failure of many attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more of the number of attempts allowed.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In these cases, if the negligent operation of vacuum extraction caused damage to the newborn – including but not only, it could cause cranial damage and bleeding that could cause brain damage – it is possible to file a tort claim.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="45">ERB Paralysis</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="46">ERB Paralysis, is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of obstetrician crew negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury manifests itself as a weakness of the hand muscles and in acute cases may reach complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by a difficulty in removing the newborn due to “dislocated shoulders” – an obstetric emergency that occurs when the shoulders of the fetus are trapped in the birthing canal after its head has crowned.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the weight evaluation the fetus indicated that it is a macrosomic fetus, this means the expected birth weight is more than 4.5 kilograms and according to guidelines, it is better to perform a caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a caesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In the event that the medical team disregards the abnormal fetus weight assessment or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth, and shoulder dislocation and paralysis due to ERB occurs, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in AA 2694/90, the Supreme Court stated that “A caesarean section should be performed when the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance with certain accuracy, in order to prevent shoulder stenosis, when a risk of its occurrence is identified.”</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="54">Placenta stage</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="55">Separation of the placenta from the uterus and exiting occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the newborn expulsion and is followed by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">The process lasts in most cases up to half an hour from the moment the baby is born and often occurs spontaneously, without the medical intervention.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the placenta comes out, the medical team will check whether it came out in its entirety or whether there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="58">During this stage, complications may occur that may cause serious harm to the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the well-known complications resulting from placental remnants remaining in the uterus is called “Asherman’s syndrome”, the scarring of the uterine wall as a result of inflammation due to placental remnants left in the uterus, this phenomenon damages the endometrium so that it prevents rooting pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical staff didn’t detect placental remnants or didn’t act with all possible measures to prevent scarring of the uterine wall albeit the suspicion of placental remnants remaining in the uterus, this might be a case of medical negligence and an experienced lawyer in this field should check the details of the case in question.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="61">Maternal death</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="62">Maternal death during childbirth is quite rare.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family turns, unfortunately, into the most tragic event for it.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the woman giving birth on time or reacts late to said bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">“For example...”, Attorney Reif-Liganza told us, “our office filed a claim concerning a maternal death, in that case the medical team ignored and did not respond to the worrisome vital signs of the woman giving birth, for many hours, and was late in diagnosing a massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a well known complication of the underlying disease from which she suffered.”</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="66">“In another case...”, said Attorney Reif-Liganza, “our office represented the relatives of a mother who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated from the caesarean section that was not properly sutured.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In that case, the woman in labor complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, reacting late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death”.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="68">Uterine loss</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="69">In serious cases, medical negligence during childbirth can lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Raif Lingza: “Our office filed a lawsuit against a hospital based on a hysterectomy due to medical negligence after the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to improper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical team after birth, and despite this factor, the actions that could have prevented the damage were not taken in time”.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="71">What are the compensations awarded in lawsuits for medical negligence in childbirth?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="72">Newborn compensation for damages due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and grief, nursing care and paid treatment, wage losses and pension for the victims and even their parents and additional damage components.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="74">In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adapting housing to the baby’s needs, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">“The amount of compensation is determined in each case on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances”, says Attorney Reif-Liganza, and she adds and notes that “today, most lawsuits on the grounds of medical negligence end in a compromise that weighs the chances and risks that each party has in managing the procedure”, but the attorney added and said that “There are cases where the procedure ends only with a verdict, so if the lawsuit is not dismissed, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example, in a lawsuit conducted by our office, the district court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation in excess of ten million shekels”.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Medical negligence at different stages of birth.</seg>
          <seg id="2">In order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family's life.</seg>
          <seg id="4">However, unfortunately, sometimes births end in severe damages caused to the mother or the newborn as a result of the medical team's negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In cases where the birth resulted in physical harm to the newborn or the mother, it is appropriate to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A lawyer specializing in medical negligence will examine whether there were flaws in the medical team's conduct during the various stages of birth that caused damage, and if deemed necessary, will consult with a medical expert in the relevant field.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment by the medical team amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of the term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that it was negligently managed.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When is it considered negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor's mistake stemmed from a lack of skill or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have occurred had the doctor not acted in such a way.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article, we will examine the different stages of birth, explain the complications that may occur in each stage and when they amount to medical negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The stage of axes.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The labor stage lasts on average between 8 to 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (to allow the passage of the fetus during birth) and at the end of the process, it should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most cases of medical negligence during labor involve failure to identify fetal distress leading up to birth, which sometimes results in brain damage to the newborn.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral Palsy (CP):</seg>
          <seg id="16">Brain damage may occur as a result of failure to identify or delay in identifying sub-birth asphyxia, which is manifested by a failure in oxygen supply to the fetus's brain tissue.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Generally, monitoring the condition of the mother and correctly interpreting the monitor that tracks the fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of fetal distress, allowing the medical team to act quickly and deliver the baby before irreversible damage occurs.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases where the medical team ignores signs that the fetus is suffering from oxygen deficiency, or the team does not correctly interpret the data in front of them, particularly the fetal monitor, or responds late to the distress shown on the monitor - may constitute negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Brain damage can also be caused as a result of umbilical cord prolapse and also as a result of an undetected uterine rupture.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult events, it is appropriate to investigate whether the medical team acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, Attorney Anna Reich Ligenza, from the Kaspie Seror &amp; Co. law firm that specializes in representing victims of medical negligence, tells that her office handled a lawsuit of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the baby's head was too high, causing the umbilical cord to descend (when the umbilical cord precedes the baby's head) and damage to the oxygen supply to the baby's brain (as a result of the pressure of the baby's head on the umbilical cord), resulting in him being born with severe neurological damage.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, the lawyer reported that her office filed a lawsuit due to severe medical negligence by a maternity ward team in a large hospital, which during the birth did not identify in time clear signs that the birthing woman was suffering from a tear in the uterus in the area of the surgical scar from her previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The fetus, which escaped through a tear in its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity, suffered from severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to the severe distress during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">We emphasize that in order to be entitled to compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal link between the medical team's negligence that led to the failure to identify the complication and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused due to the aforementioned negligence and not from any other reason or factor.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The examination of the causal link will be conducted by examining medical indices that, according to the medical literature, only when they occur there is a causal link between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the fetus's blood acidity level, his Apgar scores, the presence of neurological and systemic injury, and more are examined.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The death of the fetus.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The active labor stage.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The active stage of labor begins when the cervix dilates to a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most of the medical complications occur during this critical stage.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Birth asphyxia and avoidance of performing a cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="33">In certain cases, a dysfunctional labor develops, meaning, a lack of progress in the active birth process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such cases, it is common to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that might be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.</seg>
          <seg id="35">"There are cases where not performing a cesarean section on time could cause irreversible damage to the fetus," explained attorney Reif-Ligenza to us.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"For example, we handled a medical negligence lawsuit of a stillbirth caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section."</seg>
          <seg id="37">Contrary to all recognized medical practice, the medical team failed to identify the fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the particularly slow progress of the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the surgery caused systemic damage to the mother, which eventually led to her death shortly after giving birth.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Negligence in childbirth and vacuum.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where there is a significant risk to the mother or fetus that requires a particularly rapid end to the birth, a vacuum delivery (empty extractor) is sometimes performed.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a "cap" is attached to the fetus's head using a vacuum and the fetus is then pulled out with force.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Naturally, this action involves risks and may cause harm to both the passer and the birther, therefore it requires caution, precision and great skill.</seg>
          <seg id="43">In these events, medical negligence may be expressed in the doctor not adhering to mandatory guidelines and performing the procedure despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the baby's head is too high in the pelvis, or performing it for a longer time than allowed, or when despite several failed attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the procedure more than the allowed number of attempts.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In these cases, if the negligent vacuum procedure caused damage - among other things, it could cause cranial damage and bleeding that could lead to brain damage - there is room for filing a lawsuit.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Silencing in the name of ERB.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Erb's palsy, a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (the nerve junction connecting the spine to the upper part of the shoulder), when it occurs during birth, it is appropriate to check whether the damage was caused by negligence of the delivery team.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury manifests as weakness in the arm muscles and can lead to complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This silence is often caused by difficulty in delivering the baby due to 'shoulder dystocia' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the baby's shoulders get stuck in the birth canal after its head has come out.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that the silence was caused by medical negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the fetus's weight assessment indicated that it is macrosomic, meaning it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kilograms, it is preferable according to guidelines to deliver the mother by cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the fetus weighs more than 4 kilograms, a cesarean section should be considered due to risk factors including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In the case that the medical team ignores the abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with vaginal birth, and the risk of shoulder dystocia and ERB's palsy occurs, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in case number 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk of shoulder dystocia during childbirth can be predicted with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder dystocia, where there is a risk of its occurrence, is to perform a cesarean section".</seg>
          <seg id="54">The stage of the placenta's expulsion.</seg>
          <seg id="55">The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its expulsion occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the birth of the baby and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">The process usually lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby is born and according to many, it happens spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the placenta is delivered, the medical team will check if it came out completely or if parts of it remained in the uterus.</seg>
          <seg id="58">During this stage, complications may occur that could cause serious harm to the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the known complications resulting from the retention of placental remnants in the uterus is called "Asherman's syndrome", a scarring of the uterine wall caused by inflammation due to the retention of placental remnants in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that prevents pregnancy implantation.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not identify that placental remnants were left or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the uterine wall despite suspicion of placental remnants in the uterus, it may be a case of medical negligence and the case should be thoroughly examined by an experienced attorney in the field.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The death of the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="62">The death of a mother during childbirth is a rather rare event.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring joy and happiness to the entire family, unfortunately, turns into the most tragic event for them.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In certain cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the woman giving birth on time or responds late to such bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">"For example...", Attorney Reich-Ligensa told us, "our office filed a lawsuit concerning the death of a mother during childbirth, where in that case the medical team ignored and did not respond to the alarming vital signs of the mother for many hours, and was late in diagnosing a massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the underlying disease she suffered from."</seg>
          <seg id="66">"In another case...", attorney Reich-Ligenza reported, "our office represented the relatives of a woman who passed away after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated from a cesarean section incision that was not properly stitched."</seg>
          <seg id="67">In that case, the woman who gave birth complained about severe pain and weakness after the surgery, but the medical team did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, only responding with delay after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Loss of a uterus.</seg>
          <seg id="69">In severe cases, medical negligence during childbirth may lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Reif Lingza: "Our office filed a lawsuit against a hospital based on a hysterectomy due to medical negligence after childbirth."</seg>
          <seg id="70">In that case, the mother, a young woman of 31, lost her uterus due to inadequate treatment of massive bleeding observed by the medical team after the birth, and yet timely actions that could have prevented the damage were not taken.</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the compensations awarded in lawsuits for medical negligence during childbirth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Compensation for birth injury due to medical negligence includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts given for pain and suffering, nursing and treatment costs, loss of earnings and pension for the victim and even for his parents, and additional damage components.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The compensation awarded to a minor victim for loss of earnings and pension is calculated in most cases based on the average wage in the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="74">Also, the compensation includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation equipment, the cost of adapting housing to the baby's needs, mobility, and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The compensation amount is determined in each case individually and according to its circumstances," says attorney Reif-Ligenza, adding that "today, most medical negligence claims end in a compromise that balances the chance and risk each party has in conducting the process." However, she added and noted that "there are cases where the process only ends with a verdict, then if the claim is not dismissed, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages. For example, in a case handled by our office, the District Court awarded a minor who suffered brain damage due to a delay in identifying a transient ischemic attack, a compensation exceeding ten million shekels."</seg>
          <seg id="76">In conclusion</seg>
          <seg id="77">Medical negligence during childbirth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.</seg>

          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment by the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When, then, is it negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor's mistake was due to a lack of skill or deviated from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the acceptable level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article, we will examine the different stages of birth, explain what are the complications that may occur at each stage and when they rise to medical negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The phase of contractions</seg>
          <seg id="12">The phase of contractions lasts on average from 8 to 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (in order to allow the passage of the fetus at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about 10 centimeters.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most of the cases of medical malpractice during the labor phase involve the failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes resulting in cerebral palsy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral Palsy (CP):</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral palsy may be caused by a failure to identify or a delay in identifying a perinatal asphyxiation, which manifests itself in a failure to supply oxygen to the brain tissue of the fetus.</seg>
          <seg id="17">As a general rule, monitoring the condition of the mother and correct interpretation of the monitor that tracks fetal cardiac activity should lead to early identification of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreparably damaged.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases in which the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or the team does not correctly interpret the data in front of it and in particular the fetal monitor or reacts late to the distress expressed on the monitor - may constitute negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a prolapse of the umbilical cord as well as a rupture in the uterus that was not detected in a timely manner.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult situations, it is important to find out whether the medical team acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, attorney Anna Reif Liganza, from the firm of Caspi Sror &amp; Co., which specializes in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her firm handled a lawsuit of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the head of the fetus was too high, thereby causing the umbilical cord to drop (when the umbilical cord precedes the head of the fetus) and damage the oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and giving birth to a serious neurological injury.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to serious medical negligence by the staff of the maternity department in a large hospital who, during the birth, did not identify clear signs that required a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of her previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The fetus that was ejected through the rupture in its mother's uterus into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">It should be emphasized that in order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal link between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the infant and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused by such negligence and not by any other reason or factor.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out by examining medical indicators that, according to the medical literature, only in their existence there is a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the indicators of the level of acidity in the blood of the fetus, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic injury, and more are examined.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The passing of the fetus</seg>
          <seg id="29">The Active Birth Stage</seg>
          <seg id="30">The active birth stage begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Delayed birth and avoiding caesarean section</seg>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, that is, a lack of progress of the active birth process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.</seg>
          <seg id="35">"There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner can cause irreversible damage to the fetus," explained Attorney Reif-Liganza.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"For example, we managed a medical malpractice claim for the death of a newborn caused by a significant delay in performing a caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Unlike any recognized medical practice, the medical staff was not able to recognize the fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the surgery caused systemic damage to the newborn, which ultimately led to her death shortly after her birth. "</seg>
          <seg id="39">Negligence in vacuum birth</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother or fetus is exposed to a significant danger that requires an especially rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a "dome" is attached to the head of the fetus using a vacuum and the fetus is pulled out by force.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great caution, accuracy and skill.</seg>
          <seg id="43">In these cases, medical negligence may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory instructions and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the head of the fetus is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for a longer time than allowed or when, despite the failure of several attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more than the allowed number of attempts.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In these cases, if the careless operation of the vacuum caused damage to the newborn - among other things, it can cause cranial damage and bleeding that can cause the development of brain damage - there is room for filing a tort claim.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Paralysis named after Erb</seg>
          <seg id="46">Paralysis named after Arv, here is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is worth checking whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric staff.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury manifests itself in the weakness of the hand muscles and can reach complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a "shoulder dislocation" - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus's shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the assessment of the weight of the fetus indicated that it was a macrosomal fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kilograms and in accordance with the guidelines it is preferable to give birth to the mother by cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a cesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder dislocation and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in CA 2694 / 90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance to one degree or another of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a fear of its occurrence, is to conduct a cesarean section."</seg>
          <seg id="54">The placenta exit stage</seg>
          <seg id="55">The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the exit of the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">The process lasts in most cases up to half an hour from the moment the baby comes out and often occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the placenta comes out, the medical team will check whether it came out in its entirety or whether there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.</seg>
          <seg id="58">During this stage, complications may occur that can cause serious damage to the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the well-known complications resulting from the formation of placental residues in the uterus is called "Asherman's syndrome," the scarring of the uterine wall is the result of inflammation caused by the formation of placental residues in the uterus, a phenomenon that affects the endometrium in a way that does not allow the implantation of pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not recognize that there were placental residues or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the endometrium despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, this may be medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The passing of the birthmother</seg>
          <seg id="62">Death during childbirth is very rare.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or reacts late to such bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">"For example," Attorney Reif-Liganza told us, "our office filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a woman giving birth, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the alarming vital signs of the woman giving birth, for long hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the underlying disease from which she suffered."</seg>
          <seg id="66">"In another case," said Attorney Reif-Liganza, "our office represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated from a cesarean section that was not sutured properly.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, reacting late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death. "</seg>
          <seg id="68">Loss of a uterus</seg>
          <seg id="69">In severe cases, medical negligence at birth can lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Rafe Lingza: "Our office filed a lawsuit against a hospital based on a hysterectomy due to medical negligence after birth.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical team after the birth, and yet no actions were taken at the time that could have prevented the damage. "</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the damages awarded in claims for medical malpractice at birth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Newborn compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being provided for pain and suffering, nursing and care wages, wage and pension losses to the victim and even to his parents and other damage components.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="74">The compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adapting housing to the baby's needs, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The amount of compensation is determined on a case-by-case basis and according to the circumstances," says Attorney Reif-Liganza, and she adds and notes that "today, most claims on the grounds of medical negligence end in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in conducting the procedure," but the attorney added and said that "there are cases in which the procedure ends only with a judgment, then if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and, for example, in a lawsuit conducted by our office, the district court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation in excess of ten million shekels."</seg>
          <seg id="76">To sum up</seg>
          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by a lawyer skilled in managing claims on the grounds of medical negligence, can help you win the compensation you deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="2">In order to win damages, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that the damage was caused by negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family's life.</seg>
          <seg id="4">But unfortunately, sometimes births end in serious birth or delivery damage caused by medical negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In cases where childbirth ended in a physical injury, to the child or to the mother, there is room to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even to consider seeking legal counsel.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A medical malpractice attorney will examine whether there were any defects in the medical staff's conduct at the various stages of the birth that caused the harm and, where appropriate, consult a medical expert in the relevant field.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every medical error amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of the term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily teach that the treatment was negligent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When, then, is it negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor's error was due to a lack of skill or a deviation from a reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused otherwise.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article, we will examine the different stages of labor, explain what complications may occur at each stage and when they amount to medical negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The axis phase</seg>
          <seg id="12">The axis phase lasts on average between 8 and 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (to allow passage of the fetus at birth) and should reach a diameter of about four inches [10 cm] at the end of the process.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most cases of medical negligence in the pivotal stage involve the failure to recognize fetal distress before birth, which causes damage to the unborn child sometimes even manifesting as cerebral palsy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral palsy:</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral palsy may be caused by a failure to detect or delay the detection of a subconjunctivitis, which is manifested by a failure to supply oxygen to the fetal brain tissue.</seg>
          <seg id="17">As a rule, monitoring of the condition of the newborn and the correct placement of the fetal heart monitor should lead to early detection of fetal distress development, allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases in which the medical team ignores signs of oxygen deprivation in the fetus or misinterpret the data in front of the fetus and on the fetal monitor or responds late to stress on the monitor may constitute negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a fall of the umbilical cord as well as a rupture of the uterus that is not detected in time.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these extreme cases, it's worthwhile to find out if the medical team acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, attorney Anna Reif Ligenza, of the financial firm Serrore &amp; Co., which specializes in representing medical malpractice victims, reports that her office handled a lawsuit of a child who was injured during birth after the midwife popped the sac of spleen when the fetal head was too high, thereby causing the umbilical cord to fall (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of the fetal head pressing on the umbilical cord) and giving birth to a severely neurologically impaired child.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, a lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to gross medical negligence on the part of a maternity ward staff at a large hospital who during the delivery did not recognize any obvious signs that should have led to a real suspicion that the newborn had a tear of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of her previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The fetus that escaped through the rupture into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued late on the verge of death.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to severe fetal distress during birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">It should be emphasized that, in order to obtain damages, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal relationship between the negligence of the medical team that led to the breastfeeding diagnosis and the damage caused to the unborn child, that is, that the damage was caused by negligence and not by any other cause or factor.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The causal link will be established by examining medical indicators that, according to the medical literature, are the only indicators of a causal relationship between suffocation and brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, they look at the foetus' blood levels of acids, its abortion scores, the presence of neurological and systemic damage, and more.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The death of the fetus</seg>
          <seg id="29">The active stage of labor</seg>
          <seg id="30">The active stage of labor begins when the cervical opening reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.</seg>
          <seg id="32">In addition, the baby's birth was postponed and a caesarean section was avoided.</seg>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, Carrie, a lack of progression of the active birthing process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such cases, a caesarean section is usually performed to prevent various harmful effects on the fetus from delayed labor.</seg>
          <seg id="35">"There are instances when failure to perform a cesarean on time can cause irreversible damage to the fetus", explained lawyer Rafe-Ligenza.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"For example, we were handling a medical malpractice lawsuit of a stillborn child who died due to a significant delay in a C-section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Unlike any known medical practice, medical staff were not trained to recognize fetal distress and perform a cesarean despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the surgery caused great structural damage to Luda which ultimately led to her death shortly after her birth".</seg>
          <seg id="39">Carelessness in the Birth of a Vacuum</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where there is a significant danger to the mother or fetus requiring a particularly rapid termination of labor, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a vacuum "dope" is placed on the fetus's head and the fetus is forcibly pulled out.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Naturally, this action involves risks and can cause harm to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great care, accuracy, and skill.</seg>
          <seg id="43">In these cases, medical negligence may be manifested by the physician not following mandatory guidelines and performing the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performing it for too long or when despite the failure of several attempts the physician continues and repeats the operation more than the number of attempts allowed.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In these cases, if the careless vacuum action caused damage, among other things, it may cause cranial damage and bleeding that could lead to the development of brain damage, there is room for a damages claim.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Paralysis in the name of ERB</seg>
          <seg id="46">Paralysis named after Arb, this is a congenital nerve damage in the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is worth checking whether the damage occurred due to negligence of the birthing staff.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury manifests in weakness of the arm muscles and can lead to complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in discharging the newborn due to the occurrence of 'paraplegia' - a congenital emergency that occurs when the fetus' shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has been removed.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the weight assessment of the fetus indicates that it is a chromosomal fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 15 pounds [4.5 kg] and according to the guidelines it is preferable to deliver the mother by cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the baby weighs more than 10 pounds, a cesarean should be considered in light of risk factors, including gestational diabetes and second stage labor delays.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In the event that the medical team ignores the estimate of abnormal fetal weight or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder fracture and paralysis from ERB is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in EC 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk of shoulder formation during birth can be predicted in advance with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder formation, where there is a risk of it occurring, is by cesarean section".</seg>
          <seg id="54">The exit phase of the placenta</seg>
          <seg id="55">The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the exit of the baby and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">The process usually lasts for up to half an hour after the baby comes out and often occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the egg is removed, the medical team will check to see if it came out whole or if there are any parts of the egg left in the uterus.</seg>
          <seg id="58">At this stage, complications may occur that could cause serious birth defects.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the most common complications of uterine fibrosis is called Ashman syndrome. Uterine fibrosis is the result of inflammation caused by uterine fibrosis, a condition that affects the uterine lining to the point that the cervix cannot move.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical team failed to identify any residual bone or failed to take all appropriate measures to prevent uterine fibroid injury despite suspected residual bone in the uterus, it may be a case of medical negligence and the case merits further examination by an experienced attorney.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Death at birth</seg>
          <seg id="62">A stillbirth during childbirth is a fairly rare occurrence.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family turns, unfortunately, into the most tragic event for her.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the newborn in time or responds late to such bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">"For example . . . ", explained attorney Reif-Lingenza, "our firm filed a claim involving a stillbirth in which the medical team ignored and failed to respond to the life-threatening signs of the birth for hours and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that was a known complication of her underlying illness".</seg>
          <seg id="66">"In another case", explained attorney Reif-Lingenza, "our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to hemorrhaging caused by an improperly sewn caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In the same case, the midwife complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, responding only late after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death".</seg>
          <seg id="68">Loss of uterus</seg>
          <seg id="69">In serious cases, medical negligence at birth can lead to a hysterectomy, says lawyer Rafe Lingza: "Our firm sued a hospital on the grounds of medical negligence after childbirth.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In the same case, the woman, a 31-year-old, lost her womb due to a failure to properly treat massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after the birth and yet no action was taken in time that could have prevented the damage".</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the compensation claims for medical negligence in childbirth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Childbirth compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, lost wages and pensions for the victim and even for his parents and other damage components.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The compensation awarded to an injured minor for lost wages and pensions is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the household.</seg>
          <seg id="74">Also, the compensation includes medical expenses, medical and rehabilitation equipment costs, housing adaptation costs for the baby, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The amount of the compensation is determined in each case by the person and his circumstances", explains attorney Rafe-Ligenza, adding that "today most medical malpractice claims end in a settlement that weighs the chance and risk each party has in the proceedings". However, the lawyer added that "there are cases where the proceedings end only in a verdict, in which if the lawsuit is not dismissed, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and, for example, in a lawsuit brought by our firm, the District Court ruled that a minor who had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage due to an Irish vaginal hernia received compensation in excess of ten million shekels".</seg>

          <seg id="1">Medical negligence in the various stages of childbirth</seg>
          <seg id="2">In order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by the same negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family's life.</seg>
          <seg id="4">But unfortunately, sometimes births end with severe birth or newborn injuries due to the negligence of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In cases where birth has resulted in physical harm to the infant or the mother, there is scope to examine the chain of events that led to the injury and even to consider seeking legal advice.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A medical malpractice lawyer will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff at the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, as appropriate, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every error in treatment by the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily teach that the handling was negligent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When is it negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor's error was due to incompetence or deviation from reasonable care, and the incompetence and deviation from accepted care caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article, we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications may occur at each stage, and when they amount to medical negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The junction phase</seg>
          <seg id="12">The fusion phase lasts on average between 8 and 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (to allow the fetus to pass through at birth) and should eventually reach a diameter of about four inches [10 cm].</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most cases of medical malpractice at the placenta involve the failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which has caused damage to the newborn that sometimes manifests itself in cerebral palsy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition that affects the brain and spinal cord.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral palsy can be caused by misidentification or delayed identification of congenital breastfeeding, which is manifested by failure to supply oxygen to the fetal brain tissue.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In general, monitoring the newborn's condition and correctly unfolding the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of developing fetal distress, allowing the medical team to quickly intervene and rescue the newborn before irreversible damage is done.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Failure to respond to signs of oxygen deprivation, or to interpret data correctly, especially on the fetal monitor, or to respond to distress on the  monitor, may be a sign of negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a cord-slip and an undetected uterine rupture.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these extreme events, it's worth checking whether the medical staff acted appropriately.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, attorney Anna Reif Ligenza, of the law firm of Sarrur &amp; Co., specializing in representing medical malpractice victims, says that her office handled a lawsuit from a child who was injured during birth after the midwife punctured the amniotic sac when the fetal head was too high, causing the umbilical cord to fall (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (due to pressure from the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and resulting in a child being born with severe neurological damage.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, a lawyer said that her office had filed a lawsuit for gross medical negligence by a staff member in the maternity ward of a large hospital who, during the birth, failed to identify at the time clear signs that would have led to the suspicion that the child was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of the previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The fetus that escaped through the rift in its mother's uterus into the womb space suffered severe fetal distress until its late release when it was on the verge of death.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to severe fetal distress during his birth the child was left with a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">We emphasize that in order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal relationship between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the lactating mother and the damage caused to the newborn, that is, that the damage was caused by such negligence and not by any other cause or factor.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The causal relationship will be examined using medical criteria that the medical literature has found to be the only causal relationship between the stroke and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the fetus' blood acidity index, its appendix scores, the presence of neurological and systemic damage, and more are tested.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Death of the fetus</seg>
          <seg id="29">The active birth stage</seg>
          <seg id="30">The active stage of labor begins when the cervix opening reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical phase.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Having a baby and avoiding a C-section</seg>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., the lack of progress of the active birth process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such cases, a caesarean section is performed to prevent various possible fetal injuries due to delayed delivery.</seg>
          <seg id="35">"There are cases where failure to perform a C-section on time could cause irreversible harm to the fetus", explained lawyer Rafe-Ligonza.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"For example, we have filed a medical malpractice claim of a child's death caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Contrary to any accepted medical practice, the medical staff had not been trained to recognize fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the operation caused extensive systemic damage to Lilouda which eventually led to her death shortly after birth".</seg>
          <seg id="39">Negligence in the birth of a vacuum</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother is pregnant or the fetus is in significant danger requiring a particularly rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a vacuum dome is attached to the fetus' head and the fetus is forcibly pulled out.</seg>
          <seg id="42">This is inherently dangerous and can cause harm to both the fetus and the child, and it requires great care, precision, and skill.</seg>
          <seg id="43">In these cases, medical malpractice may be manifested by the physician not following the mandatory instructions and performing the operation despite the existence of contraindications, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performing it for too long or when despite the failure of several attempts the physician continues and repeats the operation more than the number of attempts allowed.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In these cases if the negligent vacuum operation caused birth defects  among others it could cause cranial damage and bleeding that could cause the development of brain damage  there is room for a damages claim.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Paralysis on the name of ERB</seg>
          <seg id="46">Paralysis of the spine, here's congenital nerve damage in the cervical spine and when it occurs during childbirth it's worth checking to see if the damage was caused by the negligence of the delivery team.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury manifests in weakness of the hand muscles and can reach a complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in delivering the newborn due to the occurrence of shoulder fleas - a maternity emergency that whispers when the fetus' shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the fetal weight estimate indicated that the fetus was macrosomal, meaning that it was expected to be born weighing more than 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and according to guidelines it is preferable to deliver the mother by cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the newborn weighs more than 10 pounds, a cesarean section should be considered in light of risk factors including gestational diabetes and prolonged second stage labor.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In the event that the medical team ignores the fetal weight abnormality or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder dislocation and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that medical negligence is involved.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in U.S.C. 2694/90 the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk of shoulder deformity during childbirth can be predicted with varying degrees of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder deformity where it is suspected is by cesarean section".</seg>
          <seg id="54">The placenta is released</seg>
          <seg id="55">The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to uterine contractions after the baby's exit and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">The process usually lasts up to a half hour from the time the baby is delivered and is often spontaneous, without the involvement of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the discharge, the medical team will check to see if she's completely discharged or if there are any parts of her uterus left.</seg>
          <seg id="58">At this stage, complications can occur that can cause serious damage to the fetus.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the most common complications of uterine prolapse is called Ashman's syndrome, a uterine scar caused by inflammation caused by uterine prolapse, a condition that affects the lining of the uterus in a way that prevents pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="60">So in cases where the medical team did not identify that she had residual uterine fibroids or did not take all the necessary measures to prevent uterine fibroids from being damaged despite the suspicion of uterine residual uterine fibroids, it may be a case of medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Death in childbirth</seg>
          <seg id="62">Maternal death during childbirth is a rather rare occurrence.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that should have brought happiness and joy to the whole family turns, unfortunately, into the most tragic event for her.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother on time or responds late to such bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">"For example", explained Attorney Reif-Ligenza, "our office filed a lawsuit concerning the death of a newborn, in which the medical staff ignored and failed to respond to the worrying vital signs of the newborn for long hours, and later diagnosed massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the underlying disease she suffered from".</seg>
          <seg id="66">"In another case", said Attorney Reif-Ligenza, "our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding from an improperly sutured caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In the same case, the woman complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, responding only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death".</seg>
          <seg id="68">Loss of uterus</seg>
          <seg id="69">In severe cases, medical negligence at birth can lead to a hysterectomy, says lawyer Rafe Lingza: "Our office has filed a lawsuit against a hospital that performed a hysterectomy because of medical negligence after birth.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In that case the mother, a young woman of 31, lost her uterus due to inadequate treatment of massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after birth and yet no timely action was taken that could have prevented the damage".</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the damages awarded in medical malpractice at birth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Maternity compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, loss of wages and pension to the injured and even to his parents and other damage components.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Compensation paid to an injured minor for lost wages and pensions is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="74">Also, the compensation includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation equipment, the cost of adapting the home to the needs of the baby, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The amount of compensation was determined in each case for his body and according to his circumstances", says lawyer Reif-Ligenza. She adds that "today most medical malpractice claims end in a settlement that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in the management of the procedure", but she added that "there are cases where the procedure ends only in a judgment, which then if the claim is not rejected, the claimants will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example, in a lawsuit conducted by our office, the district court ruled for a minor who suffered a cerebral palsy due to a delay in seeing a distress settlement. The compensation exceeds ten million shekels".</seg>
          <seg id="76">In conclusion</seg>
          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In these cases, a proper judicial review of the chain of events that led to the tragic outcome, by a lawyer trained in handling medical malpractice claims, can help you get the compensation you deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="5">In cases where the birth resulted in physical injury to either the child or the mother, there is scope to examine the chain of events that led to the injury and even to consider seeking legal advice.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A medical malpractice lawyer will examine if there were defects in the medical staff conduct at the various stages of birth that caused the injury, and, if deemed appropriate, will consult a medical specialist in the relevant field.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be stressed that not every error in care on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily teach that its management was negligent.</seg>

          <seg id="17">In general, monitoring the condition of the newborn, and proper deployment of the fetal heart monitor should lead to early detection of developing fetal distress, allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreversibly harmed.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases where the medical staff ignore signs of oxygen deprivation in the fetus or do not correctly interpret the data in it, especially the fetal monitor, or respond with delays to the distress displayed on the monitor  may be negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a dislocated umbilical cord as well as an undetected uterine tear.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these extreme events, it's worth asking whether the medical team acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, Anna Reiff Liganza, an attorney with the law firm of Crouch &amp; Co. specializing in representing medical malpractice victims, explains that her office handled a child who was injured during birth after a midwife blocked the amniotic sac when the fetal head was too high, resulting in the fall of the umbilical cord (when the umbilical cord is in advance of the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (caused by pressure from the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and his child being born with severe neurological damage.</seg>

          <seg id="24">Due to severe fetal distress during his birth, the child was born with a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">We insist, that in order to win damages, the plaintiffs prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal relationship between the negligence of the medical staff which led to the failure to identify the lactating woman and the damage to the newborn, which means that the damage was caused by said negligence and not by any other cause or factor.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Causal association analysis will be performed by examining medical parameters whose existence is the only one in the medical literature that provides a causal link between the concussion and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the fetus' blood acidity measurements, its blastocyst scores, the presence of neurological and systemic damage, and more.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Death of the fetus</seg>

          <seg id="47">The injury manifests in weakening of the muscles of the hand and can extend to complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in delivering the newborn due to a "breech disorder" - a birth emergency that occurs when the fetus's shoulders become trapped inside the birth canal after its head is released.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?</seg>

          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In these cases proper legal examination of the chain of events that led to the tragic outcome, by a lawyer trained in handling medical malpractice claims, can help you get the compensation you deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Medical Malpractice at Various Stages of Birth</seg>
          <seg id="2">In order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence</seg>
          <seg id="3">Childbirth is one of the happiest and most exciting events in the life of a family.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Unfortunately, however, sometimes births end in serious damage caused to the mother or newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In cases where the birth ended in physical injury, either to the newborn or to the mother, it is appropriate to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A lawyer specializing in medical malpractice will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, if he sees fit, will consult with a medical expert in the relevant field.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during labor do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When, then, is it negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor's error was due to incompetence or deviation from the reasonable level of care, and the incompetence and deviation from the acceptable level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused had the doctor not acted in this way.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article we will examine the different stages of birth, explain the complications that may occur at each stage and when they amount to medical malpractice.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Phase of contractions</seg>
          <seg id="12">The contraction phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (in order to allow the passage of the fetus at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most cases of medical malpractice during labor involve failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes even expressed in cerebral palsy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral palsy (CP):</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral palsy may be caused by failure to recognize or delay in identifying perinatal asphyxia, which manifests itself in a failure to supply oxygen to the fetus' brain tissue.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In general, monitoring the mother's condition and correctly interpreting the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical staff to act quickly and rescue the newborn before he is irreversibly injured.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases in which the medical staff ignores signs indicating that the fetus suffers from a lack of oxygen or that the staff does not correctly interpret the data before it, especially the fetal monitor, or reacts late to the distress expressed in the monitor – may constitute negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy may also be caused by umbilical cord prolapse and uterine rupture that was not detected in time.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult events, it is worth clarifying whether the medical staff acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, Adv. Anna Reif Ligenza, of Caspi Srour &amp; Co., a law firm specializing in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her firm handled a claim of a child who was injured during birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the fetus' head was too high, thereby leading to umbilical cord prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetus' head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure from the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and to his being born with severe neurological damage.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to gross medical negligence on the part of the staff of the maternity ward at a large hospital, which during the birth did not identify clear signs in time that required a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of her previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The fetus, which was ejected through the rupture in its mother's uterus into the abdominal cavity, suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage, on the verge of death.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to the severe fetal suffering during childbirth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">We emphasize that in order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the asphyxiation and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused as a result of such negligence and not due to any other reason or cause.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The causal relationship will be examined by examining medical indices that, according to the medical literature, only when there is a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the indicators of the pH level in the fetus' blood, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage, and more are examined.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Death of the fetus</seg>
          <seg id="29">Active birth phase</seg>
          <seg id="30">The stage of active birth begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical phase.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Delay in childbirth and avoidance of performing a cesarean section</seg>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, that is, lack of progression of the process of active birth.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.</seg>
          <seg id="35">"There are cases in which failure to perform a cesarean section on time may cause irreversible damage to the fetus," Attorney Reif-Ligenza explained to us.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"For example, we conducted a medical malpractice lawsuit for maternal death caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Contrary to any known medical practice, the medical staff failed to identify the fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the particularly slow progression of the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the surgery caused systemic damage to the birth rate, which eventually led to her death shortly after birth."</seg>
          <seg id="39">Negligence in vacuum birth</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother or fetus faces significant danger that requires a particularly rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a "dome" is vacuumed to the fetus' head and the fetus is forcefully pulled out.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great care, precision and skill.</seg>
          <seg id="43">In these cases, medical malpractice may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory guidelines and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for longer than permitted or when despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more than the permitted number of attempts.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In these cases, if the negligent vacuum operation caused damage to the newborn – among other things, it may cause cranial damage and hemorrhages that may cause the development of brain damage – there is room to file a tort claim.</seg>
          <seg id="45">ERB palsy</seg>
          <seg id="46">Erb's palsy is a congenital nerve injury to the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is worth checking whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric staff.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury is manifested by weakness of the hand muscles and can reach complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a "shoulder dislocation" - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus' shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after the head has come out.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical malpractice?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the weight assessment of the fetus indicated that it is a macrosomic fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kilograms and according to the guidelines, it is better to deliver the mother by cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a cesarean section should be considered in light of risk factors, including gestational diabetes and prolongation of the second stage of birth.</seg>
          <seg id="52">If the medical staff ignores an abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder rupture and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical malpractice.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in Civil Appeal 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a concern that it will occur, is to perform a cesarean section."</seg>
          <seg id="54">Placental exit phase</seg>
          <seg id="55">The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the exit of the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">In most cases, the process lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby leaves and usually takes place spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the placenta exits, the medical staff will check whether it has come out intact or whether parts of the placenta remain in the uterus.</seg>
          <seg id="58">During this stage, complications may occur that can cause serious damage to the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the well-known complications as a result of placental residues remaining in the uterus is called Asherman syndrome, scarring of the uterine wall as a result of inflammation caused by placental residues remaining in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that makes it impossible to implant a pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical staff did not identify placental residues or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the uterine lining despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, this may be medical malpractice and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Death of the mother</seg>
          <seg id="62">The death of a mother during childbirth is quite rare.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical staff does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or responds late to the bleeding as stated.</seg>
          <seg id="65">"For example...", Adv. Reif-Ligneza told us, "our firm filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a mother, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the mother's worrisome vital signs for many hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the background disease from which she suffered."</seg>
          <seg id="66">"In another case...", said Adv. Reif-Ligneza, "our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after the birth of twins due to bleeding originating in the cesarean section incision that was not properly sewn.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, reacted late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death."</seg>
          <seg id="68">Loss of uterus</seg>
          <seg id="69">In severe cases, medical malpractice in childbirth may lead to hysterectomy, says Adv. Reif Lingze: "Our firm conducted a lawsuit against a hospital based on hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to the lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after the birth, yet no timely actions were taken that could have prevented the damage."</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the damages awarded in claims for medical malpractice in childbirth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Neonatal compensation for injury due to medical malpractice in childbirth includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and suffering, nursing and wage care, wage and pension losses to the victim and even to his parents, and other components of damage.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="74">In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation devices, the cost of adjusting housing to the baby's needs, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The amount of compensation is determined on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances," says Adv. Reif-Liganza, and she adds that "today most claims on the grounds of medical malpractice end in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in conducting the proceeding," but the lawyer added that "there are cases in which the proceeding ends only with a judgment, in which case if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages, and for example,  As part of a lawsuit conducted by our firm, the District Court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation exceeding ten million shekels."</seg>
          <seg id="76">Finally</seg>
          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney skilled in managing claims on the grounds of medical malpractice, can help you win the compensation you deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult events, it is appropriate to find out whether the medical staff acted properly.</seg>

          <seg id="26">The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out through the examination of medical indicators which, according to the medical literature, only in their existence is there a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the indicators of the level of acidity in the blood of the fetus, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage and more are examined.</seg>
          <seg id="28">the death of the fetus</seg>
          <seg id="29">The active labor stage</seg>
          <seg id="30">The active labor stage begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>

          <seg id="39">Malpractice in vacuum delivery</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother or the fetus is in significant danger that requires an extremely quick termination of the birth, a vacuum birth (empty vagina) is sometimes performed.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, using a vacuum, a "cap" is attached to the embryo's head and the embryo is pulled out by force.</seg>

          <seg id="45">Paralysis in the name of ERB</seg>
          <seg id="46">Paralysis named after Erv, here is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetrician.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury manifests itself in the weakness of the hand muscles and can reach complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of 'dislocated shoulders' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the shoulders of the fetus are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.</seg>

          <seg id="68">uterine loss</seg>
          <seg id="69">In serious cases, medical negligence during childbirth can lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Raif Lingza: "Our office filed a lawsuit against a hospital based on a hysterectomy due to medical negligence after the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In that case, the woman giving birth, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical team after the birth, and despite this, the actions that could have prevented the damage were not taken in time."</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the compensations awarded in lawsuits for medical negligence in childbirth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Newborn compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and suffering, nursing care and paid treatment, wage losses and pension for the victim and even his parents and additional damage components.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="74">In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adapting housing to the baby's needs, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The amount of compensation is determined in each case on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances," says Attorney Reif-Liganza, and she adds and notes that "today, most lawsuits on the grounds of medical negligence end in a compromise that weighs the chances and risks that each party has in managing the procedure," but the attorney added and said that "There are cases where the procedure ends only with a verdict, so if the lawsuit is not dismissed, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example, in a lawsuit conducted by our office, the district court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation in excess of ten million shekels" .</seg>
          <seg id="76">In conclusion</seg>
          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic result, by an attorney skilled in managing medical malpractice claims, can help you win the compensation you deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Medical Malpractice in various stages of birth</seg>
          <seg id="2">In order to win damages,the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence</seg>
          <seg id="3">Birth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in a family's life.</seg>
          <seg id="4">However, unfortunately, sometimes births end in severe damage caused to the mother or newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In cases where the birth ended in physical injury, the newborn or the mother has room to examine the events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A lawyer specializing in the field of medical malpractice will examine whether there were flaws in the conduct of the medical team during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, if he sees fit, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every error in care on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during the birth do not necessarily indicate that her management was negligent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When, then, is it negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor's mistake resulted from ineptitude or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the ineptitude and deviation from the acceptable level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article, we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications can occur at each stage and when they arise to be treated.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Stage of contractions</seg>
          <seg id="12">The labor phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (in order to allow the passage of the fetus during childbirth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most cases of medical malpractice in the contraceptive phase involve failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes even cerebral palsy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral Palsy (CP):</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral palsy can be caused by a failure to recognize or delay in identifying a grandparent's breast, which is manifested in a failure to supply oxygen to the brain tissue of the fetus.</seg>
          <seg id="17">As a rule, monitoring the condition of the newborn and correctly decoding the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early detection of fetal distress development, allowing the medical team to act quickly and extract the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases in which the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or that the staff misinterprets the data in front of it, especially the fetal monitor, or responds belatedly to the distress expressed by the monitor may constitute negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a prolapse of the umbilical cord as well as a rupture of the uterus that was not detected in a timely manner.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult events it is important to ascertain whether the medical staff acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, Adv. Anna Rafe Liganza, of Sror &amp; Co., a financial firm that specializes in representing victims of medical malpractice, said that her firm handled the case of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the head of the fetus was too high, resulting in a prolapse of the umbilical cord (when the umbilical cord precedes the head of the fetus) and injury In the supply of oxygen to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and being born with a severe neurological injury.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, the lawyer said that her office had filed a claim due to gross medical negligence by the maternity ward staff at a large hospital who, during labor, failed to identify in time clear signs that warranted a real suspicion that the woman was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The fetus, which was ejected through the tear in its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity, suffered from severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to the severe fetal suffering during birth, the child had a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">We will emphasize that in order to win damages, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that resulted in the failure to identify the tinnitus and the damage caused to the newborn, i.e. that the damage was caused due to such negligence and not for any other reason or cause.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The examination of the causal relationship will be carried out by examining medical indicators that according to the medical literature only in the existence of which there is a causal relationship between the tinnitus and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, measures of the pH level in the foetus's blood, its apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic injury, and more are examined.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Fetal Death</seg>
          <seg id="29">Stage of Active birth</seg>
          <seg id="30">The stage of active delivery begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 cm and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Delay in birth and avoiding C-section</seg>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., a lack of progress of the active birth process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such situations, it is customary to perform a C-section, in order to prevent various damage that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.</seg>
          <seg id="35">"There are cases where failure to perform a C-section in a timely manner can cause irreparable harm to the fetus," Reif-Liganza explained.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"For example, we handled a medical malpractice claim of a birth death caused by a significant delay in performing a C-section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Contrary to all recognized medical practice, the medical staff failed to recognize the fetal distress and perform a C-section despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the surgery caused systemic damage to the newborn which ultimately led to her death shortly after birth."</seg>
          <seg id="39">Negligence in Vacuum Birth</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother or fetus is in significant danger, which requires a particularly rapid termination of the birth, sometimes a vacuum birth is carried out.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a "dome" vacuum is attached to the head of the fetus and forcibly pulls the fetus out.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Naturally, this action involves dangers and can cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great care, precision and skill.</seg>
          <seg id="43">In these events, medical negligence may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory guidelines and carries out the operation despite the existence of a counter-label, such as when the head of the fetus is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for longer than permitted, or when despite the failure of many attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the action more than the permitted number of attempts.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In these cases, if the negligent action of the vacuum caused damage to the newborn – among other things, it may cause cranial damage and bleeds that may cause brain damage – there is room for a tort claim to be filed.</seg>
          <seg id="45">ERB Paralysis</seg>
          <seg id="46">Erb paralysis is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (a nerve node that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is worth examining whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric staff.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury is caused by weakness of the arm muscles and can result in complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a 'shoulder injury' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the foetus's shoulders become trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that the paralysis is caused by medical malpractice?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where an assessment of the weight of the fetus indicated that it was a macrosomial fetus, that is, it is expected to be born weighing in excess of 4.5 kg and according to the guidelines it is better to deliver the mother by caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kg, a C-section should be considered in light of the risk factors including gestational diabetes and the lengthening of the second stage of birth.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In the event that the medical team ignores the assessment of abnormal weight of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with vaginal delivery and the risk of ERB shoulder injury and paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that"the risk of shoulder stenosis occurring during childbirth can be foreseen with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where it is feared to occur, is to conduct a caesarean section."</seg>
          <seg id="54">Placenta Exit Stage</seg>
          <seg id="55">The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the newborn's exit and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">In most cases, the procedure lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby is born and often occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the placenta is removed, the medical team will check whether it has come out intact or whether parts of the placenta remain in the uterus.</seg>
          <seg id="58">During this stage, complications may occur that may cause severe damage to the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the known complications resulting from placenta residue in the uterus is called Ascherman syndrome, scarring of the uterine wall resulting from inflammation caused by placenta residue in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the endometrial in a way that makes it impossible to instill pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not recognize that placenta residue remained or did not take all measures to prevent endometrial damage despite the suspicion of placenta residue in the womb, it is possible that this is medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Birth Death</seg>
          <seg id="62">The death of a newborn during childbirth is fairly rare.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family sadly becomes the most tragic event for her.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the newborn in a timely manner or respond belatedly to such bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">"For example..."In that case, the medical team ignored and failed to respond to the mother's alarming vital signs, for long hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the background disease from which she suffered, "Reif-Liganza said.</seg>
          <seg id="66">"In another case..."Our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after the birth of twins due to bleeding that originated from the caesarean section that was not properly sewn.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the surgery, but the medical team did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, she responded late only after her systems began to fail, leading to her death."</seg>
          <seg id="68">Uterine loss</seg>
          <seg id="69">In severe cases, medical malpractice in childbirth can lead to a hysterectomy, says Attorney Rafe Lingza:"Our firm has conducted a lawsuit against a hospital that is based on hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In the same case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper care for the massive bleeding observed by the medical team after birth and yet no action was taken in time that could have prevented the damage."</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the damages awarded in medical malpractice lawsuits at birth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Neonatal compensation for injury due to medical malpractice at birth includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts given for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, loss of wages and pensions to the injured person and even his parents, and other components of damage.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The compensation paid to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average salary in the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="74">In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitative accessories, the cost of adjusting housing for the needs of the baby, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The amount of compensation is determined on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances,"says Attorney Reif-Liganza,adding that "today most of the claims on the grounds of medical malpractice are settled in a compromise that takes into account the chance and risk each party has in conducting the procedure." Then if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and, for example, as part of a lawsuit managed by our firm, the District Court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress a compensation in excess of 10 million shekels."</seg>
          <seg id="76">In summary</seg>
          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In these cases, a proper legal examination of the events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney skilled at handling claims on the grounds of medical malpractice, can help you win the compensation you deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="6">A lawyer specializing in the field of medical malpractice will examine whether there have been defects in the conduct of the medical team during the different stages of birth that have caused the damage and, as he deems appropriate, will consult a medical specialist in the field of relontic.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every error in treatment on the part of the medical staff arises to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When then is it negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor's mistake was due to ineptitude or deviated from the reasonable level of caution, and ineptitude and deviation from the acceptable level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not been so.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article, we will look at the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications can occur in each of the stages and when they arise to malpractice.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Stage of contractions</seg>
          <seg id="12">The contractions phase lasts an average of 8—14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (in order to allow the passage of the fetus at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most cases of medical malpractice in the labor phase deal with the failure to identify fetal distress in preparation for birth, which has caused damage to the newborn, sometimes manifested by cerebral palsy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral Palsy (CP):</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral palsy may be caused by non-detection or delay in identifying prenatal asexudation, which manifests itself in a failure to supply oxygen to the fetal brain tissue.</seg>
          <seg id="17">As a rule, monitoring the condition of the mother and correctly deciphering the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early detection of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical team to act quickly and extract the newborn before being irreversibly affected.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases in which the medical staff ignores signs that indicate that the fetus has a lack of oxygen or that the staff misinterprets data on the face and in particular the fetal monitor or reacts late to the distress expressed in the monitor may constitute dereliction.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy may also be caused by umbilical cord prolapse as well as a result of uterine rupture that was not detected in a timely manner.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult events, it is worth finding out whether the medical staff acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, attorney Anna Rafe Lignese, of Caspi Srour &amp; Co. firm, which specializes in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her office handled the prosecution of a child injured during his birth after the midwife had immobilized the amniotic sac when the fetal head was too high, thus leading to umbilical cord prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury to the fetal head) and being born with injury to the fetal brain (as a result of the fetal head's pressure on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury to the fetal head) and being born with injury to the fetal brain (as a result of the fetal head's pressure on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury Severe neurologic.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a claim due to the gross medical negligence of a maternity ward staff at a large hospital who, during delivery, did not detect clear signs that required a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The fetus that was ejected through the rupture of its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was at death's door.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child was caused by a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">We emphasize that in order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to dereliction, that there is a causal link between the dereliction of the medical staff that resulted in the failure to identify the asphyxia and the damage caused to the newborn, that is, that the damage was caused due to said negligence and not for any other reason or cause.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Examination of the causal relationship will be carried out through the examination of medical measures that, according to the medical literature, only in the existence of which there is a causal relationship between the aseptic and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the indicators of the level of acidity in the fetus's blood, its apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic impairment, etc.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Passing of the fetus</seg>
          <seg id="29">The phase of active birth</seg>
          <seg id="30">The phase of active delivery begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 cm and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Delay in childbirth and avoidance of performing a cesarean section</seg>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, dysfunctional childbirth develops, i.e., lack of progression of the active birth process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to avoid various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in childbirth.</seg>
          <seg id="35">“There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner can cause irreparable harm to the fetus,” Attorney Reiff-Ligenza explained to us.</seg>
          <seg id="36">“For example, we conducted a malpractice claim of birth death caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Contrary to any recognized medical practice, medical personnel were not educated to identify fetal distress and perform a caesarean section despite the unusually slow progression of childbirth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in carrying out the operation caused a lot of systemic damage to the birth which finally led to her death near her birth.”</seg>
          <seg id="39">Negligence in vacuum birth</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother or fetus is present with a significant danger that requires a particularly rapid termination of childbirth, a vacuum birth is sometimes carried out (empty cohort).</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a vacuum “dome” is attached to the head of the fetus and force-pull the fetus out.</seg>

          <seg id="43">In these events, medical malpractice may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not follow the mandatory guidelines and performs the operation despite the presence of a contraindication, such as when the head of the fetus is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for longer than permitted or when despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more than the allowed number of attempts.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In those cases if the careless vacuum operation has caused a newborn harm — among other things, it can cause cranial damage and bleeding that can cause brain damage to develop — there is room for filing a tortious claim.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Paralysis named after ERB</seg>
          <seg id="46">Paralysis named after Erb, here is a congenital nerve injury to the brachial plexus (nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetrical team.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury is manifested by weakness of the muscles of the hand and can reach up to complete paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of 'shoulder ruffle' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus's shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has come out.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the evaluation of the weight of the fetus indicated that it was a macrosomous fetus, that is, that it is expected to be born with a weight greater than 4.5 kilograms and according to the guidelines it is better to deliver the mother by caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the newborn's weight is over 4 kilograms, consider caesarean section in view of the risk factors including gestational diabetes and the lengthening of the second stage of birth.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal fetal weight assessment or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with vaginal delivery and the risk of shoulder injury and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is malpractice.</seg>

          <seg id="54">Placental exit phase</seg>
          <seg id="55">Separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the newborn leaves and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>

          <seg id="59">One of the known complications due to the presence of placental residues in the uterus is called “Asherman's syndrome”, scarring of the uterine wall results in inflammation caused by the presence of placental residues in the uterus, a phenomenon that affects the endometrium in a way that does not allow the implantation of pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not recognize that placental residues remained or did not take all measures to prevent injury to the endometrium despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, it may be medical negligence, and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Death of the mother</seg>
          <seg id="62">The death of a newborn during childbirth is a fairly rare euro.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or react late to such bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">“For example... “, Attorney Reiff-Lignza told us, “our office filed a lawsuit regarding the death of the birth, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the mother's alarming vital signs, extended hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the comorbidities from which she suffered.”</seg>
          <seg id="66">“In another case... “, Adv. Reiff-Lignese said, “Our firm represented the relatives of a girl who died after the birth of twins due to bleeding whose origin was in the caesarean section that was not properly sutured.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In the same case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after surgery, but the medical team did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, responding late only after her body systems began to collapse, which resulted in her passing.”</seg>
          <seg id="68">Loss of uterus</seg>
          <seg id="69">In severe cases, birth medical malpractice can lead to hysterectomy, says attorney Rafe Lingze: “Our firm conducted a lawsuit against a hospital underlying hysterectomy due to postpartum medical malpractice.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In the same case, the mother, a young woman of 31 years old, lost her mercy due to lack of proper care in the massive bleeding observed by the medical team after birth and despite this, the actions that could have prevented the damage were not taken in time.”</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the compensations that are terminated in claims for medical malpractice at birth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Newborn compensation for injury due to malpractice at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being provided for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, salary and pension losses to the victim and even his parents, and other damage components.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The remit compensation to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average salary in the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="74">The compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adjusting housing to the needs of the baby, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">“The amount of compensation is determined in each case individually and according to its circumstances,” says Adv. Reiff-Lignese, adding that “today most of the claims on the grounds of medical malpractice end with a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each party has in conducting the procedure,” but the attorney added, saying that “there are cases in which the procedure is terminated only in a judgment, so if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example “As part of a lawsuit conducted by our office, the District Court ruled that a minor caused cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation in excess of ten million shekels.”</seg>
          <seg id="76">concluding</seg>
          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In these cases, a proper forensic examination of the events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney trained in managing claims on grounds of medical malpractice, can help you win the compensation you deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="2">In order to win damages, plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that the damage was caused by the same negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Childbirth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in a family's life.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Unfortunately, sometimes births result in serious damage caused to the mother or newborn by the negligence of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In cases where the birth resulted in physical injury, the newborn or the mother, there is room to examine the events that led to injury.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A medical malpractice lawyer will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff at the various stages of birth.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every mistake in medical care is negligent (in the legal sense of this term).</seg>
          <seg id="8">When is it about negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When a doctor's error was due to ineptitude or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, the ineptitude and carelessness caused</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications may occur at each stage and when they arise.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Axis phase</seg>
          <seg id="12">The contraction phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this point, the cervix gradually opens (to allow the embryo to pass at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of 10 cm.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most contraction-stage medical malpractice involves not identifying fetal distress before birth, which sometimes results in cerebral palsy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral Palsy (CP):</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral palsy can be caused by a failure to recognize or delay in identifying a prenatal lactation, which is manifested by a failure to supply oxygen.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Generally, proper monitoring of fetal heart activity should lead to early detection of fetal distress, allowing medical staff to act quickly.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases in which medical staff ignore signs indicating that the fetus is lacking oxygen or the staff is misinterpreting data.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy can also be caused by cord prolapse as well as a rupture of the uterus that has not been detected in a timely manner.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult situations, it is appropriate to find out whether the medical staff acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Anna Rafe Ligne, a lawyer who specializes in representing malpractice victims, says that her office treated a child's tuberculosis head injury.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, she said that her office filed a lawsuit due to gross malpractice by a maternity ward staff who did not recognize a rupture.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The embryo ejected through the rupture of its mother's womb to the abdomen suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued late.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to the severe fetal suffering during childbirth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">To win damages, plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal link between the negligence of the infant.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The causal relationship will be examined by medical indicators based on the medical literature only on the causal link between the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, measurements of acidity in the blood of the fetus, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic injury, etc.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Fetal Deaths</seg>
          <seg id="29">Active stage of birth</seg>
          <seg id="30">The active birth phase begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends at the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Delayed delivery and avoidance of caesarean section</seg>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., a lack of progress of the active birth process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such situations, it is customary to perform a Caesarean section to avoid various harms that may be caused to the fetus due to the birth delay.</seg>
          <seg id="35">"There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner can cause irreparable harm to the fetus," Raif-Lignza told us.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"For example, we ran a malpractice lawsuit of birth deaths caused by a significant delay in performing a caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Unlike any known medical practice, medical staff failed to recognize the fetal distress and perform a C-section despite slow progression.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the surgery caused major systemic damage to her birth which eventually led to her death soon after her birth.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Vacuum birth negligence</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother or fetus faces significant danger requiring a particularly rapid termination of birth, a vacuum is sometimes born.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a vacuum is attached to the head of the fetus and forcefully pulls out the fetus.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Naturally, this involves risks and can cause harm to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires caution, precision and skill.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Medical malpractice may mean that the doctor does not follow the instructions and performs the procedure despite repeated or repeated overtime.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In these cases, if the careless vacuum caused damage - among other things, it can cause cranial damage and bleeding that can cause brain damage.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Paralysis named after the ERB</seg>
          <seg id="46">Erb paralysis is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (a nerve node connecting the spinal cord to the upper shoulder).</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury is manifested in weakness of the wrist muscles and can reach the full paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to shoulder disruption, an obstetric emergency that occurs when the head.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that the paralysis is caused by medical negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the fetus is estimated to weigh more than 4.5 kg, it is better to deliver the mother by caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the newborn weighs more than 4 kg, consider a C-section due to the risk factors including diabetes and prolongation of the second stage of birth.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In case the medical team ignores an abnormal weight or other risk factors and chooses to continue vaginal birth, there is likely malpractice.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in CA 2694 / 90, the Supreme Court ruled that the risk of shoulder stenosis can be predicted to some extent, and prevented.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Placental Exit Stage</seg>
          <seg id="55">Separation of the placenta from the womb and its exodus occurs due to the contraction of the womb after the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">The process usually takes up to half an hour after the baby is born and usually takes place spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the placenta is removed, the medical team will check whether it is completely removed or if there are any placental parts left in the womb.</seg>
          <seg id="58">During this stage, complications may occur that can cause serious harm to the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the known complications of placental residue is called Asherman syndrome, a scarring of the uterine wall that causes placental abruption.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical staff did not identify placental residue or did not take all measures to prevent endometrial injury.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Death of the mother</seg>
          <seg id="62">Death during childbirth is a rare occurrence.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family becomes, sadly, the most tragic event for her.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or responds late to such bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">"For example," Raif-Lignza told us," our office filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a childbearing mother."</seg>
          <seg id="66">"In another case," Raif-Lignza said," our office represented the relatives of a mother who died after the birth of twins.</seg>
          <seg id="67">The woman complained of severe pain and weakness after the surgery, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints.</seg>
          <seg id="68">Uterine loss</seg>
          <seg id="69">In severe cases, malpractice can lead to a hysterectomy, Adv. Rafe Lingza said: "Our office has filed a lawsuit against a hospital.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In that case, the 31-year-old lost her womb due to a lack of proper care due to massive bleeding seen by medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the benefits of medical malpractice claims for childbirth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Neonatal compensation for malpractice includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts given to pain and suffering.</seg>
          <seg id="73">In most cases, compensation for lost wages and pensions is calculated on the basis of average wages.</seg>
          <seg id="74">It also includes medical expenses, medical and rehabilitation costs, housing adjustment costs for baby needs, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The amount of compensation is determined in each case and according to its circumstances," says Raif-Lignza, adding:" Most lawsuits are settled."</seg>
          <seg id="76">To summarize</seg>
          <seg id="77">Malpractice in childbirth is definitely every family's nightmare.</seg>
          <seg id="78">A proper forensic examination of the events that led to the tragic outcome can help you win the compensation you deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Medical malpractice during the different stages of birth</seg>
          <seg id="2">In order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Childbirth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in the life of a family.</seg>
          <seg id="4">However, unfortunately, sometimes births end in severe damage caused to the mother or the newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In cases where the birth ended in physical injury, to a newborn or mother, there is room to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A lawyer specializing in the field of medical negligence will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical team during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, as far as he sees fit, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that management was negligent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When is it about negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor's error was due to a lack of skill or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the usual level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused had the doctor not done so.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article, we will examine the various stages of childbirth, explain what complications may occur at each stage and when they rise to medical malpractice.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Axes Stage</seg>
          <seg id="12">The contraction stage lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix is gradually opened (in order to allow the fetal passage at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most cases of medical negligence at the contraction stage deal with the failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, which is sometimes even expressed in cerebral palsy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral Palsy (CP):</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral palsy may be caused by non-identification or delay in the identification of perinatal asphyxia, which results in a failure in the supply of oxygen to the fetal brain tissue.</seg>
          <seg id="17">As a rule, monitoring the mother's condition and correct decryption of the fetal heart monitor should lead to early identification of fetal distress development, allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In cases where the medical team ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or that the team is not interpreting the data correctly and in particular the fetal monitor or responds late to the distress expressed in the monitor - this may constitute negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy may also be caused by the prolapse of the umbilical cord as well as a rupture in the uterus that was not detected in a timely manner.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult events, it is worth finding out whether the medical team acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, Adv. Anna Rafe Liganza, of Caspi Srour &amp; Co., a firm specializing in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her firm handled a claim of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the head of the fetus was too high, thereby causing the umbilical cord to prolapse (when the umbilical cord precedes the head of the fetus) and damage to the supply of oxygen to the fetal brain (as a result of pressure from the head of the fetus on the umbilical cord) and to be born with a severe neurological injury.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a claim due to serious medical negligence of the maternity department staff at a large hospital, which during the birth did not identify at the time any clear signs that required a real suspicion that the woman suffered a rupture of the uterus in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The embryo that was ejected through the rupture in its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a later stage, when it was on the verge of death.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">It should be emphasized that in order to be awarded compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal connection between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the child and the damage caused to the newborn, that is, that the damage was caused as a result of the aforesaid negligence and not from any other reason or factor.</seg>
          <seg id="26">An examination of the causal relationship will be carried out by examining medical indices that according to the medical literature only exist when there is a causal connection between the brain injury and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the measurements of the level of acidity in the embryo's blood, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage, and more are examined.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Passing the Pass.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The active birth stage.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The active stage of labor begins when the cervical opening reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Delay in childbirth and avoidance of cesarean section</seg>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., a lack of progression of the active birth process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such situations, it is customary to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damage that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.</seg>
          <seg id="35">"There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner may cause irreparable damage to the fetus," explained attorney Rafe-Liganza.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"For example, we conducted a medical malpractice claim for a newborn death caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">In contrast to any known medical practice, the medical staff did not succeed in identifying the fetal distress and performing a cesarean section despite the particularly slow progression of the birth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the surgery caused extensive systemic damage to the birth, which eventually led to her death shortly after birth. "</seg>
          <seg id="39">Vacuum birth negligence</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother or the fetus is in significant danger that requires an especially rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed (an empty studio).</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a "dome" vacuum is attached to the head of the fetus and the fetus is pulled out by force.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Naturally, this action is fraught with dangers and can cause damage to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires great caution, precision and skill.</seg>
          <seg id="43">In these cases, medical malpractice may be expressed in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the binding guidelines and performs the action despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the head of the fetus is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for a longer time than permitted, or when despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the action more than the permitted number of attempts.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In such cases, if the negligent vacuum operation caused the newborn damage - among other things, it may cause cranial damage and bleeding that may cause brain damage - there is room for filing a tort claim.</seg>
          <seg id="45">It's called ERB.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Erb's paralysis is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth, it is worth checking whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric team.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury is manifested by weakness of the muscles of the hand and can reach the full paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by a difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of a "shoulder disorder" - a midwifery emergency that occurs when the fetus' shoulders are trapped in the birth canal after its head has come out.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the fetus's weight assessment indicated that it was a macrosomic embryo, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kg and in accordance with the instructions, it is better to deliver the mother by Caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the newborn's weight is over 4 kg, a cesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to continue with vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder disorder and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical malpractice.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted in advance to some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is a concern for its occurrence, is to perform a cesarean section."</seg>
          <seg id="54">The placental exit phase</seg>
          <seg id="55">The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the neonate exits and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">In most cases, the process lasts up to half an hour from the time the baby leaves and usually occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the placenta is removed, the medical team will check whether the placenta is intact or if there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.</seg>
          <seg id="58">Within this stage, complications may occur that may cause serious harm to the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the known complications as a result of the residual placental in the uterus is called "Asherman syndrome," the scarring of the uterine wall results in inflammation caused by the residual placental in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that does not allow implantation of pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not identify placental residues or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the endometrium despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, it may be medical negligence and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field.</seg>
          <seg id="61">Death of mother.</seg>
          <seg id="62">Death during childbirth is very rare.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother on time or respond late to such bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">"For example," Rife-Liganza told us, "our firm filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a mother, when in that case the medical team ignored and did not respond to the mother's alarming vital signs, for many hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrolled bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the background disease from which she suffered."</seg>
          <seg id="66">"In another case," said attorney Rafe-Liganza, "our firm represented the relatives of a mother who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated in the C-section that was not properly sewn.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical team did not properly treat her complaints and her clinical condition, reacted late only after her body systems began to fail, which led to her death. "</seg>
          <seg id="68">Loss of uterus</seg>
          <seg id="69">In severe cases, medical malpractice at birth can lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Rafe Lingza: "Our firm has managed a lawsuit against a hospital that is based on a hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding that was observed by the medical team after the birth, and yet no action was taken to prevent the damage. "</seg>
          <seg id="71">What are the compensations awarded in claims for medical negligence at birth?</seg>
          <seg id="72">Newborn compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts given for pain and suffering, nursing and wage care, salary and pension losses for the injured person and even for his parents and other components of damage.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The compensation awarded to an injured minor for salary and pension losses is calculated in most cases based on the average wage in the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="74">In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitative accessories, the cost of accommodation for the baby's needs, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The amount of compensation is determined in each case and according to its circumstances," recounts attorney Rafe-Liganza, and she adds that "today most claims on the grounds of medical negligence end in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk that each side has in conducting the procedure," but the lawyer added that "there are cases in which the procedure ends only in a judgment, in which case if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages, and for example, in a lawsuit that our firm conducted, the District Court ruled that a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress will receive compensation in excess of ten million shekels."</seg>
          <seg id="76">Summarize</seg>
          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice at birth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by a lawyer skilled in managing claims on the grounds of medical negligence, can help you win the compensation you deserve.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Medical malpractice in the different stages of childbirth</seg>
          <seg id="2">In order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to the negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Childbirth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in the life of a family.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Unfortunately, however, births sometimes end in serious damage to the mother or newborn as a result of the negligence of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="5">In cases where the birth ended in physical injury to the newborn or the mother, there is room to examine the chain of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A lawyer specializing in the field of medical malpractice will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff during the various stages of birth that caused the damage and, as he deems appropriate, will consult a medical expert in the relevant field.</seg>
          <seg id="7">It should be emphasized that not every error in treatment on the part of the medical staff amounts to negligence ( in the legal sense of this term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that its management was negligent.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When then is it negligence?</seg>
          <seg id="9">When the doctor's error was due to incompetence or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and incompetence and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused if the doctor had not acted in this way.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In this article we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications may occur at each stage and when they arise to medical malpractice.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The contraction phase is contracted.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The contraction phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At this stage, the cervix opens gradually ( in order to allow the passage of the fetus during birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Most cases of medical malpractice during labor involve failure to identify fetal distress prior to birth, which caused damage to the newborn, sometimes even manifested by cerebral palsy.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Cerebral Palsy ( CP) :</seg>
          <seg id="16">Cerebral palsy may be caused by a failure to identify or delay in identifying perinatal asphyxia, which manifests itself in a failure to supply oxygen to the brain tissue of the fetus.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In general, monitoring the mother's condition and correct interpretation of the monitor that monitors fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of the development of fetal distress, which allows the medical team to act quickly and extract the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Cases in which the medical staff ignores signs indicating that the fetus is suffering from a lack of oxygen or that the staff does not correctly interpret the data on its face and in particular the fetal monitor or responds late to the distress expressed by the monitor  may constitute negligence.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Cerebral palsy may also be caused by umbilical cord prolapse and uterine rupture that was not detected in time.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Even in these difficult events, it is worth clarifying whether the medical staff acted properly.</seg>
          <seg id="21">For example, attorney Anna Reif Lignese, of Caspi Srour &amp; Co., a law firm specializing in representing victims of medical malpractice, says that her firm handled a claim of a child injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the fetal head was too high, thus leading to umbilical cord prolapse ( when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain ( as a result of pressure of the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury to the fetal head) and being born with injury to the fetal head and being born with injury to the fetal head) and being born with injury to the fetal brain ( as a result of pressure on the fetal head on the umbilical cord) and being born with injury to the fet</seg>
          <seg id="22">In another case, the lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to severe medical negligence by the staff of the maternity ward at a large hospital, which during the birth did not identify clear signs at the time that required a real suspicion that the mother was suffering from a rupture of the uterus in the surgical scar area of her previous pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The fetus that was ejected through the rupture of its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Due to the severe fetal suffering during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.</seg>
          <seg id="25">We emphasize that in order to receive compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal link between the negligence of the medical staff that led to the failure to identify the asphyxiation and the damage caused to the newborn child, that is, that the damage was caused due to said negligence and not for any other reason or cause.</seg>
          <seg id="26">Examination of the causal relationship will be carried out through the examination of medical indicators that, according to the medical literature, only in their existence there is a causal relationship between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Among other things, the indicators of the level of acidity in the fetus's blood, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic damage and more are examined.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The death of the fetus.</seg>
          <seg id="29">The active birth stage is active.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The stage of active birth begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 cm and ends with the birth of the baby.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Delay in childbirth and avoidance of caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="33">In some cases, dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., lack of progression of the active birth process.</seg>
          <seg id="34">In such situations, it is customary to perform a caesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that may be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.</seg>
          <seg id="35">“ There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner can cause irreversible damage to the fetus,” attorney Reif-Lignese explained to us,” she explained to us.</seg>
          <seg id="36">"For example, we conducted a medical malpractice lawsuit for the death of a newborn child caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Contrary to any known medical practice, the medical staff were not educated to identify the fetal distress and perform a caesarean section despite the particularly slow progress of childbirth.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The delay in performing the operation caused extensive systemic damage to the birth which finally led to her death shortly after her birth."</seg>
          <seg id="39">Negligence in vacuum birth.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In situations where the mother or fetus is in significant danger that requires a particularly rapid termination of the birth, a vacuum birth ( empty tube) is sometimes performed.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In this process, a "cap" is attached to the fetus' head using a vacuum and the fetus is forcefully pulled out by force.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Naturally, this operation involves dangers and may cause damage to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great care, precision and skill, which requires great care, precision and skill.</seg>
          <seg id="43">In these cases, medical malpractice may manifest itself in the fact that the doctor does not adhere to the mandatory guidelines and performs the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performs it for longer than permitted or when, despite the failure of a large number of attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the operation more than the number of attempts allowed.</seg>
          <seg id="44">In these cases, if the negligent vacuum operation caused damage to the newborn  among other things, it could cause cranial damage and bleeding that could cause the development of brain damage  there is room for filing a tort claim.</seg>
          <seg id="45">Paralysis named after ERB.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Paralysis named after Erb, here is a congenital nerve injury to the brachial plexus ( nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is appropriate to check whether the damage occurred as a result of the negligence of the obstetric team.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The injury manifests itself in weakness of the hand muscles and can reach complete paralysis of the entire arm up to full paralysis of the entire arm.</seg>
          <seg id="48">This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to the occurrence of 'shoulder 3' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the fetus' shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after the head has come out of the birth canal.</seg>
          <seg id="49">When should you suspect that paralysis is caused by medical malpractice?</seg>
          <seg id="50">In cases where the assessment of the weight of the fetus indicated that it is a macrosomic fetus, that is, that it is expected to be born with a weight greater than 4 weights. 5 kilograms and according to the guidelines it is better to give birth to the mother by caesarean section.</seg>
          <seg id="51">When the weight of the newborn is over 4 kilograms, a caesarean section should be considered in light of the risk factors, including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.</seg>
          <seg id="52">In the event that the medical team ignores an abnormal fetal weight assessment or other risk factors and chooses to continue with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder rupture and ERB paralysis is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical malpractice.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Indeed, in CA 2694/90, the Supreme Court held that "the risk that shoulder stenosis will occur during childbirth can be predicted with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder stenosis, where there is concern of its occurrence, is to conduct a caesarean section."</seg>
          <seg id="54">Placental exit phase.</seg>
          <seg id="55">Separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the exit of the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="56">In most cases, the process lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby leaves and usually occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.</seg>
          <seg id="57">After the placenta exits, the medical team will check whether it has come out in its entirety or whether there are parts of the placenta left in the uterus.</seg>
          <seg id="58">As part of this stage, complications may occur that can cause serious damage to the mother.</seg>
          <seg id="59">One of the well-known complications as a result of placental residues remaining in the uterus is called Asherman's syndrome, scarring of the uterine wall as a result of inflammation caused by placental residues remaining in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that makes it impossible to implant a pregnancy.</seg>
          <seg id="60">Therefore, in cases where the medical staff did not identify placental residues or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the endometrium despite the suspicion of placental residues in the uterus, this may be medical malpractice and the case deserves a thorough examination by an experienced lawyer in the field of the case.</seg>
          <seg id="61">The death of the mother is.</seg>
          <seg id="62">The death of a mother during childbirth is a fairly rare euro.</seg>
          <seg id="63">In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy of life to the whole family becomes, unfortunately, the most tragic event for her.</seg>
          <seg id="64">In some cases, the medical staff does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or respond late to such bleeding.</seg>
          <seg id="65">“ For example, the company” .   ", Attorney Reif-Lignese told us, "Our firm filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a mother, when in that case the medical staff ignored and did not respond to the mother's worrisome vital signs, for many hours, and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the background disease from which she suffered."</seg>
          <seg id="66">“ In another case, in another case.   ", Attorney Reif-Lignese said, "Our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to bleeding originating from the cesarean section incision that was not sutured properly.</seg>
          <seg id="67">In that case, the mother complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, responded late only after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death. ”</seg>
          <seg id="68">Loss of uterus.</seg>
          <seg id="69">In severe cases, medical malpractice at birth can lead to hysterectomy, says attorney Reif Lingze: “ Our firm conducted a lawsuit against a hospital based on hysterectomy due to medical malpractice after birth.</seg>
          <seg id="70">In that case, the mother, a 31-year-old woman, lost her uterus due to a lack of proper treatment for massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after the birth, but no timely actions were taken that could have prevented the damage.</seg>
          <seg id="71">These are the compensations awarded in claims for medical malpractice in childbirth.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Newborn compensation for injury due to medical malpractice at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being given for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, salary and pension losses to the victim and even his parents, and other damage components.</seg>
          <seg id="73">The compensation awarded to an injured minor for wage and pension losses is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the economy.</seg>
          <seg id="74">In addition, the compensation also includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation accessories, the cost of adjusting housing to the baby's needs, mobility and more.</seg>
          <seg id="75">"The amount of compensation is determined in each case on a case-by-case basis and according to its circumstances, " says Attorney Reif-Lignese, and she adds that "Today most claims on the grounds of medical malpractice end in a compromise that weighs the chance and risk each party has in managing the procedure, " but the lawyer added that "there are cases where the procedure ends only with a verdict, then if the claim is not rejected, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and for example, as part of a claim conducted by our firm, the district court awarded a minor who suffered cerebral palsy due to a delay in identifying fetal distress compensation exceeding ten million shekels", but added that "there are cases where the procedure ends only with a verdict, then if the claim is not rejected, the pla</seg>
          <seg id="76">To summarize, this is true.</seg>
          <seg id="77">Medical malpractice in childbirth is undoubtedly the nightmare of every family.</seg>
          <seg id="78">In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that caused the tragic outcome, by an attorney skilled in managing medical malpractice claims, can help you win the compensation you deserve.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="5">Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairments.</seg>
          <seg id="6">It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and find the right solutions to prevent the situation from worsening.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In recent years, several studies have been conducted that help to understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The new studies provide a research basis for the suspicion that the eye disease, Keratoconus, is a genetic disease.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="9">A recent study, which was concerned with changing the shape of the cornea from a dome to a cone, revealed that the cause of the disease and the weakness of the cornea and the distortion of its shape is related to an enzymatic imbalance, as a result of which the free radicals may damage the proteins in the cornea – and its structure will change.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The source of that lack of enzymes is genetic, a fact that strengthens the hypothesis that Keratoconus is a hereditary disease.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">According to Prof. Ariela Gordon-Shag, head of the department of Optometric Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, “in a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of Keratoconus of 3.2% was found.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The highest incidence was in students from the Bedouin sector – 20% had Keratoconus, but it was a relatively small sample”.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="13">The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: “There is a high prevalence of Keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In our studies, we found that consanguineous marriages are a risk factor for Keratoconus.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Thus in any sector with many marriages between cousins, we may find a high incidence”.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="16">In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where there is a family history of Keratoconus disease, all family members must undergo an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="17">According to Erza Fruchter, a B.Sc clinical optometrist, “there are ten times more visits to the clinic from distant peripheral areas, mainly from the south, compared to the center”.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="18">Fruchter adds that “In the last decade, I noticed that most of the patients apply from the outskirts, especially from the Beer Sheva area.</seg>
          <seg id="19">This is mainly due to a high incidence of marriages within the family (mainly in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of how to properly treat the problem”.</seg>

          <seg id="11">According to Prof. Ariela Gordon-Shag, head of the department of optometric sciences at Hadassah Academic College, "in a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of keratoconus of 3.2% was found.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The highest incidence was in students from the Bedouin sector - 20% had keratoconus, but it was a relatively small sample."</seg>

          <seg id="14">In our studies, we found that consanguineous marriages are a risk factor for keratoconus.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Thus in any sector with many weddings between cousins, we may find a high incidence."</seg>
          <seg id="16">In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where there is a family history of keratoconus disease, all family members must undergo an appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.</seg>
          <seg id="17">According to Erza Fruchter, a B.Sc clinical optometrist, "there are ten times more visits to the clinic from distant peripheral areas, mainly from the south, compared to the center."</seg>
          <seg id="18">Fruchter adds that "In the last decade, I noticed that most of the patients apply from the outskirts, especially from the Beer Sheva area.</seg>
          <seg id="19">This is mainly due to a high incidence of marriages within the family (mainly in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of how to properly treat the problem."</seg>
          <seg id="20">So how is the disease diagnosed?</seg>
          <seg id="21">Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops during adolescence or in the late teens (ages 15-16 or 20).</seg>
          <seg id="22">The disease includes a decrease in vision, at the same time as an increase in the cylinder.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Keratoconus patients show distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.</seg>
          <seg id="24">These signs worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over years.</seg>

          <seg id="6">He was 41 years old when he passed away.</seg>

          <seg id="11">The environment looked up to him.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Since the operation, the IDF has forbidden the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the intelligence division, Major General Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family members, it was decided to publish his name and picture.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Mahmoud Khair al-Din, the hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Horfish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmed and Nazira, and he had seven brothers and sisters.</seg>
          <seg id="14">He is a member of the Druze community.</seg>

          <seg id="16">He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the special operations’ unit of the Intelligence Division.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Throughout his life, Khair al-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Until the 9th grade he studied at the school in Kfar Horfish, after which he transferred to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In October 1997 he enlisted in the paratrooper patrol, and in 2000 he graduated from officers’ school.</seg>
          <seg id="20">In 2002, he was located by the special operations unit in the Aman and moved to serve there.</seg>
          <seg id="21">While serving, he completed a bachelor’s degree in law at the College of Management and a master’s degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In 2002 he met his wife, Nahad, and in 2004 they got married.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="24">In 2010, he joined the “Acharai” association and started guiding a group in Kfar Horfish, after making sure that the association started operating in the Druze villages to encourage the youth to enlist.</seg>
          <seg id="25">In 2013, his second son was born.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The head of the Intelligence Division, Major General Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: “We have been turning for some time on the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din, a hero of Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="27">We finished work and came to the conclusion that there is no security obstacle to publish his name and picture.</seg>
          <seg id="28">He also deserves it, his family and his children”, he noted.</seg>
          <seg id="29">“Extraordinary educator and leader”</seg>
          <seg id="30">“Thanks to many operations, he is no less than a hero in my eyes”, said General Haliva.</seg>
          <seg id="31">“He has a significant contribution, which includes courage and composure, to the State of Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="32">He deserves to be given the place he deserves”.</seg>
          <seg id="33">And he added: “I didn’t know him personally, but he was an educator, an educator and an exceptional leader – not only on the operational side, but also in values”.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Major Haliva stated that later he will also consider whether to publish the photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno from the Defense Forces patrol, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not allowed to be published.</seg>
          <seg id="35">The action in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.</seg>
          <seg id="36">The operation was the culmination of months of meticulous preparations in which the intelligence community took part.</seg>
          <seg id="37">In the command squad of the operation sat the Chief of Staff at the time, Lt. Col. Gadi Eisenkot, the head of the Aman at the time, Major General Tamir Hayman and the head of the Shin Bet at the time, Nadav Argaman.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The purpose of the operation has not yet been released, and the IDF stressed that it was an operation whose intelligence value was invaluable.</seg>
          <seg id="39">But the Arab media retrospectively presented communication equipment that the Palestinians say was left behind by the forces.</seg>
          <seg id="40">According to Hamas, the operation was aimed at burying listening devices.</seg>
          <seg id="41">According to publications, on the day of the incident, the force traveled in two vehicles.</seg>
          <seg id="42">The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint set up by Hamas personnel, and something in their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.</seg>
          <seg id="43">The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The investigation in the field lasted about 45 minutes, during which it became more and more aggressive.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair al-Din managed to distract the Hamas men, and in that split second, the commander of the force, Lt. Col. A, was able to open fire.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Three Hamas members were killed by the fire, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Ten months after the difficult incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the Salvage Committee and award the Chief of Staff’s Salvage to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip – among them the late Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.</seg>
          <seg id="48">The commander of the fighting force and another fighter in the team also received a Valor.</seg>
          <seg id="49">In the army’s statement at the time it was stated that Lt. Col. M received the valor for “his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, in defense of his comrades”.</seg>
          <seg id="50">Later he acted out of initiative and striving for contact, took a front role in taking over the enemy and worked resourcefully to promote the takeover.</seg>

          <seg id="19">In October 1997 he enlisted in a paratrooper patrol, and in 2000 graduated from officers' school.</seg>
          <seg id="20">In 2002, he was located by the Special Operations Division in Military Intelligence and moved to serve in it.</seg>
          <seg id="21">During his service, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In 2002, he met his wife, Nahed, and in 2004 they married.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he and his friends founded an association that works to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="24">In 2010, he joined the “ After Me” association and started guiding a group in the village of Hurfeish, after making sure that the association started operating in the Druze villages in order to encourage the youth to enlist.</seg>
          <seg id="25">In 2013, his second son was born.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: “ For some time now, we have been turning on the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair a-Din, the hero of Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="27">We finished work and came to the conclusion that there is no security impediment to publishing his name and picture.</seg>
          <seg id="28">He also deserves it, his family and his children, " he noted.</seg>
          <seg id="29">“ An extraordinary educator and leader” .</seg>
          <seg id="30">“ Thanks to many operations, he is no less than a hero in my eyes,” said Maj. Gen. Haliva.</seg>
          <seg id="31">“ He has a significant contribution, which has courage and composure, to the State of Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="32">He deserves to get the place that suits him.</seg>
          <seg id="33">And he added: “ I didn't know him personally, but he was an exceptional educator, educator and leader  not only on the operational side, but also in my values.”</seg>
          <seg id="34">Gen. Haliva noted that later he would also examine whether to publish the photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno of the General Staff, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and whose photo was not allowed to be published.</seg>
          <seg id="35">The operation in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018, on November 11, 2018.</seg>
          <seg id="36">The operation was the culmination of months of careful preparations in which the intelligence community took part in the action.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The command squad of the operation sat the then Chief of Staff, Lt. Col. Gadi Eisenkot, the then head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heiman and the then head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman.</seg>
          <seg id="38">The purpose of the operation has not yet been made public, and the IDF stressed that it was an invaluable intelligence operation.</seg>
          <seg id="39">But the Arab media retroactively presented communications equipment that, according to the Palestinians, had been left behind by the forces, according to the Palestinians.</seg>
          <seg id="40">According to Hamas, the operation was aimed at burying listening devices.</seg>
          <seg id="41">According to publications, on the day of the incident, the force drove two vehicles.</seg>
          <seg id="42">The fighters were detained at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas members, and something about their behavior aroused the suspicions of Hamas operatives.</seg>
          <seg id="43">Activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The interrogation on the ground lasted about 45 minutes, during which time it became increasingly aggressive.</seg>
          <seg id="45">When the force realized that it was in a problematic situation, Lt. Col. Khair al-Din managed to distract Hamas members, and in that fraction of a second, the commander of the force, Lt. Col. A, managed to open fire.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Three Hamas operatives were killed by the fire, and unfortunately also Lt. Col. Khair al-Din.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Ten months after the difficult incident, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the IDF Committee and award the Chief of Staff's citation to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Gaza Strip - including Lt. Col. Khair al-Din, who also served in the area deep in the Gaza Strip.</seg>
          <seg id="48">The commander of the combat force and another fighter in the team also received a TLS citation.</seg>
          <seg id="49">The army said in a statement at the time that Lt. Col. M. received the citation for his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, in defense of his comrades, for the defense of his comrades.</seg>
          <seg id="50">Later, he acted out of initiative and striving for contact, took a forward role in taking over the enemy and acted resourcefully to promote the takeover.</seg>

          <seg id="3">במהלך הרמדאן נמנעה ישראל מלעשות זאת, מחשש שג'נין תידלק ותצית בעקבותיה את הגדה, אבל ייתכן שחמושי ג'נין לא יותירו לה ברירה.</seg>
          <seg id="4">סוף השבוע הסוער שעברנו מלמד שאף על פי שחודש הרמדאן מאחורינו, השטח עדיין נפיץ מתמיד.</seg>
          <seg id="5">יידרשו מאמצים רבים ושכל ישר כדי לחצות בשלום את שני מועדי האזכור הקרובים: יום ה"נכבה" שחל היום (ראשון), ויום ירושלים שיצוין בעוד שבועיים.</seg>
          <seg id="6">לא מעט גורמים יתייצבו מנגד בניסיון לטרפד חזרה לשפיות.</seg>
          <seg id="7">בראשם, כתמיד, גורמי הטרור, שמרכזים מאמץ מיוחד בניסיון לשמר את האווירה האלימה של השבועות האחרונים.</seg>
          <seg id="8">עדות לכך ניתנה במהלך מבצע המעצרים שבו נהרג שלשום לוחם הימ"מ, רס"ב נעם רז ז"ל.</seg>
          <seg id="9">לוחמים שהשתתפו בקרב בג'נין העידו כי הם אינם זוכרים היקף כזה של ירי ואלימות - עדות לא רק לכמות האדירה של אמל"ח שיש בשטח, אלא גם לנכונות להשתמש בו.</seg>
          <seg id="10">זה מחייב את ישראל לשאול את עצמה, שוב, אם לא נכון לשנות מדיניות מול גזרת ג'נין, ולעבור ממבצעי פינצטה קטנים ומבוססי מודיעין למבצע נרחב ומבוסס מסה.</seg>
          <seg id="11">במהלך הרמדאן נמנעה ישראל מלעשות זאת, מחשש שג'נין תידלק ותצית בעקבותיה את הגדה ואת הזירה כולה; גם כעת, מעדיפה מערכת הביטחון לפעול סלקטיבית, כשנדרש, כדי להימנע מתבערה, אבל ייתכן שחמושי ג'נין לא יותירו לה ברירה.</seg>
          <seg id="12">להפיק את הלקחים לאירועי העתיד.</seg>
          <seg id="13">מותו של רז בקרב הוא התשובה הטובה ביותר שיכולה ישראל לתת לכל מי שטוען כי הרגה במתכוון את עיתונאית אל־ג'זירה, שירין אבו עאקלה.</seg>
          <seg id="14">פעילות מבצעית היא עניין מסוכן למי שמשתתף בה, ולמי שנוכח בזירה.</seg>
          <seg id="15">צה"ל לוקח סיכונים אדירים לכוחותיו כדי להימנע ככל הניתן מפגיעה בחפים מפשע, ולעיתים משלם על כך בחיי לוחמים.</seg>
          <seg id="16">זה מעיד על מוסריות גבוהה, אבל יש בכך גם ערך מבצעי־מודיעיני: מחבל שנתפס חי - כפי שקרה שלשום בג'נין - הוא מקור מצוין למידע על אמל"ח, פיגועים ומחבלים נוספים; זה מידע שלרוב לא ניתן להשיגו בדרך אחרת, ובאמצעותו אפשר לסכל את הפיגועים הבאים.</seg>
          <seg id="17">צה"ל נהג נכון כאשר פרסם שלשום את תחקיר הביניים שערך בפרשת מותה של אבו עאקלה, והבהיר כי לא ניתן לקבוע בשלב הזה מי גרם למותה.</seg>
          <seg id="18">בהיעדר שיתוף פעולה פלשתיני, ספק אם ניתן יהיה להגיע לשורה תחתונה חד־משמעית בפרשה.</seg>
          <seg id="19">ממילא נראה ששום דבר לא ישכנע את המשוכנעים: העולם כבר הזדרז לגנות את ישראל מבלי שטרח לאזן זאת במילת אמפתיה לקורבנות הטרור הפלשתיני - העילה המקורית שבשמה צה"ל פועל ללא הרף בג'נין.</seg>
          <seg id="20">כתמיד, טבעם של סיפורים כאלה לגווע.</seg>
          <seg id="21">דעת הקהל העולמית עסוקה בשלה וממשיכה הלאה, ודאי כשבאוקראינה ממשיכה להשתולל מלחמה אינטנסיבית פי כמה.</seg>
          <seg id="22">לכן, חבל שישראל התעקשה לתת לפרשת מותה של אבו עאקלה עוד רגעים מיותרים של חשיפה, עם הטיפול הלא מוצלח של המשטרה בהלווייתה.</seg>
          <seg id="23">גם אם משפחתה של אבו־עאקלה לא עמדה בסיכומים המוקדמים, צריך היה לצפות לקצת יותר יכולת הבלגה מהשוטרים שליוו את מסע ההלוויה, ובוודאי להתרגש פחות מדגלי פלשתין שהונפו בה.</seg>
          <seg id="24">האחריות מחייבת: לפעול להרגעת המצב.</seg>
          <seg id="25">טוב עשו השר לביטחון הפנים ומפכ"ל המשטרה שהורו על חקירת האירוע.</seg>
          <seg id="26">דומה שחסרו בו הכנה מספקת והנחיות ברורות, אבל מטרידה העובדה שזאת הפעם השנייה שזה קורה למשטרה בתוך זמן קצר, ובשני מחוזות שונים.</seg>
          <seg id="27">גם בפיגוע בדיזנגוף כשלה המשטרה בניהול האירוע, בבידוד הזירה ובטיפול בתקשורת.</seg>
          <seg id="28">טוב תעשה ועדת החקירה אם לא תסתפק רק בניתוח התנהלות השוטרים בהלוויה עצמה, אלא גם בהפקת לקחים ומסקנות שיאפשרו טיפול מוצלח יותר באירועים דומים בעתיד.</seg>
          <seg id="29">לצד הטיפול הפנימי במשטרה, מתחייב גם לתת את הדעת על התנהלותם של נבחרי ציבור שאיבדו דרך וכיוון.</seg>
          <seg id="30">בכנסת ישראל מכהנים כיום כמה וכמה חברים שמסתמנים כסכנה לדמוקרטיה.</seg>
          <seg id="31">הם מצויים משמאל ומימין, ומנצלים את חסינותם לא כדי לאתגר את המדינה, אלא כדי לפגוע בה.</seg>
          <seg id="32">ח"כ עופר כסיף הוא הדוגמה האחרונה לכך; אם לא יינקטו כלפיו צעדים - לרבות העמדה לדין על תקיפת שוטר - תעודד המדינה במשתמע את נבחר הציבור הבא להקצין עוד יותר את פעולותיו.</seg>
          <seg id="33">מהלכים כאלה, שהם בבחינת דמוקרטיה מתגוננת, חיוניים בנפיצות של התקופה הזו, כשברקע גורמים שמבקשים לנצל את המצב לצרכים פוליטיים.</seg>
          <seg id="34">מכל מי ששכל ישר בראשו מצופה להתעלות מעל לכל אלה, ולפעול להרגעת המצב; אחרת, עלולה ישראל לגלוש במהירות להסלמה מול אויבים מבחוץ, וגרוע מכך - מול יריבים מבית.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Israel should ask itself, once again, if it’s wrong to change policy regarding the Jenin zone •</seg>
          <seg id="3">During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing this, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank in its wake, but Jenin’s militants may not leave it a choice.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The unsettling weekend we’ve just had, shows that even though the month of Ramadan passed, the area is still more explosive than ever.</seg>
          <seg id="5">It will take a lot of effort and common sense to safely cross the two upcoming commemoration dates: the “Nakba” day that is celebrated today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day that will be celebrated in two weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Quite a few parties will come forward in an attempt to jeopardize returning back to sanity.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Lead by, as always, elements of terrorism, concentrating on special efforts to try and maintain the violent atmosphere of the last few weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Evidence of this has been given during the arrests operation in which the late YAMAM fighter, Sergeant Major Noam Raz was killed the other day.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Fighters who fought the battle in Jenin testified that they do not recall such a scope of shooting and violence—evidently not only there is an enormous amount of weapons in that region, but people are also willing to use them.</seg>
          <seg id="10">This situation forces Israel to ask once again, if it is not correct to change its policy towards the Jenin zone, thus to revert from small, intelligence-based tweezers operations to an extensive, mass-based operation.</seg>
          <seg id="11">During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite, set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena on its wake; Even now, the security system prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid blow ups, but the Jenin militants may leave no choice.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Draw lessons for future events.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Raz’s death in combat is the best answer Israel could have given to those who claim to have intentionally killed Al Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Aquala.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Combat activity is dangerous for those who participate in it, and for those present in the area.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The IDF takes enormous risks for its forces in order to avoid harming innocents as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with casualties among its fighters.</seg>
          <seg id="16">This indicates high morality, but it also has a combat-intelligence value: a terrorist captured alive—as happened the other day in Jenin—is an excellent source of information about weapons, terror attacks and other terrorists; this is information that usually cannot be obtained by any other means, and by obtaining it, it is possible to thwart the next attacks.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The IDF did the right thing when it released yesterday the interim investigation results of the case of Abu Aquala’s death, and made it clear that it is not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the case.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the ones already convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without considering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terrorism—the original reason the IDF continues to operate within Jenin.</seg>
          <seg id="20">As always, such stories tend to die out.</seg>
          <seg id="21">World public opinion is busy and moving on, obviously when a more intense war continues to rage in Ukraine.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Therefore, it is a shame that Israel insisted on giving the case of Abu Aquala’s death more unnecessary exposure, by showing the police’s unsuccessful handling of her funeral.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Even if Abu-Aquala’s family couldn’t withhold the early agreements, one would have expected the policemen to be slightly more restrained while accompanying the funeral procession, and certainly be less distraught by the Palestinian flags that were flown on it.</seg>
          <seg id="24">The responsibility is demanding: act to appease the situation.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The Minister of Internal Security and the Commissioner of Police acted well by initiating the investigation of the incident.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It seems it lacked adequate preparation and clear instructions, but the fact that this is the second time it has happened to the police in a short period, and in two different districts, is troubling.</seg>
          <seg id="27">Even in the Dizengoff terrorist attack, the police failed to manage the incident, isolate the scene and handle the media.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The investigative committee would do well if it will not settle for analyzing the police officers’ conduct at the funeral itself, but also draw lessons and conclusions that would enable a more successful handling of similar incidents in the future.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Along with the internal dealing with police issues, it is also required to consider the elected officials that have lost their just way of conduct.</seg>
          <seg id="30">The Israeli Knesset consists of a few Knesset members which are considered a danger to democracy.</seg>
          <seg id="31">They are found on the left and right wing, and exploit their Parliament immunity not for challenging the state, but rather to harm it.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Knesset member, Ofer Kassif, is the most recent example of this; if no action is taken against him—including prosecution for assaulting a police officer—the state will encourage the next elected official to extreme his actions even more.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Such moves, which are considered moves of defensive democracy, are essential in the explosiveness of this period, with factors in the background seeking to exploit the situation for political needs.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Anyone with common sense is expected to rise above all of these, and act to appease the situation; Otherwise, Israel could quickly be withdrawn into an escalation facing outer country enemies, and worse—against domestic ones.</seg>

          <seg id="14">Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it and for those present at the scene.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of combatants.</seg>
          <seg id="16">This attests to high morality, but it also has an operational-intelligence value: a terrorist who was captured alive - as happened the day before yesterday in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about weapons, terror attacks and other terrorists; it is information that usually cannot be obtained in any other way, and through it it is possible to thwart the next attacks.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The IDF acted correctly when it published the interim investigation it conducted into Abu Aqla's death, and clarified that it was not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether it will be possible to reach an unequivocal bottom line in the affair.</seg>
          <seg id="19">In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terror - the original cause for which the IDF is constantly operating in Jenin.</seg>

          <seg id="21">World public opinion is preoccupied and is moving on, certainly as the war in Ukraine continues to rage much more intensely.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Therefore, it is a shame that Israel insisted on giving Abu Aqleh's death another unnecessary moment of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful treatment of her funeral.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Even if Abu "Aqleh's family did not meet the preliminary summaries, we should have expected a little more restraint from the policemen who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less to be moved by the Palestinian flags that were raised there.</seg>

          <seg id="27">In the attack in Dizengoff, too, the police failed in managing the incident, isolating the scene and handling the media.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The commission of inquiry will do well not only to analyze the conduct of the policemen at the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions that will enable better treatment of similar incidents in the future.</seg>

          <seg id="2">משטרת ישראל אמנם פתחה במבצע למיגור תופעת השוהים הבלתי חוקיים, אך הדרך עוד ארוכה •</seg>
          <seg id="3">אין היום במדינת ישראל גורם אחד שמתכלל את כל הנושא הזה"."</seg>
          <seg id="4">"אם רוצים לטפל בתופעת השוהים הבלתי חוקיים, נדרשת מדיניות ממשלתית, וממנה יש לגזור מטרות, משימות ואחריות.</seg>
          <seg id="5">כיום אין במדינת ישראל גורם אחד שמתכלל את כל הנושא הזה", כך אומר ל"ישראל היום" בכיר במשטרה.</seg>
          <seg id="6">עד לפני חודש וחצי, טרם ההסלמה במצב הביטחוני, התופעה התבטאה בכ-20 עד 30 אלף שב"חים שנכנסים מדי יום דרך הפרצות בגדר.</seg>
          <seg id="7">נוסף על כך, בין 100 ל-110 אלף פלשתינים עם היתרי עבודה נכנסים מדי יום לעבודה בישראל דרך 34 מעברים מפוקחים.</seg>
          <seg id="8">יצוין כי פלשתינים מועסקים בישראל מאז תום מלחמת ששת הימים, ומספר ההיתרים בכל ענף מוגבל במכסה שקובע הדרג המדיני בהתאם למצב הביטחוני, הכלכלי והמדיני במדינת ישראל.</seg>
          <seg id="9">ההיתרים מונפקים על ידי צה"ל באמצעות מינהלת התיאום והקישור.</seg>
          <seg id="10">לאור זאת, שב"ח אינו בהכרח פלשתיני שכניסתו אסורה בעקבות מעורבות פלילית או קשר לפיגועים, אלא במקרים רבים מדובר בפלשתינים שכניסתם נאסרה משום שאינם עומדים במכסת ההיתרים המותרת.</seg>
          <seg id="11">יודגש כי מי שביצעו את הפיגועים באריאל, בדיזנגוף ובאלעד נחשבו אמנם לשב"חים, אך לא היו מפוקחים, משום שלא עברו קודם לכן עבירה פלילית כלשהי שחייבה את גורמי הביטחון לפקח על תנועותיהם.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"לכן אין משמעות לכניסה שלהם דרך הפרצות בגדר", אומר גורם ביטחוני בכיר, "מי שרוצה לעשות פיגוע יכול להיכנס לארץ גם דרך המעברים המפוקחים, והיו כבר מקרים כאלה בעבר.</seg>
          <seg id="13">אלפי מעצרים</seg>
          <seg id="14">בעקבות הפיגוע באלעד ולאור ריבוי התרעות לפיגועים, פתחה המשטרה במבצע רחב היקף לאיתור שוהים בלתי חוקיים.</seg>
          <seg id="15">עד סוף השבוע נעצרו כ-16,000 שב"חים.</seg>
          <seg id="16">מתוכם כ-600 נחקרו ונפתחו להם תיקים פליליים, ונכלאו כ-200.</seg>
          <seg id="17">על פי מדיניות התביעה המשטרתית, הליכים נגד שוהה בלתי חוקי מתבצעים רק כלפי פושעים מועדים או אנשים החוזרים על המעשה שוב ושוב (רצידיביסטים).</seg>
          <seg id="18">שוהה בלתי חוקי שנעצר בפעם הראשונה נחקר, מתועד ומוחזר לשטחים.</seg>
          <seg id="19">לעיתים הדבר חוזר על עצמו גם בפעם השנייה, אך רק בפעם השלישית הוא נעצר, נכלא ומוגש נגדו כתב אישום בגין שהייה בלתי חוקית.</seg>
          <seg id="20">על פי החוק, אם שוהה בלתי חוקי נתפס בטווח של כ-50 עד 100 מטר מכל צד מגדר ההפרדה, הטיפול בו מתבצע על ידי התביעה הצבאית.</seg>
          <seg id="21">מנתונים שהגיעו ל"ישראל היום" עולה כי בשנת 2021 טופלו על ידי המשטרה 40,010 שוהים בלתי חוקיים, מסיעים ומלינים.</seg>
          <seg id="22">7,405 שוהים בלתי חוקיים נעצרו ול-19,533 נפתח תיק פלילי.</seg>
          <seg id="23">מספר המעסיקים, מסיעים ומלינים שטופלו על ידי המשטרה בשנת 2021 היה 6,537.</seg>
          <seg id="24">469 נעצרו, ול-5,640 נפתחו תיקים פליליים.</seg>
          <seg id="25">"היסודות של תופעת השב"חים לא תלויים במשטרה, לא בצה"ל, לא בחברה הישראלית ולא בחברה הפלשתינית.</seg>
          <seg id="26">הם תלויים בגורמים אחרים", אומר בכיר במערכת אכיפת החוק.</seg>
          <seg id="27">"כדי לטפל בתופעה יש לעקר את המוטיבציה שלהם לצאת לעבוד בישראל, ובצד הישראלי צריך לגבות מהם מחיר שימנע מהם לחצות את הגדר.</seg>
          <seg id="28">גורמים המעורבים בנושא טוענים כי אי גביית המחיר נובעת בין היתר מחוסר במקומות כליאה ובעובדה שהמעצרים מתבצעים רק כשיש עבירות נלוות או שמדובר ברצידיביסט.</seg>
          <seg id="29">גורמים משפטיים טוענים כי ההחלטה לגבות מחיר משב"ח רק החל ממעצרו השלישי התקבלה בין היתר גם משום שבתי המשפט אינם יכולים להתמודד עם מספר המעצרים המתבצעים מדי יום.</seg>
          <seg id="30">מי שיבדוק גם את הענישה, יגלה שהיא לא מרתיעה"."</seg>
          <seg id="31">ישנה מורכבות גדולה</seg>
          <seg id="32">שב"ח", אומר גורם משטרתי, "הוא אדם מורכב".</seg>
          <seg id="33">הוא יכול להיות אב למשפחה שנכנס לארץ לעבוד כדי להרוויח כמה שקלים ולחזור.</seg>
          <seg id="34">זו הפלטפורמה הבסיסית, ועליה מתלבשים המון סוגים של שב"חים שנכנסים לתוך הארץ כדי לבצע עבירות פליליות או פיגועים".</seg>
          <seg id="35">שב"ח יכול להיות בגיר או קטין.</seg>
          <seg id="36">בעבר נתפסו על ידי המשטרה שוהים בלתי חוקיים בני 16 ואפילו ילדים בני 8 ו-10 נשלחים על ידי הוריהם לצמתים בכבישים, כדי להרוויח כמה שקלים מדי יום מנהגים.</seg>
          <seg id="37">"זה גם הופך את העניין למורכב, כי במקרים כאלה אנחנו צריכים להביא את ההורים ולהגיש נגדם כתב אישום על הזנחה", אומר קצין משטרה בכיר.</seg>
          <seg id="38">מרבית הפלשתינים מועסקים בישראל בעבודות כפיים.</seg>
          <seg id="39">החריג ביותר אלו עבודות חשמל או עבודות בניין מתקדמות.</seg>
          <seg id="40">בעבר היו גם רשויות מקומיות שהעסיקו שב"חים בפינוי אשפה, בעיקר בצפון.</seg>
          <seg id="41">מתוך 34 מעברים, ישנם כ-18 מעברים מרכזיים.</seg>
          <seg id="42">ישנם מעברים של כלי רכב וסחורות, יש מעברים שעוברים דרכם רק אנשים ויש מעברים שהם גם וגם.</seg>
          <seg id="43">כל המעברים מפוקחים על ידי צה"ל ורשות המעברים.</seg>
          <seg id="44">את השב"חים מסיעים לתוך הארץ בדרך כלל נהגים פרטיים, שכן מדובר בכסף קל.</seg>
          <seg id="45">"יש כאלה שעושים זאת לפרנסתם ויש כנופיות שהעיסוק המרכזי שלהן זה הסעת שב"חים" אומר בכיר במשטרה, "בדרך כלל מרביתם הם ערבים ישראלים, שמדברים את אותה שפה ומתכתבים איתם.</seg>
          <seg id="46">זה יכול להגיע ל-100 שקלים עד 300 שקלים לאדם.</seg>
          <seg id="47">חברות רשומות לא עוסקות בזה, מכיוון שאם החברה תיתפס, דינה להיסגר".</seg>
          <seg id="48">במשטרה מדגישים שבתנאים מסוימים, הסעת שב"ח יכולה להיחשב לעבירה.</seg>
          <seg id="49">"נהג מונית שעובד עם רישיונות בהתאם לרישוי וביטוחים, שאוסף פלשתינים בנקודות מסודרות ובשעות קבועות, כולל הזמנה מסודרת, לא עובר על החוק" אומר בכיר במשטרה, "מי שיודע שהוא מסיע שב"ח, בדרך כלל אוסף אותם באישון לילה בנקודות מסתור, כולל הורדה בנקודות נסתרות.</seg>
          <seg id="50">לרוב החבר'ה האלה מסיעים עם רכב מצ'וקמק כי הם יודעים שנחרים להם את הרכב אז הם מעדיפים לנסוע ברכב ישן".</seg>

          <seg id="1">A senior police officer: “Government policy and setting goals are required here”</seg>
          <seg id="2">The Israel Police has indeed initiated an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal residents, but the road ahead is still long •</seg>
          <seg id="3">In the State of Israel, there is currently no single agency that encompasses this whole issue”.</seg>
          <seg id="4">“If you want to deal with the phenomenon of illegal residents, a government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities must be derived.</seg>
          <seg id="5">A senior police officer told Israel Hayom, “in the State of Israel, there is currently no single agency that encompasses this whole issue”.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Up until a month and a half ago, before the escalation of the security situation severity, the phenomenon manifested itself in about 20 to 30 thousand Illegal residents who infiltrate daily through the loopholes in the fence.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Furthermore, 100 to 110 thousand Palestinians holding work permits enter Israel for work every day, passing through 34 controlled passages.</seg>
          <seg id="8">It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of The 1967 Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each sector is limited by the quota set by the political rank according to the security, economic and political situation in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The permits are issued by the IDF via the Coordination and Liaison Administration.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In light of this, an illegal resident is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or relation to terrorist attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permitted permit quota.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were indeed considered illegal residents, but were not monitored, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense requiring security forces to monitor their movements.</seg>
          <seg id="12">“Therefore, their entry through the loopholes in the fence is meaningless”, says a senior security official, “those who want to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled passages, and there have already been such cases in the past.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Thousands of arrests</seg>
          <seg id="14">Following the attack in Elad and considering the numerous warnings of attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal residents.</seg>
          <seg id="15">By the end of the week, about 16,000 illegal residents have been arrested.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal records were opened against them, and about 200 were imprisoned.</seg>
          <seg id="17">According to the police prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal residents are carried out only against habitual criminals or people who repeat the act over and over again (recidivists).</seg>
          <seg id="18">An illegal resident arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and sent back to the occupied territories.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Sometimes this reoccurs, however the individual will only be arrested if this is the third incident. The resident is imprisoned and charged with illegal stay.</seg>
          <seg id="20">According to the law, if an illegal resident is caught within a range of about 50 to 100 meters from each side of the separation fence, military prosecution will take care of him.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Data received by Israel Hayom news shows that in 2021, the police handled 40,010 illegal residents, drivers and lodgers.</seg>
          <seg id="22">7,405 illegal residents were arrested and 19,533 got a criminal record opened against them.</seg>
          <seg id="23">In 2021 the police handled 6,537 employers, transporters and lodgers.</seg>
          <seg id="24">469 were arrested, and criminal records were opened against 5,640 of them.</seg>
          <seg id="25">“The foundations of the illegal resident phenomenon do not depend on the police, not on the IDF, not on the Israeli or Palestinian society.</seg>
          <seg id="26">That depend on other factors”, says a senior member of the law enforcement system.</seg>
          <seg id="27">“In order to address this phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be sterilized, and on the Israeli side, they have to be charged highly to prevent them from passing the fence.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Sources involved claim that the failure to charge the right price is due to, among other things, a lack of prison space and the fact that arrests are only made when there are related offenses or when a recidivist is concerned.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Legal sources claim that deciding to collect a price off illegal residents starting from his third arrest, was made because the courts are unable to cope with the high number of arrests carried out every day.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Whoever examines the punishment as well, will find that it is not a deterrent”.</seg>
          <seg id="31">This is highly complex</seg>
          <seg id="32">A police official states that an illegal resident is typically a complex person”.</seg>
          <seg id="33">He can be a family father entering Israel to work and earn a few NIS and get back home.</seg>
          <seg id="34">This is the basic platform, and it is used by many types of illegal residents who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks”.</seg>
          <seg id="35">An illegal resident may be an adult or a minor.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In the past, 16-year-old illegal residents were caught by the police, and even 8- and 10-year-old children were sent by their parents to road junctions, to earn a few NIS a day from drivers.</seg>
          <seg id="37">“It makes the matter even more complex, since in such cases we need to bring in the parents and charge them for child neglect”, says a senior police officer.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Most Palestinians are employed in Israel as manual laborer.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The most unusual are electrical workers or advanced construction workers.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In the past, there were also local authorities that employed illegal residents in garbage disposal, mainly in the north.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Out of 34 passes, there are about 18 major passes.</seg>
          <seg id="42">There are passages for vehicles and goods, there are passages through which only people pass, and there are passages which are both.</seg>
          <seg id="43">All crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The illegal resident are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as this is easy money earned.</seg>

          <seg id="1">A senior police officer: "There is a need for government policy and setting goals."</seg>
          <seg id="2">Israel Police has indeed launched an operation to mitigate the phenomenon of illegal squatters, but the road is still long.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Today in Israel, there is not a single entity that encompasses this entire issue.</seg>
          <seg id="4">"If we want to address the issue of illegal immigrants, a government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities should be derived.</seg>
          <seg id="5">"Today in Israel, there is not a single entity that encompasses this entire issue," a senior police officer tells "Israel Today".</seg>
          <seg id="6">Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon was manifested in about 20 to 30 thousand Palestinians entering every day through breaches in the fence.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In addition, between 100 to 110 thousand Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day through 34 supervised crossings.</seg>
          <seg id="8">It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each sector is limited by a quota set by the state according to the security, economic, and political situation in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In light of this, an illegal worker is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is forbidden due to criminal involvement or connection to attacks, but often they are Palestinians whose entry is denied because they do not meet the permitted quota.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were indeed considered terrorists, but they were not under surveillance, as they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security forces to monitor their movements.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"Therefore, their entry through the breaches in the fence is meaningless," says a senior security official, "anyone who wants to carry out an attack can enter the country through the supervised crossings, and there have been such cases in the past."</seg>
          <seg id="13">Thousands of arrests.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Following the attack in Elad and due to the increase in attack warnings, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal residents.</seg>
          <seg id="15">By the end of the week, about 16,000 Sabbath observers were arrested.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Out of them, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases were opened against them, and about 200 were imprisoned.</seg>
          <seg id="17">According to the police prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal residents are only carried out against repeat offenders or people who repeatedly commit the same act (recidivists).</seg>
          <seg id="18">An illegal resident who is arrested for the first time is investigated, documented and returned to the territories.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Sometimes this repeats itself even for the second time, but only on the third time he is arrested, imprisoned and an indictment is filed against him for illegal stay.</seg>
          <seg id="20">According to the law, if an illegal resident is caught within a range of about 50 to 100 meters from either side of the separation fence, he is dealt with by the military prosecution.</seg>
          <seg id="21">According to data obtained by "Israel Today", it appears that in 2021, the police handled 40,010 illegal residents, infiltrators, and asylum seekers.</seg>
          <seg id="22">7,405 illegal residents were arrested and criminal cases were opened against 19,533.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The number of employers, drivers and complainants handled by the police in 2021 was 6,537.</seg>
          <seg id="24">469 were arrested, and criminal cases were opened against 5,640.</seg>
          <seg id="25">"The fundamentals of the phenomenon of 'terror attacks' do not depend on the police, not on the IDF, not on Israeli society, and not on Palestinian society.</seg>
          <seg id="26">"They are dependent on other factors," says a senior official in the law enforcement system.</seg>
          <seg id="27">"To address the issue, we need to eliminate their motivation to work in Israel, and on the Israeli side, we need to impose a cost that will deter them from crossing the fence."</seg>
          <seg id="28">Those involved in the issue argue that the failure to enforce the price is due, among other things, to a lack of detention facilities and the fact that arrests are only made when there are accompanying offenses or in the case of a recidivist.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Legal experts argue that the decision to charge a fee from the detainee only from the third arrest was made, among other things, because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests made every day.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Whoever checks the punishment as well, will discover that it is not deterrent.</seg>
          <seg id="31">There is a great complexity.</seg>
          <seg id="32">"Shabach," says a police source, "is a complex person."</seg>
          <seg id="33">He could be a father to a family who came to the country to work, earn some money and then return.</seg>
          <seg id="34">This is the basic platform, and on it, many types of infiltrators enter the country to commit criminal offenses or attacks.</seg>
          <seg id="35">A suspect can be an adult or a minor.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In the past, the police have caught illegal residents aged 16 and even children aged 8 and 10, sent by their parents to intersections on the roads, to earn a few shekels a day from drivers.</seg>
          <seg id="37">"This also complicates the matter, because in such cases we need to bring the parents and file an indictment against them for neglect," says a senior police officer.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Most Palestinians employed in Israel work in manual labor jobs.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The most exceptional are electrical works or advanced construction works.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In the past, there were also local authorities that employed community service workers to remove garbage, mainly in the north.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Out of 34 crossings, there are about 18 main crossings.</seg>
          <seg id="42">There are crossings for vehicles and goods, there are crossings that only people pass through, and there are crossings that are both.</seg>
          <seg id="43">All the crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The Sabbath observers are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as it is easy money.</seg>
          <seg id="45">"Some do it for a living and there are gangs whose main activity is transporting illegal workers," says a senior police officer, "usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and communicate with them.</seg>
          <seg id="46">It can cost from 100 shekels to 300 shekels per person.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Registered companies do not engage in this, because if the company gets caught, it could be shut down.</seg>
          <seg id="48">The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting a weapon can be considered a violation.</seg>
          <seg id="49">"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at regular points and at fixed times, including a regular order, does not break the law," says a senior police officer, "whoever knows that he is driving illegal residents, usually picks them up in the dead of night at hidden points, including drop-offs at hidden points.</seg>

          <seg id="12">"Therefore, it makes no sense for them to enter through the breaches in the fence", says a senior security official, "whoever wants to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled crossings, and there have been such cases in the past.</seg>

          <seg id="14">Following the attack in Alad and in light of the multiple attacks, the police have launched a large-scale operation to find illegal immigrants.</seg>
          <seg id="15">By the end of the week, 16,000 workers had been arrested.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Of these, about 600 were investigated and prosecuted, and about 200 were imprisoned.</seg>
          <seg id="17">According to the police prosecution policy, the proceedings against illegal residence are only carried out against would-be criminals or people who repeat the act repeatedly (recidivists).</seg>
          <seg id="18">An illegal stay that was first apprehended is investigated, documented and returned to the territories.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Sometimes it happens a second time, but it's not until the third time that he's arrested, jailed, and charged with being illegal.</seg>
          <seg id="20">By law, if an illegal stay is detected within 50 to 100 yards of either side of the separation fence, it is handled by the military prosecution.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Data obtained by Israel Today shows that in 2021, 40,010 illegal residents, travelers and migrants were dealt with by the police.</seg>
          <seg id="22">7,405 illegal residents were arrested and 19,533 criminal cases were opened.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The number of employers, drivers and passengers treated by the police in 2021 was 6,537.</seg>
          <seg id="24">469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.</seg>
          <seg id="25">"The foundations of the S.H.I.E.L.D. phenomenon do not depend on the police, the IDF, Israeli society or Palestinian society.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They depend on other factors", says a senior law enforcement official.</seg>
          <seg id="27">"To address this phenomenon, we must discourage them from working in Israel, and the Israeli side must charge them a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.</seg>
          <seg id="28">The officials involved in the case allege that the non-reimbursement of the price is due, among other things, to the lack of places of detention and the fact that the arrests are made only when there are accompanying offences or when there is a serial killer.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Legal sources claim that the decision to charge a fee to the hospital only after his third arrest was made partly because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests made every day.</seg>
          <seg id="30">"Whoever examines the punishment also finds it not to be deterrent".</seg>
          <seg id="31">There's a great complexity.</seg>
          <seg id="32">"He's a complex man", says a police official.</seg>
          <seg id="33">He could be a family man who went to the country to work to earn a few shekels and come back.</seg>
          <seg id="34">This is the basic platform, and it's where all kinds of terrorists who come into the country to commit crimes or attacks are dressed".</seg>
          <seg id="35">A stroke can be major or minor.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In the past, 16-year-old illegal immigrants have been caught by the police, and even children between the ages of 8 and 10 have been sent by their parents to crossroads to earn a few shekels a day from customs.</seg>
          <seg id="37">"It also makes it complicated because in cases like this we have to bring in the parents and charge them with neglect", says a senior police officer.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In the past, there were also local authorities that employed garbage collectors, mainly in the north.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Out of 34 passages, there are about 18 major passages.</seg>
          <seg id="42">There are crossings for vehicles and goods, there are crossings that only people cross, and there are crossings that are both.</seg>
          <seg id="43">All the crossings are controlled by the IDF and the transit authority.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The U.S.A. is usually driven into the country by private drivers, so it's easy money.</seg>
          <seg id="45">"There are those who do it for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is to transport Jews", says a senior police officer, "usually mostly Arab Israelis, who speak the same language and correspond with them.</seg>

          <seg id="34">This is the basic platform, and it is used by many types of Shebaim who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks."</seg>
          <seg id="35">Sheba can be an adult or a minor.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In the past, 16-year-old illegal residents were caught by the police and even 8- and 10-year-old children were sent by their parents to road junctions, to earn a few shekels a day from drivers.</seg>

          <seg id="41">Out of 34 passes, there are about 18 major passes.</seg>
          <seg id="42">There are passages for vehicles and goods, there are passages through which only people pass, and there are passages which are both.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Senior Police Official: "Government policies and goals are required here"</seg>
          <seg id="2">The Israeli police have launched an operation to eradicate the phenomenon of illegal aliens, but the road is still a long one •</seg>
          <seg id="3">There is not a single element in the State of Israel today that includes this whole issue.""</seg>
          <seg id="4">"If the phenomenon of illegal aliens is to be addressed, government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities must be derived.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Today, there is not a single element in the State of Israel that includes this whole issue," a senior police official told Israel Hayom.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation of the security situation, the phenomenon was expressed in about 20 to 30 thousand IPS who enter every day through the gaps in the fence.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In addition, between 100 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day through 34 supervised crossings.</seg>
          <seg id="8">It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each industry is limited by a quota set by the political echelons in accordance with the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In light of this, the Shin Bet is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to the attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians whose entry has been banned because they do not meet the permitted quota of permits.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were considered to be Shin Bet prisoners, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required the security forces to monitor their movements.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"Therefore, there is no significance to their entry through the loopholes in the fence, "says a senior security official," Anyone who wants to carry out an attack can enter Israel even through the supervised crossings, and there have been cases like this before.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Thousands of arrests</seg>
          <seg id="14">Following the attack in Elad and in light of the multiplicity of terror attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal aliens.</seg>
          <seg id="15">By the end of the week, about 16,000 people had been arrested.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Of those, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases opened, and about 200 were jailed.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Under the Police prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal aliens are only carried out against prone criminals or people who repeatedly repeat the act (recidivists).</seg>
          <seg id="18">An illegal immigrant arrested for the first time is interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Sometimes this is repeated a second time, but only for the third time has he been arrested, imprisoned and charged with unlawful residence.</seg>
          <seg id="20">According to the law, if an illegal immigrant is caught within 50 to 100 meters of each side of the separation fence, his treatment is carried out by the military prosecution.</seg>
          <seg id="21">According to data obtained by Israel Hayom, in 2021, 40,010 illegal aliens, shippers and informants were dealt with by the police.</seg>
          <seg id="22">7,405 illegals were arrested and 19,533 had criminal records opened.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The number of employers, movers and shakers dealt with by the police in 2021 was 6,537.</seg>
          <seg id="24">469 were arrested, and 5,640 had criminal cases opened.</seg>
          <seg id="25">"The foundations of the Shin Bet phenomenon do not depend on the police, not the IDF, not on Israeli society and not on Palestinian society.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They depend on other factors, " says a senior law enforcement official.</seg>
          <seg id="27">"In order to address this phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be sterilized, and the Israeli side must charge them a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Officials involved in the case argue that the failure to collect the toll is due, among other things, to the lack of places of detention and the fact that arrests are made only when there are related offenses or it is a serious crime.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Legal sources say that the decision to charge the Shin Bet only from his third arrest was made in part because the courts cannot deal with the number of arrests made every day.</seg>

          <seg id="5">Today, there is no single entity in the State of Israel that integrates this entire issue, "a senior police official told Israel Hayom.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Until a month and a half ago, prior to the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon was expressed in some 20,000 to 30,000 illegal aliens who enter the fence every day through breaches.</seg>
          <seg id="7">In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day through 34 supervised crossings.</seg>
          <seg id="8">It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each sector is limited by the quota set by the political echelon in accordance with the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.</seg>
          <seg id="10">In light of this, the ISA is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited as a result of criminal involvement or connection to terrorist attacks, but rather in many cases Palestinians whose entry is prohibited because they do not meet the permissible permit quota.</seg>
          <seg id="11">It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were considered illegal aliens, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security officials to monitor their movements.</seg>
          <seg id="12">"Therefore, there is no significance to their entry through the breaches in the fence," a senior security source said, "Anyone who wants to carry out a terrorist attack can enter the country through the supervised crossings, and there have been such cases in the past.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Thousands of arrests</seg>
          <seg id="14">Following the attack in Elad and in light of numerous warnings of attacks, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal aliens.</seg>
          <seg id="15">By the end of the week, 16,000 illegals had been arrested.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Of these, about 600 were interrogated and criminal cases were opened, and about 200 were imprisoned.</seg>
          <seg id="17">According to the policy of the police prosecution, proceedings against illegal aliens are carried out only against habitual criminals or people who repeat the act over and over again (recidivism).</seg>
          <seg id="18">Illegal detainees detained for the first time are interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Sometimes this is repeated a second time, but only the third time he is arrested, imprisoned and indicted for unlawful stay.</seg>
          <seg id="20">According to the law, if an illegal alien is caught within a range of 50 to 100 meters on either side of the separation fence, his treatment is carried out by the military prosecution.</seg>
          <seg id="21">According to data obtained by Israel Hayom, in 2021 the police treated 40,010 illegal aliens, transporters and accomplices.</seg>
          <seg id="22">7,405 illegal aliens were arrested and 19,533 criminal cases were opened.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The number of employers, transporters and melons treated by the police in 2021 was 6,537.</seg>
          <seg id="24">469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.</seg>
          <seg id="25">"The foundations of the Shin Bet phenomenon do not depend on the police, the IDF, Israeli society or Palestinian society.</seg>
          <seg id="26">They depend on other factors, "says a senior law enforcement official.</seg>
          <seg id="27">"In order to deal with the phenomenon, their motivation to work in Israel must be sterilized, and on the Israeli side they must be charged a price that will prevent them from crossing the fence.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Sources involved in the matter claim that the failure to charge the price stems, among other things, from a lack of places of detention and from the fact that the arrests are carried out only when there are incidental offenses or that the detainee is a recidivist.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Legal sources claim that the decision to charge a price from the IPS only began with his third arrest, partly because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests carried out every day.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Anyone who examines the punishment will find that it is not deterring. "</seg>
          <seg id="31">There is great complexity</seg>
          <seg id="32">A police official said, "He's a complicated man."</seg>
          <seg id="33">He can be a father of a family who came to Israel to work to earn a few shekels and come back.</seg>
          <seg id="34">This is the basic platform, and on it are dressed many types of illegals who enter the country to commit criminal offenses or terrorist attacks. "</seg>
          <seg id="35">It can be an adult or a minor.</seg>
          <seg id="36">In the past, 16-year-old illegal aliens have been caught by the police, and even 8- and 10-year-old children are sent by their parents to intersections to earn a few shekels a day from drivers.</seg>
          <seg id="37">"It also makes it complicated, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and charge them with negligence," says a senior police officer.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Most Palestinians are employed in Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="39">The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In the past, there were also local authorities that employed illegals in garbage disposal, mainly in the north.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Out of 34 passes, there are about 18 major ones.</seg>
          <seg id="42">There are crossings of vehicles and goods, there are crossings through which only people pass, and there are crossings that are both.</seg>
          <seg id="43">All the crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.</seg>
          <seg id="44">The illegal immigrants are usually transported into the country by private drivers, as this is easy money.</seg>
          <seg id="45">"There are those who do this for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is transporting illegals," says a senior police official, "Most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.</seg>
          <seg id="46">It can cost up to $300 per person.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Registered companies do not deal with this, because if the company is caught, it will be closed. "</seg>
          <seg id="48">The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting illegals can be considered a crime.</seg>
          <seg id="49">"A taxi driver who works with licenses and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at regular points and at regular times, including an order, does not break the law," says a senior police official, "Anyone who knows he is driving an illegal alien, usually collects them in the dead of night at hiding spots, including downloading at hidden spots.</seg>
          <seg id="50">Most of these guys drive a half-assed car because they know we'll confiscate their car, so they prefer to drive an old car. "</seg>

          <seg id="2">The City Comptroller’s report shows apparent concern about criminal conduct by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality and political opponents: surveillance of employees and an inflated payment to an accountant’s office for conducting investigations •</seg>
          <seg id="3">“The difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation” •</seg>
          <seg id="4">No response was given from the Haifa municipality.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Surveillance of municipal employees and political opponents and an inflated payment to an accountant’s office for carrying out the investigations, “at the expense of the public purse”.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The Haifa Municipality Comptroller, Ofer Tal’s report published yesterday (Tuesday) presents an alleged fear of criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials of the municipality, municipal employees, and political opponents.</seg>
          <seg id="7">According to the suspicion, Kalish met with the accountant’s office, Barlev &amp; Co., and asked to perform an investigative audit.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to council member, Sofi Nakash, and it was checked whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash’s family are strictly kosher.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The Comptroller’s report also shows that there is disorder and a complete lack of control after the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to coordinate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant were not transferred to him.</seg>
          <seg id="11">This meant that no one in the municipality is aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what is the scope of work required in each of them.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.</seg>
          <seg id="13">A situation arose in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved grew disproportionately, with a great deal of interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring by the municipality.</seg>
          <seg id="14">At the conclusion of the report, the Comptroller recommended stopping the unpaid payments to the accountant, until material is received detailing his work in each of the issues he reviewed.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In addition to this, invoices submitted to the Haifa Municipality were under codes such as “gatekeepers”, information shop, fish shop, investigative audit for the mayor and procurement investigative audit report.</seg>
          <seg id="16">A short time later, the spokesperson for the municipality, lawyer Yamit Klein, stated that the mayor herself signed the approval of the payment in her place.</seg>
          <seg id="17">“It was not commissioned by any audit report and I do not know what it is about”, she wrote.</seg>
          <seg id="18">It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remain to be paid, from the tax money of Haifa’s public.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The former municipal treasurer, Jackie Vakim, responded: “These despicable actions that were done to tarnish my name and the name of elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the Haifa taxpayers are a criminal offense.”</seg>
          <seg id="20">City Council member, Sophie Nakash, in her response: “The Comptroller’s report and the committee’s recommendations speak for themselves.”</seg>
          <seg id="21">The response of lawyer, Sarit Golan, a member of the Haifa City Council: the evidence and the difficult findings emerging from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the use of the investigative audit consultant to carry out investigations, some of which are doubtful as to whether they are permitted by law in the manner in which they were carried out, and in particular the investigations concerning the council’s company from the opposition to the mayor and former senior employees”.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Lior Datz’s response from the “Shomeri HaSaf” association: “It seems that all the red lines have been crossed when a public authority sends private investigators to collect information against lawyers who represent an association that exposes corruption and at a time when the association is conducting public proceedings against the administration of Haifa’s Municipality”.</seg>

          <seg id="6">The report of Haifa City Comptroller Ofer Tal, published on Tuesday, presents an alleged concern about criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality, municipal employees, and political rivals.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Allegedly, Kalish met with the accounting firm Barlev &amp; Co. and asked to conduct an investigative audit.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The investigations were conducted under the names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to Councilwoman Sophie Nakash, and it was examined whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nakash's family are kosher for mehadrin.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The auditor's report also shows that there is disorder and a complete lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to coordinate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments, and the data collected by the accountant were not transferred to him.</seg>
          <seg id="11">This has meant that no one in the municipality is aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what the scope of work required in each of them is.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not confirmed in many cases as required.</seg>
          <seg id="13">A situation was created in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved grew disproportionately, with great interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring by the municipality.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In its summary of the report, the audit recommended stopping the unpaid payments to the accountant, until material detailing his work on each of the issues it examined is received.</seg>
          <seg id="15">On top of that, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were under codes such as "gatekeepers," information shop, fish shop, investigative audit to the mayor and procurement investigative audit report.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Shortly after, the city's attorney, Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor herself signed the payment approval in her place.</seg>
          <seg id="17">"It was not commissioned by any audit report and I am not aware of what it was about," she wrote.</seg>
          <seg id="18">It was also learned that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remained to be paid, from the tax funds of the Haifa public.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The city's former treasurer, Jackie Vakim, responded: "These vile actions were done to tarnish my name and the names of elected officials at the expense of the public coffers and the Haifa tax payer, and this is a criminal offense."</seg>

          <seg id="5">Surveillance of municipal employees and political rivals and inflated payments to an accountant's office for carrying out investigations, "at the expense of the public coffers."</seg>
          <seg id="6">The report of Haifa Municipal Comptroller Ofer Tal, published yesterday (Tuesday), presents a concern about alleged criminal offenses by Mayor Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.</seg>
          <seg id="7">According to the suspicion, Kalish met with the accountant's office at Barlev &amp; Co.and asked to carry out an investigative audit.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former municipal treasurer, and a code name given to councilwoman Sophie Nekesh, and it was examined whether the tenders held between the municipality and a company owned by Nekesh's family were kosher.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The auditor's report also shows that there is a complete lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Kalish met.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The municipal treasurer is the municipal official whose job it is to concentrate and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments and the data collected by the accountant was not transferred to him.</seg>
          <seg id="11">This has resulted in no one in the municipality being aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and the extent of the work required in each of them.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Moreover, the hours reports submitted by the accountant were not approved in many cases as required.</seg>
          <seg id="13">A situation was created in which the scope of the issues in which the accountant was involved increased disproportionately, with a great deal of interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and surveillance on the part of the municipality.</seg>
          <seg id="14">In summing up the report, the audit recommended halting the unpaid payments to the accountant until material detailing his work on each of the issues he examined was received.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were under codes such as "gatekeepers", an information store, a fish shop, an investigative audit for the mayor and an investigative procurement audit report.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Shortly after, the city's attorney, attorney Marine Klein, noted that the mayor had signed the payment herself instead.</seg>
          <seg id="17">"I have not been commissioned by any audit report and I do not know what this is about,"she wrote.</seg>
          <seg id="18">It was also reported that the cost of the investigative audit was about two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels were paid, with half a million shekels left to be paid, from the tax money of the Haifa public.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Former city Treasurer Jackie Wakim responded: "These despicable actions taken to smear the name and reputation of elected officials at the expense of the public coffers and the taxpayer are a criminal offence."</seg>
          <seg id="20">City Council member Sophie Knecht said: "The auditor's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves."</seg>
          <seg id="21">Attorney Sarit Golan, a member of the Haifa City Council: The hard evidence and findings from the report call for the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the consultant for investigative review to carry out investigations, some of which doubt whether they are permitted by law in the way they were carried out and in particular the investigations relating to the council member from the opposition to the mayor and former senior employees."</seg>
          <seg id="22">Lior Datz of the "Gatekeepers" association: "It seems that all red lines have been crossed that the public authority sends investigators details in order to gather information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption while the association is conducting public proceedings against the Haifa Municipality administration."</seg>
          <seg id="23">The City of Haifa declined to comment.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Accountant Yehuda Barlev's office did not wish to comment.</seg>

          <seg id="2">אחרי הפסד בדרבי ושמיני ברציפות באירופה, מפלה בקלאסיקו מול ירושלים - ככל הנראה, הייתה מסיימת את הרומן הארוך בין מכבי ת"א למאמן היווני •</seg>
          <seg id="3">אז למי יאניס חייב לשלוח זר פרחים עוד הלילה?</seg>
          <seg id="4">לצוות הישראלי שלו, שהיה אחראי על 42 נקודות קריטיות בארנה •</seg>
          <seg id="5">וגם: מדוע במועדון הצהוב צריכים לשנות את 'אסטרטגיית האמריקניזציה', ולקחת דוגמה חיה מהמודל של אריאל בית הלחמי באילת</seg>
          <seg id="6">קשה להישאר ציני למראה העיניים הדומעות והחיבוקים החמים והחזקים שהעניק יאניס ספרופולוס לשחקניו בסיום המשחק הערב בארנה, ובעיקר אל מול הלפיתה ההדוקה והחלפת הסוד עם ג'ון דיברתולמאו, שבמו ידיו הציל למאמן היווני את המשרה, ואולי את העונה כולה.</seg>
          <seg id="7">כי אחרי הפסד ביתי בדרבי ושמיני רצוף באירופה, להפסיד גם בקלאסיקו לירושלים ולהתרחק ממנה כדי שלושה ניצחונות בטבלה?</seg>
          <seg id="8">זה היה כבר מסיים את הרומן הישראלי-יווני עוד הלילה.</seg>
          <seg id="9">אז בינתיים, הוא איתנו, ויש לו הרבה מה ללמוד מהמשחק הזה, גם ובעצם בעיקר לגבי היורוליג.</seg>
          <seg id="10">ראשית, מכבי ת"א הגיעה עם שינוי קיצוני בהרגלי ההתקפה והנעת הכדור.</seg>
          <seg id="11">הכדור זז במסירות, עם הרבה תנועה ותרגילים, וסקוטי ווילבקין, באופן מופגן, השאיר את מלאכת הריכוז לאוואנס, כדרר מעט מאוד, ובעיקר עבר על חסימות ויצא לקליעות.</seg>
          <seg id="12">למרות שקלע רע מאוד (2-9 מהשדה), ווילבקין תרם בהגנה, ובעיקר, מכבי פתאום נראתה כמו קבוצה, והשחקנים האחרים קלעו.</seg>
          <seg id="13">למרות זאת, לקראת הסיום, באופן טבעי עם פחות חמצן במוח, הקבוצה חזרה להרגלים הישנים, וההתקפות חזרו אחורה לכדררות והפגזות, ובהתקפה הכי קריטית, עם יתרון 2 ו-40 שניות לסוף, סקוטי כדרר עצמו לחצי פינה וזרק פלואטר על רגל אחת שכמעט הפסיד את המשחק.</seg>
          <seg id="14">החוכמה היא להמשיך לשחק תרגילים ותנועת מסירות דווקא ברגעי הקלאץ', וזה חייב להיכנס לטבע ול- DNA הקבוצתי.</seg>
          <seg id="15">את הלמידה החשובה יעשו יאניס והמועדון לגבי השימוש בישראלים.</seg>
          <seg id="16">אלה שהפכו לשואבי מים ומנופפי מגבות במשחקים באירופה.</seg>
          <seg id="17">הלילה הם קלעו עבור המאמן שהפסיק להאמין בהם יותר ממחצית הנקודות של הקבוצה (42 מתוך 83), והיו אלה ששמרו את המשחק חי בסיום.</seg>
          <seg id="18">ארבעה מחמשת הקלעים המובילים במכבי היו הישראלים שלה.</seg>
          <seg id="19">ואל תגידו ישראל זה לא אירופה.</seg>
          <seg id="20">אם הם יכולים להיות דומיננטיים נגד ירושלים, הקבוצה הכי אירופאית בליגה שלנו, הם יכולים לעזור גם ביורוליג.</seg>
          <seg id="21">בחצי הראשון זה היה בעיקר עוז בלייזר, שהמדור זועק כבר חודש שהוא חייב לשחק יותר.</seg>
          <seg id="22">קלעי, מוסר, לוחם מתחת לסלים (7 ריבאונדים), 2 מטר של נחישות הגנתית וחוכמת משחק.</seg>
          <seg id="23">זה לא מספיק?</seg>
          <seg id="24">במחצית השניה כיכבו ג'ייק כהן, עם אחוזים מצוינים מכל הטווחים, קור רוח מהקו, וחיפוי על פציעתו של ז'ז'יץ', ובעיקר ג'ון די, שבמצב של 70:63 לירושלים שינה את המומנטום עם 5 נקודות רצופות.</seg>
          <seg id="25">עם יפתח זיו יש ליאניס מערכת יחסים מורכבת, ונראה שלעיתים הוא נותן לו יותר מדי קרדיט, ומעמיס עליו יותר מדי, עד כדי סיכון בהפסד.</seg>
          <seg id="26">זה קורה גם ביורוליג, וזה קרה גם הלילה.</seg>
          <seg id="27">אבל הלמידה החשובה צריכה להיות של המועדון, לגבי אסטרטגיית האמריקניזציה שלו.</seg>
          <seg id="28">עובדה: הישראלים הבכירים כבר לא רוצים לבוא למכבי.</seg>
          <seg id="29">תומר גינת וים מדר יצאו לאירופה אבל לא למכבי, רפי מנקו חזר לחולון, ועכשיו נועם דברת בוחר בירושלים, או אולי נדחה על ידי מכבי.</seg>
          <seg id="30">וזה קורה כי במכבי נשארים בהדרגה פחות מקומות לישראלים, בגלל בחירה מושכלת ושורשית של המועדון להתבסס על אמריקנים.</seg>
          <seg id="31">מכבי תגיע בקרוב לקו פרשת המים, שבו לא יהיו ישראלים שירצו לשחק בה, ואז היא תחפש ילדים יהודיים כדי שיתאזרחו, ותלחץ על המנהלת/איגוד כדי להגדיל עוד את מספר הזרים.</seg>
          <seg id="32">אבל זו טעות גורלית של המועדון.</seg>
          <seg id="33">והמשחק שראינו צריך להזכיר למכבי שהיא מגזימה עם הזרים, הרבה בגלל הנחת המס.</seg>
          <seg id="34">בוודאי שלא נטען שהישראלים לבד מספיקים, אבל הם מספיק טובים כדי לתמוך בארבעה זרים מעולים.</seg>
          <seg id="35">אז במקום להוציא את אותו הכסף על כוכב אחד ועוד שמונה בינוניים, אפשר חמישה מצוינים.</seg>
          <seg id="36">למשל העונה, בכסף של וויליאמס, נאנלי, אוואנס, ריינולדס וטילור, אפשר היה להביא שני כוכבים (רכז כוכב ופורוורד על) יעילים ויציבים ליד סקוטי וז'יזי'ץ'.</seg>
          <seg id="37">זה יהיה יותר יעיל, זה יהיה יותר נכון, זה יהיה יותר ישראלי, זה יהיה יותר יפה ומעניין ומייצר הזדהות.</seg>
          <seg id="38">נכון שיש שתי מסגרות עמוסות ועונה ארוכה - אז צריך לסמוך על הישראלים שלך.</seg>
          <seg id="39">וגם כי אתם קבוצה ישראלית, שמתיימרת לייצג את ישראל, ואפילו מקבלים מהמדינה הקלת מס עבור הכאילו -ייצוג שלה באירופה.</seg>
          <seg id="40">איגוד הכדורסל/מנהלת הליגה יכולים לעזור למכבי, ולחזור לשפיות עם מספר זרים מותאם לליגה הישראלית.</seg>
          <seg id="41">6 ברוסטר, 4 בטופס, מקסימום שלושה על המגרש בו זמנית.</seg>
          <seg id="42">האם בשביל ההישגים הכושלים המתמשכים (כבר שבע שנים באירופה), רק בשביל מכבי, הליגה מוצפת בזרים?</seg>
          <seg id="43">וארגון השחקנים, מה איתכם?</seg>
          <seg id="44">בשביל זה שבתתם?</seg>
          <seg id="45">היו שני ישראלים על המגרש, ועכשיו יש אחד?</seg>
          <seg id="46">כמו ג'ורג' קוסטנזה בפיילוט של סיינפלד.</seg>
          <seg id="47">להתמקח כדי לקבל פחות?</seg>
          <seg id="48">החוק הרוסי הקודם היה טוב לכדורסל, טוב לקבוצות, ואפילו טוב למכבי.</seg>
          <seg id="49">ואם מישהו היה צריך חיזוק לכיוון הנ"ל, באה הפועל אילת במשחק המוקדם והסבירה את זה כל כך יפה.</seg>
          <seg id="50">עם 3 זרים, ועוד 4 ישראלים שהיו רק משניים בנבחרות הצעירות (הובר, בן משה, רוינה ושוכמן הלוחם), היא פירקה את חולון (השניה בטבלה!) בפעם השניה בשבועיים האחרונים.</seg>
          <seg id="51">זו מסורת באילת לשחק טוב עם שלושה זרים, כי היתה ריצה כזו גם בימי דן שמיר והרבה בימי שרון דרוקר.</seg>
          <seg id="52">אילת הקצרה היא פשוט קבוצה מאוזנת ויעילה יותר, ואין כמו אריאל בית הלחמי, שהתחיל במגרשים הפתוחים בגבעת שמואל, להדגים ולהזכיר לנו איך כדורסל ישראלי צריך להיראות.</seg>
          <seg id="53">כולם בשיא כושרם, כולם משחקים יחד, וכל הישראלים לומדים ומשפרים את המשחק שלהם.</seg>
          <seg id="54">הזרים רק משלימים.</seg>
          <seg id="55">כשבן קרטר וקייסי פראת'ר יחזרו מפציעת הברך, זו תהיה קבוצה אדירה.</seg>
          <seg id="56">שיר שחלמתי על אילת.</seg>
          <seg id="57">ושמכבי יכולה ללמוד ממנו על הכיוון הנכון.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Give them a chance: the Israelis of Maccabi Tel Aviv saved Sferopoulos</seg>
          <seg id="2">After a loss in the Derby and eighth in a row in Europe, a defeat in Clasico against Jerusalem—apparently, would have ended the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach •</seg>
          <seg id="3">So who does Yanis need to send a bouquet of flowers tonight?</seg>
          <seg id="4">to his Israeli crew, for achieving 42 critical points in the Arena hall •</seg>
          <seg id="5">And: why should the Yellow Club change the ‘Americanization strategy’, and take a living example from the Ariel Beit HaLhami model in Eilat</seg>
          <seg id="6">It’s hard to remain cynical at the sight of the tearful eyes and the warm and tight hugs Yanis Sferopoulos gave his players by the end of tonight’s game at the Arena, and especially in light of the tight hug and exchange of secrets with John DiBartolomeo, who saved the Greek coach his job with his bare hands, and possibly the entire season.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because after a home loss of the Derby and the eighth in a row in Europe, to lose in Clasico to Jerusalem as well, causing a drop of three wins in the table?</seg>
          <seg id="8">This would have ended the Israeli-Greek romance this very night.</seg>
          <seg id="9">So in the meantime, he is with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also and in fact mainly about the Euroleague.</seg>
          <seg id="10">First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change of their attack strategy and ball movement habits.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The ball moved with passing, with a lot of movement and drills, and Scottie Wilbekin, obviously left the work of point guarding to Evans, dribbled very little, and mostly went through blocks and out for shots.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Although he scored very poorly (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed in defense, and most importantly, suddenly Maccabi looked like an actual team, and the other players scored.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Nevertheless, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team returned to its old habits, so the offense reverted to dribbling and shelling, and then in the most critical offense, with 2 points lead and 40 seconds to go, Scotty dribbled on his own to half a corner and threw a floater on one leg which almost lost the game.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The trick is to continue playing the drills and passing movements especially in the clutch moments, and this must be an integral part of the nature and DNA of the team.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The important learning will be done by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Those who became water-drawers and towel-wavers at European games.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Tonight they scored more than half of the team’s points (42 out of 83) for the coach who stopped believing in them, and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Four of Maccabi’s top five scorers were its Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="19">And don’t say Israel is not Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="20">If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In the first half it was mostly Oz Blazer, the section has been screaming for a month that he must play more.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Scorer, passer, fighter below the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Isn’t that enough?</seg>
          <seg id="24">On the second half, Jake Cohen was a star, thanks to excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and covering for Žižić’s injury. John Dee, starred as well when he changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points in a 70:63 situation for Jerusalem.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Yanis has a complex relationship with Yiftah Ziv, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and burdens him too much, up to the point of risking a loss.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It happens in the Euroleague, and it happened tonight as well.</seg>
          <seg id="27">But the important learning should be the club’s, regarding its Americanization strategy.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It is a fact: the senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or perhaps he got rejected by Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="30">And this happens because there are gradually fewer places left for Israelis in Maccabi, following the club’s informed and deep-rooted choice to base itself on Americans.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Maccabi will soon reach a dead end, there will be no Israelis wishing to play for Maccabi, and then Maccabi will look for Jewish children to naturalized, and will put pressure on the director/union to further increase the number of foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="32">But this is a fatal mistake for the club.</seg>
          <seg id="33">And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it is exaggerating with the foreigners, a lot because of the tax reduction.</seg>
          <seg id="34">We certainly won’t claim that the Israelis alone are enough, however they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="35">So instead of spending money on one star and eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones for the same price.</seg>
          <seg id="36">For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, it would have been possible to bring in two efficient and stable stars (a star center and a super forward) next to Scotty and Žižić.</seg>
          <seg id="37">It will be more effective, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and cause sympathy.</seg>
          <seg id="38">It is true that there are two busy frames and a long season—so you have to trust your Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="39">And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and therefore receiving a tax relieves from the state for its quasi-representation in Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The basketball association/league administration can help Maccabi, and stick to a more sane number of foreigners according to the Israeli league.</seg>
          <seg id="41">6 Brewster, 4 in a form, maximum three on the field simultaneously.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Is it because of the continuous failed achievements (for seven years in Europe), just for Maccabi, that the league is overwhelmed with foreigners?</seg>
          <seg id="43">And the players’ organization, what about you?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Is that what you went on strike for?</seg>
          <seg id="45">There were two Israelis on the field, and now there is just one?</seg>
          <seg id="46">Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Bargain for less?</seg>
          <seg id="48">The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="49">And if anyone needed reinforcement of the above, Hapoel Eilat came in the preliminary game and explained it so well.</seg>
          <seg id="50">With 3 foreigners, and 4 Israelis that are just secondary from the junior teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Royna and Shuchman the warrior), the team destroyed Holon (second in the table!) For the second time in the past fortnight.</seg>
          <seg id="51">Traditionally Eilat plays well with three foreigners, since there was such a rush in the days of Dan Shamir and more so in the days of Sharon Drucker.</seg>
          <seg id="52">The short Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there is no one like Ariel Beit HaLhami, starting on open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Everyone is at their prime, everyone plays together, and all Israelis learn and improve their game.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The foreigners are just a replacement.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return back from their knee injuries, this will be a formidable team.</seg>
          <seg id="56">A song I dreamt of Eilat.</seg>
          <seg id="57">And Maccabi can learn from this song about the right direction.</seg>

          <seg id="14">The wisdom is to continue playing exercises and passing movements especially in clutch moments, and it must become part of the nature and the team's DNA.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The important lesson will be learned by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Those who became water fetchers and towel wavers in games in Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Tonight, they scored more than half of the team's points (42 out of 83) for the coach who stopped believing in them, and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Four out of the five leading scorers in Maccabi were her Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="19">And don't say Israel is not Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="20">If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In the first half, it was mainly OZ Blayzer, whom the section has been screaming for a month that he needs to play more.</seg>
          <seg id="22">A shooter, disciplined, a fighter under the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Is that not enough?</seg>
          <seg id="24">In the second half, Jake Cohen shone, with excellent percentages from all ranges, coolness from the line, and covering for the injury of Zizic, and especially John Di, who at a score of 70:63 for Jerusalem, changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Yanis has a complex relationship with Yiftach Ziv, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and puts too much on him, to the point of risking a loss.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It happens in the Euroleague too, and it happened last night as well.</seg>
          <seg id="27">But the important lesson should be for the club, regarding its Americanization strategy.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Menco returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or maybe he was rejected by Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="30">And this is happening because in Maccabi there are gradually fewer places for Israelis, due to the club's deliberate and fundamental choice to rely on Americans.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Maccabi will soon reach the waterline, where no Israelis will want to play for them, and then they will look for Jewish children to naturalize and pressure the management/league to increase the number of foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="32">But it's a fatal mistake of the club.</seg>
          <seg id="33">And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that they are overdoing it with the foreigners, largely due to the tax assumption.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Certainly, it's not claimed that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="35">So instead of spending the same amount of money on one star and eight average ones, you can get five excellent ones.</seg>
          <seg id="36">For example, with the money of Williams, Nunnally, Evans, Reynolds, and Taylor, it would have been possible to bring two efficient and stable stars (a star center and forward) next to Scottie and Jizjiz.</seg>
          <seg id="37">It would be more efficient, it would be more correct, it would be more Israeli, it would be more beautiful and interesting and create identification.</seg>
          <seg id="38">It's true that there are two packed frameworks and a long season - so you have to rely on your Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="39">And also because you are an Israeli group, claiming to represent Israel, and even receiving tax relief from the state for supposedly representing it in Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The Basketball Association/League Management can help Maccabi, and return to normality with a number of foreigners suitable for the Israeli league.</seg>
          <seg id="41">6 on the roster, 4 on the form, a maximum of three on the field at the same time.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Is the league flooded with foreigners just for Maccabi's ongoing failures (already seven years in Europe)?</seg>
          <seg id="43">And the actors' union, what about you?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Did you rest for this?</seg>
          <seg id="45">There were two Israelis on the field, and now there is one?</seg>
          <seg id="46">Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.</seg>
          <seg id="47">To argue in order to get less?</seg>
          <seg id="48">The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for the teams, and even good for Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="49">And if someone needed reinforcement for the above direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.</seg>
          <seg id="50">With 3 foreigners, and another 4 Israelis who were only substitutes in the youth teams (Hover, Ben Moshe, Rovina and the fighter Shuchman), she dismantled Holon (second in the table!) for the second time in the last two weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="51">It's a tradition in Eilat to play well with three forwards, as there was such a run in the days of Dan Shamir and much in the days of Sharon Drucker.</seg>
          <seg id="52">Eilat Hatzara is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there's no one like Ariel Beit Halachmi, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Everyone is at their peak fitness, everyone is playing together, and all the Israelis are learning and improving their game.</seg>
          <seg id="54">The strangers only complete.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Ben Carter and Kasey Prather return from their knee injury, it will be an amazing team.</seg>

          <seg id="10">First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came up with a radical change in the habits of attacking and moving the ball.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The ball moved with dedication, with a lot of movement and drills, and Scottie Wilbkin, demonstrably, left the craft of concentration to Evans, dribbling very little, and mostly going over blocks and going for shots.</seg>

          <seg id="13">However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in their brains, the team went back to their old ways, and the attacks went back to the shelling and the bombing, and in the most critical attack, with a lead of 2 and 40 seconds to go, Scotty shoved himself into a half corner and threw Floater on one leg that almost lost the game.</seg>

          <seg id="16">The ones who became the water pumps and towel-wavers at the European Games.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Tonight they pitched for a coach who no longer believed in them for more than half the team's points (42 out of 83), and were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Four of the top five shooters in the squad were her Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="19">And don't say Israel is not Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="20">If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can help in the Euroleague.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The first half was mostly Oz Blazer, who's been screaming for a month that he has to play more.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Shooter, morale, a fighter under the sails, seven rebounds, six feet of defensive determination and game-wise.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Isn't that enough?</seg>
          <seg id="24">In the second half, Jake Cohen was in the lead, with excellent all-around percentages, a cool head from the line, and cover for the injury to Zjacic, and especially John D, who in 70:63 to Jerusalem changed the momentum with 5 straight points.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Liannis has a complicated relationship with Yeppe Zew, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and overcharges him, to the point of risking a loss.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It's happening in Urollig, and it happened tonight.</seg>
          <seg id="27">But the important lesson should be for the club, about its Americanization strategy.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to the Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Tamar Ginneth and Sam Meder went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Nahum Debret is choosing Jerusalem, or perhaps rejected by Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="30">And it's happening because there are fewer and fewer Israeli spots in the Maccabi, because of the club's educated and rooted choice to rely on Americans.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play with her, then she will look for Jewish children to civilize, and she will pressure the director/union to increase the number of foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="32">But this is a fatal mistake by the club.</seg>
          <seg id="33">And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that she overdoes it with strangers, much to the tax credit.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Of course, we're not saying that Israelis alone are enough, but they're good enough to support four excellent foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="35">So instead of spending the same amount on one star plus eight mediocre ones, you could have five excellent ones.</seg>
          <seg id="36">For example, this season, with the money from Williams, Nunnally, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, we could have brought in two effective and consistent stars alongside Scottie and Zizzic.</seg>
          <seg id="37">It would be more effective, it would be more accurate, it would be more Israeli, it would be more beautiful and interesting and create identity.</seg>
          <seg id="38">It's true there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to rely on your Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="39">And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even receives tax breaks from the state for its pseudo-representation in Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="40">The basketball association/league manager can help Maccabi, and come to terms with a number of strangers adapted to the Israeli league.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Six brewsters, four on the form, maximum three on the field at a time.</seg>
          <seg id="42">Is it because of the continuing failure of the achievements (in Europe for seven years), just for the sake of the Maccabi, that the league is flooded with foreigners?</seg>
          <seg id="43">And the players' union, what about you?</seg>
          <seg id="44">Is that what you were working for?</seg>
          <seg id="45">There were two Israelis on the court, and now there's one?</seg>
          <seg id="46">Like George Costanza in the pilot of Seinfeld.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Negotiate for less?</seg>
          <seg id="48">The old Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for the Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="49">And if anyone needed a little bit of reinforcement, the deer guy came in early and explained it so beautifully.</seg>
          <seg id="50">With 3 foreigners, and 4 Israelis who were only second in the youth teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Rowena and Sukhman the Warrior), she broke the second place for the second time in the last two weeks.</seg>
          <seg id="51">It's a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was a run like that in the days of Dan Shamir and a lot of it in the days of Sharon Drucker.</seg>
          <seg id="52">The short-handed eagle is simply a more balanced and efficient group, and unlike Ariel Beit Helmi, who started out in the open courts at the Hill of Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.</seg>
          <seg id="53">Everyone is at their peak, everyone is playing together, and all Israelis are learning and improving their game.</seg>
          <seg id="54">Foreigners only make up.</seg>
          <seg id="55">When Ben Carter and Casey Prather come back from their knee injury, it's gonna be a great team.</seg>

          <seg id="31">Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play in it, and then it will look for Jewish children to become naturalized, and will pressure the director/union to further increase the number of foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="32">But this is a fatal mistake of the club.</seg>
          <seg id="33">And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it is exaggerating with the foreigners, a lot because of the tax reduction.</seg>
          <seg id="34">It is certainly not claimed that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="35">So instead of spending the same money on one star and eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones.</seg>
          <seg id="36">For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, it was possible to bring in two efficient and stable stars (a star center and a super forward) next to Scotty and Zizic.</seg>

          <seg id="38">It is true that there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="39">And also because you are an Israeli group, which claims to represent Israel, and even receive a tax break from the state for its quasi-representation in Europe.</seg>

          <seg id="31">Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where no Israelis will want to play, and then she will seek Jewish children to become citizens.</seg>
          <seg id="32">But it's a fatal mistake by the club.</seg>
          <seg id="33">And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that she's overreacting to the foreigners, much because of the tax break.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Certainly, we will not argue that Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="35">So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Give Them a Chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv's Israelis Save Sfairopoulos</seg>
          <seg id="2">After losing the Derby and eight in a row in Europe, a defeat at the Clasico against Jerusalem - probably would have ended the long affair between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach</seg>
          <seg id="3">So who does Giannis have to send a bouquet of flowers to tonight?</seg>
          <seg id="4">His Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points in the Arena</seg>
          <seg id="5">Why the Yellow Club needs to change its "Americanization strategy," and take a living example from Ariel Beit Halachmi's model in Eilat</seg>
          <seg id="6">It is difficult to remain cynical at the sight of the tearful eyes and the warm and strong hugs that Giannis Sfairopoulos gave his players at the end of the game tonight at the Arena, and especially in the face of her tight grip and the secret exchange with John DiBartolmao, who single-handedly saved the Greek coach the job, and perhaps the entire season.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Because after a home loss in the derby and an eighth consecutive loss in Europe, to lose also in the classics to Jerusalem and stay away from it to three wins in the table?</seg>
          <seg id="8">It would have ended the Israeli-Greek romance by tonight.</seg>
          <seg id="9">So in the meantime, he's with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, also and actually mainly about the Euroleague.</seg>
          <seg id="10">First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change in offensive habits and moving the ball.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The ball moved with passing, with lots of movement and drills, and Scotty Wilbekin, demonstratively, left the craft of concentration to Evans, dribbled very little, and mostly passed over blocks and went out for shots.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Despite shooting very badly (9-2 from the field), Wilbekin contributed to the defense, and mainly, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.</seg>
          <seg id="13">However, by the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team had reverted to old habits, and the attacks had reverted to dribbling and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with a 2-and-40-second lead to go, Scotty dribbled himself into a half-corner and threw Floater over one leg for nearly losing the game.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The trick is to keep playing drills and passing precisely in the clutch moments, and that has to go into nature and team DNA.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The important learning will be done by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The ones who became water cleaners and towel-waving at European games.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them more than half of the team's points (42 out of 83), and were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.</seg>

          <seg id="19">And don't say that Israel is not Europe.</seg>
          <seg id="20">If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.</seg>
          <seg id="21">In the first half, it was mainly Oz Blazer, who has been screaming for a month that he must play more.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Shooter, passer, fighter under baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Isn't that enough?</seg>
          <seg id="24">In the second half, Jake Cohen starred, with excellent percentages from all ranges, composure from the line, and covering for Zzic's injury, and especially John Dee, who at 70: 63 to Jerusalem changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.</seg>
          <seg id="25">With Yiftach Ziv, Janis has a complex relationship, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and burdens him too much, to the point of losing.</seg>
          <seg id="26">It's also happening in the Euroleague, and it happened tonight.</seg>
          <seg id="27">But the important learning has to be the club's, about its Americanization strategy.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Fact: The senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Tomer Ganat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Manko returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or maybe was rejected by Maccabi.</seg>
          <seg id="30">And it happens that Maccabi gradually leaves fewer places for Israelis, because of an informed and rooted choice of the club to be based on Americans.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where there will be no Israelis who want to play with it, and then it will look for Jewish children to become naturalized, and pressure the director/union to further increase the number of foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="32">This is a huge mistake for the club.</seg>
          <seg id="33">And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that it exaggerates with the foreigners, much because of the tax discount.</seg>
          <seg id="34">It is certainly not claimed that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.</seg>
          <seg id="35">So instead of spending the same money on one planet and eight mediocre ones, you can have five great ones.</seg>
          <seg id="36">For example, this season, with the money of Williams, Nunally, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, it was possible to bring two stars (a star point guard and a super forward) that were effective and stable next to Scotty and Gizzich.</seg>
          <seg id="37">It will be more effective, it will be more correct, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and generates identification.</seg>

          <seg id="2">כ-2,100 מהנדסים ואנשי אקדמיה בעולם התבקשו לפתח פתרונות לבעיה – חלקם במפגשי וידאו, חלקם בפגישות פנים אל פנים •</seg>
          <seg id="3">התוצאה: פגישה וירטואלית פוגעת ביצירתיות ובחשיבה מחוץ לקופסה •</seg>
          <seg id="4">מובילת המחקר באוניברסיטת קולומביה: "ההתמקדות החזותית במסך פוגעת בתהליך יצירת הרעיונות" •</seg>
          <seg id="5">נחמה פורתא: אין פגיעה בפריון העבודה או בחשיבה הביקורתית.</seg>
          <seg id="6">מחקר מדעי גדול שפורסם לאחרונה בכתב העת המדעי Nature בחן את ההשפעה של מפגשים דרך תוכנות וידאו על היצירתיות של המשתתפים בהם, בהשוואה למפגשים הנערכים פנים מול פנים.</seg>
          <seg id="7">למרבה הצער, נמצא כי היצירתיות אכן נפגעת בפגישות וירטואליות דרך מסכים.</seg>
          <seg id="8">שאלת המחקר - בהובלת מלאני ברוקס, עוזרת פרופסור מאוניברסיטת קולומביה - הייתה האם פגישות מרוחקות באמצעות מחשב משמרות את היצירתיות שקיימת בפגישות סיעור מוחות משרדיות, או שרמת היצירתיות והחשיבה החופשית יורדת כתוצאה מהריחוק.</seg>
          <seg id="9">המחקר עצמו החל כבר בשנת 2016 אך קיבל דחיפה גדולה בשתי שנות הקורונה, שבמהלכן עובדים רבים עברו לעבוד מהבית.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"אנשים בפגישה אישית נעים בחדר, משתמשים בחפצים ונעזרים בהם לחשיבה יצירתית", אומרת ברוקס.</seg>
          <seg id="11">"בפגישת מחשב, לעומת זאת, הריכוז בשמירת קשר העין עם האחרים בא על חשבון הפעילות היצירתית במוח.</seg>
          <seg id="12">ההתמקדות החזותית במסך מצמצמת את הקוגניציה.</seg>
          <seg id="13">אנשים ממוקדים יותר בווידאו בעת אינטראקציה, מה שפוגע בתהליך יצירת הרעיונות הרחב והמרחיב".</seg>
          <seg id="14">המרחב מצטמצם.</seg>
          <seg id="15">כדי לבחון את תוצאות הניסוי ולוודא האם יחזרו על עצמן, הן נבחנו פעמיים – פעם אחת באוניברסיטת קולומביה ופעם נוספת בחיים האמיתיים - על מהנדסים שהכירו זה את זה מהיכרות מוקדמת.</seg>
          <seg id="16">באוניברסיטה חילקה החוקרת קבוצה של 602 אנשי סגל וסטודנטים לשני חלקים – באחד התבקשו הנבדקים להיפגש אישית ולפתח פתרונות לבעיה, ובשני הם התבקשו לעשות זאת דרך מחשב.</seg>
          <seg id="17">במקביל, התבקשו 1,490 מהנדסים מחמש מדינות באירופה, במזרח התיכון ובדרום אסיה להתחלק באופן דומה ולפתור בדרך חדשה בעיה שהוצגה להם.</seg>
          <seg id="18">בשני המקרים נמצאה ירידה ביצירתיות ובחשיבה מחוץ לקופסה בקרב אלו שנפגשו וירטואלית בווידאו.</seg>
          <seg id="19">ג'יי אולסון, פוסט-דוקטורנט באוניברסיטת מקגיל בקנדה וחוקר שעוסק בדרכים למדידת יצירתיות, לא היה מעורב במחקר אך לא הופתע מהתוצאות.</seg>
          <seg id="20">לדעתו, במסגרת פעילות חשיבה, אנשים לרוב מסתכלים על סביבתם כדי להסתייע ביצירת רעיונות, ואילו במפגש וידאו החשיבה מתכנסת אל המסך ולא מתרחבת באופן המאפשר יצירתיות.</seg>
          <seg id="21">"כשהאנשים באותו חדר הם מביטים סביבם ורואים את המרחב, שבו יש חפצים ומצבים שיכולים לעורר בהם אסוציאציות חדשות.</seg>
          <seg id="22">לעומת זאת, המחקר מראה שיחסים דרך מחשב משנים את תשומת הלב שלנו כך שאנו יותר מרוכזים פנימה ולמסך, והאופן הזה מצמצם את החדשנות ויצירת רעיונות דרך ההסתכלות על הסביבה והחשיבה החוצה".</seg>
          <seg id="23">אין פגיעה בחשיבה הביקורתית.</seg>
          <seg id="24">עם זאת, ולפני שמנהלים מריצים את העובדים חזרה למשרדים, מציינים החוקרים כי "העבודה דרך מחשב לא פגעה בפריון עצמו ולא בחשיבה הביקורתית של האנשים על הצעות חדשניות, כשהיה עליהם לבחור את הרעיון הכי טוב מתוך סט רעיונות.</seg>
          <seg id="25">כלומר, הפגיעה היא ממוקדת ליצירתיות בלבד ולא לשאר צורות העבודה מול מחשב".</seg>
          <seg id="26">פרופ' אלן לנגר, פרופסור לפסיכולוגיה באוניברסיטת הרווארד, מסייגת גם היא את הממצאים.</seg>
          <seg id="27">לדבריה, "יש הבדל בין סתם יצירתיות, כמו שימושים חדשים לפריזבי (אחת משאלות המחקר; א"ג) לבין פתרונות של עבודה.</seg>
          <seg id="28">ייתכן גם שכשהעובדים נינוחים יותר אחרי היכרות, או ששהם עובדים מהבית, היצירתיות כן תשתפר".</seg>
          <seg id="29">הן פרופ' לנגר והן ד"ר אולסון, גם הציעו מחקר עתידי בו פגישות כאלו יופסקו למצבי חשיבה ושוטטות בחדר כדי לראות איך הפעילות הזו תשפיע על התוצאה הסופית.</seg>
          <seg id="30">כמו כן ד"ר אולסון הציע כי בעקבות המחקר רק לפגישות סיעור מוחות עובדים יחזרו לעבודה וככלל הוא הציע שלא להיבהל ממחקר אחד אלא לבצע עוד חקירה בתחום.</seg>
          <seg id="31">"לא הייתי רוצה שעובדים יוחזרו בכפייה ולא יהיו מאושרים זו פגיעה גדולה יותר" הוא אומר.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Research states: Zoom meetings harm creativity</seg>
          <seg id="2">About 2,100 engineers and academics all over the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem—some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The result: a virtual meeting hurts creativity and thinking outside the box.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The leader of the research at Columbia University: “The visual focus on the screen harms the process of generating ideas.”</seg>
          <seg id="5">Nechama Porta: There is no harm to work productivity or to critical thinking.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal, Nature, examined the effect of meetings through video software on the creativity of the participants in them, compared to meetings held face to face.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Unfortunately, it has been found that creativity does suffer in virtual meetings through screens.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The research question—led by Melanie Brooks, assistant professor from Columbia University—was whether remote meetings using a computer preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of remoteness.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The research has already began in 2016 but it achieved a big boost during the two years of the Corona Virus, when many employees started working from home.</seg>
          <seg id="10">“People in a personal meeting mingling in the room, using objects as an aid for creative thinking,” says Brooks.</seg>

          <seg id="2">About 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem - some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The result: a virtual meeting hinders creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.</seg>

          <seg id="5">Nachama Porta: There is no harm to the work productivity or critical thinking.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of meetings via video applications on the creativity of the participants, compared to face-to-face meetings.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Unfortunately, it was found that creativity indeed suffers in virtual meetings through screens.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The research question - led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University - was whether remote meetings via computer maintain the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or if the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of the distance.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The research itself began in 2016 but received a major boost during the two years of the coronavirus, during which many employees switched to working from home.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"People in a pleasant personal meeting in a room, using objects and using them for creative thinking," says Brooks.</seg>
          <seg id="11">"In a face-to-face meeting, on the other hand, the focus on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain."</seg>

          <seg id="16">At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 staff members and students into two parts - in one, the participants were asked to meet personally and develop solutions to a problem, and in the second, they were asked to do so via a computer.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Simultaneously, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia were asked to similarly divide and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.</seg>

          <seg id="2">About 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem – some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings</seg>

          <seg id="6">A large scientific study recently published in Nature examined the effect of meetings through video software on participants' creativity, compared to face-to-face meetings.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Unfortunately, creativity has indeed been found to be impaired in virtual meetings through screens.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The research question—led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University—was whether remote computer meetings preserve the creativity of office brainstorming meetings, or whether creativity and free thinking decrease as a result of remoteness.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The study itself began in 2016 but received a big boost during the two COVID-19 years, during which many employees switched to working from home.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"People in a personal meeting move around the room, using objects and using them for creative thinking," Brooks says.</seg>
          <seg id="11">"In a computer meeting, on the other hand, concentrating on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.</seg>
          <seg id="13">People are more focused on video when interacting, which hinders the broader and expansive idea creation process."</seg>

          <seg id="15">To test the results of the experiment and see if they would be repeated, they were tested twice—once at Columbia University and again in real life—on engineers who knew each other from prior acquaintance.</seg>
          <seg id="16">At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts – in one the subjects were asked to meet personally and develop solutions to the problem, and in the other they were asked to do so through a computer.</seg>
          <seg id="17">At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to share the same way and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In both cases, there was a decline in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually via video.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who studies ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.</seg>
          <seg id="20">In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people usually look at their surroundings in order to help generate ideas, while in a video session the thinking converges to the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.</seg>

          <seg id="26">Professor Alan Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also qualifies the findings.</seg>
          <seg id="27">According to her, "There is a difference between mere creativity, such as new uses and frisbee (one of the research questions; A.G.) and solutions of work.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Some 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem - some in video sessions, some in face-to-face meetings.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The Result: Virtual Meeting Harms Creativity and Thinking Out of the Box</seg>
          <seg id="4">Columbia University research leader: "Visual focus on the screen impairs the idea-creation process"</seg>
          <seg id="5">Forte comfort: There is no harm to labor productivity or critical thinking.</seg>
          <seg id="6">A major scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of meetings through video programs on the creativity of their participants, compared to face-to-face meetings.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Unfortunately, creativity was found to be impaired in virtual meetings through screens.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The research question - led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University - was whether remote computer-aided meetings preserve the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or whether the level of creativity and free-thinking decreases as a result of remoteness.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The study itself began in 2016 but received a big boost in the two COVID-19 years, during which many employees switched to working from home.</seg>
          <seg id="10">"People in a personal meeting move around the room, use objects, and use them for creative thinking," Brooks says.</seg>
          <seg id="11">"In a computer meeting, however, the concentration on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.</seg>
          <seg id="13">People are more focused on video when interacting, which impairs the broad and expansive idea-creation process. "</seg>
          <seg id="14">Space is shrinking.</seg>
          <seg id="15">To test the results of the experiment and ascertain whether they would be repeated, they were tested twice - once at Columbia University and again in real life - on engineers who knew each other from an early acquaintance.</seg>
          <seg id="16">At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts - one asked the subjects to meet in person and develop solutions to the problem, and the other asked them to do so through a computer.</seg>
          <seg id="17">At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to share similarly and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.</seg>
          <seg id="18">In both cases, there was a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually on video.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher on ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.</seg>
          <seg id="20">In his opinion, as part of a thinking activity, people often look at their surroundings to help them create ideas, while in a video session, thinking converges on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.</seg>
          <seg id="21">"When the people in that room look around them and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can awaken new associations in them.</seg>
          <seg id="22">In contrast, the research shows that computer-based relationships change our attention so that we are more focused on the inside and the screen, and this way reduces innovation and the creation of ideas through looking at the environment and thinking out. "</seg>
          <seg id="23">No harm to critical thinking.</seg>
          <seg id="24">However, before managers run the employees back to the offices, the researchers note that "working through a computer did not harm productivity itself nor people's critical thinking about innovative proposals when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas.</seg>
          <seg id="25">In other words, the harm is focused solely on creativity and not on other forms of computer work. "</seg>
          <seg id="26">Professor Ellen Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also qualifies the findings.</seg>
          <seg id="27">"There's a difference between mere creativity, like new uses for Frisbee, and work solutions.</seg>
          <seg id="28">It's also possible that when employees are more relaxed after dating, or when they work from home, creativity will improve. "</seg>
          <seg id="29">Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson have also proposed a future study in which such meetings would be stopped for thinking situations and roaming the room to see how this activity would affect the final outcome.</seg>
          <seg id="30">Dr. Olson also suggested that, following the study, only brainstorming sessions would lead to employees returning to work, and as a general rule, he suggested not to be alarmed by a single study, but to carry out another study in the field.</seg>
          <seg id="31">"I wouldn't want employees to be forcibly returned and unhappy," he said.</seg>

          <seg id="3">הפתרון: ניהול נכון של מאגרי המים</seg>
          <seg id="4">מחקר חדש ומטריד שפורסם לאחרונה בכתב העת Earth’s Future, צופה כי עד שנת 2050 כמות המים הזמינים לחקלאות תקטן בכ-80% במידה וקצב צריכת המים וגידול אוכלוסיית העולם יישארו במגמות השימוש הנוכחיות שלהן.</seg>
          <seg id="5">במחקר, בו השתתפו מדענים מכל סוכנויות המדע בעולם, סיכמו המדענים את כלל כמות מי הגשמים, הנהרות ומקורות המים המתוקים בעולם והשוו אותה לצורך של האנושות בחקלאות.</seg>
          <seg id="6">מסקנות המחקר העגומות מראות כי נכון לעכשיו קצב צריכת המים מכפיל את עצמו שוב ושוב ב-10 השנים האחרונות, כאשר במקביל ההתחממות הגלובלית גורמת להתמעטות כמות הגשמים באזורים חקלאיים ברחבי העולם.</seg>
          <seg id="7">על פי שכלול נתוני המחקר, 84% מהקרקעות המיועדות לחקלאות בעולם יחוו מחסור כבד במי גשמים.</seg>
          <seg id="8">אחת המסקנות המרכזיות שעלו מהמחקר קוראת לחקלאים ברחבי העולם להתאים את החקלאות לשינויי האקלים ולעונות השנה, ולעבור לשיטות גידול שיקלו על המים לחדור לאדמה על מנת למנוע את תהליך אידוי המים שיוביל לבזבוז נרחב של מי גשמים.</seg>
          <seg id="9">כמו כן, החוקרים ממליצים לחקלאים העובדים בסמוך למקורות מים מלוחים, להשתמש בטכנולוגיות איסוף מי גשמים על מנת למנוע את זרימתם לים.</seg>

          <seg id="1">בדקנו: מה אומרות תופעות הלוואי שאחרי חיסון הקורונה?</seg>
          <seg id="2">אנשים רבים שמתחסנים מרגישים חולשה, חום ועייפות לאחר קבלת הזריקה, בעוד שאחרים אינם חשים בדבר •</seg>
          <seg id="3">האם זה יכול להצביע על מערכת חיסונית חזקה יותר של אלה שכן חווים תופעות אלו, או שמדובר בשמועה משוללת יסוד?</seg>
          <seg id="4">בעוד יותר ויותר אנשים מתחסנים, ממשיך חוסר המידע על אודות תופעות הלוואי לבלבל וליצור שמועות, שרובן אינן נכונות.</seg>
          <seg id="5">האם המערכת החיסונית של אלה שפיתחו תופעות לוואי חזקה יותר מאשר אלה שגופם הגיב פחות בחומרה לחיסון, מה שאולי יכול להוכיח שהמערכת שלהם לא מצליחה להיאבק בגוף זר שנכנס לגוף?</seg>
          <seg id="6">"יש כמה רמות של תגובות לחיסון", אומר ד"ר דוד דביר, ראש אגף רפואה ראשונית במאוחדת וחבר בוועדה המייעצת לצט"מ (צוות טיפול במגיפות), ומרגיע: "כאבי ראש, עייפות, כאבים במקום, אלו התגובות המיידיות של מערכת החיסון.</seg>
          <seg id="7">כך הגוף מגיב בכניסה של גוף זר למערכת".</seg>
          <seg id="8">יש קשר בין רמות הנוגדנים שמפתחים לתופעות הלוואי?</seg>
          <seg id="9">"אין קורלציה בין התחושות לפיתוח נוגדנים נגד הווירוס.</seg>
          <seg id="10">כ־60%-50% חשים בתופעות הלוואי, אבל כ־90% מפתחים הגנה נגד הווירוס.</seg>
          <seg id="11">לא נמצא שאנשים שפיתחו תגובות חזקות מוגנים יותר".</seg>
          <seg id="12">"בספרות הרפואית לא מופיעה קורלציה בין תגובה מיידית לרמת החיסון.</seg>
          <seg id="13">בחלק מהניסויים שבהם אנשים קיבלו גם חיסוני פלצבו, כרבע מהם פיתחו כאבי ראש.</seg>
          <seg id="14">זהו גם מרכיב נפשי - איך האדם תופס את החיסון, אם הוא מצפה שיהיו תופעות לוואי.</seg>
          <seg id="15">הרבה מהתופעות שקורות יכלו לקרות גם באופן רגיל, אבל מכיוון שהציבור חוסן הוא מייחס את התגובה לחיסון עצמו, וזו הטייה שרואים בנוגע לחיסונים באופן כללי - ייחוס של תופעות שקורות בסמוך לחיסון ומיוחסות אליו".</seg>
          <seg id="16">לפי ד"ר דביר, הסיבות לתופעות הרווחות המדווחות, כמו חולשה וכאבי ראש, אינן ידועות עדיין.</seg>
          <seg id="17">בנוגע לדלקת שריר הלב (מיוקרדיטיס), הדעות חלוקות.</seg>
          <seg id="18">"יש כל מיני תיאוריות בנושא, אבל יש לציין שהווירוס עצמו גורם לשיעורים גבוהים יותר של מיוקרדיטיס מאשר החיסון.</seg>
          <seg id="19">אחת התיאוריות היא שזו תגובה חזקה של מערכת החיסון".</seg>
          <seg id="20">יש בכלל אפשרות להעריך חוזק של מערכת חיסון?</seg>
          <seg id="21">"כשחשפו סטודנטים לנגיף השפעת, הראו שאלה שלא ישנו או שהיו בלחץ גבוה יותר היו יותר פגיעים להידבקות.</seg>
          <seg id="22">מלבד זאת, יש פרמטרים מעבדתיים שבודקים את המערכת החיסונית או את המרכיבים שלה.</seg>
          <seg id="23">כשיש ירידה במערכת החיסון, רואים את זה מייד.</seg>
          <seg id="24">אנשים חוטפים הרבה מחלות ויראליות או זיהומיות.</seg>
          <seg id="25">זה לא שמישהו מסתובב עם מערכת חיסונית חלשה ולא מודע לזה.</seg>
          <seg id="26">אלה אנשים שמגיעים לבירורים בגלל אירועים חוזרים ונשנים של מחלות זיהומיות, ומה שמשפיע על המערכת הם דברים בנאליים: לחץ, תזונה, שינה.</seg>
          <seg id="27">אגב, אנחנו גם לא רוצים מערכת חיסון חזקה מדי, כי היא יכולה לגרום למחלות אוטואימוניות".</seg>
          <seg id="28">בקרוב חיסוני MRNA יופיעו בהקשרים נוספים, וזאת הודות לידע הרב שהצטבר לגביהם בתקופה האחרונה.</seg>
          <seg id="29">"אין ספק שייסלל פתח לחיסונים אחרים מהסוג הזה.</seg>
          <seg id="30">בודקים את הטכנולוגיה הזו להרבה מאוד שימושים מעבר לחיסונים - לטיפולים במחלות אונקולוגיות, למשל.</seg>
          <seg id="31">היעילות שלהם היא שהחומר נשאר מעט מאוד זמן בגוף - נכנס, עושה את הפעולה שלו, ואז מתפרק.</seg>
          <seg id="32">הטכנולוגיה הזו לא חדשה, אבל היא קיבלה בוסט רציני בעקבות הצורך המאוד גדול בחיסון מהיר.</seg>
          <seg id="33">עכשיו, למשל, אנחנו יודעים שמרווח של שלושה שבועות בין מנה למנה הוא קטן מדי, וחלק ממומחי החיסונים טוענים שיכול להיות שאחרי מנה שלישית לא נצטרך עוד חיסון בטווח הקרוב, כך שלא ברור אם אנחנו הולכים למצב של חיסון מדי חצי שנה או שהמנה השלישית תיתן מרווח גדול יותר".</seg>

          <seg id="3">Could this indicate a stronger immune system of those who do experience these phenomena, or is it a baseless rumor?</seg>

          <seg id="2">The emerging conclusion for extended flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: the airline is planning to launch new flights to the Far East instead of destinations to Europe</seg>
          <seg id="3">The largest airline in Israel is planning significant changes prior to the arrival of US President, Joe Biden, to Israel.</seg>
          <seg id="4">As we published in “Israel HaYom”, it is estimated that Biden will announce granting of permission to El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly above Saudi Arabia towards other destinations besides the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The meaning of the emerging agreement is that El Al will be allowed to take shorter flight routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">To this end, the company will have to cancel flights of less profitable destinations, in order to use the planes to fly to these new destinations.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The destinations that the flights will be canceled to, as of November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.</seg>
          <seg id="8">The three destinations have sizable Jewish communities, however, at this stage, these are less profitable for the company.</seg>
          <seg id="9">On the other hand, the new destinations that El Al is considering are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.</seg>
          <seg id="10">This is how the move will be made: the Dreamliner planes that fly to Canada will be released in favor of long flights to the East.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The Boeing 737 planes that fly to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred to be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris, to which El Al operates flights using Dreamliner planes.</seg>
          <seg id="12">So basically the company will be able to release large planes to fly to more destinations in the East.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At the same time, El Al expects talks to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that the Israeli airlines will be able to return to flying to Turkey, as the company will be able to operate flights using the airline’s Boeing 737 aircrafts.</seg>

          <seg id="4">As we reported in Israel Today, the estimate is that Biden will announce the granting of permission to Al Ala and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the UAE.</seg>
          <seg id="5">What the deal means is that you can ask if you can fly shorter routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.</seg>
          <seg id="6">To do that, the company would have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations to divert planes to new destinations.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting next November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.</seg>
          <seg id="8">These are three destinations that have a sizeable Jewish population, but at this point they're less profitable to society.</seg>
          <seg id="9">By contrast, the new targets being examined by Al are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Here's how it's gonna work: Dreamliners flying to Canada will be released in favor of long-haul flights east.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Boeing 737s flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred to destinations such as London and Paris, to which Al operates flights using Dreamliners.</seg>
          <seg id="12">So basically, the company can unleash larger planes to fly to more destinations in the east.</seg>
          <seg id="13">At the same time, Ba'al expects discussions to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility of Israeli airlines being able to return to flying to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.</seg>

          <seg id="2">מחוסנים החוזרים ממדינות כתומות יחויבו בבידוד של 24 שעות •</seg>
          <seg id="3">המדינות ארה"ב, טורקיה, בריטניה ואיחוד האמירויות יוגדרו אדומות.</seg>
          <seg id="4">אחרי שבועות ארוכים שבהם היה קשה מאוד למצוא יעד שאליו ניתן לטוס בלי הגבלות, ולאחר שכל החוזרים מחו"ל חויבו בבידוד, לצד איסור כניסת תיירים לישראל - אתמול הוחלט לשנות את הנהלים ולהקל באופן משמעותי את ההגבלות על נתב"ג.</seg>
          <seg id="5">במשרד הבריאות החליטו להמליץ לבטל את חובת הבידוד למשך שלושה ימים לישראלים שחוזרים ממדינות כתומות.</seg>
          <seg id="6">עד כה, כל מחוסן או מחלים לפי הגדרות משרד הבריאות שחזר ממדינה כתומה - חויב בבידוד למשך שלושה ימים, בכפוף לשתי בדיקות קורונה.</seg>
          <seg id="7">כעת, הבידוד שיצטרכו להיכנס אליו המחוסנים והמחלימים שחוזרים ממדינות כתומות הוא ל־24 שעות לכל היותר, או עד קבלת התוצאות של בדיקות הקורונה שמבוצעות לאחר הנחיתה בנתב"ג (המוקדם מביניהם).</seg>
          <seg id="8">מי שלא מוגדר מחוסן או מחלים יחויב בכל זאת להיכנס לשבעה ימי בידוד בכפוף לשתי בדיקות קורונה, או 14 ימים ללא הבדיקה השנייה, גם אם חזר ממדינה כתומה וגם אם חזר ממדינה אדומה.</seg>
          <seg id="9">מחוסן או מחלים שחזר ממדינה אדומה חייב גם הוא בבידוד מלא.</seg>
          <seg id="10">רשימת המדינות האדומות העדכנית שעליה המליץ משרד הבריאות, ושעדיין צריכה לעבור את אישור הממשלה, כוללת את ארה"ב, טורקיה, טנזניה, אתיופיה, מקסיקו, בריטניה, שווייץ ואיחוד האמירויות.</seg>
          <seg id="11">בכל המדינות, למעט טורקיה, ממוצע החיוביים שנכנסו לארץ בשבועיים האחרונים הוא יותר מ־5% מסך כלל הנכנסים, מה שמכניס אותן באופן אוטומטי לרשימת המדינות האדומות.</seg>
          <seg id="12">קצב העלייה בקרב החולים מטורקיה הוא מהיר, שיעור החוזרים החיוביים ממנה עומד על קצת יותר מ־4%, ולכן הוחלט להכניס גם אותה לרשימת המדינות האדומות.</seg>
          <seg id="13">המדינות הבולטות שיוסרו מרשימת המדינות האדומות: צרפת, ספרד, פורטוגל וקנדה.</seg>
          <seg id="14">בתוך כך, החל מ־9 בינואר, תיירים שמחוסנים לפי דרישות משרד הבריאות יוכלו להיכנס לישראל ללא צורך בבידוד, ובדומה לתנאים של ישראלים שחוזרים ממדינה כתומה.</seg>
          <seg id="15">גם במקרה הזה, ההחלטה כפופה לאישור הממשלה, שתדון בנושא בימים הקרובים.</seg>
          <seg id="16">חשוב לציין שמעטים המקרים שבהם הממשלה לא מאשרת את המלצות משרד הבריאות בתחום זה.</seg>
          <seg id="17">התיירנים נגד ההגבלות.</seg>
          <seg id="18">התאחדות משרדי הנסיעות, המטה לשמיים פתוחים והתאחדות המלונות הגישו עתירה לבג"ץ כדי לבטל את ההגבלות על הטסים.</seg>
          <seg id="19">המדינה הסירה את רוב ההגבלות אתמול, אך כאמור השאירה שמונה מדינות משמעותיות ברשימת המדינות האדומות.</seg>
          <seg id="20">בדיון שיתקיים הבוקר בירושלים, צפויים העותרים לדרוש מהמדינה לבטל את רשימת המדינות האדומות.</seg>
          <seg id="21">מי שיתמוך בעמדת העותרים הוא פרופ' איתמר גרוטו, שצפוי להיות נוכח בדיון.</seg>
          <seg id="22">שר התיירות יואל רזבוזוב, שתמך בשבועות האחרונים בהקלות בכל מה שקשור להכנסת תיירים זרים לישראל, אמר אתמול: "ביטול הבידוד למחוסנים החוזרים מחו"ל וחזרת התיירות למחוסנים הם הדבר הנכון והצודק בתקופה זו.</seg>
          <seg id="23">אני מודה לחבריי לממשלה, שהבינו את מצוקת תעשיית התיירות והסכימו איתי שהנזק עולה על התועלת.</seg>
          <seg id="24">החיסון הוא המענה הטוב ביותר למגיפה, וככזה - מגיע לציבור המחוסנים לנהל שגרת חיים מאפשרת לצד הקורונה".</seg>

          <seg id="4">After long weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which one could fly without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were ordered to quarantine, along with a ban on the entry of tourists into Israel—yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on traffic.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The Ministry of Health decided to recommend canceling the mandatory isolation for three days for Israelis returning from orange countries.</seg>
          <seg id="6">So far, anyone vaccinated or recovering according to the definitions of the Ministry of Health who returned from an orange state—was required to be isolated for three days, subject to two corona tests.</seg>

          <seg id="7">Now, the isolation that vaccinators and recuperators returning from orange countries will have to enter is for a maximum of 24 hours, or until the results of coronavirus tests performed after landing at the airport (whichever comes first).</seg>
          <seg id="8">Those who are not defined as vaccinated or recovering will nevertheless be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two coronavirus tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if returned from an orange state and if returned from a red state.</seg>
          <seg id="9">A vaccinated or recuperator returning from a red state must also be in complete isolation.</seg>
          <seg id="10">The latest list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, and which still need to pass government approval, includes the U.S., Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In all countries, except Turkey, the average of positives entering the country in the last two weeks is more than 5% of total arrivals, which automatically puts them on the list of red countries.</seg>
          <seg id="12">The rate of increase in patients from Turkey is rapid, the rate of positive recidivism is just over 4%, so it was decided to put it on the list of red countries as well.</seg>
          <seg id="13">The most prominent countries to be removed from the list of red states: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.</seg>
          <seg id="14">As of January 9, tourists vaccinated under the requirements of the Ministry of Health will be able to enter Israel without the need for isolation, and similar to the conditions of Israelis returning from an orange country.</seg>
          <seg id="15">In this case, too, the decision is subject to approval by the government, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.</seg>
          <seg id="16">It is important to note that there are few cases where the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.</seg>
          <seg id="17">The purists are against the restrictions.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The Travel Office Association, the Headquarters for Open Skies and the Hotel Association submitted a petition to the High Court to overturn the restrictions on flying.</seg>
          <seg id="19">The state lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but as stated left eight significant states on the list of red states.</seg>
          <seg id="20">At a hearing to be held in Jerusalem this morning, petitioners are expected to demand that the state revoke the list of red states.</seg>
          <seg id="21">The one who will support the petitioners' position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Tourism Minister Yoel Razvozov, who in recent weeks supported easing in everything related to the introduction of foreign tourists to Israel, said yesterday: “Eliminating isolation for vaccinated people returning from abroad and the return of tourism to the vaccinated are the right and just thing during this period.</seg>
          <seg id="23">I thank my friends in government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the harm outweighed the benefit.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Vaccination is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to conduct an enabling routine alongside the coronavirus.”</seg>
