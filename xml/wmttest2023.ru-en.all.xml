          <seg id="1">Июльский номер традиционно сдается во время Московского кинофестиваля, и это, конечно, очень грустно: вычитывать полосы, когда душа рвется на Шаброля.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Тем не менее об ММКФ мы расскажем в следующий раз (пока только пожалуюсь, что в этом году в сознании организаторов окончательно укрепилось необъяснимое представление о том, что счастливые обладатели купленных билетов в разы важнее для фестиваля, чем аккредитованные гости, смехотворный и вполне оскорбительный принцип, которым не грешит ни один нормальный кинофестиваль мира), а в этом номере отчитываемся за увиденное в Каннах и на «Кинотавре».</seg>
          <seg id="3">Обложку июльского номера украшает очередное приятное лицо - заглавный персонаж спродюсированной Робертом Родригесом картины «Хищники», а внутри журнала уж постарайтесь как-нибудь не пропустить рассказ о «Начале» Кристофера Нолана (человека, между прочим, перезагрузившего «Бэтмена...»), самом - без дураков — ожидаемом фильме лета.</seg>
          <seg id="4">А еще мы в этот раз публикуем первую часть довольно подробного гида по творчеству Альфреда Хичкока, и вот тут уж точно не нужно ничего специально рекламировать, и ежу понятно, что автор «Подозрения» и «Веревки» - это наше Татьяна Алешичева, Борис Глейзеров, Анна Головня, Ник Де Семлин, Дэн Джолин, Тамара Дондурей, Николай Караев, Денис Корсаков, Мария Кувшинова, Иван Куликов, Уилл Лоуренс, Сергей Мезенов, Сергей Натапов, Иан Нейтан, Ким Ньюмэн, Заира Озова, Нев Пирс, Алексей Простяков, Серафима Скибюк, Адам Смит, Мур Соболева, Василий Степанов, Александр Стрелков, Олли Ричардс, Олег Тищенков, Алена Логунова, Крис Хьюитт, Ольга Шакина лондинку-цэрэушницу Эвелин Солт, несмотря на блестящий послужной список, заподозрили в шпионаже в пользу русских и решили во что бы то ни стало изловить.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Загнанная в угол, она перекрасится в привычный нам черный и сама отправится искать правду.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Очередной боевик с Анджелиной Джоли в роли роковой бой-бабы обещает еще сильнее закрепить позиции актрисы в жанре экшн.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Она будет устраивать одно ДТП за другим, бегать по стенам а-ля «Матрица» и как детей раскидывать крепких мужиков в одинаковых строгих костюмах.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Примерно так красота и должна спасать мир.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Вот он, родной, взорвавший и починивший мир «Пятым элементом» и сделавший Миллу Йовович самой прекрасной женщиной во вселенной.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Брюс Уиллису него был самым супергеройским парнем, а Гари Олдман - самым стильным и безупречным воплощением Зла.</seg>
          <seg id="11">И при этом все вместе оказывалось не нудным блок-бастером американского типа про спасение человечества, а милейшим живым карнавалом.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Что делал Бессон 13 лет между «Элементом...» и «Аделью...» вспоминать не хочется.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Он, мягко говоря, без дела не сидел, но вся эта сценарно-продюсерская суета и редкие, вымученные режиссерские выступления забудутся.</seg>
          <seg id="14">А вот «Адель...» — едва ли.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Когда смотришь это кино, кажется, что 13 лет перед нами был не наш Бессон, а какой-то двойник.</seg>
          <seg id="16">А сам он, настоящий, жил в маленькой квартирке на Монмартре, попивал вино в кафе напротив и сочинял историю про обаятельнейшую искательницу приключений.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Пересказывать сюжет (пусть ивобщих чертах), подогревая ожидания, в данном случае грешно больше обычного.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Тут весь невероятный драйв заключается в том, что за каждым поворотом или репликой вас поджидают сюрпризы.</seg>
          <seg id="19">И все как один приятные.</seg>
          <seg id="20">То ли девушка, то ли видение</seg>
          <seg id="21">НЕОБЫЧАЙНЫЕ ПРИКЛЮЧЕНИЯ АДЕЛЬ</seg>
          <seg id="22">Самое лихое приключенческое кино десятилетия намекнуть, что «Необычайные приключения Адель» начнутся как «Амели», метнутся в сторону &lt;Парка Юрского периода», продолжатся «Индианой Джонсом» и «Мумией», а закончатся «Титаником».</seg>
          <seg id="23">В основе фильма - первый том комиксов Жака Тарди о журналистке Адель Блан-Сек.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Луиз Бургуэн до Адели снялась всего в трех фильмах.</seg>
          <seg id="25">Прославила актрису ее роль в «Девушке из Монако», за которую она была номинирована на премию «Сезар».</seg>
          <seg id="26">Режиссер не бежит за зрителем с протянутой рукой, умоляя оценить спецэффекты, декорации или трюки, а увлекает за собой, как старомодный романист, восклицающий пред большим путешествием к центру земли или на край света: «Вперед, мой читатель, нас ждут великие дела!»</seg>
          <seg id="27">При этом Бессон обращается с жанровым кино, про которое знает решительно все, бесцеремонно и весело, как мальчишка, насмотревшийся старых фильмов и начитавшийся Жюля Верна.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Манипулируя банальностями, не отказывая себе в цинизме и не стесняясь риско</seg>
          <seg id="29">РЕЖИССЕР Люк Бессон</seg>
          <seg id="30">В РОЛЯХ: Луиз Бургузн, Матье Амальрик, Фредерик Бель, Жиль Лелуш</seg>
          <seg id="31">СЮЖЕТ: В Париже в 1912 году происходили странные вещи.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Город переполошило древнее чудовище, которое пробудил к жизни старый медиум.</seg>
          <seg id="33">За ископаемой тварью гоняется полиция, а также знаменитый охотник, пара ученых из музея естественной истории и журналистка Адель Блан-Сек, у которой есть дело не столько к самой зверюге, сколько к медиуму — ей необходимо спасти сестру.</seg>
          <seg id="34">С той же целью девушка тащит из Египта настоящую мумию.</seg>
          <seg id="35">ВЫХОДИТ 22 ИЮЛЯ</seg>
          <seg id="36">«Адель...» — тот случай, когда пародия становится вершиной самого жанра и способна радикально его изменить, направив по новому пути.</seg>
          <seg id="37">Так было со спагетти-вестернами Серджио Леоне, с гангстерскими боевиками Квентина Тарантино, с упомянутым «Индианой Джонсом» (ему тут и поклон сделали, и высмеяли), наконец, с тем же «Пятым элементом».</seg>
          <seg id="38">Стиль Бессона в этом фильме складывается из словесного трюкачества, актерской клоунады и сюжетной эквилибристики (цирковые термины вполне уместны - единение двух искусств здесь органично и крепко как никогда).</seg>
          <seg id="39">Пару слов надо сказать и про саму Адель.</seg>
          <seg id="40">В ней воплотился незаслуженно забытый типаж авантюристки, которая берет не столько эксплуатацией сексуальности, сколько чистейшим куражом и отвагой.</seg>
          <seg id="41">В кино к таким девушкам, как правило, приставляют какого-нибудь дежурного мачо или волоокого романтика</seg>
          <seg id="42">ТЕКСТ: АЛЕКСАНДР СТРЕЛКОВ</seg>
          <seg id="43">Лицом к лицу с историей</seg>
          <seg id="44">В наличии лишь робкий и комичный воздыхатель, который только вертится под ногами (полезными оказываются лишь его познания в зоологии).</seg>
          <seg id="45">Поэтому энергичная девушка не тратит времени на амурные пустяки, а весело проводит время в обществе древних трупов, которые, кстати, играют в сюжете ключевую роль.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Натренированный на многочисленных жанровых «кошках» и, казалось, совсем скисший Люк Бессон проявил неожиданную творческую лихость, напомнив, что граница между предпочтениями скучающих посетителей мегамоллов и высоколобых завсегдатаев арт-хаусных залов легко преодолевается фильмами для жизнерадостных безумцев.</seg>
          <seg id="47">Игра в приключенческое кино без печали, страха и упрека</seg>
          <seg id="48">КОМНАТА СМЕРТИ</seg>
          <seg id="49">Герметичный хоррор с претензией на психологизм и политический контекст 2002 году дебютный ужастик Джонатана Либесмана был разруган критикой, но понравился публике и хорошо заработал в прокате, а главное - попался на глаза продюсеру Майклу Бэю.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="1">Traditionally, the July issue is submitted while the Moscow Film Festival is underway, which is, of course, quite tragic — having to proofread columns when your heart is yearning for Chabrol.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Nonetheless, we'll write about the Moscow International Film Festival in the next issue (for now, I'll only complain that this year the organizers have definitively latched onto the inexplicable idea that the lucky holders of purchased tickets are far more important to the festival than accredited guests — a laughable and entirely offensive principle which not a single respectable international film festival upholds), and that in this issue we report on the films we saw at Cannes and Kinotavr.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The cover of the July issue is adorned, as usual, with a pleasant face — that of the protagonist from the film Predators produced by Robert Rodriguez — and inside the magazine, we urge you not to somehow miss the story about Christopher Nolan's Inception (the same man, by the way, who relaunched Batman), which is the most (without exaggeration) anticipated film of the summer.</seg>
          <seg id="4">In addition, in this issue we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock. And here there's no need to advertise anything: it doesn't take a film buff to know the creator of Suspicion and Rope. Despite his outstanding credentials, our team — Tatyana Alishicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolie, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karayev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mezenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Aleksei Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mur Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Aleksandr Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tischenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Ahakina, and London FBI agent Eveline Solt — suspect him of spying for the Russians and have decided to catch him, whatever it takes.</seg>
          <seg id="5">After being backed into a corner, she dresses in the black garb we're all familiar with and goes off to search out the truth.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Another shooter starring Angelina Jolie in the role of a rough-and-tumble femme fatale further cements her reputation as an actress in the action genre.</seg>
          <seg id="7">She causes one traffic accident after the next, running up walls à la Matrix and throwing muscular men dressed in identical, severe uniforms around like dolls.</seg>
          <seg id="8">When Doestoevsky said "Beauty will save the world," this is what he meant.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Her it is: our dear old world of The Fifth Element, blown apart and then restored, which made Milla Jovovich into the most fabulous woman in the universe.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Its Bruce Willis was the most super of heroes, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and unimpeachable of Evil's incarnations.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Meanwhile, all of this turned out not to be a boring American blockbuster about saving humanity, but a most enjoyable carnival of delights.</seg>
          <seg id="12">It's best not to recall what Besson did in the 13 years between "Element" and "Adèle."</seg>
          <seg id="13">He kept busy, to put it lightly, but all of his busywork as a producer and scenarist, as well as his occasional appearances as a director, will be forgotten.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Meanwhile, "Adèle" is not likely to be.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Watching it, it seems as if over the past 13 years we haven't been seeing Besson, but rather some kind of double.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Meanwhile he, the real Besson, was living in a tiny apartment in Montmarte, drinking wine at the cafe across the street and composing the story of a most charming adventure-seeking lady.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Recounting the plot (even in general terms) in order to whet our audience's appetite is even more of a sin than usual.</seg>
          <seg id="18">The incredible drive of the film is contained in the fact that a surprise awaits you behind every turn and in every spoken response.</seg>
          <seg id="19">And each one as just as wonderful as the last.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Whether it's a girl or a ghost</seg>
          <seg id="21">THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADÈLE BLANC-SEC</seg>
          <seg id="22">We'll hint that the most wild adventure film of the decade, The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec, starts like Amelie, swerves off in the direction of Jurassic Park, continues on in the spirit of Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and ends like Titanic.</seg>
          <seg id="23">The basis of the film is the first volume of comics by Jacques Tardi about the journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Before Adèle, Louise Bourgoin starred in only three films.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The actress was made famous by her role in La Fille de Monaco, for which she was nominated for a César Award.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The director doesn't chase after the viewer with hand outstretched, begging them to appreciate the special effects, sets, or stunts, but is rather like a classical novelist calling out before a great adventure to the center of the Earth or to the edge of the world, "Onward, reader, great things await us!"</seg>
          <seg id="27">Besson navigates genre films (about which he knows absolutely everything) joyously and without ceremony, like a little boy raised on old films and Jules Verne.</seg>
          <seg id="28">He plays with tropes, allows himself some cynicism, and isn't afraid of risks</seg>
          <seg id="29">DIRECTOR Luc Besson</seg>
          <seg id="30">STARRING: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frédérique Bel, Gilles Lellouche</seg>
          <seg id="31">PLOT: Strange things happened in Paris in 1912.</seg>
          <seg id="32">The city has been sent into commotion by an ancient creature that has been brought to life by an old psychic medium.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The police chase after the ancient monster along with a renowned hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History, and the journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec, who is less interested in the creature itself than in the medium — the reason being that she needs to save her sister.</seg>
          <seg id="34">With this goal in mind, the young woman drags a real mummy out of Egypt.</seg>
          <seg id="35">IN THEATERS JULY 22</seg>
          <seg id="36">Adèle is one of those cases when a parody becomes the apotheosis of the genre itself, and is capable of radically changing the genre and pointing it in a new direction.</seg>
          <seg id="37">The same thing happened with the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, the gangster action films of Quentin Tarantino, Indiana Jones, which is alluded to (both homage is given and jokes are made), and, finally, The Fifth Element itself.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Besson's style in this film is composed of linguistic showmanship, actorly clowning, and a balancing act of plot (circus terms are quite apt — the marriage of the two art forms in the film is stronger and more organic than ever).</seg>
          <seg id="39">A couple words must also be said about Adèle herself.</seg>
          <seg id="40">She exemplifies the undeservedly forgotten type character of the adventure-seeking young woman, who achieves her goals not so much through exploiting her sexuality as though pure panache and courage.</seg>
          <seg id="41">Usually in films this type of woman is set against some kind of standard machismo or doe-eyed romanticism</seg>
          <seg id="42">SCREENPLAY: ALEKSANDR STRELKOV</seg>
          <seg id="43">Face-to-face with history</seg>
          <seg id="44">Only a timid and comical admirer is present, who always gets in the way (only his knowledge of zoology ends up proving useful).</seg>
          <seg id="45">For this reason, the young woman doesn't waste her energy on amorous trifles and instead happily spends her time in the company of ancient corpses which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Having trained himself on a long string of "low-hanging" genre films and having, so it seemed, gone completely stale, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative daring, reminding us that the barrier between the tastes of bored megamall cinema attendees and high-minded art-house film fanatics can be easily overcome by movies made for life-loving weirdos.</seg>
          <seg id="47">The game of adventure films is without sadness, fear, or reproach</seg>
          <seg id="48">THE KILLING ROOM</seg>
          <seg id="49">Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film, a claustrophobic thriller with attempts made at psychology and the political context of 2002, was berated by critics but liked by the public. It performed well at the box office and, most importantly, ended up in front of producer Michael Bay.</seg>

          <seg id="1">The July issue is traditionally handed in during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: proofreading pages when the soul longs to be at Chabrol.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Nevertheless, we will talk about the MMKF next time (for now, I will just complain that this year, in the minds of the organizers, the inexplicable idea that the happy owners of purchased tickets are much more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle, which no normal film festival in the world is guilty of), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at "Kinotavr".</seg>

          <seg id="5">Cornered, she will dye herself in the familiar black and set out to seek the truth herself.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Another action film with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal femme fatale promises to further strengthen the actress's position in the action genre.</seg>
          <seg id="7">She will be causing one accident after another, running on walls à la "Matrix" and tossing around burly men in identical strict suits like children.</seg>
          <seg id="8">This is roughly how beauty should save the world.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Here he is, the native, who exploded and repaired the world with "The Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Bruce Willis was the most superhero-like guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.</seg>
          <seg id="11">And yet, all together, it turned out not to be a boring American-style blockbuster about saving humanity, but the most charming live carnival.</seg>
          <seg id="12">One doesn't want to recall what Besson was doing for 13 years between "The Fifth Element..." and "Adèle...".</seg>
          <seg id="13">He, to put it mildly, was never idle, but all this script-producing hustle and rare, strained directorial performances will be forgotten.</seg>
          <seg id="14">But "Adele..." - hardly likely.</seg>

          <seg id="21">THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADEL</seg>
          <seg id="22">The most daring adventure film of the decade hints that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele" will start like "Amelie", veer towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".</seg>
          <seg id="23">The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Louise Bourgoin only appeared in three films before Adèle.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The actress gained fame for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for a César Award.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The director does not chase after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to appreciate the special effects, decorations or tricks, but draws them in, like an old-fashioned novelist, exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the edge of the world: "Forward, my reader, great deeds await us!"</seg>
          <seg id="27">In doing so, Besson approaches genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, with a carefree and cheerful attitude, like a boy who has watched old movies and read a lot of Jules Verne.</seg>
          <seg id="28">Manipulating banalities, not denying oneself cynicism and not being afraid of risk.</seg>
          <seg id="29">DIRECTOR Luc Besson</seg>
          <seg id="30">CAST: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frederic Bel, Gilles Lellouche</seg>
          <seg id="31">PLOT: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.</seg>
          <seg id="32">The city was thrown into chaos by an ancient monster, awakened by an old medium.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The police, a famous hunter, a pair of scientists from the natural history museum, and journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec are all chasing after the fossil creature. Adèle is more concerned with a medium than the beast itself, as she needs to save her sister.</seg>
          <seg id="34">With the same goal, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.</seg>
          <seg id="35">RELEASES ON JULY 22</seg>
          <seg id="36">"Adèle..." is a case where parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is capable of radically changing it, directing it on a new path.</seg>
          <seg id="37">This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino's gangster action films, the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (they both paid tribute to and mocked him here), and finally, with "The Fifth Element" itself.</seg>
          <seg id="38">Besson's style in this film is composed of verbal trickery, actor's clowning, and plot acrobatics (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is as organic and strong as ever).</seg>
          <seg id="39">A few words need to be said about Adele herself.</seg>
          <seg id="40">In her, an undeservedly forgotten type of adventuress is embodied, who takes not so much by exploiting sexuality, but by sheer audacity and courage.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In movies, such girls are usually paired with some stereotypical macho man or hairy romantic.</seg>

          <seg id="45">Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but cheerfully spends time in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Luke Besson, trained on numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely jaded, showed unexpected creative audacity, reminding that the boundary between the preferences of bored visitors of mega-malls and high-browed regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.</seg>

          <seg id="29">Directed by Luc Besson.</seg>
          <seg id="30">This is the end of the world.</seg>
          <seg id="31">SUMMARY: Strange things were happening in Paris in 1912.</seg>
          <seg id="32">The city was terrorized by an ancient monster, brought back to life by an old medium.</seg>
          <seg id="33">The excavated creature is being pursued by the police as well as a famous hunter, a pair of scientists from the Natural History Museum, and journalist Adèle Blan-Sec, who has a case not so much with the monster itself as with the medium - she needs to save her sister.</seg>
          <seg id="34">For the same purpose, the girl smuggles a real mummy out of Egypt.</seg>
          <seg id="35">[ Man ] I want you to go.</seg>
          <seg id="36">Adele...  the case where the parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre and is able to radically change it by sending it in a new direction.</seg>
          <seg id="37">So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with the gangster fighters Quentin Tarantino, the above-mentioned "Indiana Jones" (who was both admired and ridiculed), and finally with the same "Fifth Element".</seg>
          <seg id="38">Besson's style in this film is made of verbal trickery, comedic clownry, and story-driven balancing (circus terms are quite appropriate - the union of the two arts is organic and stronger here than ever).</seg>
          <seg id="39">I need to say a few words about Adele herself.</seg>
          <seg id="40">She has become an undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality, but the sheer courage and courage.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In the movies, they usually have a macho on duty or a romantic with a big head</seg>
          <seg id="42">I just want to say...</seg>
          <seg id="43">Face to face with history</seg>
          <seg id="44">There is only a timid and comical sighing creature that is turning under your feet (only its knowledge of zoology is useful).</seg>
          <seg id="45">So the energetic girl doesn't waste time on amorous trifles but has a fun time in the company of ancient corpses, who, by the way, play a key role in the plot.</seg>
          <seg id="46">Trained in numerous genre "cats", and seemingly out-of-the-box, Luc Besson showed an unexpected creative flair by reminding the audience that the line between the preferences of the boring megamoll-goers and the tall-talking art house-goers is easily crossed by films for the buoyant madmen.</seg>
          <seg id="47">A game of adventure film without sadness, fear and blame</seg>
          <seg id="48">The room of death.</seg>
          <seg id="49">A hermetic horror with a claim to psychology and political context in 2002, Jonathan Libesman's horror debut was slammed by critics, but it was liked by the public and made a good profit at the box office, and most importantly - caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Nevertheless, we will tell you about MIFF next time (for now I will only complain that this year in the minds of the organizers the inexplicable idea that happy owners of purchased tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world sins in), and in this issue we report for what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.</seg>

          <seg id="4">And this time we publish the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here you certainly don't need to advertise anything specially, and it's a no brainer that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov,  Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant track record, was suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch her at all costs.</seg>

          <seg id="17">To retell the plot (albeit in general terms), warming up expectations, in this case is more sinful than usual.</seg>

          <seg id="4">And also this time we publish the first part of a fairly detailed guide on the creativity of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is certainly not necessary to advertise anything specifically, and it is clear that the author of "Suspicion" and "Ropes" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolay Karayev, Denis K Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaire Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hugh Olga Shakina, the London-born Evelyn Salt, despite her brilliant record, was suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch whatever it took.</seg>

          <seg id="27">At the same time, Besson treats the genre of cinema, about which he knows everything decisively, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who watched old films and read Jules Verne.</seg>

          <seg id="1">The July issue is traditionally rented out during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: subtracting the stripes when the soul breaks for Chabrol.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Nevertheless, we will tell you about the Moscow International Film Festival next time (so far I will only complain that this year an inexplicable idea has finally strengthened in the minds of the organizers that the happy owners of purchased tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and completely offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world sins), and in this issue we report for what we saw in Cannes and on Kinotavr.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the title character of the film "Predators" produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about "The Beginning" by Christopher Nolan (a man who, by the way, rebooted "Batman"...), the most - without fools - the expected film of the summer.</seg>
          <seg id="4">And this time we are also publishing the first part of a rather detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here it is certainly not necessary to specifically advertise anything, and it is clear to the hedgehog that the author of "Suspicions" and "Ropes" - this is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurei, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina Londinku-Tsereushnitsa Evelyn Salt, despite the brilliant track record, they were suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch it at all costs.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Cornered, she will repaint in her usual black and go looking for the truth herself.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Another action movie with Angelina Jolie as a fatal boy-woman promises to further consolidate the actress's position in the action genre.</seg>
          <seg id="7">She will arrange one accident after another, run along the walls a la "Matrix" and how to scatter strong men in the same strict suits.</seg>
          <seg id="8">This is how beauty should save the world.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Here he is, dear, who blew up and repaired the world with the "Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.</seg>
          <seg id="11">And at the same time, all together turned out to be not a boring American-type block buster about the salvation of mankind, but the cutest living carnival.</seg>
          <seg id="12">What Besson did for 13 years between Element... and Adele... I don't want to remember.</seg>
          <seg id="13">He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this script and production fuss and rare, tortured directorial performances will be forgotten.</seg>
          <seg id="14">But "Adele..." -Hardly.</seg>
          <seg id="15">When you watch this movie, it seems that 13 years before us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.</seg>
          <seg id="16">And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe opposite and composed a story about a charming adventurer.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Retelling the plot (albeit in general terms), warming up expectations, in this case it is sinful more than usual.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Here the whole incredible drive lies in the fact that surprises await you at every turn or cue.</seg>

          <seg id="21">ADELE'S EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES</seg>
          <seg id="22">The most dashing adventure movie of the decade hint that "Adele's Extraordinary Adventures" will begin as "Amelie," rush towards &lt; Jurassic Park," continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy," and end with "Titanic."</seg>
          <seg id="23">The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Louise Bourgoin appeared in only three films before Adele.</seg>
          <seg id="25">The actress became famous for her role in "The Girl from Monaco," for which she was nominated for the Cesar Award.</seg>
          <seg id="26">The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to appreciate special effects, scenery or tricks, but carries along with him, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a big journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: "Forward, my reader, great things await us!"</seg>
          <seg id="27">At the same time, Besson deals with genre cinema, about which he knows everything decisively, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has seen enough old films and read Jules Verne.</seg>

          <seg id="37">So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster action movies, with the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (he was bowed and ridiculed here), and finally with the same "Fifth Element."</seg>
          <seg id="38">Besson's style in this film consists of verbal stunts, acting clowning and plot balancing (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is more organic and strong than ever).</seg>
          <seg id="39">A few words must be said about Adele herself.</seg>
          <seg id="40">It embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer, who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality as the purest courage and courage.</seg>
          <seg id="41">In the cinema, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of duty macho or hair romance</seg>

          <seg id="1">Так молодой режиссер попал на фабрику, кующую новые ужасы по старым лекалам: Бэй задался целью переснять в виде ремейков всю классику хоррора и поручил Либесману приквел «Техасской резни бензопилой» (2006).</seg>
          <seg id="2">Критика снова скривилась, но публике опять понравилось — Либесман сработал в духе «новых страшных», делающих упор на чрезмерную физиологичность насилия.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Вообще, на его примере можно наблюдать, как мечется в конвульсиях целый жанр, пытаясь изобрести новые способы воздействия на пресыщенную публику: натуралистичная кровища сплэттеров сливается с догонялками слэшеров.</seg>

          <seg id="1">That's how the young director ended up in the factory where he's been pounding new horror films out of old material: Bay set the goal of filming remakes of all the classic horror movies and tasked Liebesman with a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).</seg>
          <seg id="2">Critics once again grimaced, and the public once again liked it: Liebesman worked in the spirit of "new horror," putting emphasis on the exaggerated physicality of violence.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Generally speaking, it is an example of how the whole genre is undergoing convulsions trying to invent new ways to affect an overly sated public — the naturalistic bloodbath of splatter films is mixed in with the chase scenes of slasher films.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="4">The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, only without the liters of blood.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Among its prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut film Cube. That film was not with Michael Bay.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="6">And so, in The Killing Room, Liebesman was forced to go a different way. Instead of scenes of mindless slaughter or monotonous fleeing from a maniac, he showed preference for a smarter approach — without the famed bloodbaths, but instead with psychological games and riddles.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="7">In this film, evil doctors play cat-and-mouse with experimental subjects.</seg>
          <seg id="8">And three men inside a locked room try to work out a strategy to survive: Should they join together as a team or shoot each other?</seg>
          <seg id="9">Should they play by the rules and obey orders from outside?</seg>
          <seg id="10">Or should they try to break out of their cage at any cost?</seg>
          <seg id="11">They are not undergoing the test alone — so is a young, ambitious special agent who the experienced professor, who has been learning from savage experiments, is testing for her ruthlessness.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">STORY: In exchange for 250 dollars, four volunteers sign up to take a simple test.</seg>
          <seg id="13">They are placed in an isolated room and each is given a bundle of papers with nonsensical questions.</seg>
          <seg id="14">A polite man then enters the room in a white robe, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the subjects in the head.</seg>
          <seg id="15">A game for survival begins, which is carefully observed from behind glass by government agents.</seg>

          <seg id="10">Понятно, что причиной смены курса стало не чувство меры авторов, а вопиющая асексуальность главного героя, каковая в свою очередь продиктована нежеланием как бы то ни было касаться темы педофилии.</seg>
          <seg id="11">За «взрослую» часть здесь, помимо основной коллизии одинокого отцовства, отвечает довольно жесткий черный юмор (которым, хочется думать, мы обязаны режиссеру Коффину).</seg>
          <seg id="12">В целом, это очень симпатичное кино - настолько, что в какой-то момент оказывается даже слишком совершенным и правильным.</seg>

          <seg id="35">Понятно, разумеется, что Джейкобсон и его банда, снимая эту трэш-пародию, веселились от души, но сама по себе задача кажется довольно странной.</seg>

          <seg id="9">Despicable Me is, quite possibly, his team's best work yet: the film is beautifully animated (it is, by the way, worth watching even if you're 30 — especially if you like it when objects occasionally try to jump out of the screen and into the theater), intelligently written, and, most importantly, is without a single "below-the-belt" joke of the type that, in Ice Age, makes you to press yourself into your chair out of embarrassment and cover your kids' ears with your hands.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Given, the reason behind this change in direction was not the writers' good sense, but rather the protagonist's extreme asexuality which, in turn, was dictated by a desire to, no matter what, avoid the topic of pedophilia.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The "adult" part of the film, aside from the basic conflict of single fatherhood, is provided by the rather harsh dark humor (for which, one would like to think, we are indebted to director Coffin).</seg>

          <seg id="1">Несколько отпетых головорезов во главе с хлипким на вид Ройсом (Эдриен Броуди) загадочным образом оказываются на другой планете, где на них открывают спортивную охоту стильные клыкастые инопланетяне.</seg>
          <seg id="2">Возвращение культового персонажа 80-х на большой экран.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="3">Обратите внимание на Джорджа Клуни, который объединился с рок-фотографом-ныне-режиссером Антоном Корбайном («Контроль») для весьма любопытного экзистенциального исследования психологии стареющего наемного убийцы, прячущегося от людей в небольшом итальянском городке и сзапозданием постигающего человеческую природу.</seg>
          <seg id="4">«Художник-визионер масштаба Корбайна и великолепный Джордж Клуни - это киносоюз, заключенный на небесах», — хвастается студийный пресс-релиз.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Кроме того, этот проект — еще одно подтверждение самых долгих любовных отношений в жизни Клуни - с Италией: съемки проходили в живописном городке Кастель-дель-Монте в Абруццо.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Взяв за основу роман Мартина Бута «Очень скрытный джентльмен», Роуэн Джоффе внес в свой сценарий кое-какие коррективы: место рассказчика-англичанина занял вынесенный в заглавие американец, а из оружейника-нелегала главный герой превратился в простого убийцу.</seg>
          <seg id="7">В остальном история близка к оригиналу: пока киллер Джек пытается разобраться со своим последним делом и окончательно завязать с доходным ремеслом, его ледяное сердце тает под обаянием местного священника (Паоло Боначелли) и уличной проститутки (Текла Рютен), в которую персонаж Клуни моментально влюбляется.</seg>
          <seg id="8">«Джек искушает судьбу, - гласит официальный синопсис.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Опасный посланник тьмы приближается к нему все ближе и ближе, а загадочная дама, которая его нанимает, вполне может оказаться не той, за которую себя выдает».</seg>
          <seg id="10">Если судить по трейлеру, визуальные эксперименты Корбайна, приправленные пепельной шевелюрой Клуни (фильм похож на длинный клип 02), вышли на качественно новый уровень.</seg>

          <seg id="3">Тем не менее, место главной героини и новой возлюбленной героя Шайи ЛаБафа скорее всего займет английская модель Рози Хантингтон-Уитли.</seg>

          <seg id="5">Этот факт не должен пугать искушенного зрителя - в истории кинематографа есть масса примеров успешной переквалификации моделей в актрис.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Megan Fox has been fired from Transformers 3.</seg>
          <seg id="2">The film company Paramount ensures that the firing "is not related with the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."</seg>
          <seg id="3">That notwithstanding, the role of the lead female character and new girlfriend of protagonist Shia LeBeouf will likely be taken by English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.</seg>
          <seg id="4">The young woman has no experience in film, so she'll have to fast-track some acting master classes.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="5">But that fact shouldn't scare off tempted viewers: film history contains many examples of models successfully changing careers into acting.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Charlize Theron (Monster), Angelina Jolie (Girl, Interrupted), Jessica Lange (Blue Sky, Tootsie), Kim Basinger (L.A. Confidential), Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), Geena Davis (The Accidental Tourist), and the first runner-up of Miss USA 1986, Halle Berry (Monster's Ball) all started out as runway models or were photographed for fashion magazines and ended up winning well-earned Oscars.</seg>
          <seg id="7">The beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, what's especially pleasant, our own Olga Kurylenko, all found success in acting.</seg>
          <seg id="8">For them, the highest awards are clearly just a reach away.</seg>

          <seg id="12">Specifically, plans are already underway for the filming of an in-house series (about teenagers and vampires).</seg>

          <seg id="16">The film's secondary plot line has been further developed.</seg>
          <seg id="17">In the place of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the Moscow bride Nadya will be played by Milla Jovovich.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="2">Очумевшие от жесткого расписания, критики и кинематографисты на сверхскоростях носились меж сочинским Зимним театром, где проходили показы с мастер-классами, и гостиницей «Жемчужина», в которой потоком шли пресс-конференции и круглые столы, едва успевая нырнуть в Черное море.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Под стать вели себя и герои конкурсных фильмов - практически в каждом кто-то куда-то бежал: растерянные азиаты из «Гастарбайтера» Юсупа Разыкова и «Другого неба» Дмитрия Мамулии искали пропавших внука и жену, беглый бандит из картины Юрия Быкова «Жить»</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="4">Тех же ментов счастливо обводил вокруг пальца герой детектива Клима Шипенко «Кто я?» — который, впрочем, запомнился публике скорее присутствием в кадре тотально обнаженной Жанны Фриске.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Появились герои отечественного шоу-бизнеса и еще в паре конкурсных картин - в фильме «Слон» Сергей Шнуров сыграл дальнобойщика, везущего цирковое животное на убой, а Евгений Гришковец порассуждал на любимые темы - женское предательство, мужское одиночество, целительная сила алкоголя - в кинопостановке на двоих «Сатисфакция», где бизнес-партнеры вызывали друг друга на алкодуэль из-за дамы.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Впрочем, и деловые мероприятия на «Кинотавре» носили ощутимый отпечаток шоу — не было скучно ни на одном.</seg>
          <seg id="7">На круглом столе, посвященном судьбам российского артхауса, живописную свару с критиками устроил председатель фонда поддержки отечественного кино Сергей Толстиков: «Вы вообще читаете статьи в прессе, которые читаю я?» - грозно вопрошал он у собравшихся.</seg>
          <seg id="8">«Я их пишу», — растерянно отвечал президент ЕРВЕЗС! Андрей Плахов.</seg>
          <seg id="9">На этом скандалы не закончились: ближе к концу фестиваля из конкурсной программы внезапно сняли фильм Алексея Федорченко «Овсянки» - он поедет в Венецию: отборщики Мостры решили, что лишний российский показ им помеха.</seg>

They've hardly had time to take a plunge into the Black Sea.</seg>
          <seg id="3">The protagonists of the competing films behaved similarly: in almost every one, someone was running somewhere — frazzled Asians in Yusup Razykov's Gastarbaiter and Dmitry Mamuliya's Drugogo Neba searched out a lost grandson and wife, and a swift bandit runs around in Yury Bykov's Zhit.</seg>

          <seg id="10">Kinotavr never used to bother the giants: films from the large festivals have been shown in Sochi many times.

          <seg id="8">Второй раз подряд вы играете воображаемого персонажа.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Это случайность?</seg>
          <seg id="10">Закономерность.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Я была приятно удивлена, узнав, что представляю здесь (на «Кинотавре» и сочинском кинорынке - ЕМРБЕ) две картины.</seg>
          <seg id="12">И в обеих играю женщину-мечту.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Но... так увидел меня режиссер, так меня представил, и многим, наверное, кажется, что я такой являюсь в жизни.</seg>
          <seg id="14">Девочка-мечта.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Ваш партнер по фильму Александр Яценко совершенно не похож на своего героя.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Как вы находили общий язык? Каков он на площадке?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="17">Он абсолютно не такой, каким кажется на первый взгляд.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Сначала я увидела его и подумала: «Да... не просто мне придется».</seg>
          <seg id="19">Наверное, без человеческого контакта, искреннего и настоящего, у нас ничего бы не получилось.</seg>
          <seg id="20">И этот контакт у нас случился буквально через несколько минут после знакомства.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Мы здорово, не побоюсь этого слова, задружились.</seg>
          <seg id="22">Я ему рассказывала обо всех своих страхах, о всех переживаниях, о том, что я боюсь, что у меня не получится, и просила у него какого-то совета и помощи, и он с радостью этот совет и эту помощь мне давал.</seg>
          <seg id="23">Мы очень много говорили...</seg>
          <seg id="24">Я старалась это делать, потому что очень боялась утратить этот контакт, потерять наше взаимопонимание.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="25">И поэтому на премьере мы смотрели весь фильм держась за руки.</seg>

          <seg id="26">Как прошли съемки в Севастополе?</seg>
          <seg id="27">Севастополь - это город, в который я приехала в первый раз.</seg>
          <seg id="28">У меня никогда не было там гастролей, ни на отдых, ни в детстве я туда не приезжала.</seg>
          <seg id="29">Этот город обладает особой магией, каким-то своим характером, своей харизмой.</seg>
          <seg id="30">И это город, в который хочется вернуться.</seg>
          <seg id="31">Он имеет свое провинциальное обаяние.</seg>
          <seg id="32">Место, в котором никто никуда не торопится и всюду всегда успевает.</seg>
          <seg id="33">Получается, вам было несложно играть влюбленность в этот город.</seg>
          <seg id="34">Вообще, вы предельно органичны на экране, чего многие, откровенно говоря, не ожидали.</seg>
          <seg id="35">Как вы работаете с ролями?</seg>
          <seg id="36">Легко ли вам даются эмоциональные сцены?</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="37">Вы знаете, я же актер непрофессиональный.</seg>
          <seg id="38">И я очень, по натуре своей, доверчивый человек.</seg>
          <seg id="39">Если я пришла и согласилась работать с режиссером, то я, собственно, вверяюсь в его руки и мне хочется быть тестом, из которого будут лепить.</seg>
          <seg id="40">Я прекрасно понимаю, что со стороны видней, и я, опять же, прошу подсказок и разговариваю с режиссером, очень долго, даже не я с ним разговариваю, а он со мной ведет предварительные беседы и предельно четко и точно объясняет, что ему нужно.</seg>
          <seg id="41">А потом длинными многочасовыми репетициями мы приходим к той органике, о которой вы говорите.</seg>

          <seg id="23">We talked a lot...</seg>
          <seg id="24">I tried to do that because I was really afraid of losing that connection, of losing our mutual understanding.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="26">How was it filming in Sevastopol?</seg>
          <seg id="27">Sevastopol is a city I was visiting for the first time.</seg>
          <seg id="28">I'd never toured there, never vacationed there, and I'd never been there as a kid.</seg>
          <seg id="29">That city has a certain magic, it's own kind of character, it's own charisma.</seg>
          <seg id="30">And it's a city you want to go back to.</seg>
          <seg id="31">It has its own provincial charm.</seg>

          <seg id="37">You know, I'm not a professional actor.</seg>

          <seg id="39">If I show up and agree to work with a director, then, essentially, I'm entrusting myself to him and I want to be the clay that he uses to sculpt out of.</seg>

          <seg id="2">I just loved everyone — the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Because I love working with crazy people!</seg>
          <seg id="4">I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.</seg>
          <seg id="5">He was willing to go without sleep or food — and it was the same kind of situation here.</seg>
          <seg id="6">No sleep, no food for days on end, and it didn't matter, rain or shine.</seg>
          <seg id="7">If anything didn't pan out, it was a catastrophe and we had to immediately do something to make it work.</seg>
          <seg id="8">It's really easy for me to work in that kind of crazy atmosphere.</seg>
          <seg id="9">And it seems to me that when people are moved to the point of pathological fanaticism by what they do, there's just no way it won't work out, because just too much energy is being spent on it.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">I don't want it to be ridiculous — ridiculous dialog, films where nothing is said or people aren't wearing anything.</seg>
          <seg id="13">I don't want to work just for the sake of appearing on the screen yet again.</seg>

          <seg id="13">Пока мы работаем над ноябрьским номером, в Москве практически беспрерывно идут кинофестивали: американского кино - «Амфест», «2тогго\», на днях начнется “2-т-1”, за ним — фестиваль британского кино.</seg>
          <seg id="14">И вот что интересно: половина знакомых постоянно обсуждает, что кого-то необходимо бойкотировать, а кого-то поддерживать, по каким-то - ну, простите — очень смутным соображениям.</seg>
          <seg id="15">При этом, когда один из этих фестивалей торжественно закрывается ужасающего вида Чу4-проекцией без английских субтитров, никто вроде как ничего не замечает.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Меньше всего хочется по этому поводу брюзжать, но если вы, купив за деньги билет, остаетесь в зале смотреть на гигантские пиксели и горизонтальные фигуры актеров, то вам так и будут их показывать.</seg>
          <seg id="17">А вномере у нас между тем никаких пикселей: «Трон: Наследие» (продолжение классической картины о виртуальной реальности), «Впусти меня. Сага» (американский ремейк прекрасного шведского фильма), «Неуправляемый» (еще один подход Тони Скотта к теме поездов) и дико подробный рассказ о том, как создавались фильмы о Конане, варваре, разрушителе и губернаторе.</seg>

          <seg id="64">Новый фильм Дэвида Финчера - это, в первую очередь, история о парадоксе.</seg>
          <seg id="65">Картина повествует об изобретении Facebook, одном из инструментов-первопроходцев в сфере интернета, который объединил весь мир, рассорил пятерых друзей и сделал своего создателя - 26-летнего бывшего студента Гарварда Марка Цукерберга — самым молодым миллиардером последних десятилетий.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Джесси Айзенберг в главной роли так же великолепен, как и наш конфликтный гений, эмоционально изолированный социальный изгнанник с непредсказуемым набором мотиваций и привязанностей.</seg>
          <seg id="67">Цукерберг запускает сайт по целому ряду причин: отчасти из-за озлобленности на окружающий мир, отчасти из-за спортивного интереса и отчасти просто потому, что ЭТО «круто».</seg>
          <seg id="68">Сама задумка и ее реализация могут показаться стихийными и спонтанными, но действительный ход событий намекает на четкий расчет и продуманный бизнес-план.</seg>
          <seg id="69">Сильные стороны «Социальной сети» становятся очевидны с первых кадров, в особенности в сцене перед начальными титрами, где Цукерберг разговаривает в баре со своей без пяти минут экс-девушкой Эрикой (Мара): звонкие, жесткие диалоги сценариста Аарона Соркина набирают силу уже здесь и не смягчаются до самого финала.</seg>
          <seg id="70">То же и с режиссурой Финчера: сравнительно сдержанная (за исключением Близнецов Уинклвоссов сыграли непохожие друг на друга актеры.</seg>
          <seg id="71">Лицо одного из них при помощи компьютерной графики было наложено другому.</seg>
          <seg id="72">Одновременно с Цукербергом в Гарварде училась Натали Портман.</seg>
          <seg id="73">Руни Мара получила главную роль в следующем фильме Финчера «Девушка с татуировкой дракона».</seg>
          <seg id="74">РЕЖИССЕР Дэвид Финчер</seg>
          <seg id="75">В РОЛЯХ: Джесси Айзенберг, Эндрю Гарфилд, Руни Мара, Джастин Тимберлейк, Эрми Хаммер, Джошуа Пенс</seg>
          <seg id="76">СЮЖЕТ: Хмурый и замкнутый студент Гарварда Марк Цукерберг, получив на личном фронте от ворот поворот, берется за амбициозную задачу по созданию принципиально новой социальной сети.</seg>
          <seg id="77">По  мере роста популярности Facebook, отношения с  немногими друзьями-компаньонами начинают разлаживаться и в итоге приводят к судебным процессам.</seg>

          <seg id="64">David Fincher's new film is first and foremost a story about a paradox.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The film follows the invention of Facebook, one of the first tools of the internet that united the whole world, caused five friends to feud, and made its creator — the 26-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg — the youngest billionaire of recent decades.</seg>
          <seg id="66">In the main role, Jesse Eisenberg is just as outstanding as our conflicted genius — an emotionally reserved social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and loyalties.</seg>
          <seg id="67">Zuckerberg launches the site for a whole host of reasons: partially due to anger at the world, partly for the fun of it, and partly just because it's "cool."</seg>
          <seg id="68">The idea itself, and its manifestation, may seem wild and spontaneous, but the real course of events hints at careful calculations and a well thought-out business plan.</seg>
          <seg id="69">The strengths of The Social Network are clear from its first minutes, particular in the scene before the opening credits in which Zuckerberg is chatting at a bar with his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend Erika (Mara). Screenplay writer Aaron Sorkin's resonant and hard-edged dialogs gather speed even in this early scene and don't let up through the very end.</seg>
          <seg id="70">The same can be said of the director, Fincher: the relatively conservative (with the exception of The Winklevoss Twins were played by actors who don't look like one another.</seg>
          <seg id="71">The face of one was laid on top of the other with the help of computer graphics.</seg>

          <seg id="77">As Facebook's popularity grows, his relationships with his few friends and companions start to fall apart, ultimately resulting in legal proceedings.</seg>

          <seg id="15">at the same time, when one of these festivals solemnly closes with a terrifying view of Chu4-projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.</seg>
          <seg id="16">least of all I want to grumble about this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall looking at giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then you will be shown them.</seg>
          <seg id="17">meanwhile we have no pixels: 'Throne: Inheritance' (continuation of the classic picture about virtual reality), 'Let me in. » (American remake of the beautiful Swedish film), “Uncontrollable” (another Tony Scott approach to the subject of trains) and a wildly detailed account of how films about Konan, the barbarian, the destroyer and the governor were created.</seg>

          <seg id="63">History of the creation of Facebook</seg>
          <seg id="64">David Fincher's new movie is first and foremost a story about paradox.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The picture tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools of the Internet, which united the whole world, broke up five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of the last decades.</seg>
          <seg id="66">Jesse Eisenberg in the title role is as brilliant as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.</seg>
          <seg id="67">Zuckerberg is launching the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of exasperation with the world around him, partly out of sporting interest, and partly simply because THIS is "cool."</seg>
          <seg id="68">The idea itself and its realization may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.</seg>
          <seg id="69">The strengths of "The Social Network" are evident from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his five-minute ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara): screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's ringing, hard-hitting dialogues gain momentum here and don't soften until the finale.</seg>
          <seg id="70">Same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins played by unlikeable actors.</seg>

          <seg id="64">David Fincher's new film is primarily a story about a paradox.</seg>
          <seg id="65">The picture tells about the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, quarreled five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire in recent decades.</seg>

          <seg id="67">Zuckerberg is launching the site for a whole host of reasons: partly because of a grudge against the world around him, partly because of sports interest and partly simply because IT is "cool."</seg>
          <seg id="68">The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.</seg>
          <seg id="69">The strengths of the Social Network become apparent from the first shots, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) without five minutes: the sonorous, tough dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin are gaining strength here and do not soften until the very finale.</seg>

          <seg id="2">За пределами потока непрекращающихся дискуссий в фильме происходит не так уж и много: ни одной смерти, ни одного убийства, да и все судебные передряги Цукерберга вряд ли потянут хотя бы на дополнительный абзац для его скудной страницы в «Википедии».</seg>
          <seg id="3">Что же привлекло 49-летнего Соркина и 48-летнего Финчера в этой не слишком щедрой на детали истории?</seg>
          <seg id="4">После просмотра появляется стойкое ощущение, что «Социальная сеть» - это портрет нашего времени, а недосказанность в данном случае - важный художественный прием.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Мощный взрыв был слышен за десятки километров, но обошлось без жертв.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="7">Полиция графства Норфолк объявила, что, хоть взрыв и был незапланированным, никто из военных, занимавшихся обезвреживанием бомбы, не пострадал.</seg>

          <seg id="1">Вероятность повышения в дальнейшем ключевой ставки выше, чем ее снижения</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="2">Такое заявление сделала Председатель Банка России Эльвира Набиуллина по итогам заседания его Совета директоров 10 февраля, принявшего решение сохранить данную ставку на уровне 7,50%.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="3">Глава регулятора, в частности, отметила, что в последнее время произошли важные изменения.</seg>
          <seg id="4">С одной стороны, заметно ухудшились условия внешней торговли - снизились цены на российскую нефть.</seg>
          <seg id="5">С другой - ситуация в экономике складывается лучше октябрьского прогноза.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Продолжается сдвиг в структуре спроса: потребление остается сдержанным, частные инвестиции замедляются, но растут бюджетные расходы.</seg>
          <seg id="7">При этом проинфляционные риски в целом увеличились.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="8">"Поэтому в текущем году вероятность повышения ставки превышает вероятность ее снижения.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Целесообразность изменения ставки будет определяться развитием ситуации", - сказала Э. Набиуллина.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">Кроме более выраженного влияния бюджетной политики, она отметитла три риска.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Во-первых, быстрое раскручивание потребления в условиях повышенных инфляционных ожиданий, в случае если факторы, которые сдерживают потребительскую активность, ослабнут.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Во-вторых, все большая нехватка рабочих рук и отставание роста производительности труда от роста заработных плат.</seg>
          <seg id="13">А также по-прежнему остаются риски дополнительного ужесточения санкционных ограничений.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="14">Говоря о будущих решениях регулятора, Председатель Банка России отметила, что, несмотря на отмеченное раньше усиление проинфляционных факторов, прогноз по инфляции на текущий год остается на уровне 5 - 7%.</seg>
          <seg id="15">По ее словам, для этого может понадобиться более высокая траектория ключевой ставки, чем предполагалось в октябре.</seg>
          <seg id="16">В обновленном прогнозе ЦБ на этот и следующий год диапазоны для средней ключевой ставки повышены на половину процентного пункта, до 7,0-9,0% годовых на 2023 г. и 6,5 - 7,5% годовых на 2024 г.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="17">"Это не исключает возможности снижения ставки в этом году, но его вероятность и масштаб уменьшились.</seg>
          <seg id="18">И напротив, возросла вероятность того, что может понадобиться некоторое повышение ставки, чтобы в 2024 г. инфляция соответствовала цели вблизи 4%", - заключила глава Банка России.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="2">So said Russian Central Bank head Elvira Nabiullina after the February 10 meeting of its Board of Directors decided to keep the said rate at the level of 7.5%.</seg>

          <seg id="3">In particular, the head of the regulator noted that important changes had recently taken place.</seg>
          <seg id="4">On the one hand, external trade conditions noticeably worsened – the price of Russian oil fell.</seg>
          <seg id="5">On the other, the economic situation is turning out better than October's forecast.</seg>
          <seg id="6">The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing, but budget expenditures are growing.</seg>
          <seg id="7">At the same time, inflationary risks have increased overall.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="8">"Therefore, this year it is more likely that the rate will be raised than lowered.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The appropriateness of a change to the rate will be determined by how the situation develops," E. Nabiullina said.</seg>

          <seg id="6">Именно поэтому, по мнению полиции, требуется усиление контроля.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Как беременные россиянки застряли в Аргентине</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="3">Миграционная служба Аргентины начала приостанавливать и отменять действие вида на жительство россиян, получивших его через рождение ребенка, но не оставшихся жить в стране.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Ранее власти республики отказали во въезде в страну нескольким беременным россиянкам, которых заподозрили в том, что они прибыли с целями "родильного туризма".</seg>
          <seg id="5">11 февраля их все же пустили в Аргентину по решению суда.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Подробнее - в материале "Газеты.Ru".</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="7">Миграционная служба Аргентины начала приостанавливать и отменять действие вида на жительство (ВНЖ) россиян, получивших его через рождение ребенка, но не оставшихся жить в стране.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Об этом рассказала телеканалу C5N директор службы Флоренсия Кариньяно.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="9">"То, что мы делаем, это приостанавливаем вид на жительство тех россиян, которые приехали получить вид на жительство, потому что их ребенок - аргентинец, но при этом провели больше времени за пределами (Аргентины), чем внутри (страны) ", - пояснила она.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">По ее словам, когда в суде будет рассматриваться вопрос об аргентинском гражданстве для россиянина, миграционная служба подаст данные, что ВНЖ был приостановлен, потому что этот человек "провел месяц в Аргентине и больше никогда не приезжал".</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">Кариньяно предупредила, что у россиян, которые получили ВНЖ после рождения ребенка и уехали, могут его отозвать.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">На этом фоне 9 февраля стало известно, что три беременные россиянки "застряли" в аэропорту в Аргентине из-за отказа во въезде в страну.</seg>
          <seg id="13">По словам главы консульского отдела посольства РФ в Аргентине Георгия Полина, дипмиссия связывает произошедшее с тем, что власти республики могли счесть информацию, предоставленную девушками при въезде, неполной или ложной.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="14">Одна из них прилетела 7 февраля, еще две - вечером 8 февраля, передает РИА Новости.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Дипломат подчеркнул, что в Аргентину прилетело больше беременных, но конкретно этим трем выписали предписание о недопущении в страну.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="16">"Не впустили их в страну в соответствии с законом о миграции, где одно из оснований для недопущения в страну - предоставление неполной, ложной, искаженной информации", - рассказал Полин.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="17">В субботу, 11 февраля, миграционная служба Аргентины по решению суда пропустила в страну беременных гражданок РФ, сообщил адвокат Кристиан Рубилар.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="18">"Час назад им всем разрешили въехать в Аргентину", - приводит его слова ТАСС.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Рубилар отметил, что миграционная служба изменила свое решение после постановления суда.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="20">Иностранным родителям ребенка, родившегося в Аргентине, проще получить паспорт республики.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Он позволяет совершать краткосрочные поездки в 171 страну без виз, в том числе в государства ЕС, Великобританию и Японию, отмечает РБК.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="22">В начале января 2023 года газета The Guardian писала о "буме родильного туризма" в Аргентину среди россиян.</seg>
          <seg id="23">По словам Полина, в 2022 году в республику переехали от 2 тыс. до 2,5 тыс. граждан РФ.</seg>
          <seg id="24">Многие из них, отмечал дипломат, - россиянки, собирающиеся там родить.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="25">"В 2023 году это число может вырасти до 10 тыс"., - говорил он.</seg>
          <seg id="26">В свою очередь, Кариньяно ранее утверждала, что в 2022 году в Аргентину прибыли около 10,5 тыс. граждан России, а за последние месяцы - более 5,8 тыс. беременных женщин.</seg>

          <seg id="7">Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and as a result - difficulties with falling asleep arise.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.</seg>
          <seg id="9">The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.</seg>
          <seg id="10">However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent night awakenings.</seg>
          <seg id="11">In addition, to prevent sleep problems, the somnologist recommends avoiding spicy food and large portions.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Large volumes of food and spicy meals can increase the body's internal temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.</seg>
          <seg id="13">For a healthy sleep, it is not only necessary to maintain an external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of an elevated body temperature.</seg>
          <seg id="14">According to Cherkasova, one should not overindulge in heavy food before sleep, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to expend energy on digestion.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="2">Иркутской области необходимо продолжить осваивать альтернативные направления сбыта, кроме Дальнего Востока.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Это и внутренний рынок, и порты Западного направления, в том числе Азово-Черноморского бассейна.</seg>
          <seg id="4">С таким предложением выступил замгендиректора РЖД Алексей Шило на встрече с губернатором Игорем Кобзевым, сообщает 10 февраля 2023 года региональное правительство.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="5">- Как показала практика прошлого года, даже несмотря на географическое расположение Иркутской области, данное решение может быть крайне эффективно.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Важно, чтобы логистические службы компаний постоянно взаимодействовали с нашими "смежниками" (портами, операторами, морским транспортом) и находили оптимальные ценовые условия для перевозки своей продукции по новым схемам, - подчеркнул Алексей Шило.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="7">Губернатор отметил важность стабильность отгрузки продукции, Иркутская область является одним из самых богатых минеральными ресурсами регионов РФ и располагает значительными запасами каменного и бурого угля.</seg>
          <seg id="8">На территории региона добычей угля занимаются порядка 25 предприятий.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Нестабильность отгрузки продукции на экспорт оказывает негативное влияние на финансово-хозяйственную деятельность угледобывающих компаний.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="10">Также Игорь Кобзев подчеркнул, что Иркутская область - экспортно ориентированный регион, поэтому необходимо увеличить размер ежемесячных квот на транспортировку производимых в регионе лесоматериалов и продукции металлургической промышленности до уровня, обеспечивающего стабильную работу таких предприятий.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="11">- Понимая важность Иркутской области как промышленного центра, мы, со своей стороны, будем стараться делать все, чтобы оказать поддержку по объемам перевозок.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Если появятся дополнительные объемы отгрузки на внутренний рынок, то по этому направлению мы тоже готовы оказать содействие, - сказал Алексей Шило.</seg>

          <seg id="4">Объект возвели в рамках федерального проекта "Современная школа" национального проекта "Образование".</seg>
          <seg id="5">В восьми школьных блоках размещены: учебные кабинеты, столовая, пищеблок, актовый зал, два спортивных зала, кружковые помещения, библиотека, административные помещения, санузлы, рекреации общего пользования, медицинский блок.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="6">На строительство было направлено из федерального бюджета 240,8 млн рублей, более 512 млн рублей - областных средств и более 72 млн рублей муниципального образования.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Кроме того, была выделена областная субсидия на приобретение оборудования на сумму 64,2 млн рублей.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="19">"Often the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population usually uses electrical energy for heating.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="2">Пограничный пункт Маргара-Алиджан на границе Турции и Армении открыли впервые за три десятка лет для доставки гуманитарной помощи пострадавшим от землетрясения.</seg>
          <seg id="3">Об этом пишут турецкие и армянские СМИ.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Этот же переход использовался для доставки гуманитарной помощи из Турции в Армению после разрушительного землетрясения 1988 года, отмечает турецкое агентство "Анадолу".</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="5">В субботу Армения направила пять грузовиков со 100 тоннами продовольствия, медикаментов, воды и других пакетов экстренной помощи в город Адыяман на юге Турции, сообщил спецпредставитель Анкары на армяно-турецких переговорах Сердар Кылыч.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="6">Он выразил благодарность вице-спикеру парламента Армении Рубену Рубиняну и заместителю министра иностранных дел Армении Ваану Костаняну.</seg>
          <seg id="7">"Я всегда буду помнить помощь, направленную народом Армении для облегчения страданий нашего народа в пострадавшем от землетрясения регионе", - написал Кылыч на своей странице в твиттере.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="8">Пресс-секретарь МИД Армении Ваан Унанян в свою очередь сообщил, что грузовики с гуманитарной помощью пересекли границу через мост Маргара и направляются в пострадавший от землетрясения регион.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="9">Как передает Public Radio of Armenia, в последний раз автомобиль пересекал мост Маргара 30 лет назад, в 1993 году.</seg>
          <seg id="10">С тех пор армяно-турецкая сухопутная граница закрыта.</seg>

          <seg id="12">Тогда в зону бедствия в Армении поставили помощь, собранную по линии турецкого Красного полумесяца.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="13">Ранее Армения направила в Турцию 27 спасателей и еще 29 спасателей в Сирию в пострадавшие от землетрясения районы.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="14">По последним данным, более 25 тысяч человек погибли в Турции и Сирии от разрушительного землетрясения, случившегося в понедельник.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Президент Турции Реджеп Тайип Эрдоган 11 февраля сообщил, что известно уже от 21 848 погибших в Турции.</seg>
          <seg id="16">С сирийской стороны сообщалось о 3553 погибших.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="17">Отношения между Турцией и Арменией омрачены главным образом тем, что Анкара отказывается признать геноцид армян в Османской империи, а также поддерживала Баку во время Первой и Второй карабахских войн.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="18">В последнее время Ереван и Анкара предприняли ряд попыток нормализации отношений.</seg>
          <seg id="19">В 2021 году Армения и Турция назначили специальных представителей, которые несколько раз встречались в Вене для обсуждения вопросов нормализации.</seg>

        <p>

          <seg id="8">Успех номинальных гостей доступен за 11.0 (8%).</seg>
          <seg id="9">Даже на ничью предложена заметно более низкая котировка 6.10 (15%).</seg>

        </p>
        <p>

          <seg id="16">"Бланкос" явно превосходят в классе соперника, состав которого, согласно статистическому сайту Transfermarkt, составляет всего 39.6 млн евро.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Для сравнения: ростер "Реала" оценен в 849 млн евро.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Вдобавок, к ужасу "Аль-Хиляля", к финалу восстановится главный нападающий мадридцев и действующий обладатель "Золотого мяча" Карим Бензема.</seg>

        <p>
          <seg id="19">Но и без француза "Реал" на этом турнире выступает результативно: в полуфинале разгромил египетский "Аль-Ахли" 4:1.</seg>
          <seg id="20">Матчи аравийцев тоже получались достаточно яркими: в 1/4 финала оформили ничью 1:1 и победу в серии пенальти, а в полуфинале - драматичные 3:2.</seg>
        </p>

          <seg id="1">Возникшие у беременных россиянок проблемы с въездом в Аргентину объяснили</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="2">По оценке специалиста, на фоне наплыва желающих родить ребенка в Аргентине власти страны стали более внимательно следить за въездом иностранных граждан на свою территорию.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="3">Сложности с въездом беременных россиянок в Аргентину связаны с тем, что власти страны не заинтересованы в массовом наплыве иностранцев, желающих получить гражданство для своих детей и вид на жительство для себя, а потом уехать.</seg>
          <seg id="4">Об этом сообщает "Лента.ру" со ссылкой на профессора СПбГУ Виктора Хейфеца, главреда журнала "Латинская Америка".</seg>
          <seg id="5">По его словам, ни одна страна не поддерживает подобную практику.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Он отметил, что в Аргентине не одобряют превращение страны в перевалочный пункт, а не в конечный.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Это касается тех, кто нарушает конституционную практику.</seg>
          <seg id="8">Как объяснил эксперт, у ребенка останется гражданство Аргентины, но решение о предоставлении паспорта Аргентины родителям после получения вида на жительство вынесет суд.</seg>
          <seg id="9">В случае, если выяснится, что они фактически не жили в Аргентине и сразу же уехали, в предоставлении гражданства могут отказать.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Это касается не только россиян, но и граждан других стран.</seg>
          <seg id="11">В последнее время, как указал специалист, родильные туры в Аргентину особенно популярны среди россиян и украинцев.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="12">Напомним, Аргентина предоставляет гражданство по "праву почвы", то есть, если человек родился на ее территории.</seg>
          <seg id="13">Аргентинский паспорт открывает возможность для безвизового посещения 170 стран, в том числе, государств ЕС и Великобритании.</seg>
        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="14">Ранее сообщалось, что Аргентина начала отзывать ВНЖ россиян, которые получили документ через рождение ребенка, но уехали из страны.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Буэнос-Айрес заинтересован в сокращении подобных случаев.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Также стало известно, что шесть беременных гражданок России получили отказ во въезде в Аргентину в связи с подозрением в предоставлении ложных данных о мотивах поездки.</seg>

        </p>
        <p>
          <seg id="3">The pregnant Russians' difficulties entering are associated with the country's authorities not wanting an influx of foreigners wishing to receive citizenship for their children and residency for themselves, then leaving.</seg>

          <seg id="6">He noted that Argentina does not approve of the country being turned into a transit point, and not into a final one.</seg>
          <seg id="7">That concerns those who violate constitutional practice.</seg>
          <seg id="8">As the expert explained, the child keeps Argentinian citizenship, but a decision to provide the parents with an Argentinian passport after receiving residency is up to the court.</seg>
          <seg id="9">In the event that it is determined that they in fact did not live in Argentina but left immediately, they can be refused citizenship.</seg>
          <seg id="10">This applies not only to Russians, but to citizens of other countries.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Recently, the specialist said, birth tourism to Argentina has been particularly popular among Russians and Ukrainians.</seg>

          <seg id="6">К концу года в России будет насчитываться около 8,6 тысячи клубов.</seg>
          <seg id="7">По данным издания, большинство новых клубов - это малоформатные проекты с небольшими первоначальными вложениями и быстрой окупаемостью.</seg>

          <seg id="3">В Кировской области по решению регионального Арбитражного суда аннулирована лицензия на осуществление предпринимательской деятельности по управлению многоквартирными домами ранее выданная управляющей компании "Забота".</seg>
          <seg id="4">По данным региональной Госжилинспекции, судебное решение было принято еще в ноябре 2022 года, однако в законную силу вступило только в феврале 2023 года.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Арбитраж лишил "управляйку" лицензии за то, что в организации несколько раз оставили без внимания предписания Госжилинспекции.</seg>

          <seg id="6">В настоящее время все объекты, которые находились в управлении "Заботы", исключены из реестра лицензий на осуществление предпринимательской деятельности по управлению многоквартирными домами.</seg>
          <seg id="7">Их общая площадь составляла 64,8 тыс. квадратных метров.</seg>

          <seg id="11">Напомним, в январе 2023 года губернатор Кировской области Александр Соколов поставил перед сотрудниками Госжилинспекции задачу до весны ликвидировать 2/3 управляющих компаний региона, так как их слишком много.</seg>
          <seg id="12">Законность губернаторских требований вызвала сомнения у кировских коммунистов.</seg>

          <seg id="2">Отдых удался на "5", понравилось все!</seg>
          <seg id="3">Начну по порядку:</seg>
          <seg id="4">В день заезда позвонили, уточнили в какое время нас ждать, дали информацию о стоимости трансфера (1400 от аэропорта), мы заказали такси (в 23:00 цена 850р), доехали быстро, пробок не было, за шлагбаум пустили без всяких проблем.</seg>
          <seg id="5">Административный корпус рядом, оформили быстро, минут за 15-20.</seg>
          <seg id="6">Во всех корпусах есть лифт- это большой плюс!</seg>
          <seg id="7">2-х местный номер просторный, полы и в комнате и в ванной теплые (без подогрева), огромный балкон с ротанговой мебелью (столик и два кресла), панорамные окна (в 5 корпусе).</seg>
          <seg id="8">Мебель в номере нормальная, есть дамский столик с большим зеркалом, холодильник не совсем маленький, даже морозилка есть.</seg>
          <seg id="9">В 5 корпусе очень много зеленых растений.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Все чисто, меняют полотенца и белье по вашему желанию, но если не просите менять, то все равно меняют на 4-ый день, белье хорошего качества.</seg>
          <seg id="11">Территория ухоженная, везде лавочки, чистые дорожки, вечером красивая подсветка.</seg>
          <seg id="12">На пляж и обратно возит микроавтобус каждые 30 мин.</seg>
          <seg id="13">До остановки общественного транспорта 5 мин.</seg>
          <seg id="14">В зале столовой приветливые ребята, всегда пожелают хорошего дня.</seg>
          <seg id="15">Еда приличная, но тут кто за чем едет, нас все прекрасно устроило, и выбор и качество, всегда была и рыба и курица и биточки или т.п., овощи на гарнир каждый день, выпечка своя вкусная, больше 4-х напитков, кофе зерновой, на завтрак всегда пекут блинчики, вот только сыр и колбаса не очень.</seg>
          <seg id="16">Медицинский персонал очень доброжелательный и лояльный.</seg>
          <seg id="17">Нам еще и с погодой повезло, не было дождей, температура 11- 16 С°, солнышко.</seg>
          <seg id="18">Все понравилось, действительно отдохнули.</seg>
          <seg id="19">Есть желание приехать еще раз и именно в январе, когда мало отдыхающих)).</seg>
          <seg id="20">Жаль что бассейн никак не запустят в эксплуатацию и тренажерный комплекс.</seg>
          <seg id="21">Спасибо всему коллективу санатория за их слаженную и качественную работу!</seg>

          <seg id="3">Here's how it went:</seg>
          <seg id="4">On check-in day they called and asked when to expect us, told us about the price of a transfer (1,400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (₽850 at 11:00 p.m.) and got there fast, no traffic, they let us through the gate no problem.</seg>
          <seg id="5">The reception building was nearby, they got us checked in fast, 15-20 minutes.</seg>
          <seg id="6">All the buildings have elevators, which is a huge plus!</seg>
          <seg id="7">The 2 person room was spacious, the floors in the room and bathroom were warm (but not heated), there was a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), and panoramic windows (in building 5).</seg>
          <seg id="8">The furniture in the room was fine, including a dressing table with a big mirror, and a decent sized fridge with a freezer too.</seg>
          <seg id="9">Building 5 had lots of green plants.</seg>
          <seg id="10">Everything was clean, they change the towels and bedding whenever you ask, but if you don't ask they change it every 4 days anyway, the bedding was comfortable.</seg>
          <seg id="11">The grounds are well kept with lots of benches, clean paths, and beautiful lighting at night.</seg>
          <seg id="12">A minibus goes to and from the beach every 30 minutes.</seg>
          <seg id="13">There's a public transport stop 5 minutes away.</seg>
          <seg id="14">The dining area staff are polite and always tell you to have a good day.</seg>
          <seg id="15">The food was good, but it depends what you order, we thought everything was great, both the selection and quality; there was always fish, chicken, meatballs and the like, vegetables on the side every day, tasty baked goods made in-house, 4+ different beverages, whole-bean coffee, and freshly cooked crepes every day for breakfast, only the cheese and sausage weren't that great.</seg>
          <seg id="16">The medical staff was really friendly and accepting.</seg>
          <seg id="17">We got lucky with the weather too, sunny and no rain with temps 11-16 С°.</seg>
          <seg id="18">We had a great time and left truly relaxed.</seg>
          <seg id="19">We want to come again, only in January when it's less crowded :)</seg>
          <seg id="20">It's too bad they haven't opened the pool or gym yet.</seg>
