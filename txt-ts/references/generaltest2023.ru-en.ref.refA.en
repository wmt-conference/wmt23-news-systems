Traditionally, the July issue is submitted while the Moscow Film Festival is underway, which is, of course, quite tragic — having to proofread columns when your heart is yearning for Chabrol.
Nonetheless, we'll write about the Moscow International Film Festival in the next issue (for now, I'll only complain that this year the organizers have definitively latched onto the inexplicable idea that the lucky holders of purchased tickets are far more important to the festival than accredited guests — a laughable and entirely offensive principle which not a single respectable international film festival upholds), and that in this issue we report on the films we saw at Cannes and Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is adorned, as usual, with a pleasant face — that of the protagonist from the film Predators produced by Robert Rodriguez — and inside the magazine, we urge you not to somehow miss the story about Christopher Nolan's Inception (the same man, by the way, who relaunched Batman), which is the most (without exaggeration) anticipated film of the summer.
In addition, in this issue we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock. And here there's no need to advertise anything: it doesn't take a film buff to know the creator of Suspicion and Rope. Despite his outstanding credentials, our team — Tatyana Alishicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolie, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karayev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mezenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Aleksei Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Mur Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Aleksandr Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tischenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Ahakina, and London FBI agent Eveline Solt — suspect him of spying for the Russians and have decided to catch him, whatever it takes.
After being backed into a corner, she dresses in the black garb we're all familiar with and goes off to search out the truth.
Another shooter starring Angelina Jolie in the role of a rough-and-tumble femme fatale further cements her reputation as an actress in the action genre.
She causes one traffic accident after the next, running up walls à la Matrix and throwing muscular men dressed in identical, severe uniforms around like dolls.
When Doestoevsky said "Beauty will save the world," this is what he meant.
Her it is: our dear old world of The Fifth Element, blown apart and then restored, which made Milla Jovovich into the most fabulous woman in the universe.
Its Bruce Willis was the most super of heroes, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and unimpeachable of Evil's incarnations.
Meanwhile, all of this turned out not to be a boring American blockbuster about saving humanity, but a most enjoyable carnival of delights.
It's best not to recall what Besson did in the 13 years between "Element" and "Adèle."
He kept busy, to put it lightly, but all of his busywork as a producer and scenarist, as well as his occasional appearances as a director, will be forgotten.
Meanwhile, "Adèle" is not likely to be.
Watching it, it seems as if over the past 13 years we haven't been seeing Besson, but rather some kind of double.
Meanwhile he, the real Besson, was living in a tiny apartment in Montmarte, drinking wine at the cafe across the street and composing the story of a most charming adventure-seeking lady.
Recounting the plot (even in general terms) in order to whet our audience's appetite is even more of a sin than usual.
The incredible drive of the film is contained in the fact that a surprise awaits you behind every turn and in every spoken response.
And each one as just as wonderful as the last.
Whether it's a girl or a ghost
THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADÈLE BLANC-SEC
We'll hint that the most wild adventure film of the decade, The Extraordinary Adventures of Adèle Blanc-Sec, starts like Amelie, swerves off in the direction of Jurassic Park, continues on in the spirit of Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and ends like Titanic.
The basis of the film is the first volume of comics by Jacques Tardi about the journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec.
Before Adèle, Louise Bourgoin starred in only three films.
The actress was made famous by her role in La Fille de Monaco, for which she was nominated for a César Award.
The director doesn't chase after the viewer with hand outstretched, begging them to appreciate the special effects, sets, or stunts, but is rather like a classical novelist calling out before a great adventure to the center of the Earth or to the edge of the world, "Onward, reader, great things await us!"
Besson navigates genre films (about which he knows absolutely everything) joyously and without ceremony, like a little boy raised on old films and Jules Verne.
He plays with tropes, allows himself some cynicism, and isn't afraid of risks
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
STARRING: Louise Bourgoin, Mathieu Amalric, Frédérique Bel, Gilles Lellouche
PLOT: Strange things happened in Paris in 1912.
The city has been sent into commotion by an ancient creature that has been brought to life by an old psychic medium.
The police chase after the ancient monster along with a renowned hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History, and the journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec, who is less interested in the creature itself than in the medium — the reason being that she needs to save her sister.
With this goal in mind, the young woman drags a real mummy out of Egypt.
IN THEATERS JULY 22
Adèle is one of those cases when a parody becomes the apotheosis of the genre itself, and is capable of radically changing the genre and pointing it in a new direction.
The same thing happened with the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, the gangster action films of Quentin Tarantino, Indiana Jones, which is alluded to (both homage is given and jokes are made), and, finally, The Fifth Element itself.
Besson's style in this film is composed of linguistic showmanship, actorly clowning, and a balancing act of plot (circus terms are quite apt — the marriage of the two art forms in the film is stronger and more organic than ever).
A couple words must also be said about Adèle herself.
She exemplifies the undeservedly forgotten type character of the adventure-seeking young woman, who achieves her goals not so much through exploiting her sexuality as though pure panache and courage.
Usually in films this type of woman is set against some kind of standard machismo or doe-eyed romanticism
SCREENPLAY: ALEKSANDR STRELKOV
Face-to-face with history
Only a timid and comical admirer is present, who always gets in the way (only his knowledge of zoology ends up proving useful).
For this reason, the young woman doesn't waste her energy on amorous trifles and instead happily spends her time in the company of ancient corpses which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Having trained himself on a long string of "low-hanging" genre films and having, so it seemed, gone completely stale, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative daring, reminding us that the barrier between the tastes of bored megamall cinema attendees and high-minded art-house film fanatics can be easily overcome by movies made for life-loving weirdos.
The game of adventure films is without sadness, fear, or reproach
THE KILLING ROOM
Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film, a claustrophobic thriller with attempts made at psychology and the political context of 2002, was berated by critics but liked by the public. It performed well at the box office and, most importantly, ended up in front of producer Michael Bay.
That's how the young director ended up in the factory where he's been pounding new horror films out of old material: Bay set the goal of filming remakes of all the classic horror movies and tasked Liebesman with a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
Critics once again grimaced, and the public once again liked it: Liebesman worked in the spirit of "new horror," putting emphasis on the exaggerated physicality of violence.
Generally speaking, it is an example of how the whole genre is undergoing convulsions trying to invent new ways to affect an overly sated public — the naturalistic bloodbath of splatter films is mixed in with the chase scenes of slasher films.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, only without the liters of blood.
Among its prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut film Cube. That film was not with Michael Bay.
And so, in The Killing Room, Liebesman was forced to go a different way. Instead of scenes of mindless slaughter or monotonous fleeing from a maniac, he showed preference for a smarter approach — without the famed bloodbaths, but instead with psychological games and riddles.
In this film, evil doctors play cat-and-mouse with experimental subjects.
And three men inside a locked room try to work out a strategy to survive: Should they join together as a team or shoot each other?
Should they play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or should they try to break out of their cage at any cost?
They are not undergoing the test alone — so is a young, ambitious special agent who the experienced professor, who has been learning from savage experiments, is testing for her ruthlessness.
STORY: In exchange for 250 dollars, four volunteers sign up to take a simple test.
They are placed in an isolated room and each is given a bundle of papers with nonsensical questions.
A polite man then enters the room in a white robe, introduces himself as a doctor, and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A game for survival begins, which is carefully observed from behind glass by government agents.
Too thoughtful for a horror film but not thoughtful enough for genuine art house
It can maintain a civil conversation, blast a flamethrower in your face, but is unable to let a single skirt go by.
The captivating Nastya, on the other hand, is attractive in being both attentive and unremitting.
She is offended by her father's courtesan lifestyle and openly looks on as he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, dives into a pool after his next romantic prey.
The daughter rebels, but her father tempts her young lover from his poor family with money.
But the main theme behind the family conflict is not the difference between generations or the choice of a career — which is, one way or another, already determined — but rather the young woman's unsuccessful attempts to reject the apparent idea that, in modern Moscow, everything can be bought and sold.
Mher Mkrtchyan and Pavl Bardin filmed the weak melodramatic comedy Troe I Snezhnika with Ivan Urgant.
Working in the comedy genre, Depardieu convincingly depicted the grown daughter's dad.
The fractured plot weaves around the protagonists' romantic escapades as they constantly discuss psychology. Meanwhile they themselves, apparently thanks to a smart directorial approach, put emphasis on the language of looks and gestures.
Secondary plot lines (a girl injured in an auto accident whom Aleksei, an alcoholic athlete played by Sergei Gorbchenko, wants to marry) are, alas, outlined only telegraphically.
Especially unfortunate is the plot line about the business of reselling of football players, which was left behind the scenes.
STORY: An agent who works football stars is worried by the fate of his teenage daughter Nastya more than anything in the world,
The tender-hearted dad throws around money almost as readily as he changes out his expensive shirts. But his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and whatever happens, she must marry a boy "with drive."
Imagine the businessman's disappointment when Nastya, in her struggle for independence and to spite her father, instead chooses his peer and business partner.
But the film's writer "scored a goal" with a potential slogan for the film's audience: "Don't look for problems where there are none." It couldn't be more apt.
Their similarity is simply stunning.
Both films employ a lineup of serious-looking young men, soldiers of fortune forced to seek revenge on those who deceived them, and in each group there is one beautiful young woman.
The films' protagonists run around the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and use the same screen effects: in both cases something filled with American bills explodes and a whirlwind of greenbacks drifts down onto the set.
Even the villains, dressed up in expensive suits, are difficult to distinguish from one another (and in both cases they are played by Patricks — Jayson Patric in one, Patrick Wilson in the other).
The last role played by Zoe Saldaña was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White previously filmed Stomp the Yard, about dance crews.
Chris Evans was recently called to play a protagonist from another comics series: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comics series that came out in the 70s and was re-released in the 2000s, while Joe Carnahan was inspired by a comedy series from the 80s.
It's astonishing how they, without conferring with one another, drew different material down to an absolutely identical, explosion-filled common denominator. They made trundling, predictable, and unneeded action films that recall a great bulk of the movies made by Willis and Schwarzenegger (with the comparison always falling in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If a choice must be made between the two films, The Losers comes off a bit better and is clearly at a disadvantage with regards to breaking even (the budget, after all, was three and a half times less).
At least Zoe Saldaña makes an appearance, and she looks great with a bazooka
STARRING: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldaña, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
STORY: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of hardened commandos working for the CIA is set up by their leadership: a helicopter carrying children that they were trying to save explodes and, from that moment on, the soldiers themselves are believed to be deceased.
But they are alive — alive and determined to get revenge, whatever it takes, on the ne'er-do-well with the ominous voice who orchestrated the whole event.
It's all very charming but, frankly, it's only worth wasting an hour and a half of your life watching White's film if you really having nothing more interesting to do.
It's made from recycled material like a highly-digestible action flick
A simple story about an escapee from a Romanian labor camp
In a low-budget Romanian film that received a prize at a prestigious international film screening.
In fact, nothing more than this information, it should be possible to clearly imagine the film's hypothetical contents as well as a number of specific details about its form.
Without doubt, the film promises a sharp social critique.
It's sure to be realistic and, indeed, brutal.
There's a high chance it will star non-professional actors.
The film will also contain lots and lots of Romanian poverty (sure, poverty knows no borders, but Romania, as film after film by our festivals' laureates have shown, is especially poor).
Moreover, without knowing the film's year of release, it's possible to simply interpret the film's action as the exercises of some underground critical realists from Warsaw Pact countries who read Bresson's lectures from the early 80s
The film received the Grand Prix at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The film is based on a play by Andreea Vălean, whose work has seen particular attention from directors in the Romanian "new wave."
Cinematographer Marius Panduru has frequently worked with Corneliu Porumboiu.
Everything has been said fairly, both for the debut work of Florin Șerban and — please understand us correctly — has a positive, not a reproachful, intent: the Romanian "new wave" is currently in that remarkable stage of development when faith in its representatives and methods
has yet to falter.
And it's important to make the most of this moment: it's only thanks to that faith that we're able to tolerate an hour-and-a-half viewing of a Romanian penal colony for minors and give ourselves over to the charisma of the highly talented Piștereanu (whose story, despite the chasm dividing the two cultures, can be simply
converted into an exploitation film à la 1970s, with a cowboy who decides to walk out of prison — which he was soon to be released from — over to the nearest saloon).
STARRING: George Piștereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Vodă, Marian Bratu
STORY: After serving a four-year sentence, 18-year-old prisoner Silviu (Piștereanu) will soon be given his freedom. However, it unexpectedly comes to light that his mother wants to take his younger brother away with her to Italy.
From that moment onwards, the young man's behavior becomes unacceptable.
Romantic intrigue with a social worker named Ana further spurs the young man towards desperate acts, the essence of which is extracted in the name of the film.
It's all just such nonsense!
If you want to watch it, then watch.
It's a decent debut providing a modicum of hope that, someday, Romanian art-house cinema will begin to develop in a decent direction
A cartoon about the joys of being evil and of family life
This directorial debut of a man with the last name Coffin (Sop) and his coauthor Renaud was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the éminence grise of American animated films who, notably, was responsible for Ice Age, Horton Hears a Who, and Robots.
Despicable Me is, quite possibly, his team's best work yet: the film is beautifully animated (it is, by the way, worth watching even if you're 30 — especially if you like it when objects occasionally try to jump out of the screen and into the theater), intelligently written, and, most importantly, is without a single "below-the-belt" joke of the type that, in Ice Age, makes you to press yourself into your chair out of embarrassment and cover your kids' ears with your hands.
Given, the reason behind this change in direction was not the writers' good sense, but rather the protagonist's extreme asexuality which, in turn, was dictated by a desire to, no matter what, avoid the topic of pedophilia.
The "adult" part of the film, aside from the basic conflict of single fatherhood, is provided by the rather harsh dark humor (for which, one would like to think, we are indebted to director Coffin).
In all, it's a very likable film — so much so, in fact, that at a certain point it becomes even too perfect and correct.
You can feel the work of the corporate team of marketers who thought through every detail to ensure that the film would be liked by every category of viewer.
That's not to say that we want to see the characters in kid's films get eaten by cannibals or die in a nuclear explosion
STORY: The large-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of becoming an astronaut have over the years morphed into the idea of stealing the Moon, finds himself needing to enlist the help of children to carry out his great plan and rid himself of a young competitor.
He adopts three female orphans from some kind of progressive orphanage: Margo who wears glasses, Edith who wears a hat, and Agnes, whose lethal cuteness could only be compared to the cat in Shrek.
As it usually goes, in the course of events the children transform the plans of the adults.
The protagonist was drawn from Christopher Meledandri: they're both bald, large-nosed, and have a tendency towards dark humor.
In the original, the main characters are voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
At the end of the film, Gru dances like John Travolta
Somewhere in a desertlike landscape, a car rolls up to an abandoned trailer and from it emerge three pairs of excellent tits.
Literally.
The women who bear this blessing are themselves of little importance.
The camera confidently fixes its attention on that specific body part.
For fans of this, I've got good news: the whole films carries on in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands what's what in female beauty and conducted casting in such a way that all the action on the screen is only of secondary importance.
And lots of amusing things happen.
Camero, Hel, and Trixie dig around in the sand, pour water on themselves (don't ask why), spew all kinds of nonsense, and periodically break out into wild fights.
The creators think that a swearing dame with a nice body, covered in mud, and with a broken nose is super cool.
Bitch Slap is primarily oriented towards the classic sexploitation genre.
Rick Jacobson filmed episodes of Xena: Warrior Princess and Hercules: The Legendary Journeys.
The film closest to it in spirit that's showing in Moscow is A Gun for Jennifer.
It's also super cool that the bitchy beauties kick a bandit in the crotch and that a dimwit punk goes around with a Japanese schoolgirl, to which is added a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and intrigue is built through an endless number of flashbacks.
In all, a film fetishist will find a true gold mind of pleasure here.
Of course, it goes without saying that Jacobson and his gang had a ball of a time filming this trash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren't for the physical qualities of the actresses, you'd already be bored halfway through.
It'd be reasonable to assume that this doozie came to us from nighttime channels for adults (Jacobson does, in fact, often film TV episodes)
STARRING: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties take a mafia boss out into the desert where he's hidden a pretty penny's worth of diamonds.
After finding nothing and killing the hapless criminal, the gals start to scratch and punch at one another and, periodically, at thugs who appear out of nowhere. They also frequently kiss and press against one another.
In the course of events it becomes clear that all three are not who they seemed to be at the beginning.
Apparently, in the opinion of the screenwriter, that makes everything especially funny.
This is a product for the narrow audience of people who love things made with horrifically bad taste
Indeed, with his last film Doomsday, a watered down off-brand Mad Max, Marshall seriously misfired
But this bloodthirsty and biting sword-and-sandal flick has reestablished our faith in the director.
This non–politically correct and grim magnum opus is not ashamed of its small budget, obvious sources of inspiration, or savage B-movie aesthetic.
The film offers the thug-like swagger of Dog Warriors and the savage cruelty of The Descent.
This "Marshall Plan" to clean the post-Gladiator cinematic mud off of the sword-and-sandal genre, on the whole, worked.
In 2011, Kevin Macdonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His legionaries who are covered in battle scars (among them the unexpectedly expressive David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham), are tough guys trying to join their duty as warriors with their insurmountable desire to live.
Murder and all the exciting details of natural needs set in ancient times are here displayed with love and consideration.
The scene depicting the destruction of the Ninth Legion, which ate up much of the budget, is a direct recreation of the initial scene with soldiers going out into the German forest in Sir Ridley Scott's Gladiator, which has set the gold standard. But for some reason there's absolutely no desire to try accusing Marshall of plagiarism: he does his job honestly and unpretentiously.
STARRING: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The land that is modern-day Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The distant fore-post where the centurion Quintus Dias (Fassbender) is serving is cruelly destroyed by a Pictish reconnaissance troop.
Dias, who is miraculously saved, is first forced to join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then with a bunch of other Romans who have survived, try to slip away from the group of Pictish soldiers under the leadership of the sadistic Etain (Kurylenko).
This thin arthouse actress has so far only managed to lay claim to colorful supporting roles in Hollywood, but one very much wants to believe that this will change after Centurion.
Sword-and-sandal: a corrected and supplemented edition.
Almost like Gladiator, but a bit more modest and darker.
A continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationships with two very promising young men: the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the bodybuilding werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fangirls are waiting with bated breath.
The blockbuster film version of the cartoon about a bald boy wizard who's been called to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The fire nation has started a bloody war and subjugated its neighbors.
Young Aang can stop the war, but only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes the Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is able to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the dreams of his subjects, he forces the sleeping brains to operate by his own rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite: leave in someone's mind something that wasn't there before.
This is a picturesque lesson in navigating illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced sorcerer (Nicholas Cage) finds himself a young assistant in hopes that the two will together be able to best an evil mage (Alfred Molina).
Using destructive spells, they create a pandemonium of dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
A cat as bald as a cue ball has thought up a plot to capture the whole world, and now superagent dogs must join forces with their meowing nemeses.
The second installment in this furry family comedy.
A group of over-the-hill ruffians led by the frail-looking Royce (Adrien Brody) mysteriously find themselves on another planet where stylish, fanged aliens declare open hunting season on them.
The return of the 80's cult hero to the big screen.
Keep your attention on George Clooney, who joined forces with rock-photographer-become-director Anton Corbijn (Control) for an extremely curious, existential investigation into the psychology of an aging hit man in hiding in a large Italian city and who, late in life, comes into touch with human nature.
"An artistic visionary of Corbijn's stature and the great George Clooney make a cinematic team from heaven," touts the studio press-release.
Aside from that, this project is yet further confirmation of Clooney's long romantic relationship with Italy: the film was shot in the picturesque city of Castel de Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel A Very Private Gentleman, Rowan Joffé made a number of changes in his screenplay: the place of the narrating Englishman was taken by the eponymous American, and the criminal gunsmith was turned into a simple assassin.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack tries to finish up his last piece of business and finally get out of his lucrative line of work, his icy heart is melted by the local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street-working prostitute (Thekla Reuten), whom Clooney's character immediately falls in love with.
"Jack tempts fate," the official synopsis reads.
"A dangerous emissary of darkness draws nearer and nearer to him, and the mysterious lady who has hired him may not be who she claims."
Judging from the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, buttressed by Clooney's melancholy silhouette (the film resembles a long clip from 02), have emerged on a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe is set to play the lead role in the film adaptation of Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front
Might I take your picture with my photo apparatus?!
This season, you can see Johnny Depp appearing in two places at once.
First in Venice, on the set of the thriller The Tourist from director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck (The Lives of Others).
There, he plays a tourist who is in love with Angelina Jolie's character.
Secondly, you can see him in Puerto Rico on the set of The Rum Diary, a film adaptation of the legendary Hunter S. Thompson's debut novel.
The project's director and screenwriter is Bruce Robinson (Withnail and I), whose last work as a director was the thriller Jennifer 8 back in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists for this Russian prison drama, there's no question as to where they drew their inspiration.
But you can't approach the idea from a literal angle!
That said, it's good that the female protagonist of the Russian picture, despite being strange, at least isn't bald.
Director Dennis Dugan mostly specializes in films starring Adam Sandler.
They've already racked up four films together: Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, and You Don't Mess with the Zohan.
July will see the release of their fifth film, Grown Ups; and their sixth, Just Go with It, starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman, is in production.
They've already penciled in a seventh film as well — the romcom Jack and Jill — where Sandler simultaneously plays Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who made an impression on viewers this year with his explosive action film Kick-Ass, will work on the reboot of X-Men.
The director of X-Men: First Class immediately recruited James McAvoy to the film, giving him the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike plays the mutant telepath Emma Frost, known as the White Queen; Amber Heard transforms into the blue-skinned Mystique; and Michael Fassbender will potentially portray Magnito.
Though the filming of the new James Bond movie has been put off, its new director Sam Mendes is keeping busy.
His to-do list includes a musical of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and a film adaptation of Ian McEwan's novel On Chesil Beach.
The screenplay is being adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of hard-headed major George Smiley, the protagonist of John la Carré's series of novels, in the film adaptation of the thriller Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy.
Alec Guinness acted in the novel's first film adaptation in 1979.
The new version will be filmed by the Danish director Tomas Alfredson, the creator of the horror film Let the Right One In.
Tom Tykwer is adapting David Michell's sci-fi best-seller Cloud Atlas for the screen.
The director admits that the work is not easy (the novel features six parallel plot lines), but is extremely interesting.
He has already offered roles to Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen, and Natalie Portman.
Maxim Korostyshevsky's international action film with the working name Soldiers of Fortune is being filmed in Crimea.
The film takes as its subject millionaire adrenaline junkies who pay their own money to be sent into a real war.
It stars Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya, and others.
The film's premier is slated for early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy Sweet Baby Jesus alongside English pop star Pixie Lott
Megan Fox has been fired from Transformers 3.
The film company Paramount ensures that the firing "is not related with the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
That notwithstanding, the role of the lead female character and new girlfriend of protagonist Shia LeBeouf will likely be taken by English model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
The young woman has no experience in film, so she'll have to fast-track some acting master classes.
But that fact shouldn't scare off tempted viewers: film history contains many examples of models successfully changing careers into acting.
Charlize Theron (Monster), Angelina Jolie (Girl, Interrupted), Jessica Lange (Blue Sky, Tootsie), Kim Basinger (L.A. Confidential), Jennifer Connelly (A Beautiful Mind), Geena Davis (The Accidental Tourist), and the first runner-up of Miss USA 1986, Halle Berry (Monster's Ball) all started out as runway models or were photographed for fashion magazines and ended up winning well-earned Oscars.
The beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, what's especially pleasant, our own Olga Kurylenko, all found success in acting.
For them, the highest awards are clearly just a reach away.
That's all to say, Rosie does have precedents to follow.
Valeriya Gai Germanika, who earned Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for her film Everybody Dies but Me and who filmed the scandalous TV series School, has been appointed creative director of the channel MTV.
The channel's leadership believes that Valeriya is who they need to bring about necessary and desired changes.
Specifically, plans are already underway for the filming of an in-house series (about teenagers and vampires).
Germanika has also begun auditions for new leads.
The comedy Kolotilov, from director Leo Gabriadze's and produced by Timur Bekmambetov, has suddenly been renamed Lucky Trouble.
The basic subject of the film remains the same: Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky), a Russian language teacher from a provincial town, is rushing to Moscow to meet his bride but is delayed when he decides to train a football team of street children.
The film's secondary plot line has been further developed.
In the place of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the Moscow bride Nadya will be played by Milla Jovovich.
To provide additional intrigue, a third man has been added: Nadya's former groom Danya (Ivan Urgant).
With this, in addition to the question of whether the backyard team will win the football championship, there is also the dilemma of who will get the hand of Milla Jovovich.
Due to his constant obligations on the set of The Hobbit and a pile of other side projects, Guillermo del Toro has declined the role of director.
Studios are trying to convince producer Peter Jackson to take the whole project into his own hands, but he's willing to take that step only if absolutely necessary.
Among those who have been named as possible inheritors are David Yates, who has finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, was nominated for an Oscar.
The name of the new director will be officially announced at the usual Comic Con convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play the role of Cleopatra
Driven into a frenzy by the unforgiving schedule, critics and filmmakers have been flying at super-speed between Sochi's Winter Theater, where showings with master classes took place, and the Zhemchuzhina hotel, where a constant stream of press releases and round tables have been held. They've hardly had time to take a plunge into the Black Sea.
The protagonists of the competing films behaved similarly: in almost every one, someone was running somewhere — frazzled Asians in Yusup Razykov's Gastarbaiter and Dmitry Mamuliya's Drugogo Neba searched out a lost grandson and wife, and a swift bandit runs around in Yury Bykov's Zhit.
The protagonist of Klim Shipenko's film Kto Ya? wrapped the same cops around his finger — a film which, by the way, was most memorable to the public on account of showing a completely nude Jeanna Friske.
Heroes of Russian show business also appeared in a couple of the competing films: in the film Slon, Sergei Snurov plays a truck driver transporting circus animals to slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets contemplated every subject imaginable — cheating women, lonely men, the and therapeutic power of alcohol — in Statisfaction, in which business partners challenge each other to an alco-duel because of a lady.
What is more, TV shows made a palpable impression on the events at Kinotavr — not a single one of them was a bore.
At a round-table dedicated to the fate of Russian art house films, Sergei Tolstikov, the chair of a fund for supporting Russian cinema, got in a beautiful spat with critics: "Do you even read the press articles that I read?" he intimidatingly inquired of those gathered there.
"I write them," Andrey Plakhov, the president of ERVE3S! answered, nonplussed.
But that wasn't the end of the scandals: near the conclusion of the festival, Aleksei Fedorchenko's film Silent Souls was unexpectedly pulled from the program: it's going to Venice, and Mostra's curators decided that an unnecessary Russian showing was not in their interest.
Kinotavr never used to bother the giants: films from the large festivals have been shown in Sochi many times. This time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film My Joy participated in the competition. In the spring it competed with Mikhalkov and Weerasethakul on the Côte d'Azur.
At Kinotavr, Nikita Sergeevich attended the film of the former Cannes competitor and stated that he liked it.
On the other hand, jury chair Karen Shakhnazarov didn't like Loznita's film at all — but under the pressure of his peers, he was forced to give it the prize for best director after all.
His daughter received the prize for the best debut, for the film Missing Man.
A terrifying cinematic encyclopedia of Russian life: the naive, humane, and rational protagonist of the film is beaten, robbed, and incited to monstrous acts without any discernible goal.
A precisely presented and refreshing film experience captured by a misanthrope with an education in math, which has one single message: start thinking.
A debutant with an education in philosophy, Mamulia names his films after quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any and all events in the screenplay, and affirms that the viewer's enjoyment lies in the work it takes to understand his inaccessible, meditative films.
The most difficult film at Kinotavr has already been selected for the competition at Karlovy Vary. A new directorial star has been born.
The impeccably dressed and shorn computer programer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained squeamishness, hiding away in the hole of his well-maintained bachelor lifestyle.
But a headstrong woman descends on his household, the unjust hand of law enforcement comes down on his head, and he begins to run a meaningless gauntlet of Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's important to work with people who aren't debutants," the producer Sabina Eremeeva victoriously announced from the stage, collecting her prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabina simply succeeded in drawing the "inner debutant" out of one of Russia's art house heveyweights.
And this is more broadly symptomatic: in our cinema today, the masses are following the younger generation.
And not the other way around.
It's a documentary picture filmed in such a way that it takes your head off more cleanly than a feature film cut from the same cloth.
The filmmaker is interested even in a screwdriver probing an electric meter, or a piece of unsalted butter drifting across a cast-iron skillet — and all these details turn this story of an unemployed miner, his gap-toothed lover, and her criminal brother into a visual masterpiece of a documentary.
The winner in the short film category, Nikolai Sokolov, applies the black and white style of the French new wave to the world of bedroom communities.
And sure, Godard-like montages come off strangely in a story about two schoolboys, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach compositions backwards — but we can't help but say "thank you" for the rare attempt at poeticizing the reality that surrounds us.
"There are three days a year — on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day, and City Day — that a fleet of ten An-12, Il-18, An-32, and An-24 planes takes off into the sky. They're equipped for their work with meteorological tools and technical means for affecting clouds, and loaded with specialized ecologically clean chemicals: liquid nitrogen, granulated carbonic acid ("dry ice"), and meteorological pyroshells with silver iodide and powderlike reagents.
The process looks like this: the planes use these reagents to "break up" clouds headed towards the city at a distance of 50–100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and intensity of the rain front). The moisture condenses onto the chemical particles.
As a result, the precipitation falls earlier than it otherwise would and in the specific spot where the clouds were acted upon."
It's already been ten years that work has been ongoing on the remake of the science fiction film that starred Michael York.
Carl Rinsch, famous for his advertising clips, was recently appointed as the director (he's already slated for the Creature from the Black Lagoon remake as well).
Previously, names associated with the project included Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeigue (V for Vendetta), and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
In the story, the protagonist, who is about to turn 30, has to flee from a death sentence because the society of the future executes all citizens when they reach that age.
Robert Rodriguez got the rights to the rotoscope-animated 80s fantasy cartoon and plans to turn it into a large-scale film.
The original was the product of collaborative creative work between the director Ralph Bakshi (the animated The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and the fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The subject of the cartoon was swords, sorcery, and a lot of illustrated boobs.
In it, the warrior Larn saves Princess Teegra and all the people from the evil master of ice, Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to be attentive when creating the monsters and barbarians riding pterodactyls.
George A. Romero is sending his zombies on vacation for the time being since he himself is planning to take up the remake of Dario Argento's classic Giallo film.
The person returning the characters to the big screen is none other than Michael Bay — the sovereign lord of action films, explosions, and horror remakes.
The director of the remake will be Daming Chen, who will also adapt the screenplay.
Argento and Romero already collaborated on Day of the Dead and filmed Two Evil Eyes together in 1990.
This time around, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the screenplay.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy Arthur.
"I wanted to bring more power to the female character in order to reflect the way things are in China, " Chen says.
"In our time, Chinese women lead large businesses and win Olympic gold medals.
Gong Li personifies that power."
This is the second time you're playing an imaginary character.
Is that a coincidence?
It's a pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised when I learned I'm representing two films here (at Kinotavr on the Sochi film market, EMRBE).
And in both I'm playing a dream woman.
But... I was so surprised by the director, by how he introduced me, and lots of people probably think that I'm that way in real life.
Dream girl.
Your costar in the film, Aleksandr Yatsenko, looks nothing like his character.
How did you find a common language? What's he like on set?
He's nothing like he seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, "Yeah... this isn't going to be easy for me."
Probably if we didn't have that human connection, honest and real, nothing would have panned out for us.
But that connection happened literally just a few minutes after we met each other.
We became close — I'm not afraid to use that word — friends.
I told him about all my fears, all my worries, and about the fact that I was afraid I wouldn't do well, and I asked him for some help and advice, and he gave that help and advice happily.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do that because I was really afraid of losing that connection, of losing our mutual understanding.
And that's why at the premier we held hands while watching the whole film.
How was it filming in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is a city I was visiting for the first time.
I'd never toured there, never vacationed there, and I'd never been there as a kid.
That city has a certain magic, it's own kind of character, it's own charisma.
And it's a city you want to go back to.
It has its own provincial charm.
It's a place where no one hurries anywhere but always makes it everywhere on time.
So it turns out you didn't have any trouble acting like you were in love with the city.
All in all, you were extremely organic on screen, which is something lots of people, honestly, didn't expect.
How do you work with the roles?
Do emotional scenes come easily to you?
You know, I'm not a professional actor.
And, by nature, I'm a very trusting person.
If I show up and agree to work with a director, then, essentially, I'm entrusting myself to him and I want to be the clay that he uses to sculpt out of.
I know that things are always clearer from someone else's perspective, and, again, I ask for pointers and talk with the director at length. I don't even really talk with him, rather he has some initial conversations with me and explains extremely clearly and precisely what he needs.
And them with many long hours of rehearsal we reach that organic performance you were talking about.
And how was it working with the film's producer, Klim Shipenko?
I just loved everyone — the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because I love working with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was willing to go without sleep or food — and it was the same kind of situation here.
No sleep, no food for days on end, and it didn't matter, rain or shine.
If anything didn't pan out, it was a catastrophe and we had to immediately do something to make it work.
It's really easy for me to work in that kind of crazy atmosphere.
And it seems to me that when people are moved to the point of pathological fanaticism by what they do, there's just no way it won't work out, because just too much energy is being spent on it.
What kind of screenplays do you not agree to do?
What are the criteria for choosing material that you'll work with?
I don't want it to be ridiculous — ridiculous dialog, films where nothing is said or people aren't wearing anything.
I don't want to work just for the sake of appearing on the screen yet again.
Do you have any offers or projects that you're getting ready to work on in the near future?
Right now I don't have any particular offers or plans.
I'm not the kind of person who packs my schedule.
A screenplay arrived, it interested me, and today this premier happened.

While we're at work on our November issue, film festivals are being held in Moscow almost nonstop: American cinema — Amfest, 2toggo\, in coming days 2-t-1 will be starting, and after it the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of my friends are constantly talking about how so-and-so needs to be boycotted and so-and-so needs to be supported according to some — please excuse me for saying this — very vague considerations.
Meanwhile, when one of these festivals is triumphantly taken over by terrible looking Chu4 projection without English subtitles,  it's as if nobody notices anything.
Of all things, I don't want to grumble about this — but if you buy a ticket and stay to watch giant pixels and actors projected horizontally, then that's what they're going to show you.
And in our issue, by the way, there are no pixels. Tron: Legacy (a continuation of the classic film about virtual reality), Let Me In (an American remake of the outstanding Swedish film), Unstoppable (Tom Scott once again approaching the subject of trains), and a wildly detailed story about how the film about Conan was made (the barbarian, destroyer, and governor).

the multi-episode tale about our lovable glasses-wearing wizard is coming to its end.
And despite the fact that the fans of the series have already read the books and know how it ends, and that those for whom "Expelliarmus" means nothing will stay home regardless, the title of "November's main blockbuster" is de facto already Harry's.
The people sitting in the studios aren't idiots either, by the way: in order to expand the enjoyment of the viewing experience and, ultimately, squeeze as much as they can out of the franchise, they have decided to split the film into two parts.
Thus, our touching goodbye with the magical world of Hogwarts will last until next summer.
THE SOCIAL NETWORK
The creation story of the social network Facebook
David Fincher's new film is first and foremost a story about a paradox.
The film follows the invention of Facebook, one of the first tools of the internet that united the whole world, caused five friends to feud, and made its creator — the 26-year-old Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg — the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
In the main role, Jesse Eisenberg is just as outstanding as our conflicted genius — an emotionally reserved social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and loyalties.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a whole host of reasons: partially due to anger at the world, partly for the fun of it, and partly just because it's "cool."
The idea itself, and its manifestation, may seem wild and spontaneous, but the real course of events hints at careful calculations and a well thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network are clear from its first minutes, particular in the scene before the opening credits in which Zuckerberg is chatting at a bar with his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend Erika (Mara). Screenplay writer Aaron Sorkin's resonant and hard-edged dialogs gather speed even in this early scene and don't let up through the very end.
The same can be said of the director, Fincher: the relatively conservative (with the exception of The Winklevoss Twins were played by actors who don't look like one another.
The face of one was laid on top of the other with the help of computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara got the lead role in Fincher's next film, "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo."
DIRECTOR David Fincher
STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Armie Hammer, John Pence
PLOT: The sullen and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, who can't make any personal headway, struggles in the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, his relationships with his few friends and companions start to fall apart, ultimately resulting in legal proceedings.
The color palette plays a role: it's warm, at times sunny, and even in the dark it's still cozy. It weaves between two tangled chains of events and two separate lawsuits.
Beyond the unceasing stream of discussions, not much happens in the film: there's not a single death or murder, and even Zuckerberg's legal battles would hardly be likely to make for an additional paragraph in his small Wikipedia page.
So what attracted the 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this story, despite being rather short on details?
After watching The Social Network, you get a strong feeling that the film is a portrait of our times and that its incompleteness is, in this case, an important artistic device.
Twenty or so years ago, Wall Street did approximately the same thing, only at a larger scale with its astronomically large deals.
Now, when the daily financial turnover is even higher, the politics is played out on beaches rather than in conference rooms.
Zuckerberg wants to be special and dreams of being the center of attention.
Saverin (Garfield) is hurt by the fact that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and that now he has no one to play with.
Meanwhile, the Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence) throw a tantrum. Who said that rich, handsome, sporty people also have to be smart?
(Fincher is particularly entertained by this storyline.)
If the filmmakers had wanted to, they could have easily made The Social Network into a dark comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of being popular and at the head of the pack — but is what's he's doing ultimately more good or bad?
And what are the social consequences that will be brought about by his invention?
Is he a scammer?
Does he cleverly manipulate other people?
Fincher and Sorkin don't wrap things up while there's still at least a hint of something of the kind.
But here that isn't even necessary: in their version of the story, it's completely unimportant.
"How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people?" The Beatles ask in their song "Baby You're a Rich Man," which runs over the credits.
The protagonist has no idea.
The film suggests an answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of a lost, online generation with a weak conception of beauty and even weaker one of feelings.
This character drama about a sensational lawsuit of the internet era is made with good taste
At the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin was alive, surnames for people of humble origin had not yet begun to appear in earnest.
People got by with names like "so-and-so, son of so-and-so".
That is, patronymics were in use — names after one's father.
And sometimes, for example in the case of a father having multiple marriages, matronymics were used — names after one's mother.
Susanin is one such case: "Ivan, son of Susanna".
Serfs of small landowners got by without surnames for a long time – why have them when you have 20 souls and all are constantly in view.
But the owners of many-thousand estates were obliged to give their serfs surnames.
As such, the serfs of prince Andrey Cherkassky as early as the beginning of the 18th century had a surname each.
In the 19th century, even small landowners would not keep a serf on the land, but release them for tributes — let them earn by a trade and pay their lord.
Such a serf was due a passport, in which a surname had to be written.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs had been released for tributes.
And that means they already had surnames.
Capital criminologists flew to Novosibirsk to investigate an explosion
Criminologists of the central apparatus and forensic center staff arrived in Novosibirsk to help investigate the case of the gas explosion in the house at Lineynaya, 39, the NGS reports.
According to the investigators, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Evgeny Kavun, presented themselves as employees of the made-up organisation "Mezhregiongaz", inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used spare parts of low quality, worked sloppily, and on the contrary raised the prices for their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineynaya, a man and a woman visited three apartments of house No. 39, where they changed stove hoses.
In one of the apartments, they installed a hose for water instead of for gas.
However, Kavun denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a gas leak and an explosion of a gas-and-air mix in one of the apartments.
Two entrances were destroyed – one completely, and the second partly.
This led to a significant destruction of the building, as a result of which 13 people were killed.
Earlier, suspects in the case of the building explosion in Novosibirsk were arrested.
The swindlers came from Omsk.
A sea surge flood was averted in Petersburg

Flooding was prevented thanks to closing the dam a day earlier.
On Friday in Saint Petersburg there was a sharp increase in the risk of flooding due to bad weather in the city.
A sea surge flood was successfully prevented thanks to timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could have become the 32nd, Petersburg's Neva.Today publication reported.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to closure of the floodgates in the Gulf of Finland, the water remained at the 168-centimeter marker, which is just seven centimeters above the bottom threshold for dangerous flooding (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds at speeds of up to 20-25 meters per second.
The dam has now been reopened, the water level has lowered, and vessels can once again traverse the Gulf of Finland.
We note that the situation with the water level is tracked by ten meteorological stations on the eastern site of the Gulf of Finland.
This enables the prevention of flooding that may follow strong wind.
8 people were arrested in Turkey over defects in collapsed buildings
Eight people have been arrested in the Turkish province of Sanliurfa in connection with construction defects discovered in buildings that collapsed due to an earthquake.
According to Armenpress, this is reported by Habertürk.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20,000 people were killed.
The number injured exceeds 80,000.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7-point earthquake was followed by hundreds of underground aftershocks that were felt not only in 10 Turkish provinces, but also in neighboring Syria.
Pashinyan sent a congratulatory message to the supreme leader of Iran and the president of the country
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan sent a congratulatory message to the supreme leader of the Islamic revolution, Sayyid Ali Khamenei, and the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
Armenpress was informed of this by the Information and Public Relations Department of the Armenian prime minister's executive office.
The message to the supreme leader of the Islamic revolution of Iran, Sayyid Ali Khamenei, says:
"Your Eminence,
I sincerely congratulate you on the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Warm and friendly Armenian-Iranian relations with centuries-long roots, rich history and traditions have special significance for our two countries.
More than three decades have passed since diplomatic relations were established between the Republic of Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are witnesses to steadfast and stable mutual cooperation.
I am sure that Armenian-Iranian friendly relations strengthened in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust will achieve even more for the benefit of the Armenian and Iranian peoples in the future.
I take this opportunity to wish you strong health and a long life."
The congratulatory message sent to Ebrahim Raisi says in particular: "Your Excellency, accept our heartfelt congratulations and best wishes to you and the friendly people of Iran on the occasion of the 44th anniversary of the victory of the Islamic Revolution.
Founded on centuries of history and mutual respect, the inviolable Armenian-Iranian relationship has special significance for the Republic of Armenia.
I am sure that as a result of mutual efforts, we will succeed in bringing to a new level our bilateral cooperation, the multi-sectoral agenda of which will be expanded even more for the benefit of the wellbeing of our two friendly peoples and the security of our countries.
Underscoring the importance of our vision for establishing and strengthening regional peace and stability, I confirm the official invitation to visit Iran addressed to you during my visit to Tehran.
I take this opportunity to wish you new achievements, and the friendly people of Iran – stable peace."

In the port town of Great Yarmouth in England, a WW2-era aviation bomb that sappers were trying to defuse exploded.
The powerful explosion was heard dozens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk county police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel defusing the bomb were harmed.
"The device detonated soon after work to defuse it began.
Fortunately, the entire team is unhurt.
The department has begun evaluating the damage," the assistant to the head of Norfolk Police, Nick Davison, told journalists.
Local residents write in social networks that the explosion shook houses 24 km away.

The 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction works on the bank of the river Yar, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea shore, Great Yarmouth is located.
Before starting to attempt to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protection embankment around it made of sand, and the security perimeter, which unauthorized people were not permitted to enter, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
Explosives experts initially, on Thursday, were preparing to cut the fuse from the bomb, but the attempt did not succeed, and then they decided to use the "slow-burn" explosive technique, local media report.
The explosion occurred during this burning.
Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain during WW2.
In the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from the autumn of 1940 through the spring of 1941 alone, known as the Blitz, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Almost 40% of Belarusian researchers are women
In Belarus the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, the National Academy of Sciences Sociology Institute research associate Alesya Solovey told BELTA.
The share of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: women account for 41.1% of candidates of sciences and 21% of doctors of sciences.
In all academic fields, except for technical ones, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized field of academic knowledge is medical sciences, where the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Men dominate only in technical sciences: women account for 26.7%
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1% — which is 10.2% more than in the republic overall.
Among candidates of sciences the proportion is 46% and among doctors of sciences it is 20%.
In higher education institutes, more than half of the academic staff are women (57%).
Women account for a third of vice rectors in scientific, pedagogical and educational work (31.8%), 38.7% of deans, 44.6% of vice deans, and 42.5% of department heads.
The highest proportion of women is among senior teachers and teachers — more than 60%.
There is a high proportion of women among associate professors in faculty staff (55.2%).
According to the republic's public opinion monitoring conducted last year by the the National Academy of Sciences Sociology Institute, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's capabilities in science.
63.5% do not agree to some extent with the gender stereotype that "science is a men's profession" (56.5% of men and 69% of women).
More than half of the country's residents do not support the opinion that women are less competent as scientists - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"Transformation in the mass consciousness of gender perceptions about the research competence of women fosters the attraction of young women to science, development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful female scientist role model, including by sharing experience and mentoring," Alesya Solovey said.
The International Day of Women and Girls in Science is marked annually on February 11.
The holiday was founded to attract women and girls to science, to encourage women to develop a scientific career, and to recognize women in science.
According to UNESCO data, women account for 30% of the total number of researchers worldwide.-0-
The key rate is more likely to be raised than lowered in the future
So said Russian Central Bank head Elvira Nabiullina after the February 10 meeting of its Board of Directors decided to keep the said rate at the level of 7.5%.
In particular, the head of the regulator noted that important changes had recently taken place.
On the one hand, external trade conditions noticeably worsened – the price of Russian oil fell.
On the other, the economic situation is turning out better than October's forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing, but budget expenditures are growing.
At the same time, inflationary risks have increased overall.
"Therefore, this year it is more likely that the rate will be raised than lowered.
The appropriateness of a change to the rate will be determined by how the situation develops," E. Nabiullina said.
Besides the more pronounced influence of budget policy, she noted three risks.
Firstly, rapid unraveling of consumption in conditions of high inflationary expectations, in the event that factors that restrain consumption activity weaken.
Secondly, growing labor shortages and the lag in labor productivity growth relative to salary increases.
And also the risk of additional toughening of sanctions remains.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the head of the Central Bank of Russia noted that despite the aforementioned strengthening of inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for this year remains at the level of 5%-7%.
She said this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than was expected in October.
In the CB's updated forecast for this and next year, the ranges for average raising of the key rate are half a percentage point higher, up to 7.0%-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5%-7.5% pr annum for 2024.
"This does not exclude the possibility of lowering the rate this year, but its likelihood and scale are reduced.
And on the contrary, the likelihood has grown that some raising of the rate may be needed, so that in 2024 inflation meets the goal of near 4%," the Bank of Russia head concluded.
The Bank of Russia approved the requirements for the procedure to create special closed-end mutual funds consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator says that these securities will be separated from the composition of current retail mutual funds.
This facilitates launching management of the remaining liquid shares and renewing operations with investment shares.
If blocked securities account for more than 10% of a mutual fund's portfolio, the management company must allocate them to a separate closed-end mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be given a share of the new fund equal to their share in the main fund.
Changing the status from a retail fund to a closed-end fund is also possible.
For funds where the proportion of blocked shares is less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked shares into a separate closed-end mutual fund.
In addition, the requirement to inform shareholders of the consequences of allocating blocked securities to a special mutual fund is being introduced.
In the future, when such securities are traded, the management company will be obliged to pay investment share owners no less than 90% of the proceeds quarterly, the Bank of Russia's message says.
In addition to summing up the sector's results, experts also gave forecasts for this year.
According to data from Promsvyazbank's Center for Analysis and Expertise, airline passenger miles in Russia fell by 6.3% in 2022 and passenger traffic declined by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic was 95.2 mln people, and passenger miles amounted to 228.0 bln passenger kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 mln people, which is 26.7% lower than the level of the preceding year, while internal traffic was 78.0 mln people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that government support programs influenced the sector's relative stability.
A program to stimulate domestic tourism was in effect in 2022, with 38.8 bln rubles allocated to it.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights, organized by Rostourism.
Several state support programs were implemented to ensure the affordability of air transportation, including subsidized transportation for citizens, the development of regional transportation and so on, with a combined budget of more than 27.5 bln rubles.
In Q2 2022, the government decided to allocate airlines an additional 100 bln rubles and increase the capital of Aeroflot by 52.5 bln rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation sector, thanks to the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, and also the continued state subsidizing of the sector, passenger traffic in 2023, according to our estimates, will grow by 6.4%, to 101.2 mln people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 mln people), and by Rosaviation's forecast, to 103.0 mln people," forecast PSB analysts.
Terror attack in Jerusalem, 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, became victims of a terror attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Another six people were injured.
The car's driver was shot at the scene.
Later it emerged that it was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement authorities classified his actions as a terror attack, the terrorist's relatives were arrested, and their house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli mass media, the attacker had mental health problems, and had just been released from hospital this week.
Austria is toughening checks on the border with Hungary after the latest inflow of migrants in recent months.
Bureaucrats say that many people remain at the border in vehicles waiting to cross to the Austrian side.
As such, this is becoming a signal from the Austrian authorities that they did not go through the procedure to receive refuge in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where they submitted their application.
At the same time, Austrian authorities consider it incorrect to automatically send back those who want to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
This is why, in the opinion of the police, strengthened checks are needed.
The decision to tighten checks on Vienna's part followed a promise by European Union leaders to allocate more funds to cameras, drones, and watchtowers to guard the union's borders.
According to data of the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants arriving in the EU and requesting refugee status exceeded 2016 numbers for the first time and amounted to more than 330,000.
Progress 83 cargo ship successfully docked to the ISS
The Progress 83 uncrewed resupply spaceship successfully docked to the International Space Station on Saturday at 3:45 Greenwich time, having completed a two-day orbital flight.
The docking took place at a height of 269 statute miles above the southern part of the Pacific Ocean.
The NASA flight control center in Houston, Texas state, conducted transmission of the docking.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by Mission Control Specialists.
Cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina greeted the cargo ship from on board the ISS.
The Progress MS-22 spaceship delivered more than 2500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and also about 1354 kg of dry cargo.
The space ship also delivered food for the Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully took off from the Russian cosmodrome Baikonor on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was prepared for undocking from the ISS and subsequent flooding on February 18.
The company's press service clarified that the transition hatch of the spaceship was promptly closed: "Progress MS-21 was isolated from the overall volume of the ISS.
The reasons for the depressurization are being investigated."
MCC also said that the ISS crew were not in any danger: "The temperature and pressure on board the station remain satisfactory.
The life and health of the crew are not in any danger, they feel fine."
"Birth tourism cases have become more frequent."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Argentinean migration service began to suspend and cancel residency permits of Russians who received them through childbirth but did not stay to live in the country.
Earlier, authorities of the republic refused entrance into the country to several pregnant Russian women who they suspected of arriving for the purpose of "birth tourism".
On February 11 they were admitted into Argentina by a court decision, however.
Read more in the Gazeta.Ru report.
The Argentinean migration service began to suspend and cancel residency permits of Russians who received them through childbirth but did not remain to live in the country.
Service director Florencia Carignano told the C5N TV channel about it.
"What we are doing is suspending the residency permit of those Russians who came to receive residency because their child is Argentinean, but who spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the court will consider the question of Argentinean citizenship for a Russian, the migration service will provide information that the residency permit was suspended, because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never returned".
Carignano warned that the residency permit of Russians who received it after childbirth and then left may be cancelled.
On this backdrop, on February 9 it emerged that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" in an airport in Argentina due to being refused entry into the country.
According to the head of the consular section of the Russian embassy in Argentina, George Polin, the diplomatic mission connects the incident to the republic's authorities possibly considering the information provided by the young women upon entry to be incomplete or false.
One of them flew in on February 7, another two on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reported.
The diplomat emphasized that more pregnant women had flown to Argentina, but an order denying entrance into the country had been issued specifically for these three.
"They were not permitted into the country in accordance migration law, where one of the grounds for refusing entrance into the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentinean migration service permitted the pregnant Russian citizens to enter the country according to a court ruling, lawyer Christian Rubilar said.
"An hour ago they were all permitted to enter Argentina," TASS quoted him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court's ruling.
For foreign parents of a child born in Argentina, it is easier to receive a passport of the republic.
It allows brief visa-free trips to 171 countries, including EU states, the UK and Japan, RBK notes.
At the beginning of January 2023, the newspaper The Guardian wrote about the "birth tourism boom" in Argentina among Russians.
According to Polin, in 2022, from 2000 to 2500 Russian citizens moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, were Russian women planning to give birth there.
"In 2023 this number may grow to 10,000," he said.
In turn, Carignano earlier said that about 10,500 Russian citizens had arrived in Argentina in 2022, and in recent months — more than 5800 pregnant women.
On February 9, it was revealed how housing rental prices in Petersburg have changed.
They became cheaper by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that nationwide, rent became more expensive by 25%, Patrol Petersburg reported, citing RBK.
At the beginning of 2023, the average monthly rent for an apartment in Saint Petersburg was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room flat cost 25,000 per month, a studio — 22,000 rubles per month, a two-roomer — 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change as soon as spring, when many citizens who have been abroad return home.
The reasons for women's questioning in a foreign country have become known.
The Argentinean migration service did not admit six pregnant Russian women into the country because the purpose that they stated for their visit turned out to be false.
So reports TASS, citing the Todo Noticias television channel.
Over the course of five hours the pregnant women were questioned about the purpose of their visit.
The majority of them admitted that they came to the foreign state to give birth.
Because of this, the country's representatives did not allow the Russian women into Argentina.
As stated in the publication, the migration service has a procedure to follow if there is suspicion of "false" tourists.
As such, if it can be seen that a woman is in the 33rd week of pregnancy, does not have a return ticket to Russia, and also cannot clearly talk about where she is going on vacation, she immediately falls under the suspicion of the migration service.
Besides that, specialists say it is difficult to be a tourist "in these conditions".
Actor's decision to leave theater was planned.
State Award of the Russian Federation laureate Alexander Filippenko announced that the Mossovet theater's decision not to extend his contract was planned, and besides, everything was agreed with senior management.
He told the Interfax agency about this in an interview.
Actors from the second cast were invited into the play that he was in.
The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract ended back in 2022.
All the details were agreed with theater representatives.
Besides that, everyone knew that the star did not intend to extend his contract.
Filippenko noted that senior management made a compromise and prepared all the documents.
As such, he assured that "nobody let anybody down".
It also emerged that the actor had emigrated from Russia.
He flew to Latvia to his daughter.
Filippenko plans to undergo "extended treatment" in the foreign country.
As reported in the publication, at present the cinema actor works for the Moscow theater as a guest actor.
According to the publication's information, at Mossovet he performed in plays including "Shakespearehamlet" and "The Taming of the Shrew", "Uncle Vanya", and also "Three Sisters".
340,000 cubic meters of snow was removed from private property in the Kalininsky administrative district on Friday, February 10
This was announced by the city's mayor.
In the Kalininsky district there are currently more than 400 private-sector streets from which snow must be cleared each spring.
The roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first ends on February 15, and the second runs from March 1 to April 15.

Kirkorov won court case against fisherman
The man's lawsuit accused the artist of illegal construction, but he did not appear at the hearing.
A fisherman took the musical artist Filipp Kirkorov to court over an allegedly illegally constructed pier at his country house outside Moscow.
So reports Channel 5.
Nonetheless, the Saratov fisherman did not manage to win the case.
Odintsovo city court considered the complaint against the singer. According to the artist, design documents provided to the court confirmed the legality of all constructions built on the star's territory.
Law firm head Alexander Dobrovinsky said the pier deprived the plaintiff of fishing access.
The claim against the performer was submitted on January 11.
The celebrity lawyer joked that the man probably planned to catch fish exclusively from the artist's home.
Dobrovinsky ironically added that he'll ask Kirkorov to give the plaintiff his balcony for fishing.
He said a spinning reel can be cast even further from that spot.
Сомнолог назвала причины проблем со сном
Врач-сомнолог София Черкасова рассказал о продуктах питания и привычках, Которые мешают здоровому сну.
Как отметила специалист, проблемы со сном часто возникают из-за продуктов, содержащих кофеин.
Речь идет в первую очередь о чае, кофе, шоколаде и любых содержащих какао десертах.
Их употребление перед сном стоит ограничивать, поскольку они не только мешают засыпанию, но и делают сон "рваным", а значит не дающим организму полноценно восстановиться.
По словам врача, употребление кофеинсодержащих продуктов лучше прекратить за 6-8 часов до сна.
В противном случае они способствуют снижению порога возбудимости нервной системы и как следствие - возникают сложности с засыпанием.
Негативно влияет на возможность заснуть и алкоголь.
Врач уточняет, что небольшие дозы алкогольных напитков способствуют расслаблению и не влияют на сон.
Однако количества, превышающие 36 грамм в перерасчете на чистый алкоголь, ведут к различным нарушениям сна, таким как поверхностный сон и частые ночные пробуждения.
Кроме того, для предотвращения проблем с засыпанием сомнолог рекомендует отказаться от острой пищи объемных порций.
Большие объемы и острая еда способствуют повышению внутренней температуры тела, что негативно влияет на способность погрузиться в сон.
Для здорового сна необходимо не только соблюдение внешнего температурного режима: оптимальной является температура воздуха 18-20 градусов - но и отсутствие повышенной температуры тела.
По мнению Черкасовой не стоит перед сном злоупотреблять и тяжелой пищей, поскольку она не даст организму полноценно восстановиться и отдохнуть: он будет вынужден тратить силы на пищеварение.
Врач также напомнила, что отсутствие здорового сна и накопленный недосып влияют на качество жизни и привычную деятельность, поэтому крайне важно придерживаться режима сна и отдыха и позволять организму восстанавливаться.
Bloomberg named Trump's competitor in the upcoming presidential elections: World: Politics: INFOX.ru
In the agency's opinion, the former president's main competitor in the upcoming elections will be Florida governor Ron DeSantis.
The Republican DeSantis has not yet officially announced his intention to run for the presidency, but Bloomberg's sources say he is already getting ready for the primaries.
According to the agency's information, DeSantis's team is already choosing consultants to participate in the presidential elections and conducing preliminary surveys.
In confirmation of this, Bloomberg reports that a retreat is planned for Republican party leaders and government officials at the end of February.
The agency reports that the Florida governor's team is seeking support among fellow Republicans from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and other states. Bloomberg experts name DeSantis as Donald Trump's main potential competitor.
Experts consider the current governor of Florida to be well enough known to not have to start his election campaign right now, and they also note his fundraising ability.
Ron DeSantis was a supporter backing Donald Trump for the presidency in 2017, but at the upcoming presidential elections in November 2024 he may give him some competition.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for the presidency "to make America great again"... during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
Current president Joe Biden, despite his team's assurances of intending to take part in the 60th presidential elections, announced that he has not yet made up his mind.
Hundreds of demonstrations against pension reform will take place on Saturday in France
French trade unions will conduct their fourth day of mass protests against pension reform on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French mass media report.
After some reduction in the number of protest participants last Tuesday compared with the first two "days of mobilization", the trade unions hope to draw a larger number of protesters to the streets, taking account of those citizens who were unable to participate in demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement bodies expect from 600,000 to 800,000 demonstrators across the country, including from 90,000 to 120,000 in Paris, the mass media report.
On February 7, 757,000 people participated in protests against pension reform, according to the French interior ministry's information.
The largest trade union organization — the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) – announced that there were 2 mln demonstrators.
Also, according to CGT's estimations, 400,000 demonstrators came out on the streets of Paris on Tuesday.
The police say there were 57,000.
On the previous day of protests, January 31, the number of demonstrators was 1.27 mln people according to the police's estimation, and 2.8 mln according to the trade unions' information.
The next mass protest actions are planned for February 16.
As reported, on January 10 French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne presented the government's pension reform plan, which calls for raising the pension age from 62 to 64.
The set age threshhold to go on the pension is supposed to gradually rise from 62 to 64 by three months per year, and this process will continue until 2030.
The new system will be applied starting from the generation of French people born in September 1961 or later.
French President Emmanuel Macron announced during his election campaign in 2022 that he was prepared to conduct pension reform through to the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the National Assembly of France began considering the government's pension reform plan.

Progress MS-21 depressurization occurred at the ISS: February 12, 2023, 12:12 A.M.
TASS – KAZINFORM – Roscosmos announced the depressurization of the Progress MS-21, which was preparing to undock from the ISS, the Kazinform international news agency reports, citing TASS.
"The circuit of the Progress MS-21 cargo transportation spaceship, which was planned to be sunk on February 18, is depressurized, confirmed by telemetry data received by MCC," the Roscosmos press service said.
As noted, it is currently isolated from the rest of the space station.
The reasons for the incident are being investigated, it did not affect the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the ISS's planned flight program.
The executive director for piloted spaceflight programs at Roscosmos, Sergey Krikalev, commented on the situation.
"Insulation fluid leaked from the coolant system in the cargo spaceship, which has already been docked at the space station for several months.
A similar situation occurred with a spaceship (Soyuz MS-22 – TASS note) in mid-December," he said, having  noted that the commission that analyzed the Soyuz incident came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to make sure there are no problems with future launches.
"We need to undertake a deep analysis to make sure the cause does not extend to similar constructions for future launches.
That's the most important task before us now," he said.
According to the executive director, analysis must be conducted from the point of view of a ship's readiness for takeoff, the materials used, and the technologies used when assembling the radiator.
Such an analysis was conducted with the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 space ship.
"The most important thing is to make sure there is no systematic error," Krikalev added.
The executive director specified that the commission to analyze all the possible reasons started work on Saturday.
"The space ship was supposed to undock and go out of orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz space ship (Soyuz MS-23 — TASS note), so serious consequences for the crew's actions, for the crew's work ... From this point of view it has no affect on the program," Krikalev said.
The Progress MS-21 cargo ship was launched from Baikonur on the Soyuz-2.1a carrier rocket on October 26.
Two days later, it docked to the small research module Poisk on the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered more than 2500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA identified the Progress leak spot
The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo space ship at the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the insulation system.
So said a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during talks with the ISS crew, telecast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA information, the coolant liquid leak from the Progress has been stopped.
NASA believes all the coolant leaked out.
"This morning we had a coolant leak from the insulation system in space, the coolant leak has stopped," an MCC representative said (quoted by Interfax).
Earlier, the Progress circuit was isolated due to the depressurization.
Roscosmos said the cosmonauts were in no danger.
"Progress MS-22 docked to the ISS today, February 11, we will take it out of orbit, as planned, on February 18.
The Coordinator for Strategic Communications at the U.S. National Security Council, John Kirby, refused to announce U.S. President Joe Biden's possible trip to Ukraine.

A day earlier, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20-22.
A representative of the administration said that during the trip the U.S. president will discuss bilateral cooperation with the Polish leadership, and also collective efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities.
Earlier, Kirby said that Biden will visit Ukraine when the time is right, but that now was not the time for official visits.
A fitness expert spoke about training outdoors in the winter to lose weight
A fitness expert said winter walks are an excellent way to slim without intensive workouts
Fitness expert Anthony Ang spoke of effective interval training outdoors for weight loss.
His comments are published on the Eat This, Not That portal.
The specialist said active winter walks are an excellent way to lose weight without intensive workouts, and also improve the cardiovascular system and psychological health.
"Walk at a normal pace for the first five-ten minutes to warm up the body and joints.
Then walk for one minute as fast as you can without breaking into a run.
One minute at a normal pace," Ang explains.
Three sets must be done.
The specialist went on to recommend doing lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, then walking at a comfortable speed for another 45 seconds.
This sequence needs to be repeated five times. After that, Ang suggests alternating active stepping (two minutes) and calm stepping (one minute) three more times.
Complete the walk with a five-minute walk at a calm pace and some stretching exercises.
This entire workout takes 35 minutes in the fresh air.
Earlier, the athletics Master of Sport Maxim Babenko-Kudryavtsev, speaking to Lenta.ru, gave advice on choosing gear for winter runs.
"Thermal underwear, moisture-wicking things, special light but warm headwear are needed.
Footwear for winter runs is distinguished by thicker material, a higher platform and heel protector," the sportsman said.

Deputy CEO of Russian Railways suggests developing new markets to the governor of Irkutsk region
Irkutsk region needs to continue developing alternative markets besides the Far East.
This is the internal market, and Western ports, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
The deputy CEO of Russian Railways, Alexey Shilo, made this suggestion at a meeting with governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reports on February 10, 2023.
"As last year's experience showed, even regardless of the geographical location of Irkutsk region, the said solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that companies' logistics services constantly cooperate with our 'partners' (ports, operators, marine transport) and find optimal price conditions for transporting their production in new ways," Alexey Shilo emphasized.
The governor noted the importance of stability in dispatching production, Irkutsk region is one of the richest regions of Russia in terms of mineral resources and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises extract coal on the territory of the region.
Instability in dispatching production for export has a negative effect on the financial-economic activity of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the monthly quotas for transporting forestry and metallurgical industrial production in the region to a level that ensures the stable functioning of the enterprises.
"Understanding the importance of Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do all we can to support transportation volumes.
If additional shipment volumes appear on the domestic market, we will also be prepared to assist in this area," Alexey Shilo said.
Konstantin Zaytsev had a meeting with active citizens of Granovshchina and Khomutovo
On orders of regional head Igor Kobzev, Angara regional government head Konstantin Zaytsev worked today in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo.
In the village of Granovshchina, the Government Chairman got acquainted with the work of a new educational institute — Granovsky school, which opened in September 2022.
The facility was created in the framework of the federal Modern School project of the national Education project.
The eight school buildings contain: classrooms, a canteen, a catering unit, an assembly hall, two sports halls, club rooms, a library, administrative premises, toilets, shared recreation space, and a medical unit.
For construction, 240.8 mln rubles was allocated from the federal budget, another 512 mln rubles of regional funds and more than 72 mln rubles from the municipality.
In addition, a regional subsidy of 64.2 mln rubles was allocated to purchase equipment.
After the opening of the school, besides children from the village of Granovshchina, children from Urikovskaya school also studied at the school while theirs was undergoing refurbishment.
More than 100 teachers lead classes, 90 of whom are subject teachers.
In 2022, the school was allocated a bus that was purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade under a federal program.
The refurbishment of the Khomutovo primary general educational school No. 2 began in 2022.
Primary class pupils were assigned to Khomutovo school No. 1, and the senior classes study in the second building of school No. 2
According to the renovation plan, here the roof, utility systems, windows and associated elements will be replaced, the facade will be renovated, and interior finishings will be fitted.
An important component of the refurbishment is the restoration of the heating point for water heating, instead of the dry heat that had been used.
The cost of all works is more than 80 mln rubles.
The renovation is at the stage of completion, there are problems with connecting to the electricity network: it is necessary to increase power, and work is under way with the energy supply organization.
In Granovshchina and in Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaytsev also met with citizens to some of whom builders had sold houses illegally connected to the electricity network.
It was decided that the network company will organize a personal reception next week for the legal resolution of these matters.
"Often the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population usually uses electrical energy for heating.
So sellers sometimes independently connect houses to the nearest network, but that is grounds for cutting off the electricity supply.
For this reason, network companies on those territories where active construction is under way must pay special attention to this issue," Konstantin Zaytsev stressed.
Anatoly Prokopyev evaluated the efficacy of state support measures for peasant farms in Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug
Ust-Orda Buryat Okrug head Anatoly Prokopyev visited three peasant farms in Ekhirit-Bulagatsky district.
Kapsal village peasant farm head Yulia Madayeva received a grant to develop her farm as a novice farmer in 2014.
One of the main focuses of the farm's activity is livestock production.
With every year the herd grows and the gross amount of meat and milk produced doubles.
Later, in 2019, thanks to state support, there was an opportunity to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies to develop the family milk livestock farm.
Currently the farm's livestock consists of 150 heads of cattle, 60 of which are cows.
Grain crops are also grown here, annual fodder crops are sown.
Thanks to Viktor Katanayev's peasant farm's activity, the Kharyashino locality in the village of Kulunkun was given the status of a population point.
The farm raises and fattens dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received to develop the family milk cattle farm by 60 heads.
Currently the farm's herd numbers 150 heads of cattle.
Potato has also been grown here for many years.
The peasant farm's management is trying to create all the necessary conditions for work and habitation for employees.
There is now an entire village on the territory of the farm.
Anatoly Prokopyev has personally taken charge of constructing 2 km of road from the Kharyashino locality to Ust-Ordinsky.
The main sphere of activity of Stalina Mogzoyeva's peasant farm in the village of Otonkhoy is breeding large cattle and buffalo.
In 2020, the farm participated in a competitive selection process and received an AGROSTARTUP grant to develop the peasant farm for meat production.
The funds were used to buy a tractor trailer, two balers and a mower.
The head of the farm boosts cattle numbers every year and increases gross production of meat.
The farm also sows annual feed crops on 40 ha.
Svetlana Mogzoyeva plans to open a feedlot.
After visiting the three farms, the district head noted that state support measures are effective, needed, and necessary.
"The Irkutsk regional government pays a lot of attention to agriculture.
That is why government support must be preserved, and also increased and raised.
We, in turn, must guarantee production safety.
Agricultural producers of the district fulfill this role with honor," Anatoly Prokopyev emphasized.
Armenian-Turkish border crossing opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alidzhan border point on the border of Turkey and Armenia opened for the first time in three decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
This was reported by Turkish and Armenian mass media.
The Turkish Anadolu agency notes that this very crossing was used for the delivery of humanitarian aid after the destructive earthquake in 1988.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicine, water, and other packages of emergency aid to the city of Adiyaman in the south of Turkey, Ankara's special representative for Armenian-Turkish negotiations Serdar Kylych said.
He expressed thanks to the vice speaker of the Armenian parliament, Ruben Rubinyan, and Armenian deputy foreign affairs minister Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help sent by the Armenian people to ease the suffering of our people in the region that suffered from the earthquake," Kylych wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenian foreign ministry press secretary Vahan Unanyan in turn said that the humanitarian aid trucks crossed the border via the Margara bridge and were on their way to the earthquake-affected region.
Public Radio of Armenia reports that the last time a vehicle crossed the Margara bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu agency provides different information and writes that the Margara-Alidzhan border point was last used to deliver humanitarian cargo to Armenia to limit the damage of the destructive earthquake of 1988.
Aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone at that time.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to areas that suffered from the earthquake.
According to the latest information, more than 25,000 people were killed in Turkey and Syria due to the devastating earthquake on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on February 11 that 21,848 fatalities were known of in Turkey.
3553 fatalities were reported from the Syrian side.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are marred most of all by Ankara's refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also its support for Baku during the First and Second Nagorno-Karabakh wars.
Recently Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who have met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul were renewed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening a land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

"Fernandez is Makelele plus Lampard.
If you need him in the Makelele position he can play very well.
This guy can also smell the goal, good shot from outside the box so if you need him behind the striker, Lampard or Essien, he can do it," Crespo told British media.

Prediction for the Real vs Al Hilal Club World Cup game on February 11, 2023
The final of the football Club World Cup takes place on February 11 in the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in the Moroccan city of Rabat.
Madrid's Real meet Al Hilal of Saudi Arabia in the game for the trophy.
The game starts at 10 P.M. Moscow time, and the matchtv.ru website and the Match! Football 2 TV channel will show a live telecast at 9:55 P.M. Moscow time.
BETCITY bookmaker company analysts consider the "Blancos" to be huge favorites: bets can be placed for a Real victory with a 1.28 coefficient in normal time with a probability of approximately 77%.
Success for the nominal guests is available at 11.0 (8%).
Even for a draw there is a significantly lower quote of 6.10 (15%).
Do you believe the teams will not determine who is stronger in 90 minutes?
Betting 1000 rubles on a "peaceful" result in the event of a win yields 6100 rubles.
Betting for the madrileños' triumph taking into account extra time and a series of penalties can be done at 1.14, and for Al Hilal this market goes for 5.80.
In their journey to the final, the team from Saudi Arabia overcame two rounds, beat Moroccan Wydad in a series of penalties and Brazilian Flamengo in normal time (3:2).
Betting on the outsider not losing to the Europeans in 90 minutes is possible for 3.90.
Analysts anticipate a large number of goals: a total of more than 2.5 goals is available for 1.53, and TM 2.5 for 2.60.
The Blancos clearly outclass their rival, whose team, according to the statistical website Transfermarkt, is just 39.6 min euros.
For comparison: the roster of Real is valued at 849 mln euros.
In addition, to Al Hilal's horror, the madrileños' main striker and current Golden Ball holder Karim Benzema will recuperate by the final.
But even without the Frenchman, Real has played effectively: in the semi-final they destroyed Egyptian Al Ahly 4:1.
The Arabs' games also turned out to be quite vivid: in the 1/4 final they achieved a 1:1 draw and victory in a series of penalties, and in the semifinal — a dramatic 3:2.
Recommended bet: Real's victory and TB 2.5 for 1.76.
Guberniev spoke out about midfielder Pavel Mamayev's decision to end his playing career.
The renowned TV commentator Dmitry Guberniev spoke out about midfielder Pavel Mamayev's decision to end his playing career.
"Now a bust of him can be cast in his home town.
He made a big mistake and for the majority of people he remains in people's memory not as a footballer, but as a lawbreaking footballer.
But he's nothing compared with Kokorin.
Because nobody squandered their potential like Kokorin.
With all his talents, Mamayev was periodically outstanding.
I can only wish him success and self-realization somewhere else," Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev as saying.
The 34-year-old midfielder's last club was Khimki.
The Moscow-area club did not extend the contract with the halfback in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamayev played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar, and Rostov.
Mamayev is a Russian champion, a three-time winner of the Russian Cup, and a two-time winner of the country's Supercup in the CSKA team.

Numerous landscapes by the artist, full of unusual light, are displayed at the exhibition.
They seem to glow from within.
The nature of the Far East, Vologda area and, of course, Bashkiria, the artist's second home, inspire N. Alexeyeva to create wonderful canvases.

Spanish port denied entry to tanker with diesel from formerly Russia-flagged ship
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Marine under the Spanish Ministry of Transport denied the Maersk Magellan ship entry to the city's port to unload diesel fuel, because the cargo is from the ship Nobel, which was under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport announced.
"The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Marine under the Spanish Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development denied the Singapore-flagged Maersk Magellan ship entry to the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel, because the cargo that it carries came from the Cameroon-flagged Nobel, which was under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022," the ministry's statement says.
The measure was taken in accordance with the legislation of the European Union, which forbids access to any ship registered under the Russian flag after April 16, 2022 or having changed the flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that a check was conducted on February 9, after which the ban was agreed.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first instance when ships have been refused entry to Spanish ports.
In April 2022, access to the Barcelona port was refused to the Maltese-flagged Black Star, which carried cargo from a Russian-flagged ship.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russia sanctions, the EU, USA and UK introduced restrictions on Russian oil products deliveries, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
A ceiling price introduced by unfriendly countries on shipping deliveries of oil from Russia has been in effect since December 5, 2022.
The ceiling price for Russian oil was then set at $60/barrel.
An EU embargo on shipping deliveries of oil from Russia has also been in effect since December 5.
Pregnant Russians' problems entering Argentina explained
According to a specialist, on the backdrop of an influx of those wishing to give birth in Argentina, the country's authorities began to more attentively monitor foreign citizens' entry.
The pregnant Russians' difficulties entering are associated with the country's authorities not wanting an influx of foreigners wishing to receive citizenship for their children and residency for themselves, then leaving.
Lenta.ru reports this, citing Saint Petersburg State University professor Viktor Kheyfets, editor-in-chief of the magazine Latin America.
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of the country being turned into a transit point, and not into a final one.
That concerns those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child keeps Argentinian citizenship, but a decision to provide the parents with an Argentinian passport after receiving residency is up to the court.
In the event that it is determined that they in fact did not live in Argentina but left immediately, they can be refused citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but to citizens of other countries.
Recently, the specialist said, birth tourism to Argentina has been particularly popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
To recap, Argentina provides citizenship by the "law of the soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
An Argentinian passport opens up the possibility of visa-free visits to 170 countries, including EU states and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began canceling the residency permits of Russians who received the document through childbirth but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens received a refusal to enter Argentina in relation to the suspicion of providing false information about the purpose of the trip.
Hundreds of new fitness clubs forecast to open in Russia

By the end of the year, Russia will have about 8600 fitness clubs.
According to the publication's information, most of the new clubs are small-scale projects with small initial investment and a fast return on investment.
Such information is provided by representatives of the National Fitness Association.
Association of Fitness Industry Operators president Olga Kiseleva told the publication in an interview that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, and the remainder will occupy more than 500 square meters.
NFA president Elena Silina noted that since 2020, more clubs have closed than opened every year.
In the past three years, their number fell by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts provide different figures.
According to Kontur.Fokus data, in the last three years, the number of organizations whose main sphere of activity is "fitness center work" grew by 10.1 percent, and they now number 5120.
The sector experienced large losses due to the pandemic, but as early as 2021 it began to recover.
According to 2GIS data, there are more than 4500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of 1 million.
Russians began to pay more attention to physical activity, as indicated by fitness club attendance.
As of the end of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year on year.
Silina noted that if the trend can be preserved, by the end of the year the sector will return to pre-crisis levels.
Management company from Kirov stripped of license
The Kirov region arbitration court annulled the license to conduct entrepreneurial activity in apartment building management that had been given to the Zabota management company.
In Kirov region, by a decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license to conduct entrepreneurial activity in apartment building management that had earlier been given to the Zabota management company was annulled.
According to the information of the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court's decision was taken back in November 2022, but only came into legal force in February 2023.
Arbitration deprived the "manager" of the license because the organization had ignored instructions from the State Housing Inspectorate several times.
Currently all properties that were under Zabota's management have been removed from the register of licenses for carrying out entrepreneurial activity in apartment building management.
Their total area was 64,800 square meters.
All of the buildings are in the regional center.
The Kirov administration is aware that they have been left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor of the situation that had arisen.
To recap, in January 2023, Kirov region governor Alexander Sokolov set State Housing Inspectorate staff the task of liquidating 2/3 of management companies in the region by the spring, as there were too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demand was doubted by Kirov communists.
They contacted the regional prosecutor and requested holding Sokolov liable under civil law.
The Federal Monopoly Service could presumably hold the same position.
Anti-monopoly personnel supposedly also requested that the prosecutor check the legality of the regional head's actions.
Wildberries introduces charges for bags at pickup points
The Wildberries online store is introducing charges for bags at pickup points from February 13.
They will cost from 6 to 15 rubles.
Bags are currently provided by pickup point owners.
A fine is issued if they are lacking.
From Monday, February 13, it will no longer be possible to take a bag for free at Wildberries pickup points.

At the same time, they must be in particular colors and bear the agreed image.
Owners of pickup points pay for the bags and are issued a fine of 10,000 rubles for every violation if this obligation is not fulfilled.
Earlier, Wildberries customers accused the platform of debiting funds from bank cards that had already been deleted from their accounts.
As shoppers fear, this is associated with major risks for their security.
The support service in turn explained that this is provided for in the user agreement.
According to it the company has the right to debit funds from a deleted card without notice if payment from others does not work for some reason or another.
The company, commenting on the situation, said that customer accounts are settled with customers' permission, and there cannot be any leak of bank card information.
Photos from February 2023.
The area is beautiful, especially in summer, with sculptures of mammoths and gazebos with grills.
There's a small park you can walk around with your family.
Lots of parking.
The store is on the 1st floor of the Univer City shopping center.
It's open from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
There's coffee and fresh baked goods available in the store.
A small parking area is provided by the shopping center.
Welcoming staff!
Delicious coffee with a big selection of syrups and non-dairy milk.
Super tasty fresh baked goods😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
A comfortable dining area.
I visited with my daughter to apply for my pension.
The staff was happy to help, explained everything, scanned my documents, accepted my application and told me how to schedule future appointments.
The administrator and security guard at the entrance greated us respectfully, like people.
A good building with everything you need, including a waiting area and bathroom, but it wouldn't hurt to put in a water cooler too.
We visited 2 times, everything was great!
I wish all the employees peace, kindness, happiness, and good pay in this difficult time for all of us!
A truly fantastic place!
After a long walk on the beach there's nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine while you wait for your mushroom salad (that seriously tastes like nothing you've ever had before!!!)
I can't recommend this wonderful place enough!!! :)
The sweet cashier girl asked me if I wanted my coffee for here or to go, 200 or 300 ml.
I said for here, 300 ml.
A few minutes later they give me a plastic cup.
But I wanted a ceramic mug, that's why I said "for here."
They made my coffee to go.
I asked why I got a cup and not a mug.
The girl said that unfortunately, they don't have 300 ml mugs.
How are people supposed to comprehend that?
They ask for here or to go, meaning they need to figure out for themselves how to pour the coffee: in a mug or in a disposable cup.
They get the answer "for here," i.e. in a mug.
They ask the size.
They hear 300 ml.
They tell you straight out that they don't have mugs of that size.
So here's a 300 ml paper cup for you.
It's notable that this is the third time this has happened to me in Zeleny Okolitsa that I can remember.
It's even more notable that they didn't offer me a regular mug so I could pour what's in the disposable cup into it and drink the coffee how I wanted to. I asked for it myself.
This raises a lot of questions.
1. Are the Zeleny Okolitsa Cafeteria and Zeleny Okolitsa two sides of the same coin, or are they two separate entities completely unrelated to each other?
If they're unrelated, I can understand.
If they're related, how did a food and shopping establishment known in the city for its service and quality sink to the level of rhetoric you might find at a kiosk at the Kazan Railway Station?
I say "rhetoric" because, once again, this same thing has happened to me three times already.
I wouldn't be surprised if it happens to other people too.
2. Do the cashiers have instructions?
I get the feeling that they just act on a whim.
I hope I'm wrong.
Since you're trying to work in the service industry, please write out what your employees need to do in this situation.
We love this circus, we've been going since we were kids.
I used to go to shows with Yu. Nikuliny himself.
Now I go with my kids and nephews.
I like how the circus is set up and the programs too.
The seating is really well organized.
The arena is visible from almost everywhere, and the backs of the people sitting in front of you don't get in the way.
The circus is small, like you're part of a family!
This time we went to see the New Years program.
We were a little disappointed.
There were lots of clowns and acrobats.
It would've been nice to see more magic tricks and animals.
It's too bad you can't take pictures with the animals in the lobby anymore.
But I guess there's a reason for it.
In general, it's really great here!!
Keep thriving and making us happy with your shows!!!
Otdelstroy is a great developer, they choose good locations to build residential complexes.
They use quality materials that fully justify the price.
They invited us to check out the complex before the walls were even up so we could see everything in person, and no matter how many other apartments we looked at, not a single other developer offered this.
This is my favorite ski resort in Russia!
The best part is the sparse low-sloping woods in E, especially when there's lots of soft snow.
But in my opinion the trails are a little boring and short.
The longest are in Sector E, they're good for the most part.
In general, the atmosphere is great with lots of different bars and restaurants, so you're guaranteed to feel what a fun mountain skiing trip is supposed to be!
Perry's the best!
Everything she did was great and fast too, and the salon is clean and nice.
Good service, friendly staff, and a clothes rack and water are available.
Horrible service.
For the second time I came to pick up my order at the time shown in the app and ended up waiting by the window for my order for 30 minutes.
Service like this is unacceptable in companies today!
The response from the "support" team: we're trying.
No apologies at the register either, just "it's not our fault, it's the program's."
No calls to warn you, and they haven't found any other technical options of getting in touch with used-to-be loyal customers either.
Guys with ED "try," businesses are supposed to work.
Thanks, but we're done here.
We're not ordering with you anymore, and certainly won't be recommending you either.
A bad mood, waiting guests, and apologies from the owner aren't the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a vehicle (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) here.
They estimated I should get the car in 3-3.5 months (based on our agreement), but in reality it took 4.5 months, the delay owing to a situation on the Lithuanian-Belorussian border (Lithuania was the executor).
In the end I'm very happy with the car, thanks to the team — Dmitry, Stas, and Alexander — they were always available to contact, had up-to-date information, gave professional advice, and treated me like a person.
Thanks again!
We rented a cabin for 4 days with 3 people.
The cabin was clean, comfortable, and warm (really warm, actually), and had a small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, and all the dishes you need.
There was soap and a sponge.
As for cons, maybe the fact that there wasn't a lot of space — the shower in the bathroom was extremely small.
There's no dedicated storage for snowboards or skis and nowhere to dry your things, so we had to borrow a drying rack from the owners, cram it in where the chair was, and put a heater under it.
But other than that it's not a bad choice in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, and spacious.
Delicious food and a decent selection no matter what you're in the mood for.
Reasonable prices.
Wine and beer available if you want to drink.
Downtown Moscow, check it out.
A great place with really polite staff, we'll definitley come again.
It has everything you need here, including parking and pool tables.
The rooms look great and have everything you need.
Beautiful and elegant, we walked around here on a visit to Kaliningrad.
Everything was great, including miniature Russia, Ozerov Park, and the landscape.
In the winter there are lots of natural hills for kids :)
Awesome tobacco and hookah store :)
We buy from here all the time, low prices and great quality!
Really helpful staff, ready to make suggestions and answer any questions you have :)
I'd recommend this store to anyone! ❤️
The location might not be convenient for some people.
For me it's fine.
Fast service if other guests aren't going slow.
Scheduled appointments are convenient.
The staff is attentive and ready to suggest, recommend, and give advice even if you didn't come on a day when visitors are accepted.
Good for the most part.
Awesome staff!
Thank you so much!
Everything was fast, and prices were reasonable compared to other services.
I thought I was supposed to throw the remote away, but the awesome team here did everything for me.
Big thanks to all the young staff!
I ordered a bouquet with 21 tulips and 2-hour delivery on March 8.
They delivered it 6 hours later in packaging that made it look stolen (barely enough paper to cover the flowers).
Then when I put them in a vase, I realized something was wrong.
I compared them to the photo on the site and the color was completely different than what I ordered.
I decided to recount them and it turned out there were 20 tulips, an even number.
In response to my outrage about the color and number of flowers, the support team in WhatsApp said "looks like they mixed up the flowers."
The next day I messaged them again and they offered me 15% off.
To me this is beyond absurd and can probably be considered fraud.
I already sent a notice to the tax authority that they refused to issue me a receipt.
Now it's Rospotrebnadzor and the court's turn.
I don't recommend anyone contact this place ever.
I've been going to Samira to dye and cut my hair for more than 10 years.
I want to mention Samira's professionalism, she does a great job and I'm always satisfied with her work.
She listens carefully to what clients want, and the client is always satisfied with the results.
I recommend her to all of my friends and family.
Everything she does is always the best!!!
Thank you so much Samira 😍
Hello, I've been in this gaming club and can say that the prices are excellent, there are lots of gaming computers, and food and drinks are available.
As for cons, some of the keyboards are busted and the keys are falling off, and if you choose "regular gaming process" then some computers can't handle it :(
So 4 stars🥸
This place is a family tradition for us now :)
My son goes to his group, and mom goes to fitness boxing in the evening.
The administrators are super attentive, and the trainers are professional.
They throw parties for kids and make sure the place and exercise equipment stay clean.
It's nice to work out here.
My 6 year old already has a good punch and strong conditioning.
I'd recommend it for all kids, moms, and dads :)
Top specialists!
Irina was awesome!!
Great work, attentive, and asked lots of questions.
You can talk about anything with these girls!
This was my 3rd visit!
No regrets at all!
Finally I can grow my hair out after bleaching!!!
Plus Vita is studying coloristics.
So she'll be able to mix blonde with keratin really soon!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰
Service receptionist Elena Polyanskaya is very willing to help, she explained to me clearly everything that's included in routine maintenance.
She also helped me out when my car was getting serviced.
I also want to thank specialist Valery Ushakov for being so careful and professional in his work.
He was there to answer any questions.
The work was high quality.
The only comment I have is that when I was scheduling the routine maintenance, information about the work to be done wasn't completely correct, but when I arrived for the routine maintenance they explained it more clearly.
I want to express my deepest gratitudes to the staff here.
I needed a very rare verification document for Child Protective Services to get approval for a real estate transaction, and the staff greeted me kindly and helped obtain the document, even though they could have refused because it wasn't part of their job.
Thank you so much!
The people working here are warmhearted.
Amazing, warmhearted, and polite staff, I don't regret coming to this hair salon!👍
The highlighting and haircut from Nakhida were beyond reproach, she understood and took all my requests into consideration, everyone should come here❤️
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for its 800th anniversary, and inside it's all fancy and clean.
There's a cafe and restrooms for tourists.
I went on a guided tour which was also cool.
I also definitely recommend checking out the Russian wing of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum, the collection was unexpectedly amazing.
We've known Olya for 3 years and have been going to her regularly.
During that time, we've seen Olya grow in her beloved profession, continually expand her qualifications, and increase the space for our four-legged friends, which fills us with admiration and trust.
We always leave our doggy here with peace of mind.
Daily video reports, and if you need they can pick up or drop off animals in their pet taxi.
And they bring him back all clean and smelling great :)
simply amazing 🥰
Thank you for caring and being so attentive to every pet you work with 🐕💜
The Full Moose restaurant is located next to the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is really cozy inside!
The food is excellent.
The menu is diverse.
It's best to reserve a table in advance before you visit, especially on Fridays!
A cute well-kept zoo.
Smaller than in Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
We came on a weekday, ₽300 for an adult ticket and ₽170 for kids.
It wasn't crowded, and we had a great time walking around looking at the animals
The anteater was really cool :)
We actually didn't see one in Moscow.
There are a few cafes with reasonable prices, a clean free restroom, and we also saw a phone charging station.
In short, it's worth checking out 👍
A top-notch salon!!!
I'm very satisfied with the work of cosmetologist Natalya Kuznetsova, I only ever go to her.
I get different kinds of facials, including hardware and mechanical.
I'm 100% satisfied.
A true professional👍
She explained everything about skin specifics and picked out skincare products based on my skin type, it was perfect.
Now I'm walking around satisfied and beautiful!
Thank you Natalya!
A great club with tons of space, a pool, sauna, steam room, and excellent trainers!
As for cons, there are lots of old people in the pool and dressing area.
It's like they use the club like a public bathhouse!
Especially in the women's area.
On weekdays after 19:00 it's really crowded!
I'm giving three stars only because of my first visit when I was helped by a consultant named Timur if I'm not mistaken, but I may be mistaken.
He got everything done fast, explained pretty much everything and was easy to understand, my son also decided to apply for a card but unfortunately all the consultants were busy, customers were waiting, eventually one who didn't give a crap came to talk to my son but walked off to a meeting room a few times laughing about something with their colleagues, eventually my son left without applying, when he was leaving the consultant just said okay it's your choice, I saw everything myself and was surprised.
The office is new and has a new format, everything is well built, but that's how they treat you.
Too bad our first impression was ruined, now we go to a different branch where the attitude towards clients doesn't depend on who's working.
Huge selection, high quality (the fabric doesn't get rolls), the staff knows the assortment well and helps pick out cuts.
Good for thin women and children with non-standard body types and height.
Located not far from the metro and even has a small parking area.
Check it out!
I was there in September to celebrate my birthday.
For the most part I was satisfied with the service and food quality: low prices, medium-size portions, so you might get enough or have to order again.
My only complaint is reserving a table.
When I was reserving one, I entered my phone number and everything else, and then a bot called me right away to check my phone number was real.
Then nothing.
When I got to the restaurant, it turned out that the table hadn't been reserved.
We were lucky that there were available tables and they were able to seat us.
But for the most part, it's a great restaurant and an excellent value for the money.
Check it out!
I came in for a teeth cleaning on the weekend recently.
I've never seen help staff handle all my questions so carefully and advise how and what's best to do to treat my teeth in the future.
I highly recommend this place, it's the only clinic to my mind that isn't trying to just reach into your pockets.
A good shopping center.
It's got everything!
A large assortment of products.
Different stores.
You can always find what you want.
From groceries to gifts.
I'm never setting foot in this store again.
We bought a washing machine and said we live outside the city, so we'll drive it home ourselves.
The sales manager told us where to pull up at the warehouse, and when I asked if they'd load it, he said yes. :)
At the warehouse they brought it out without a box, when I asked why they said that's how they always load them.
When I insisted, they shoved in two strips of polystyrene, like that's fine too!
They refused to load it in my trailer, they said it wasn't their job, load it yourself, they only do delivery :)
When I said in that case I'm canceling my order, they said "whatever, we don't care," eventually one of them deigned to come down from the ramp and help my dad shove the washing machine in our trailer.
I've never had to deal with such rude service in my life.
A good shopping center Clean and neat. Lots of different stores, cafes, and restaurants.
It has the Cosmic movie theater and the Nevidaliya children's entertainment center.
There's a huge Lenta hypermarket on the lower floor.
A convenient, big parking lot is conveniently located.
A good supermarket with cosmetics, underwear, and household goods.
It's got different kinds of products, reasonable prices, and polite and attentive staff.
The staff are always ready to help find what you need and answer any questions.
Everyone can find something for themselves.
A great place to spend the evening.
Excellent staff and a nice venue.
Highly recommend, you won't go wrong choosing here. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be awesome.
Check it out :)
We want to say thank you to Marina Chasova, the agent who helped with our funeral.
She came to our home on call, took responsibility for deciding all the questions involved in this difficult and sad event, helped us pick out everything we needed, was always available, and updated us on how things were going.
Thanks to her we sent off our loved one with dignity.
Everything was held and organized just as we had discussed at our first meeting.
Marina understands exactly what loved ones are going through, gave us advice about what's best, and just sympathized with us like a human being.
She's a true professional in what she does.
Thank you for everything.
Enticed by all the good reviews, I contacted RemStirMash and they assigned me a specialist named Alexander.
He started the conversation by saying he was completely free tomorrow and ready to work.
We talked everything over and scheduled a time: 2:00 p.m.
The next day I get a call from the specialist saying that he can't come because of a tough job (wait, what? what about being "completely free?") and that if he can, instead of the scheduled 2:00 p.m., he'll come after 6:00 p.m.
We agreed again on the next day.
Fifteen minutes before our scheduled time, a different specialist calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but only in 2 hours.
What's with these games?
Half a day waiting for nothing, everything else I had planned ruined!
In short, a smart specialist named Ivan came and fixed the issue, so thank you to him for that.
So don't fall for any false promises and don't waste your time for nothing.
The evening viewing session wasn't what I was expecting.
First there was a short and unclear lecture, then we looked through the telescope.
Everything was pretty unorganized, kids kept running up to look multiple times, and the adults were crowding around and not letting anyone else look.
The objects we looked at were the size of regular stars, you could just look at them for free even without a telescope.
The girl there didn't explain things very well, she didn't realize she's talking about things regular people don't understand.
I have no idea why it cost ₽600.
This place is amazing, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, it's been around since the early 2000's.
Cozy atmosphere and the staff are always friendly.
Mid-range prices.
Dine-in with 2-3 items (huge portions) for two people + cocktails is around ₽2,500👌
Interesting beer cocktails, like with beer and tequila, I really recommend trying the Macho Boracho.
₽420 for 0.5 l.
The food is also really good, I don't know about other people, but I really liked it and will tell my friends to definitley check it out :)
Great store, I've been shopping here for a pretty long time, since it opened.
High quality products.
I bought a faucet five years ago and it still works great and is in good condition.
So when we remodeled our apartment, we bought everything we needed here.
A great gas station!
Convenient location, accessible when you're heading to or from downtown, just really convenient! :)
Good fuel quality, I've been filling up 2 times a week for over 2 years without a problem, excellent prices!!!
Payment by card or cash, always honest about the amount pumped.
I love this store!
You can choose any model you want, affordable prices, no matter what you need!
The staff is always ready to help you choose.
I bought a laptop for my daughter for school because hers broke.
They helped me, picked one out, and gave a guarantee (1 month) Thank you! 👍
There's a sommelier on staff.
He helped me pick a wine because with a menu this big it's hard to figure out on your own.
Working with the sommelier was interesting, Vasily is charming, there aren't enough people like him in Moscow.
I had the perch, it was incredible, big respect to the chef.
The kid's menu is the same as anywhere: macaroni, fries, chicken nuggets. We had the pizza, it's AMAZING here!
The adults liked the truffle, and the kids got ham and mushrooms.
My husband had the smoked ribs, they're super good: soft, juicy and smell delicious.
The staff is great, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We had a good time.
This brand new WB order pickup point is conveniently located.
Open from 10:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m., including weekends and holidays.
The pickup point has fitting rooms.
This place is great.
The staff are true professionals always ready to help.
There's also a group and WhatsApp chat if you need more information.
Fast pickup.
I like that you can check out what you ordered and try it on right away.
Great that it's right by my house.
An excellent modern hotel.
Spacious rooms, clean and comfortable.
Everything in the description was available.
Breakfast is included in the price and has lots of different options for the whole family.
Easy check-in with dedicated parking by the entrance.
A solid 5.
A great puppet theater.
We go a lot for different shows.
Today we went to see The Frog Princess.
This is the best performance around right now for kids.
It was really interesting and had lots of puppets and special effects.
Even my 14 year old son who just came for fun said that it was a good show.
Me and my husband were there for ten days in January 2023.
The vacation was 5/5, everything was great!
Here's how it went:
On check-in day they called and asked when to expect us, told us about the price of a transfer (1,400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (₽850 at 11:00 p.m.) and got there fast, no traffic, they let us through the gate no problem.
The reception building was nearby, they got us checked in fast, 15-20 minutes.
All the buildings have elevators, which is a huge plus!
The 2 person room was spacious, the floors in the room and bathroom were warm (but not heated), there was a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two chairs), and panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room was fine, including a dressing table with a big mirror, and a decent sized fridge with a freezer too.
Building 5 had lots of green plants.
Everything was clean, they change the towels and bedding whenever you ask, but if you don't ask they change it every 4 days anyway, the bedding was comfortable.
The grounds are well kept with lots of benches, clean paths, and beautiful lighting at night.
A minibus goes to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
There's a public transport stop 5 minutes away.
The dining area staff are polite and always tell you to have a good day.
The food was good, but it depends what you order, we thought everything was great, both the selection and quality; there was always fish, chicken, meatballs and the like, vegetables on the side every day, tasty baked goods made in-house, 4+ different beverages, whole-bean coffee, and freshly cooked crepes every day for breakfast, only the cheese and sausage weren't that great.
The medical staff was really friendly and accepting.
We got lucky with the weather too, sunny and no rain with temps 11-16 С°.
We had a great time and left truly relaxed.
We want to come again, only in January when it's less crowded :)
It's too bad they haven't opened the pool or gym yet.
Thank you to the whole sanatorium staff for doing such great work and being so well organized!
We've been going to Polet since August.
My daughter turned four in September.
She really loves it here, and most importantly her trainer says she's doing great :)
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova! :)
I would've never thought my daughter could be so flexible!
When me and my girlfriends were wandering the streets of St. Petersburg we decided to check out this promising place and were not disappointed!
Affordable prices and unbelievably tasty pizza that you can scarf up in the blink of an eye, even the crusts.
A great atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend it :)
I ended up in Tomarovskaya Hospital with high blood pressure and a high heart rate.
And I was extremely surprised: clean, well-run, and mopped twice a day, they even wipe down the windowsills, furniture, and doors.
The food isn't rich, but it's really good!!!
I was shocked when they brought me tea and a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese) at 7 a.m., like a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is understanding and every last one of them give intramuscular and intravenous shots!!!
When I had an IV drip they'd come in and ask how I was feeling.
I've had to do heart ultrasounds before, but never like here (unfortunately, I don't remember the doctor's name, he looked young).
A special thanks to my attending doctor Klavdia Fedorovna Vetokhina!
She's a true specialist: attentive and knowledgable, she always answered my questions in detail; she picked out my meds and set a dosage that helped normalize my blood pressure and heart rate, something that never worked out for me before with other doctors.
A big thanks to Head Physician Olga Vladimirovna Mevsha for running the hospital so well!
Thanks to the entire medical staff, cleaning crew, and kitchen staff!
I had a good visit here to customer service.
An administrator met me in the waiting room.
The specialists are knowledge and polite, and help clients with all their questions quickly and patiently.
A specialist assisted with my application and explained my question.
The assortment here is actually pretty good for such a small store.
It's got processed foods, milk, vegetables, household cleaners, and lots of other stuff.
Open 24/7, which is convenient, and the staff are always welcoming
It's awesome that there's a place in the city where you can downhill ski.
Due to the T-bar lifts there's obviously a line on the weekends, 40 seconds to go down and 5-10 minutes waiting in line.
But it's cool for the most part, positive winter vibes even when the roads are dirty and wet.
I came to this repair shop with an iPhone 11 Pro.
The back glass was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I was in contact with specialist Alexander directly, he explained everything about the repairs and gave me a price range up front.
Thank you for the repairs, everything turned out great.
The specialists are easy to talk to, they explain and show you everything.
However, during the repairs, the camera got nicked and lost focus.
I reported the issue right away and they answered fast.
They fixed their mistake right away, and now everything works fine.
The specialists working in this repair shop are easy to talk to.
Compared to other repair shops, prices are reasonable and attractive.
If I ever need repairs again, I'm definitely coming back!
Massive, beautiful, and really cool.
But like the majority of historical objects, it needs the careful, immediate, and quality care of a team of restorators.
So 4 stars, the majority of which go to the creators, not the current caretakers.
An excellent residential complex.
Helpful concierges, trash gets cleaned up, the grounds are clean and beautiful, and it's close to public transport stops, schools, and stores.
Twenty minutes to the metro on public transport
They opened a great nice place to relax in our neighborhood.
It's got all the stores you need.
There's all kinds of food in the food court and it's amazing.
The tables are organized into cozy little zones.
They're not clumped together.
Alright, so we came and tried it out...
The interior doesn't have anything in common with a cozy little Italian cafe...
It's cramped and the tables are square like in a cafeteria.
As for the pizza... I guess you'll like it if you've never tried anything better, but to me it seemed pretty bland.
I didn't really like that the server is always standing behind your back and pretty much always looking the person you're sitting with directly in the face.
We felt uncomfortable.
Yeah, the cannoli were good.
We won't be coming back and I won't recommend this place to our friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best specialist I've ever gotten hair cuts and coloring with.
She does everything great and is really careful, I love going to her because I know that everything will turn out great.
I only let Lena work on my daughter too.
The vibe in the salon is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We're from Nizhny Novgorod and our car broke down on the road, and the kind people at KatResurs responded fast and helped!
Much respect, we wish you all the success in the world, it could use more good people like you!
The inside is clean and nice too!
We came to see Sergey Chigrakov in concert.
This is a great concert venue, the sound and overall atmosphere are both excellent.
We'll definitley be going to the concerts scheduled this year.
A wonderful nice and quiet Georgian restaurant with live music on the weekends and holidays.
The staff is nice and helpful!
There's a children's room.
Incredible Georgian cuisine!
I'm giving the highest rating, I love this place ❤
A downtown park that's really easy to get to.
The park is clean and has places for both kids and adults.
But there's no sand on the playground anymore, all that's left is dust.
There's also a fenced soccer field, but unfortunately it isn't very well kept.
But still, our park has more pros than cons.
Spacious interior, clean, and well-organized product layout.
There are some products you can only find in Perekrestok.
The staff is really welcoming.
I've never seen expired products here before.
Lots of promotions and discounts.
It's great that it's close to home.
There's always parking available.
We've been to this bar twice, everything's great; polite staff, tasty food, and most importantly: awesome music with DJs who know their stuff.
My only comment is that the vocalist of Ruki Vverkh Band has been a disappointment twice now.
It's not just that he doesn't sing that great, to put it lightly, but he seriously reads the lyrics to most songs on his phone, which is especially shocking when it comes to Ruki Vverkh songs.
It just doesn't make sense (playing in the Ruki Vverkh bar in a band called Ruki Vverkh Band).
We were here in the beginning of March.
The hotel is nice and so are the rooms.
As a birthday gift they gave us a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Housekeeping every day.
Water, tea, coffee, and shampoo restocked every day and towels replaced.
The breakfasts are OMG.
There's a mini bar with ridiculous prices.
If you want to order room service from the restaurant, there's an extra 20% fee.
Prices in the restaurant are a little high.
The food is a 3+.
Water park entry is included in the price.
You can't call the water park the best in Russia.
But the masseuse was incredible.
Everything was great, but check-out was a bit of a disappointment: they didn't say bye or wish us a safe trip.
The employee at the door didn't even help open the door when he saw a woman with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
They've got to work on that to keep up their reputation.
An excellent bathhouse to get together at with your friends.
There's a big convenient steam room, pool tables, outdoor pool, and karaoke.
The food is good and the drinks fresh :)
A great repair shop!
They fixed 3 pairs of shoes fast (2 mens and 1 womens).
Everything's good.
They did an excellent job.
Thank you to the repair specialist for doing great work and taking such good care!
A great basketball school!
My son has been going for 5 months and he loves it, he can't wait for his next practice.
Every child is treated like an individual, the practices are interesting, and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming.
Great store and decent staff, I order online on my own.
Excellent store location.
Plus there's always discounts and promotions, which is also good
A good AV store with a convenient location, big interior and good assortment.
A special thanks to the staff for being so responsive!
There's a cafe area with a few tables.
I come here a lot, everything's great!
A great pool!
I'm talking about the kiddie pool, our child really likes our instructor Anastasia Vitalyevna, she's a real professional!
The changing rooms are clean, the water's warm, and there are blow dryers!
I love this bakery the cupcakes, service, croissants, and coffee are always amazing.
But unfortunately not this time, because I ordered coffee and a couple croissants and the girls behind the register didn't make the coffee until I reminded them, then when they did it was impossible to drink, it stank and had an aftertaste of spoiled milk, so I didn't finish it and just left.
Last time there was a super long black hair in my coffee too, so they replaced it.
Please be more careful, after all as a guest I keep coming back even after things like this happen.
Come here for stylish eyebrows!
Victoria does an excellent job with treatment based on the proportions of your own face.
Treatment with warm wax that's great at removing all the peach fuzz so your eyebrows look clean for a long time.
They pick the color based on your hair and skin type so the dye lasts for a long time.
They don't do eyebrows better anywhere else!
Thank you so much for helping my mom's move go so smoothly!
Moving is always stressful, but with your company everything went great, according to plan and fast.
A special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I'll be recommending your company to everyone I know!
This place is fantastic.
My whole family has been getting dental work at Novodent for a long time.
We got some dental work for my 8 year old son recently, everything went great, he feels calm and ready to come back.
You don't have to wait long, there aren't any lines or anything because appointments are scheduled in advance.
In my opinion the tastiest shawarma in Tambov is right here, and I'm not even a fan of shawarma, BUT when you want some junk food look no further than here.
Fresh, tasty meat, big portions.
And I have no idea how, but they never drip on me.
A lot of the times when you're earing shawarma you can't eat the last bit cause it's all wet from the sauce and ewww... but not here.
So you guys are the best🙂
A great teaching staff.
The food in the cafeteria is always fresh.
Lessons in the school museum are interesting, and there are different kinds of events held throughout the school year.
A great store with a polite staff and decent selection.
However, it's a serious problem that they unload shipments right on the sales floor.
Sometimes there isn't much space between aisles, and it's not so great when products are sitting right on the floor without platforms, but that's probably a question for the company and not this specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Austere grandeur that's carefully maintained.
I enjoyed the concert twice as much thanks in large part to the ambience in the community center.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I seriously felt like I was at a real event, like I was out in society.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.
I wound up on this store's site by complete accident.
I called and told them my vinkod, and they told me to wait :)
Ten minutes later they called back with a couple different options.
I use my car for work and for myself so I decided not to be cheap and asked them to order a good LUK clutch kit.
Five minutes later they called back and said they had good news for me.
If I bought the LUK kit crate + disk and the LUK release separately instead of the crate + disk + release all together, then it would be ₽2,000 cheaper, which of course I was happy to hear.
I picked up the clutch and went to the auto shop.
When they took out my transmission it turned out that I also needed a flywheel, and the faster the better.
I already knew who to call :) The sales manager understood the situation and placed the order without prepayment over the phone (I paid on receipt the first time too).
The flywheel came the very next day.
The car's happy with its new flywheel and clutch, and I'm happy with how fast everything was and that the staff were accomodating.
I'll definitely be recommending vinkod.shop and shopping here again
Our New Years celebration was great, except for a few hiccups.
I reserved a 2 person table, but was seated at a 4 person table instead.
Not a big deal.
It's just strange they didn't warn me.
Food was a 4/5, the fish wasn't good at all.
The host with his contests made on grade-school level Powerpoint weren't great either, to be honest.
BUT the music was fantastic.
The atmosphere was excellent.
Everything else seems like nitpicking.
Thanks for hosting the event
I'm writing this review to express my gratitude to the entire staff of Maternity Hospital 7 in Chelyabinsk.
All the people working here know and love their jobs, and the doctors and nurses are a gift from God.
In the Department of Pregnancy Pathology, the Labor and Delivery Department, and in the Postnatal Services Department.
I also want to especially thank E. Yu. Kotlyarova, the Head of the Labor and Delivery Department on the 5th floor, and N. V. Yarantseva, my delivery nurse in the Labor and Delivery Department, thank you so much for your help delivering my little girl, for your kind hearts, and for your high level of professionalism.
This store is great.
Lots of different balloons to choose from, and ordering and delivery is always fast.
Professional staff.
Really beautiful bouquets always tastefully compiled with flowers that are always fresh.
We came here on a recommendation.
The food was amazing, the entertainment wasn't great and the servers were a bit rude, but we were in a great group with our kids and celebrated an important event, it was a friendly atmosphere.
The plateau wasn't served on fire like the kids were expecting.
A great place to come for good food.
