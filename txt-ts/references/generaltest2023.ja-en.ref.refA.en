Cases of Rabies on the Increase in Northeast Thailand
On February 9th, Doctor Tawichai of the Ninth Regional Office for Disease Prevention and Control announced that rabies infections in northeast Thailand have been increasing over the past few months, with the total number of infections having risen to 74 cases.
Over the past 12-month period (October last year to September of this year) the number of people who tested positive for rabies in the northeastern provinces of Surin and Buriram were 67 and 7, respectively.
All the infected people had previously been vaccinated against rabies.
Doctor Tawichai urged residents to get vaccinated against rabies together with their pets, and not to come into contact with the saliva of any animal that seems to have the disease.
Rabies can be transferred to humans not only from dogs, but also from cats and bats.
Virtually 100% of infected people die after symptoms appear, but vaccination before the appearance of symptoms can prevent death.

Nonetheless, the farm was blessed with an unprecedented bumper crop last year.
▼Korea Central Zoo's Chongjin aquatic products feed office has made great strides.
The facility was established in 2011 with the mission of sending aquatic products to be used as feed to the zoo in Pyongyang.
Although fishing quotas are being exceeded, in recent years, the facility has been supporting farms in Chongjin city by providing them with farming supplies.
However, this time round, the facility assisted a farm not in Chongjin, but in neighboring Kyongsong County.

FUJI Developing a System to Prevent Incidents of Being Left Inside a Car, Carrying out Trials in its Own Company Vehicles | THE MID-JAPAN ECONOMIST, Economic News for Aichi, Gifu, Mie and Shizuoka
FUJI CORPORATION (head office: Chiryu), manufacturer and seller of machine tools and electronic component mounting systems, has embarked on a new venture to develop a system to prevent incidents of children and others being left inside cars.
The system consists of motion detectors installed inside the vehicle that send a notification via phone or chat when they detect a person's movement.
The company is currently conducting trials in its own shuttle vehicles.
The hope is that the system will protect children and prevent tragic incidents occurring from them being left inside cars.
Currently, FUJI CORPORATION is conducting trials with two shuttle buses used at teracoya THANK, an extracurricular English school for children run by the company in Chiryu.
Motion detectors that are capable of discerning people from their surroundings due to the temperature difference are installed at three points on the ceilings of the vehicles.
When the vehicles' engine is off and the doors are closed, an alert will be automatically sent if a person's movement is detected after a certain amount of time has passed.
Combining the sensor data with the state of the engine and doors helps to prevent false positives as much as possible.
Alerts are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling a pre-registered phone number, the system will send alerts to chat apps on PC or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and consideration has been given to prevent users from missing alert notifications.
The trial is expected to continue until the end of February.
Kamiya Kazumitsu, second section manager of innovation at FUJI CORPORATION, noted that, "During the trial, we also became aware of some issues that are not related to the system itself."
For example, they observed several issues related to school buses, such as the need to create an environment in which the driver can concentrate on the road.
Kamiya expressed hope that they would be able to expand their solution to suit other situations.
The development of this system was set in motion in response to a string of incidents occurring around the country in which children were left inside shuttle buses.
FUJI employees with young children enquired whether there was anything they could do to ensure children's safety.
The company resolved to develop the system in question, making use of the expertise in information management gained in their work related to factory automation (FA), such as the internet of things (IoT) and sensors.
The big selling point of FUJI's system to prevent people being left inside a car is its ease of use.
The sensors can be attached to the ceiling by simply pinning them in place.
As it can be easily retrofitted to existing shuttle buses, it lowers the barrier to adopting such a system, and so FUJI is hoping to make it a commonplace feature in vehicles.
FUJI CORPORATION is working closely with nursery schools, kindergartens and other institutions, with the aim of turning the system into a commercial product in the future.
[Editorial] Start of construction on the Tsuruga - Shin-Osaka section of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Line, originally scheduled for the start of 2023, has been delayed, and it is beginning to affect urban development west of Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture.
In the city of Obama, where the new station is set to be established, the exact location of the station has still not been indicated, causing urban planning, including development of the surrounding area, to be at a standstill.
The act of formulating plans itself is likely to take a significant amount of time, so there is a pressing demand for this information to be made public as soon as possible.
The planned station in Obama will be the only new station for the Hokuriku Shinkansen that will be built to the west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency indicated a region centered around JR Higashi-Obama Station with a 2.5km radius as an approximate station location.
The agency had aimed to confirm the route and exact location of the station in the winter of 2022.
In Obama, development projects related to the Shinkansen opening in Tsuruga and Obama were in full swing in 2021.
In 2022, projects further increased with the initial budget, and efforts were made in urban development in anticipation of the announcement of the station location.
However, the exact location of the new station is yet to be announced.
It seems that the city, which set aside a budget of 3 million yen to formulate a basic plan of considering land use and development concepts that take into account the location of the new station, will not be using its budget.
According to a city official, urban planning centered around new stations, "Takes time due to the need to build a consensus among citizens."
Echizen is an example of a city in the prefecture that had a new station built in the suburbs and not connected to any existing JR station, but it seems like it took a significant amount of time for the whole scheme to come together.
In the case of Obama, there are concerns that if the announcement of the station location continues to be delayed, there will be a reduced amount of time to prepare for the station's opening, adversely affecting the development of the surrounding area.
Even before the question of the location of the new station, there had been a lack of clarity regarding the expansion of the Shinkansen to the west of Tsuruga.
Last October, a citizens' group in Kyoto, which is on the extended route, submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calling for a total retraction of the extension plan.
Meanwhile, it can hardly be said that the neighboring prefectures are united in their opinion, since with the delay in construction, there are flurry of motions to go back to the drawing board on predetermined routes, such as with lawmakers in Ishikawa Prefecture calling for a reconsideration of the Maibara route.
Although Obama residents remain relatively calm in their reactions to the delayed construction, there are concerns that the present state, in which the location of the new station is unknown and its opening date is unclear, may negatively impact future opportunities.
Obama's mayor, Matsuzaki Koji, intends to continue lobbying the government to have the line in operation as early as possible, but this also requires areas along the route to demand construction to start as soon as possible.
An indifferent attitude along the lines of "The Shinkansen will operate (to the west of Tsuruga) someday" will not get the national and local governments to take action.
We need people to be engaged and keep speaking up on this issue.
Food sampling back for the first time in three years at the Valentine's Day chocolate sales area - Seibu department store, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, February 9th
In the run up to Valentine's Day on February 14th, sales of luxury chocolates - for friends, family, or as a "treat for oneself" - are booming, even amidst rising chocolate prices due to the sharp rise in the price of ingredients and packaging materials.
Retailers and confectioners throughout Fukui Prefecture are hoping to attract customers with creations that emphasize local characteristics, a sense of luxury, and high-quality ingredients.
Seibu Fukui department store (Fukui City) opened a special sales area in the 6th floor event space on January 25th.
The sales area features around 450 varieties of chocolate from 40 brands, including 10 confectionery stores from within the prefecture, and runs until the 14th.
Some popular products include chocolates made with sake local to Fukui, and sandwich-based products such as ganache sandwiched between cookies.
According to a Seibu representative, the retail price of many of the Valentine's products has increased by approximately 10% compared to the previous year.
As for this year's trends, they said, "There are many products that emphasize the use of high-quality ingredients and evoke a sense of luxury through the packaging. The trend that is emerging amongst customers is to buy the products for themselves or their family and enjoy comparing and eating different confections."
It seems that, despite the unfavorable price rises, sales of luxury chocolates are gaining traction.
⇒ An average increase of 25 yen per chocolate due the higher cost of living
The representative explained, "We have endeavored to create a sales area in which people can enjoy the event of Valentine's Day itself."
Seibu has been selling a daily-changing selection of recommended confections since January 26th, and has resumed food sampling for the first time in three years.
Confectionery maker SEIYOGASHI CLUB (head office: Ippondennaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai) launched its original chocolate series, "KISEKI", which was jointly developed with a long-established French chocolatier at the end of last year, for the first time in the run-up to this year's Valentine's Day.
The chocolates are made with a particular variety of cocoa beans that have a fruity taste and subdued bitterness, and are being sold in packs of 3 for 1,000 yen, or packs of 9 for 3,000 yen.
Takakura Ryoma, SEIYOGASHI CLUB's company director and head of purchasing, explained "As the culture of handing out obligatory chocolates on Valentine's Day is dying out, there is an increasing desire to enjoy a little bit of luxury. We are aiming to differentiate ourselves by enhancing the added value of our products."
⇒ In order to receive chocolates on Valentine's Day...we asked ChatGPT how to do that
On the 9th, a company employee in her 20s (a Fukui resident) who was visiting Seibu Fukui commented, "I have always loved chocolate, so I want to buy some as a reward for myself because I found employment and am now earning money."
Another company employee in her 30s (also a Fukui resident) who was buying obligatory chocolates said, "It's aggravating that the price increases are also affecting chocolates, but it's just once a year, so I want to get something to give to my family and the people I am usually indebted to. However, I may give them to fewer people this year."
Products made with Fukui plums and midi tomatoes grown in the prefecture - Fukui Prefectural Office, February 9th
On February 9th, Seven-Eleven Japan announced the launch of six products available the same day at stores around the three prefectures of the Hokuriku region, including some new products made with ingredients from Fukui Prefecture, such as sweet shrimp.
This is to commemorate the first anniversary of signing the comprehensive collaboration agreement regarding overall governance of the prefectures, with the aim to promote the appeal of produce from the prefectures.
In addition to the four new products - shrimp meatball soup and shrimp miso ramen made with sweet shrimp caught in the prefecture, a salad made with midi tomatoes grown in the prefecture and cream puffs filled with Habutae mochi and sweet bean paste - there are also local favorites such as Fukui plum onigiri and a rice bowl topped with pork cutlets in a rich sauce.
The products will be available to purchase until the 20th.

Akutsu Tomohiro, deputy general manager of Seven-Eleven's operations department, and others paid a courtesy visit to Prefectural Governor Sugimoto Tatsuji on the 9th.
Governor Sugimoto, who tried the meatball soup, commented, "The shrimp stock adds flavor to the soup and it's very nice," giving it his seal of approval.
A company representative for Seven-Eleven said, "We would like to continue developing products made with ingredients produced in Fukui Prefecture."
Ruins of Ushigahara Castle, believed to have been built in preparation for a battle with Heisen-ji Temple - Ushigahara, Ono, Fukui Prefecture
Inuikawa district in the city of Ono, Fukui Prefecture, where there once stood the large Ushigahara Estate.
Ushigahara Castle is thought to have been constructed during the Kamakura period on the slopes of the local Mount Nabetokoyama, to prepare for a battle with Heisen-ji Temple, which was in conflict with the estate.
The castle makes an appearance in The Taiheiki, a historical military epic.
Although no documents remain about Ushigahara Castle, the following is recorded in chapter 11 of The Taiheiki, entitled "The Suicide of the Steward of Ushigahara in Echizen".
Aikawa Ukyonosuke Tokiharu, an official of the Kamakura Shogunate, was dispatched to Ono to act as the steward of Ushigahara Estate.
In 1333, Commissioner Rokuhara, who had been installed in Kyoto to monitor the imperial court and control the western territories of Japan, was defeated by Ashikaga Takauji, and then the Kamakura Shogunate itself met its downfall at the hands of Nitta Yoshisada.
As soon as they heard that Commissioner Rokuhara had died, Tokiharu's retainers fled, leaving behind only around 20 people.
Seeing this as their chance, the warrior monks of Heisen-ji Temple attacked.
Tokiharu made his wife and two children commit suicide by drowning themselves in the river, then he too committed suicide.
⇒ An impregnable castle where Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu stood together
The Inuikawa Improvement Association, made up of local residents, published a chronicle of Inuikawa's history in 2014.
Within its pages, the tragic story of Tokiharu is illustrated as a comic, making it easy for primary school children to understand.
Kitagawa Masao (75), who was involved in the publication, said, "I want local residents to know the history of the place where they live and pass it on to future generations."

You can get to the castle ruins via a mountain path maintained by the Inuikawa Improvement Association.
The castle is located about 200m up from the head of the trail.
During the winter, the road leading to the trail entrance may not be traversable by car due to snowfall.
Inuikawa Improvement Association
The association is made up of a total of about 220 households in Inuikawa district, Ono.
In the past, the association has published "Guide to Inuikawa", which introduces the ancient burial mounds, historical sites and other attractions to be found in the district.
The Rennyo-no-Sato Awara Michinoeki Roadside Market currently under construction in Yoshizaki, Awara, Fukui Prefecture, is set to open on April 22nd.
It expects to welcome around 360,000 visitors annually as a new base for tourism and regional promotion in the northern part of the city, as the Hokuriku Shinkansen line is expected to open Awara Onsen Station in the spring of 2024.
The roadside market's main facility, where food, drinks, and goods will be sold, is a one-storey steel frame building with a 975㎡ floor area.
The total area of the Michinoeki roadside market including the car park and "Nagisa" children's park is 8137㎡.
There will also be a rest area and a tourist information center at the facility.
You will be able to rent an electric bicycle here and there will also be a shower room.
The two car parks will be able to accommodate a total of 66 small and large vehicles (including three disabled spaces).
These details were given by Awara's mayor, Mori Yukitsugu, at the routine press conference held on February 8th.
In the food and drinks section, parfait made with fruits from Sakai's northern hills and Tomitsu sweet potato pies are sold.
There are plans to develop more menu items that incorporate local produce, such as rice topped with raw eggs from Fukuji chickens and dishes available in autumn and winter featuring eel from Kitagata.
Currently, there are around 60 producers participating in the association that will supply products to the farmers' market.
There will also be a wide variety of other products such as bento boxes and deli food, plus gardening products such as seedlings and potted plants.
In the souvenir section, there are artworks on display and available to purchase by resident artists of the Kanaz Forest of Creation, as well as confectionery, alcoholic beverages and traditional crafts.

At a press conference, Mayor Mori proclaimed, "I want to reinvigorate the whole of Awara, help to promote the city, and lead to the improvement of local residents' lives and revitalisation of the community."
The cat-shaped serving robot installed at "Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store, the Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Lamb BBQ."
Its cute expressions and other attributes are proving popular with families - Ote 2-chome, Fukui, Fukui Prefecture
In the restaurant industry of Fukui, which is struggling with a labor shortage, there is an increasing trend of introducing serving robots to carry food to customers' tables.
As well as helping restaurants to reduce staff and prevent the spread of COVID-19 through contactless serving, the robot's cute expressions and other attributes are proving popular with families.
According to restaurant managers and related parties, "the use of serving robots is likely to become more widespread as it is difficult to secure full- and part-time workers for restaurants in provincial areas."
"Gen, Gen, Genghis Khan ♪"
Playing a jaunty tune, the robot glides smoothly around the restaurant with food placed on it and a cat's face displayed on its screen.
When it arrives at tables, the robot speaks to customers, saying phrases like, "Here is your order, meow."
"Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store, the Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Lamb BBQ" in Ote 2-chome, Fukui, installed the cat-shaped serving robot in August 2022.
The robot autonomously delivers the food to that table when a customer's order is placed on the robot waiting near the kitchen, and the appropriate table number is selected from the screen.
The robot has built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice functions, reacts to customers' touch, and the cat face on its screen shows a wide range of expressions.
The Bonta Group, which operates the restaurant, has installed serving robots at a total of two restaurants, including this one.
Talking about the reason for installing the robots, Saito Toshiyuki, president of the Bonta Group, cited the shortage of labor as the biggest reason, but also said it was linked to the improvement of productivity through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to sales is usually about 30%, but with the introduction of the serving robots, itt has gone down to 21-22%.
The serving robot also collects customers' empty plates, which leads to efficiency in cleaning, and President Saito added, "The robot delights families and children, and acts as publicity for the restaurant."
"Rocken Hoshiyama Fukui store," a yakiniku and offal hotpot restaurant located in Shinbocho, Araki, Fukui, also installed a serving robot in August 2022.
Hoshiyama Eifuku, president of Sonsan Shoten who operate the restaurant, said, "Even if we advertise for full- or part-time positions, we hardly get any applicants. Therefore I thought the serving robot was an absolute necessity to help ease the shortage of labor."
The Fukui Store operates by separating the areas where staff serve food and the robot delivers food.
The lease fee of the robot is said to be about the same as the wages of one part-time worker.
In addition to the serving robot, the restaurant has installed an ordering system using tablets, and is also considering an automated till to help save labor costs.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, in December 2022, there were 6.94 times more job openings than job applicants in the hospitality and service category, which includes restaurants, indicating that this occupation category has an acute labor shortage.
A representative from NetSystem (Chuo 2-chome, Takagi, Fukui), the company responsible for the sales and distribution of the serving robots, said, "There is now a severe labor shortage at restaurants throughout the prefecture, partially due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we receive a lot of enquiries about introducing robots."
President Hoshiyama's analysis is that, "It will become even more difficult to secure restaurant workers in provincial areas, and so the use of serving robots is likely to become more widespread in the future."
[Editorial] Echizen-cho has created an end-of-life planning booklet, and is distributing copies to residents who want it.
It all started when a similar handbook, which covered the necessary procedures when a relative dies, including a do-it-yourself list for the disposition of property and a family tree, was published two years ago and there were many people who came to pick up a copy for their own use.
It seems that the concept of making preparations for one's death has taken a firm hold in Fukui Prefecture, with courses frequently held throughout the prefecture to show people how to fill in an end-of-life planning booklet and prepare one's affairs before death.
The end-of-life planning booklet created by Echizen-cho has 35 pages.
It is arranged into five chapters, with places to write one's life story, one's current state of health and finances, wishes regarding nursing care and end-of-life care, and requests regarding one's funeral or grave.
There are also sections where you can write a bucket list of things you want to do before you die, and messages to loved ones.
It might seem hard to complete all 35 pages, but it is not necessary to fill in every single page.
What do you want to leave in writing the most for your family and people around you?
The crucial thing is to have a clear idea of the purpose.
In bookshops and other places, there is a wide variety of these booklets for sale according to purpose, and just filling in the sections that you are able to answer is a good place to start.
The term meaning "making preparations for one's death" was coined in 2009, and is a homonym with the word for "job hunting".
Two years later in 2011, the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami occurred.
So many people witnessed in that moment the reality that death can strike at any time, and it seems that this caused an increase in the number of people making preparations for their end of life and death.
It has been a decade since.
The COVID-19 pandemic that swept across the world is still not over even today.
The cost of living has increased due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other factors, and this winter, electricity bills rose to unprecedented levels.
Meanwhile, people's wages have not been raised in proportion with the increased prices, and many people are worried about the future.
At the same time, being an only child is not rare now, whereas things like funeral expenses, nursing expenses and management of the family grave were once shared between siblings and relatives.
Furthermore, although life expectancy has lengthened considerably compared to previous generations, as people get older they face a higher risk of dementia and needing care.
It should be worth noting that these issues are part of the backdrop creating greater social unease, as the concept of making preparations for one's death has taken a firm hold instead of being a passing trend.
In any case, nobody wants to put undue burden on their partners and children.
Apparently, "living out your last days in your own way" is a popular keyword when it comes to end-of-life booklets, but one should not be too self-centered in this regard.
It is better to discuss it with one's family and calmly prepare for that time, rather than secretly writing down one's wishes and requests.

Stated the opinion that in principle, it is not necessary for teachers and students to wear masks at graduation - Toda, Saitama Prefecture, February 10th
On February 10th, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology announced a change of policy saying that the wearing of masks is "basically unnecessary" at graduation ceremonies.
The head teacher of a large middle school aired their concerns, divulging, "In reality, it is difficult to implement physical distancing between students, and so I am at a loss over how to proceed. There are some students who feel uncomfortable about removing their masks."
The topic had also been raised among teachers in response to the media coverage revolving around whether masks should be worn at graduation ceremonies.
On the other hand, the head teacher of an elementary school gave their prediction, saying, "If the decision is made by the government, then it will likely lead to a graduation ceremony without masks. In that event, I think we should be able to manage as long as we exclude singing."
For this year's graduation ceremonies, there are some schools in the prefecture that are seeking to relax restrictions, such as allowing students who had been isolating to participate, and resuming graduating students singing together in a chorus.
Prefectural high schools in Fukui Prefecture are scheduled to have their graduation ceremonies at the beginning of March, with public elementary and middle schools following suit in the middle of the month.
The prefectural and municipal boards of education will await a formal announcement from the Ministry of Education before deciding how to proceed.
Some concerns have also been expressed regarding the Ministry of Education's policy decision where mask wearing is not required for any school activity from the beginning of the new school year in April.
The headteacher of one elementary school opined, "I think it may be a bit bewildering for children if masks suddenly come off one day. I think it would be more natural to decide on the rule that mask wearing is up to the individual, and then the number of children not wearing masks would gradually increase."
× × ×
On February 10th, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology made the decision that students would no longer be asked to wear a mask in any school activity from April onwards, a policy which is in line with new government guidelines for mask wearing.
In principle, choral singing, PE lessons and club activities will be undertaken without masks.
During the remainder of the 2022 academic year, measures to prevent infection will be required in line with the current hygiene control manual, and the ministry will inform schools and boards of education of the precautions to take from April onwards.
Although graduation ceremonies for elementary, middle, high schools and universities will take place during the 2022 academic year, graduating students, teaching staff and current students participating in the ceremonies will not wear masks, and infection prevention measures such as ventilating the venue will be implemented.
Nagata Yasushi cutting the hair of a student (left) preparing to take school entrance exams using scissors blessed with a prayer for exam success - Hair Atelier LimLim in Tsuka-cho, Echizen, Fukui Prefecture
Each year during entrance exam season, Hair Atelier LimLim, a hair salon in Tsuka-cho, Echizen, Fukui Prefecture, cuts students' hair with scissors and other tools blessed with a prayer for exam success.
The service is popular with the students preparing to take entrance exams, attracting comments such as "It made me feel confident," and "I was able to confront the exam calmly."
Nagata Yasushi, director of the hair salon, said he had often seen students reading textbooks while waiting for a haircut, and talking about their exam worries during.
Feeling that he wanted to do something to help, the salon started offering the exam prayer haircut in 2014.
⇒ Totals on the last day for applying to national, prefectural and other public universities
Every year on the first workday of the year, the salon takes its scissors and combs to Kamiso-sha Shrine in Wakatake-cho, Echizen, to have them blessed with a prayer for exam success.
Around 80 people get this haircut each year.
In addition to students preparing for high school and university entrance examinations, there are also customers who are about to take their driving test or an employment exam.
The salon also gives out a pencil blessed with a prayer for exam success as a gift.

"Dear Prime Minister, 'Life's Bulwark' from Tojinbo," a book published by the NPO, Publishing Bureau for Collections of Writing that Touch the Heart
"Dear Prime Minister, 'Life's Bulwark' from Tojinbo" is the tenth title to be privately published in this series.
It has been featured in newspapers around the country, and many readers have shared their thoughts.
The purpose of the book is to inspire people to create a comfortable society by sharing what we have heard first hand from people who were planning to commit suicide, regarding the social and structural issues that are often the cause of suicide in Japan.
We have been patrolling the rocky coastline of Tojinbo, a well-known suicide hotspot, in Fukui Prefecture for 18 years and 10 months to prevent suicide, approaching people considering suicide, offering them protection, and continuing to support them until they have a fresh start in life.
This book collects together the problems that we have heard from the 784 people we have saved so far (as of February 6th), and raises the following seven points for the prime minister to consider regarding policies the government needs to implement to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention efforts are a lifesaving activity.
(2) The motivation behind suicide is often an accumulation of human rights violations.
(3) Victims of suicide are victims of social and structural institutionalised crime.
(4) Administrative bodies treat citizens living outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders", and treat them coldly.
(5) People suffering from mental disorders such as depression are overprescribed medicine, and if they commit suicide, it is treated as an "accident".
(6) In suicide hotspots, the duty of safety and care is being forgotten and the focus has instead shifted towards commercialism.
(7) Any part of the doctrine of a new religious group that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and threatening people with future divine punishment if they do not donate money is extortion.
Any religious group that is guilty of these crimes of fraud and extortion should be publicly denounced and eliminated.
People who have read the book have offered us wholly undeserved praise such as, "I was impressed by the strong mentality of the people engaged in these efforts", "This retired policeman serves as an exemplary model for all police officers" and "To support a total stranger as if they were one's own family truly is the act of a living bodhisattva", and as such, I'd like to share below an excerpt of one person's thoughts.
I looked at the photo in the newspaper article, and tears welled up in my eyes as I thought, "What were they thinking...".
I have heard that suicide is on the increase among people who have been driven to the edge by the COVID-19 pandemic.
It truly is sad.
Everyone should be their true selves.
I wish for a society in which one can live the life one has been given happily.
I have much respect and gratitude for all the staff who dedicate themselves to supporting people who have borne so much pain that they want to die.
I'm sure these efforts must be both physically and mentally draining, but please look after yourselves and continue to approach people.
Thank you.
Respectfully yours
I hope that all readers become guardians in their own communities.

Shimada Kenji, who photographs capybaras almost every week and posts the photos to social media - Happy Jungle, an indoor facility at Asuwayama Mini Zoo, Fukui, Fukui Prefecture, February 1st
In the city, there is a man who, every week, takes pictures of the capybaras at Happy Jungle, an indoor facility at Asuwayama Mini Zoo, Fukui, Fukui Prefecture, and uploads them to Instagram.
On his Instagram page, there are myriad thumbnail images of capybaras, such as mouth open wide and teeth bared mid-yawn, or lying down and basking in the sun.
He has over 10,000 followers from Japan and other parts of the world, and it is helping to promote the joy of Happy Jungle and its capybara inhabitants.
⇒ Kudo Shizuka is sharing Fukui heirloom vegetables on Instagram
The man in question is Shimada Kenji (38), a company employee who lives in the city.
He started posting on social media in March 2021.
Capybaras are the largest rodent species in the world, and their webbed feet make them excellent swimmers.
Since opening in 2018, Happy Jungle has been home to three capybaras, one male and two females, and visitors are able to observe them up close and even feed them.
Shimada first learned about capybaras around five or six years ago.
He was intrigued after watching a video of the animals relaxing in a hot spring, thinking to himself, "What are those animals?"
Shimada was drawn to their almost human-like mannerisms and friendly expressions.
Hearing that they were being raised at Happy Jungle, he looked forward to seeing them up close.
Shimada started taking photos seriously about three years ago, when he bought his first SLR camera.
He has used it extensively to capture the adorable appearance of the capybaras, never missing an opportunity to take a good photo, such as a capybara rotating its body like a drill to shake the water out of its fur.
Shimada has amassed around 830 Instagram posts, which, looking back on, he says, "I'm surprised I managed to take this many photos."
It seems that the male capybara, Yamato-kun, may have remembered who Shimada is after all his frequent visits, as he apparently comes up to him and squeaks.
"It's so cute and it makes me happy," says Shimada, his love for the capybara only growing stronger.
Shimada also enjoys exchanges with capybara lovers from all over Japan on social media, doing things like sharing their best shot each month.
Shimada also visits a zoo in the neighboring prefecture to see the capybara there, about which he says with a smile, "I want to keep my home zoo of Asuwayama as the main focus, but also start taking and posting photos from here."

Toba City Makes Double Payment of Child Benefit to Families, Asking for it to be Paid Back - The Ise Shimbun
[Toba] On the 10th of this month, Toba city officials announced that a total of 600,000 yen of the 2021 special child maintenance payment (for other households) was incorrectly paid to 12 people in 11 households.
The city will apologize to those affected and explain how the error occurred, and request that they make arrangements for the money to be paid back.
According to city officials, the error came to light on January 27th, 2023, when it was reported by the guardian of one of the eligible children who had been checking past payments.
When a total of 182 people in 79 households that were eligible in the financial year in question were checked, it was discovered that the benefit paid on July 20th, 2021 had been paid in double to 12 people in 11 households.
The city pays a benefit of 50,000 yen per child high school age and below in households that are exempt from the municipal tax.
The error occurred when data provided by an outsourced data processing company indicating eligible children was mistakenly thought to not include high school children, so the employee in charge added them to the data, resulting in the payment being made twice.
A person in charge at the city's childcare support office stated, "We are taking this issue seriously, and in the future, we will take all possible measures to prevent an error like this from happening again, such as double checking data, and endeavor to restore trust from the people we serve."

The 24 teams have been divided into eight blocks, and will begin at 9am on the 11th with the first (qualifying) league, followed by 12 matches of the second (semifinals) league from around 3pm onwards, with the remaining second league matches and the deciding matches being played from 9am onwards on the 12th.
From Mie Prefecture there will be two teams competing; Mie High School and the Mie Prefecture selection team, who are hoping to get to the quarterfinals or higher in the Kagoshima National Tournament this autumn.
The policy for both days of the tournament is to carry out basic infection control measures and not to restrict admission.
Admission is free.
Amano Haruo, chairman of the Mie Prefecture Soft Tennis Federation, commented, "It's a wonderful opportunity to see top level players play. I hope there's a large turnout."

10/02/2023 - The Iwaki Minpo
It is snowing again.
Apparently, this is not a northerly cold wave, but the effects of a southern depression that is moving east over Japan.
Although we have only just got over the abnormal cold of the 24th-26th of last month, it seems we can't let our guard down yet ▼ This cold will be even more unbearable for the people of Turkey, which was just hit by a major earthquake.
Buildings collapsed in an instant.
At this moment in time, over 20,000 people in Turkey and neighboring Syria are known to have died in the quake, and many more are still trapped beneath the rubble ▼ Turkey is well-known as an ally of Japan.
The two countries' relations date back to 1890, when the frigate Ertuğrul sent to Japan by the Ottoman Empire, was shipwrecked.
The ship was wrecked off the coast of Kushimoto-cho, Wakayama Prefecture, whose residents came to the rescue of crew members and nursed them back to health, an incident that is immortalized in film and literature ▼ Approximately 100 years after the shipwreck, the favor was repaid when Turkish aircraft were deployed to rescue Japanese hostages held by Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War.
People who went through the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami can feel the pain of the Turkish people.
We will keep the Turkish people in our thoughts as the situation comes under control and they work towards recovery and reconstruction.

Advice on handling swords is also being given at the exhibition, and a sword worked on by Tsukamoto Ikkansaiokimasa (1915-1960), a noted modern swordsmith from Koriyama, was brought in, which drew admiration from staff at the event.
Tsukamoto Ikkansaiokimasa was ranked best in the east in the pre-war era swordsmith rankings, and many visitors to the exhibition were fascinated by the beautiful sword.

Bellino Hotel Misappropriation of Relief Funds, Monies Returned in Full for Accommodation Subsidy by City and Prefecture｜Iwanichi Online  Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
Ichinoseki City and Iwate prefecture announced on the 10th that Bellion Hotel Inchinoseki (Yamanome, Ichinoseki) have been misappropriating subsidies marked for accommodation discounts for travelers since October 2021, for approximately a year.
Employee discounts were being used for hotel guests who were not covered by the subsidy.
There were also a number of cases where hotel employees stayed as guests, violating the subsidiary's objective of "boosting demand for tourism".
After investigations by the hotel, city and prefecture, a total amount of 7,231 thousand Yen, considered to be misused, has been returned by the 6th of this month.
The mishandled subsidies were "Iwate Travel Boost Project", a prefectural accommodation discount implemented to counter the negative effects of Covid-19, and "Ichinoseki Accommodation Discount", the city's emergency hotel and tourism aid project.
Discounts were applied during the period between October 18, 2021 to October 10, 2022 (until September 20, 2022 for Ichinoseki Accommodation Discount), and investigations revealed 95 invalid cases worth 587,000 yen where discounts were not applied due to reasons such as inapplicable regions and non-vaccinated travelers, and 1,239 invalid cases totaling 6,644,000 yen where usage were not in line with the project's objective.
When the prefecture's contractor for the project was settling the account, they found a number of cases where the name of the hotel guest receiving the discount and the name of the hotel receptionist were the same.
With the detailed investigation by the prefecture revealing misuse of subsidies, the city also confirmed the facts.
The city's project has already ended, and the hotel's registration to the prefectural project has been eliminated as of December 2nd of last year.
When reached for comment, Dobashi Michiaki, CEO of Bellino Hotel, stated "I would like to apologize to the people in the local district, city and prefecture, and to all those who were affected. We deeply regret this situation. The hotel is supported by the people of this region, and I aim to rebuild trust we had by starting anew from scratch," and mentioned plans to hold compliance (legal compliance) workshops for all employees.
Chiba Takayoshi, manager of the Tourism Promotion Division of Iwate Prefecture, said, "This is extremely regrettable.  We urge, once again, to follow rules, establish compliance policies, and to appropriately use subsidies in line with the project's purpose."
Mayor Sato Yoshihito commented, "It is truly regrettable that the project was inappropriately used by a hotel in this city."

Thursdays Only Ramen Shop, Dandan Noodles on the Menu, Kinshuko Michinoeki Roadside Market (Nishiwaga)｜Iwanichi Online  Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
At the Kinshuko Michinoeki Roadside Market (store manager : Kouki Masuoka) in Nishiwagacho's Suginahata, Rame shop "Menya Nishiki" will be open only on Thursdays, which was the day their restaurant was originally closed.
They have developed new Dandan noodles (850yen including tax) with locally sourced ingredients so that more diners can enjoy regional flavors.
Restaurant Kinshuko, which serves "Yuda Dam Curry (1200 yen including tax)" and "Nishiwaga Marugoto Ramen (900 yen including tax), was originally closed on Thursdays to give employees rest days, but diners voiced their disappointment.
So the store decided to start a ramen only shop that requires less staffing, starting on the 9th.
Of the regular restaurant menu, they will limit their offerings to Soysauce ramen, Soysauce Char sui ramen, Miso ramen and Miso Char sui ramen, as well as the Dandan noodles.
The Dandan noodle that was developed for the new shop "Menya Nishiki" uses "Yukikko miso" made from soy and sea salt from Nishiwaga, locally sourced scallions, Nishiwarabi bracken fern fiddleheads, ground meat and chili peppers among other ingredients.
There was an influx of orders on opening day, and the restaurant is considering selling on other days of the week in the future.
The Michinoeki Roadside Market was closed from May 2021 to November 2022 due to closure of National route 107.
During this time, it operated an alternative store "Ramen and Domburi Shop Nishiki" in Kotsunagizawa in the same city, and is now utilizing that experience.
Store manager Masuoka promotes the store by saying "Dandan noodles which warm up the body during this season are perfect. The menu is small but I want people to feel happy with good food."
Store hours during winter are the same as the restaurant; from 11 am to 2:30pm (last order at 2pm).

Pioneers in Botany and Their Collection from Mount Hayachine, Special Exhibit at Cultural Property Center (Hanamaki) ｜Iwanichi Online  Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
A special exhibit titled "People who introduced the flowers of Hayatine - History of Hayachine Botanical Research", showcasing the pioneers who established the foundation for botanical research of Mout Hatachine, known for its rich variety of alpine plants, will be held at the Municipal Cultural Property Center in Hanamaki City's Ohasamamachi from the 12th.
124 items will be on display including rare specimens collected by the pioneering researchers, and will highlight the footsteps of those involved in the botanical research of Mount Hayachine.
Botanical research in Mt. Hayachine began during the Bakumatsu period, with Russian botanist Carl Johann Maximowicz (1827-1891) coming to Japan and instructing Shiwa-cho's Sugawa Chonosuke (1842-1925) on botanical collection.
With restrictions on foreigners' movements in Japan, Maximovicz was not able to travel freely and settled in Yokohama and Nagasaki to continue his research for 3 years while delegating the task of gathering specimens to Sugawa.
Sugawa continued to support Maximowicz's research even after he left Japan, and this lead to the publication of species unique to Mount Hayachine such as "Primula macrocarpa," "Sanguisorba obtusa," and "Aruncus dioicus var. astilboides."
This was followed by the discovery of "Bistorta hayachinensis," "Minuartia verna (L.) Hiem var. japonica H. Hara," and "Draba japonica" in 1903 (Meiji 36) by modern-day botanist Makino Tomitaro (1862-1957), and in 1905 (Meiji 38), Makino personally climbed Mount Hayachine to discover and name "Arenaria katoana."
The exhibited materials reveal how the precious alpine plants were discovered by many researchers.
The exhibit also introduces us to Sugimura Matsunosuke (1874-1948), principal of Hanamaki Elementary School and a botanical researcher who joined the investigation on preservation of natural treasures in 1927 (Showa 2), as well as Tamagawa Shichiro (1914-1988), curator of Ohasamamachi Municipal Mountain Museum who was involved in publishing "Plants of Hayachine."
Yoshida Sohei, curator of the city's Cultural Property Center, explains, "There is a wealth of research and bond among people involved behind the name of each and every Mount Hayachine plant. One can trace the connections among researchers throughout the country."
The special exhibit is made of 4 parts, with the first being about the religious beliefs and the history of Hachimine, and the second placing a spotlight on the characteristics of Mount Hayachine through the geological findings by German geologist Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), who established the basis of Japan's geological research.

His fastball blazed even using a different ball.
Lotte's Sasaki Roki (Ofunato High School) stepped up to the mound for the first time on the 9th at the Ishigaki Camp in Okinawa, making 30 pitches in a practice game, and marking 160km/h using a ball that was used in the World Baseball Classic (WBC).
Pitching against 6 batters, there were 2 hits, "I gained a lot from this. My forkballs have gotten a little better compared to last year's warm-up matches," said Sasaki with a look of satisfaction.
Sasaki marked 160km/h twice, pushing Fujiwara into batting a foul ball and Yasuda into a grounder heading for 2nd base.
He pitched some sliders into the mix, calmly creating a pitcher-led combination of pitches, and Matsukawa who was on the receiving end, gave some words of praise, saying "Sasaki was making some really strong pitches, forcing the batters to be late on their swings."
Lotte's manager, Yoshii also commented, "I think he's growing at a good pace. At this time and point, he's doing great," seeming satisfied with the progress the pitcher has made in his 4th year of being a professional baseball player.
The strong arm that's gaining so much attention is scheduled to make around 40 pitches in the practice match against Yakult on the 15th (at Itoman, Okinawa).
Sasaki displayed meticulous preparation, saying "I'd like to refine my straight balls and be able to have more well-rounded coordination."
Idlib Governorate, northwestern Syria experiences damage from a large earthquake, early morning on the 9th (information provided by local residents, Kyodo)
【Gaziantep, southern Turkey, Kyodo】According to local authorities in Turkey and neighboring Syria, in the wake of the large earthquake whose epicenter was southern Turkey, the total number of victims in both countries has surpassed 21,000 as of the 9th.
As rescue operations continue in the bitter cold, finding survivors in the rubble of collapsed buildings is getting harder as time passes.
Rescue operations continued in earnest in the disaster-stricken areas.
On the 9th, the first humanitarian aid supplies from the UN reached the disaster-hit Idlib Governorate in northwestern Syria via the Turkish border after the region was hit by the earthquake on the 6th.
There were concerns that international relief would not be able to reach Idlib Governorate, as it is the last stronghold of the rebel faction opposing the Assad regime.
Heavy machinery has been brought in to assist with the rescue efforts in the disaster-hit areas of both countries, but they are encountering difficulties.
It is believed that there are still many people buried under the rubble, making it likely that the number of casualties will increase further.
Turkish authorities have confirmed that there are 17,674 casualties within its borders.
There are an additional 3,000 casualties in Syria, making this disaster greater than the 1999 earthquake of northeastern Turkey, in which over 17,000 people lost their lives.
The city of Miyako has announced that it is planning to take independent measures to provide financial support for businesses within the city, which are taking a hit due to the increasing fuel and goods prices, by assisting them with electricity, gas, and gasoline costs.
As an emergency measure, the city will use its independent revenue to support the local economy.
The support is available to all businesses (excluding farms, fisheries, electricity and gas companies).
To be considered eligible, the profit ratio for the fiscal year that just ended must have decreased compared to the previous year.
The amount of financial support will be half the amount of any increased costs incurred over a consecutive six-month period between April 2022 and March 2023, compared to the previous year, with an upper limit of 1 million yen per business.
The city is expecting to provide financial support to around 800 businesses.

Practicing hard in the hopes of making a third major appearance.
Women's snowboarder Iwabuchi Reira (Burton, Ichinoseki Gakuin High School, 3rd year at Hosei University) will not take part in the third round of the slopestyle event at the World Cup (Canada), choosing instead to train in Fukushima Prefecture to prepare for the World Championship (Georgia), which begins on the 19th.
"I wasn't sure I'd have much to practice during the season if I competed in every event at the World Cup. I wanted to do some conditioning in Japan to improve my accuracy," she stated calmly.
Her best result from the last two events was 5th in slopestyle, and this year she is aiming for the podium in two events, including big air, which is her strong suit.
In this season's World Cup, she won the big air event, and placed 2nd in the second round of slopestyle.
She emphasized her natural approach, saying, "I'm going to refocus my energy, but I hope to go into the events without being too rigid," suggesting that she's in good condition.
At the end of January, she won her first big air event at the Winter X Games, where the world's top pros gather.
Iwabuchi made a stir for the first time in a competition at the Bejing Winter Olympics last year, when she attempted a triple underflip, although she didn't stick the landing.
She reacted strongly, saying "I was able to take some steps, and get a clear image. It was a huge accomplishment."

It consists of about 70 members and 4 rescue dogs.
Team leader Yamamoto Hideaki said, "The situation on-site is just terrible. It reminded me of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Japan and Turkey's relationship is one of helping each other out in times of need."

Second Council Meeting to Promote Decarbonization Discusses the Introduction of Renewable Energy and Goals at Amami Airport | Society & Economy | Nankai Nichinichi Newspaper
Council meeting to discuss and promote decarbonization at Amami Airport - Kasari-cho, Amami
The "Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council" (Chairman: Ando Takashi, Director of Construction, Oshima Branch Office, 13 members), consisting of the prefecture officials and airlines using the airport, held its second meeting regarding reducing greenhouse gas emissions at Amami Airport (Kasari-cho, Amami) on the 9th.
All committee members were in attendance, including online participants.
The participants exchanged views on setting decarbonization goals and the introduction of renewable energy sources, mainly solar power.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set an overall target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at every airport in the country by 46% or more (compared to FY2013) by 2030, in order to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions, or "carbon neutrality", by 2050.
In response, the council held its first meeting last November, aiming to formulate plans ahead of the other six airports located on remote islands in the prefecture.
As with the first session, the second meeting was closed to the public except for the beginning.
According to Chariman Ando, who was interviewed after the meeting, they were able to determine the levels of the airport's greenhouse gas emissions.
The council held their discussions in accordance with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism's guidelines to set targets and introduce renewable energy sources.
According to the documents distributed at the meeting, the CO2 emissions of the airport's equipment and vehicles (excluding aircraft) in FY2013, the benchmark year, were 1,476 metric tons.
Of which, lighting and air conditioning emissions from seven facilities, including the airport terminal building, accounted for about 90%, or 1,321 tons, followed by aviation lighting emissions of 84 tons and airport vehicle emissions of 71 tons.
The council will proceed with discussions regarding reducing emissions from said facilities and vehicles.
Chairman Ando stated, "This is a checkpoint. The committee members are in agreement on our direction, and we'd first like to make sure that everything is drawn up in the draft interim report."
Future plans will be formulated after a hearing on the draft interim report at the 3rd meeting, and the final draft of the report at the 4th meeting.
Okinoerabu Branch of "Upside-down Real Estate" Opens with the Aim of Bringing People to the Island, Interested Renters Seek Landlords | Society & Economy | Nankai Nichinichi Newspaper
Talk sessions and more held to further the understanding of "Upside-down Real Estate" at the opening event on the 8th, China-cho
【Okinoerabu General Office】The opening event of the Okinoerabu branch of "Upside-down Real Estate," an online property service that visualizes the wishes of people who want to take on the task of renting vacant homes and stores, and advertises to landlords, was held on the 8th at "entaku," a community space in China-cho, China.
During the talk session, the managing company provided an overview of the service.
Okubo Masahiro, representative director of Tsuginoba (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), which manages the branch office, said, "We hope that by implementing this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we can create a movement and a trend that will attract people to areas throughout the island."
Unlike typical real estate procedures, Upside-down Real Estate displays the information of people who wish to rent and receives enquiries from landlords, then, if an agreement is reached, both parties sign a contract between themselves.
The service began in June 2020 as an experiment for discovering vacant homes with potential, and building relationships through said homes, and is operated by On-Co ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture).
This branch office is the 7th to be opened, and the first in Kyushu.
It is the first branch in the nation to be located on a remote island.
The event was attended by around 20 people, including On-Co and Tsuginoba staff, Wadomari and China town hall officials, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background behind the opening of the branch office, stating, "As the movement to attract people from outside the island becomes more active, I thought that if we could utilize vacant homes and stores, the town and the island could become even more lively from there."
He expressed his feelings, saying "We want to connect people who own properties on the island with people who want to do something here, and help as many people as possible in their efforts."
On-Co representative Takeshi Mizutani pointed out the importance of caring for each vacant home and discussing with local residents what they want to do with the area, who they want to attract, and what criteria those people will use to select the homes, among other things.
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information will be gathered," he said, calling on islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

Does the turn signal work when the engine of the NSR250R is off and the key is in the ON position?
If the battery is in good condition, when the key is turned to the ON position the ACC or accessories will have power so things like the turn signal and brake lights will work.
The horn will also work.
However, after starting the engine, the voltage will increase and everything will work better.
Can the ADATA DDR4 be mixed with the Samsung DDR4?
It's about a laptop.
Generally, if the pin arrangement, voltage and frequency standards match, they can be used together.
If only the frequency is different, it is designed to match the slower one, but, depending on the product, it may not work well so I can't say it will definitely be OK.

Those that know, please give me some advice.
Are you ignoring all the harnesses, controls and settings?
If so, it'd be about ¥300,000.
However, I think you should prepare about ¥1,000,000 separately.
Do I look fat because I have some fat around my waist and bottom?
It would give the impression of the upper body being normal, middle-aged belly fat but, the lower body is big!
As a whole, it'd give an impression that you're quite big.
While my nephew was surfing the Internet something like this seems to have come up, is it ok to completely ignore it?
Unless you entered various things, the registration is a lie and it's OK to be ignored.
Is this thin hair?
This is a "part" due to the hairstyle.
If you continue with a hairstyle like yours, and brush your hair incorrectly with a comb or hair brush, it's easier to get thin hair, so be careful.
However, if you brush your hair properly, it's harder to get thin hair.
If you don't like your scalp showing, you can solve the problem by changing to a hairstyle that doesn't part your hair.
Is this Dunhill wallet authentic?
If it was purchased at a famous department store like Takashimaya, it would have come with a warranty certificate and I would say it's undoubtedly authentic, that's what happened, right??
Was it given as a gift or something!?
If it's suspicious, you should get it appraised by an expert at a nearby pawn shop or a second-hand brand store.
Didn't teachers, who are school club superviors with no prior experience, do club activities when they were students?
Cases where the school club supervisor is inexperienced is because there aren't any others who are experienced (including club supervisors who are already in charge of other clubs) and so, it doesn't necessarily mean that they didn't do club activities when they were a student.
I'm a high school student.
It has been slowly getting colder recently so I started to wear black tights, but is the timing still too early?
If you think that you are cold, then it's ok to wear them.
There's no need to conform to the timing around you.

Are you living alone?
What's something fun to do?
I was living by myself.
Until last year.
It was fun.
Humans are creatures of habit, so when we continue to have fun every day, the situation becomes normal for daily life.
If you have fun in daily life, unless there's something more enjoyable, you won't think that it is "fun".
I understand that, so "uneventful daily life" is fun.
That's how I feel.
Do you put a lot of tempura crumbs on your instant yakisoba?

If I used spray paint to paint stainless steel, would it be more difficult for a magnet to stick to it?
It depends on the magnetic force, but it can happen.
Rather, as No1 wrote, stainless steel isn't magnetic, so maybe this stainless steel has some iron mixed in or is of low purity.
It's a common story with counterfeit Chinese-made stainless steel.

Has anyone upgraded an early or mid-term model to the late-term model?
How much did it cost?
What else did you change other than the headlights?
If there's anyone who is more knowledgeable, please let me know, thank you in advance.
It would generally be cheaper to buy the late-term version.
Good evening.
Thank you for answering.
To me, computer games and manga,

Everyone, do you think they're interesting?
Everyone is different.
Doesn't the industry exist because there are people interested in it?
What do you think about the woman you like meticulously keeping every box of the chocolates that you gave her as a present?
It's OK if they are being kept to be used for something, but if not, I'd be a little worried that they are becoming a potential hoarder.
Why do elderly people like priority seats?
The people who are sitting in the priority seats are always the elderly.
I only see young people sitting in the priority seats about once every 10 times.
Why?
It's because priority seats are reserved for the elderly with limited mobility and for people who can't move freely.
Do you think wearing the polo shirt in the image below would be appropriate for casual office wear?
It's an office job that's not as formal as a bank or securities.
I think it's important to match the atmosphere of your coworkers around you.
Firstly, how about you look at the people in your company and try to make an assessment.
I think it's good if you wear something that's between "flashily dressed people" and "plainly-dressed people".
What do you think about your boyfriend who gets along well with his mother?
It's good, isn't it?
The whole family getting along is the best!
What are you worried about?
Do living creatures have a trait that they are reluctant to leave the place they were born?
A familiar place to live is safe and has food, which is why they don't want to leave.
If there's danger, or they have run out of food, they will leave.
Humans did that and spread all over the world out of Africa.
Does yakkami refer to someone who is envious of other people?
Yakkami doesn't mean someone who is envious of others, but it's being envious of other people.

Are there any characters in anime, manga or special effects shows where they hide their true identity and later turn out to be a different person, even though it was obvious?
There are so many of those characters like "Rather, you don't need to your true identity!", so I'm sick of them, I want to know unexpected types of characters.
Like Full Frontal in Gundam UC.

It is a platform (app) for automated trading (programme-based) in the foreign exchange market.
MT is an abbreviation for Meta Trader.
The 4 and 5 are the different versions.
Why am I so bad at everything?
That's probably because you are comparing yourself to someone who is superior.
It's because we compare that we become either superior, amazing or useless.
Aren't you good enough as yourself?
At the very least, if you try to do your best, you're not "a useless person".
Ramen these days are just covered in backfat and topped with kimchi, they're so greasy and spicy!
They're gross!
Aren't there any ramen that aren't so rich, like ones with soy sauce based-soup or broth made of pork bones?
I don't want these so-called Korean-style ones!
Ramen served in a local diner that's been around since the old days!
The kind of place that serves rice bowl dishes, udon and soba noodles.
That's the kind of ramen I like too.
Light-flavored ramen includes ramen like Hidatakayama ramen and Kitakata ramen.
I'm going to a job interview for a part-time position at a supermarket tomorrow.
I'm worried about what they're going to ask me..
・Basic information that's written on the resume (there are times they ask you about them)
・Your commute time from home to work
・Transportation costs
・Whether you have experience in part-time work
・Why did you choose here to apply
・The days of the week and hours you can put in shifts
I think they'll ask you about these things at least!

Have you ever caught the flu in your lifetime up to now?
Have you caught it quite a few times?
Personally, I don't remember whether I caught it a long time ago, but probably a few times?
I guess.
I don't have any memory of catching the flu in over 50 years since I started working, but 5 or 6 years ago, when I had my antibody levels tested at a city hospital, I had an antibody count high enough to offer protection.
I also don't remember getting any flu shots, so I probably caught the flu without knowing and my body developed the antibodies.
Do you use trays or placemats around the dinner table?

Has anyone started playing basketball from the age of 24?
I'm not a beginner, yet I can't say I'm good either, but I gained weight recently so I was thinking of trying it out as a method of weight loss, what do you think?
There are lots of groups like that, where you go to play basketball when invited.
Of course, there are some groups out there that are welcoming even to beginners.
When I watch car commercials from the Showa era on YouTube, I feel like they were influencing purchaser power through the music they used, but can it be said that old car commercials were good?
I think Honda commercials were good.
I feel like car commercials during the Showa era didn't actively feature popular actors or actresses like they do now.
No, there were lots of commercials with famous people in them.
There's no doubt that the atmosphere of them was totally more sophisticated than now.
This is about something that happened a bit before, but it's been bothering me all this time.
I was hospitalized in order to undergo surgery for an enlarged prostate, but since I was hospitalized for 2 months, I received nearly no support from the High-Cost Medical Expense benefit.
(because one month is the standard)
Is it possible that the doctor had me hospitalized for 2 months on purpose?
Probably it's because of COVID.
If your life isn't in danger, you go through triage.
Can you clear up a misunderstanding by pointing it out?

Why don't you try speaking up?
Is it really bad to be unable to manage your own funds despite having a graduate degree in economics and an MBA?
You don't get an MBA in order to manage your own money, so it's not a problem.
Does it take a few days for lymph nodes to heal once they've become swollen?
I think it depends on why they were swollen.
If they were swollen because of cold symptoms or something, I think the swelling would go down as you recover from the cold.
I heard a doctor once say that if the swelling is really bad and causes pain, you need to take antibiotics in order to fix it, so you may want to visit a hospital.
Can you run further than a 5th grader?

About manga... even if the drawings were bad, honestly, would you read something if the story was interesting?
Would you keep reading it?
(;_;)Even if they really sucked at drawing, like me...!
It's rough and I haven't decided on the character design yet, but I plan to make it dark from the first page!
Manga is only manga if it has good artwork.
If the artwork is bad, I won't even pick it up.
Would you be angry if your wife prepared frozen food for dinner occasionally?
First of all, I'd be worried that she's not feeling well.
If the frozen food is delicious and prepared well, that's fine, but if it was obviously gross I may be angry.
I'd want to help look for tastier frozen foods, or perhaps a better way to prepare them.
I have a simple question.
Can't I, a computer-illiterate person, use ChatGPT?

Rikkyo University's Yosuke Ikeda announced that he wants to go pro, so will he aim to be the 17th professional baseball player from Chiben Wakayama High School?
It seems he started thinking about it since his upperclassman from Rikkyo, Kosei Shoji, was first picked by Rakuten during the draft last year.
183cm, 92kg, right-handed, pitcher.
His fastball reaches up to 150km/h, and he can throw a variety of pitches: slider, curve, changeup, forkball, two-seam.
If picked, he would be the 17th person from Chiben Wakayama High School, the first since Tatsuto Kobayashi was picked in the 4th 2020 draft by Hiroshima.

The idea is using it from commuting to going out.
Both the top and bottom are flared, which is annoying, so how about changing the bottom to pants, or something tight?
Or you could try changing the top to something a bit simplier?
Is Shimajiro no Wao shown on Sundays on TV Tokyo?
That's right.
On TV Tokyo it starts 7/10(Sun.) from late at night.
A note about the time:

In other words, it starts after the date has changed to 7/11(Mon.), at 1:30 a.m.
Does the outdoor unit rotate when using an air conditioner's ventilation function?
How does it push the air out?
Using the power of the fans within the indoor unit, it sucks air into the intake and then blows it back out.
When changing the air temperature, the outdoor unit rotates to activate the heat exchanger, but when ventilating there is no need to do so, and so the outdoor unit doesn't rotate.
If I ask an employee for a case of "Giant" ice cream cones at the supermarket, will they sell it to me?
If they have enough stock, and it doesn't impact the number of items on sale at the store, I'm sure they will; however, it depends on the store's situation so not just with "Giant" ice cream, but also batteries,  snacks, and bread, it's better to contact them in advance to make a reservation.
When I ordered 30 ice creams as a treat for my children's club activities, I also asked in advance.
Please tell me if there are any free apps that provide location data.
My child got a smartphone, and I'd like to check their location.
I installed an app called "COCODAYO" but after a month passed, I had to begin paying.
Please tell me if there are any free apps that I can use to check someone's location.
The "Location Sharing" on "Google Maps" can be used for free.

I'm looking for a well-received gaming router wireless LAN that doesn't support Wi-Fi6
I know it doesn't make much sense if it's not Wi-Fi6, but I can't do any construction because of personal reasons, so I'm still asking
if there's anything you know of that you think is good, please tell me.
Thank you.
It's more difficult to find ones that don't support Wi-Fi6 now,
so I think something Wi-Fi6 compatible is suffice because they work even with unsupported devices.
Does the Tokaido Shinkansen slow down at Yamashina when arriving in Kyoto?
Naturally, it slows down before Yamashina.
There are only 5.5km between Kyoto and Yamashina.
If you were traveling at 280km/h, that distance would only take about 1-1.5 minutes for you to arrive.
Why do so few people put mayonnaise on yakitori even though it's delicious?
Because many people don't think it's delicious.
Was the Porno Graffiti CD single released on Wednesday, July 13th, 2022?
Please tell me if you know.
It's not released.
Their last CD single was the 51st, "Theme Song", released on Wednesday, September 22nd last year.
It rose up to 2nd place on Oricon.
It's June now, but it's not strange to wear clothes that expose your shoulders, right?
Even kimonos have changed to summer kimonos, so I don't think it's strange.
I guess it depends on the day's weather.
What does "chan-chan" at the end of a sentence mean? Thank you m(_ _)m
It's one of the gags in Yoshimoto Shinkigeki.
It's a sound announcing the end of the gag.
What did you eat for breakfast on May 6 (Fri.) 2022?
I made a sandwich with a loaf of six-slice bread, gyoza and ham, then toasted it and ate it with coffee. It was good.
Are there any people who download music now that there are free music apps?
There are.
I buy songs of artists that I like or want to support.
I also buy CDs.
There are all kinds of convenience stores in Japan such as Seven Eleven, Family Mart, Lawson, Ministop, and Seicomart, but do you have a favorite convenience store?
Please let me know!
The one I go to the most is 7-Eleven.
Because it's next to where I live.
My favorite is Natural Lawson.
Do you eat sweets from the convenience store?
I like caramel custard or jelly-based desserts, and I enjoy them occasionally (⁠^⁠^⁠)
Working out
Is it better to work out before or after you eat?
If you work out while your energy is depleted (empty stomach) you'll lose muscle
If you take in nutrients (mainly protein) after working out, it's easier to put on muscle
So, if you're going to be serious about it, replenishing nutrients both before and after working out is necessary
But, if I have to pick only one, either before or after, I think working out after eating is the best choice
Do you like posts from friends that don't like your posts on Facebook or Instagram, etc.?
If I like the post then I do.
Because I think liking a post is something you do if that post or information is something that you liked, not something that you do to reciprocate.
I have absolutely no interest in whether other people liked something or not.
Is a Cretan that calls all Cretans liars honest?
It's the paradox problem.
If you're honest then you become a liar at that point, and if you're a liar, you're a liar telling lies.
If I were to choose one of these three; Theatrhythm Dragon Quest, Rhythm Heaven Fever, or Wario Land Shake It!, which would you recommend?
I recommend Theatrhythm.
Please tell me about the economic results of shortened working hours.
According to reports from companies that have implemented shortened working hours, many companies state that employees have strived to be more efficient on their own with reduced working hours, and because of that, business performance has increased.
Salaries go up and holidays increase as a result of improved business performance, so expenditures increase too, which also has economic effect.
Winter tires  Does increasing the air pressure a bit have any effect on driving on snowy roads?
Does making the pressure a bit higher increase fuel costs slightly?
Do you need to increase the pressure significantly?
I think rolling resistance would be better.
Winter tires are low-pressure tires, so if you increase the pressure, they could not get traction on the snow, or be more likely to burst, etc. there's nothing good about it.
I have never received Best Answer even once.
What should I do to get Best Answer?
I'm not conscious of it, but I do receive Best Answer from time to time.
Firstly, I'd sincerely answer the person who seriously asks a question. I'd put myself in their position and think about the situation and then answer.
I consider what would be the best kind of answer for that person.
Doing that means your answer could be the best for the person asking the question as well.
Hope that helps.
My eyelashes drop right after I curl them, so I'd like to know how to make them stay curled.
Apply mascara, and after it dries, curl them in three steps while gradually applying a curve.
By applying the mascara first, in short, the eyelashes are coated (stiffened) with the adhesive, in that state,  you can easily curl and fix them in place.
If you do it in three steps, you can make it neat.
Please tell me about useful items that you wish you had used earlier in your life.
Futon dryer
I didn't expect it to be this great.
The futon is fluffy and freshly dried!
You can get a great night's sleep during this time of year ♬
Is the AKB48 Team8 outfit being worn at the United States of Odaiba 2013, as shown in the picture?
Is it also being worn on Eight Day?
There are pictures of the same outfit at United States of Odaiba 2013, so I think so.
I couldn't tell whether it was also being worn on Eight Day, though.
Please tell me your favorite soba and udon.
For soba, I like zaru soba.
I also like grated yam soba.
For udon, I like tempura udon.
Maybe because I'm poor, shrimp tempura udon is a great treat.
It's just too incessant
It's been going on constaaantly since 1:30
Rumbling rumbling rumbling rumbling rumbling rumbling rumbling.
Putting in earplugs didn't help at all; can still hear it
A painful and cruel hell where you can't sleep really exists
Just how much longer is this going to go on for??
Are you talking about spring thunder, or thunder before a snow storm?
It'll be over soon.
I've been to several different dentists, but when you sit in that treatment chair, some dentists and dental hygienists that talk to you from behind at a slight angle.
I'm not sure if it's best to turn back and look at them for this, but looking back for a long time is painful and difficult, yet I feel it's rude to just continue looking straight forward...
Does anybody understand?
What do you do?
I talk while facing straight not only at the dentist but also at the barber and the beauty shop.
100% polyester or viscose, which material is cooler?
Viscose is better and cooler.
I have a question.
I just started working this April.
What should I do to become a more worldly person?
Thank you.
For right now, you should focus on quickly becoming proficient in the work you've been assigned so you can be an asset to your company instead of thinking about how to become worldly.
Is your stomach clock accurate?
My internal clock and stomach clock are the only ones that haven't gone wrong.
The front panel of the door on my bathroom cabinet came off and I want to request repairs, which shop should I contact?
Please let me know.
They have veneer at home centers, so you can measure the size, work it, and replace it yourself.
When you go to submit income tax return documents to the tax office, they don't have to be printed in color, right?
No
When will the amount filed on my tax return at the beginning of the year be deposited into my account?
It will be deposited in about two to three weeks.
You'll get a postcard notifying you they'll be depositing the money in advance, so once that comes, record it in your bankbook, as the money has been deposited.
For now, all you can do is to wait for the postcard (notification).
Please tell me how to check my LINE ID.
Select Home on the bottom left, press the gear icon at the top right, and you can see it on the profile at the very top.
If it isn't set yet, you can set it just once.
Can you use a Visa Line Pay prepaid card to buy the ticketless limited-express ticket through E5489?
Good evening.
The JR West Japan's ticketless limited-express ticket through e5489 can only be paid for with a credit card.
You can't use prepaid cards.
It's quite a bit past the date, but do you think it's still alright?
It's vegetable juice.
It depends on the way it was stored.
If it has been kept in the fridge, you can drink it even two or three days past the date, but if it was left outside, or always sitting at room temperature, I think it would be best to get rid of it.
You wouldn't want something weird to happen to your body later.
How is the Saru Brother Saruhara Shinichi in Avataro Donbrothers able to dine at Cafe Donbura when he's unemployed?
What about the payment?
Other than the time he paid with a haiku in episode 2, he doesn't order anything.
Which function on this washing machine would be close to delicate cycle (like handwash function)?
Thank you.
Select "Dry" for the course.
Can you enjoy the movie The Promised Neverland without knowing what happened before or after the movie?
Yes you can.
Because it's a simple story.
If it's okay to say, it's a story about running from monsters that eat people.
I'm pretty sure nurses travel to work in ordinary clothes, but is it okay to wear even sandals barefooted?
Well, you're going to change all your clothes anyway, so I figure any clothes are fine as long as it's easy to travel in and isn't weird.
I'm envious of houses where no one comes over at all, but is there anything that you miss out on in a home like that?
You would become less diligent about cleaning around the house.
You would also start lacking in hospitality towards guests.
This is about Instagram.
I (an ordinary person) currently have about 10,000 followers, but if somebody who didn't know this saw that, would they think that was amazing?
Or would they not really think that much about it?
What would you think?
I think that's incredible.
That's a miracle for an ordinary person.
I think you've done something special.
Frustrated by problems
I rarely find the time to exercise, so I purchased this compression undergarment in the hopes that I could just rely on this currently trendy item.
I am 175cm tall and weigh 80kg, so I bought size L.
It's very hard to put on at first, but I assume it would be okay once I get used to it.
I used it for a few days, but because of the problems that occurred I am now wearing a different compression undergarment.
The problems are 1) unless you have very thin arms, where the bands of the sleeves sit (right at the upper arm) is so tight that it feels like the blood flow to my arms is being cut off and it is very itchy.
2) The part around the abdomen is too loose.  Because of these two problems, I have stopped wearing it.
It feels very tight when worn, but one can sleep in it.
Great value if it fits
Size S was good as I am 158cm and 50kg.
However, for someone like me who has a large build and is muscly, they were not a good fit.
Because they are not sculpted to fit around the buttocks and such, it left a strange gap and they slipped down easily and just didn't feel right.
I felt like I was always having to pull them back up.
I think they would be good for someone shaped like a stick.
In terms of the thickness, I guess you could say they are a reassuring thinness.
They don't feel flimsy or like they're going to rip, and I was able to wear them in some pretty close-fitting knee-high boots, making it look neat.
Lovely
I don't really like showing much skin on my upper body, and when I was searching for something different from a fitness swimsuit, I came across this.
The top looks fancy with a laced back and embroidered hem.
The bottom is also good, because it's nice being able to choose between wearing the bikini or wearing the shorts over the top (^.
^) It's only just arrived and all I've done is try it on and I've not actually been in the water yet so I can't say anything about the durability or what it's like when it's wet, but it's beautifully sewn and the fabric is strong, so I think it was a bargain at this price.
It said there were no wires in the bust part, but when I felt it it seemed there was something hard below the pads.
Nonetheless, it doesn't hurt when I wear it, and it fits along the bust line, so it seems like it will be good even when I move around.
I wonder if they changed the design from no pads to having them?
(^.
^) At any rate, I'm looking forward to getting into the water in this♪ thank you very much♪
Size M was a little large at 156cm, 45kg
The raincoat is made of a thick material, so it feels hot and humid, but it's well made, so it should last for a long time.
It came with two rain visors, which prevented my face from getting wet.
No issues with the durability, I was even able to use it without issue on my bike in a storm.
It wasn't even ripped after use.
I store it in a vacuum bag so I can carry it around compactly.
This product is much better than I expected for the price.
I was able to install it without issue.
I installed a CLA 180 Shooting Brake in a 2016 model.
If you read the manual or check YouTube for the installation method, then even an amateur can do it.
One thing to be careful of is if you loosen the hex screw too much, it will fall inside the car.
I dropped one and it went missing.
Another thing is, if you use needle-nose pliers when inserting the gray connector between the brown and the red green wiring, then the force will be uneven and the plastic will snap, as shown in photo, and then you will no longer be able to install it.
The company offers fantastic customer support, as when I called support I received a new cable in the post the next day.
When I tried installing it again, I used wide, flat pliers like the ones shown in the photo in the instruction manual, and it worked as I was able to connect it in one go.
Finally, when returning the main unit inside the car, there's a slight knack to storing away all the wiring, but I somehow managed to do it.
After installing it, I am able to view DVDs, TV, and navigation while driving, no problem.
I think this product is really good value for money because a dealer would charge an extra 80,000 yen, and even a custom shop would charge 40,000 yen more.
Not worth the price
To be honest, I don't understand why this gets such good reviews. First off, the stuffing is polyethylene, and it's all separated inside the cushion, so there are some parts that are plump, and some parts that are empty. It seems like it's already worn out. Or rather, there isn't enough stuffing in the first place, and after trying it out I thought a product like this where the head section and the hug pillow are joined together is something that you don't know whether or not it's going to suit you unless you try it. I realized that you can't go wrong with a separate pillow and hug pillow. I bought it for 3,600 yen in a limited-time sale, but I want to return it. I regret not being more suspicious of the 5-star reviews.
Neither good nor bad
Product arrived.
I tried it out straight away.
My impression on using it is that it does pump milk properly.
However, I feel it's a bit noisy, and sometimes the power button doesn't respond very well.
I'm able to use it without problems, so I don't really care, but people who are concerned might be bothered about those things.
It's definitely not ultra quiet 😅 you might have to be a bit careful if you're going to be using it in the middle of the night.
I was also a bit worried whether the accompanying tube was going to fit in the bit where you attach it to the machine, but I was able to do it by stuffing it in 😂 I think it is easy to carry around with you because it is lightweight!
Requires some effort to form a lather...
I don't know if this just doesn't suit my kind of hair, or if it's something to do with the shampoo itself, but I can fairly confidently say it doesn't lather at all when using it normally.
(Other shampoos I've used in the past form a lather with no problem when using them normally) So, here is the solution that I found ↓ (1) First, get slightly less shampoo than normal, and massage it evenly through your hair.
(At this point it will not lather, to the extent that there won't even be any bubbles) (2) Rinse your hair once, then take a good amount of shampoo and apply it evenly through your hair.
(Doing this will finally make it lather normally) So basically, you wash your hair twice, lol. There's quite a small amount in the shampoo bottle, so the trick is to use as little as possible the first time... I'm pleased with the results of this shampoo overall.
I mean, it's pretty obvious that I've bought an expensive shampoo, but I also feel there's been a clear improvement to the texture of my hair.
However, to be honest, overall, I am not satisfied with it.
I've enjoyed using the facial cleansing products from the Quattro Botanico series, so it's a shame...
It's not good value for money if I have to wash my hair twice when there's not much shampoo to begin with.
Furthermore, considering that it's not a fragrance that is loved by everyone, I'm going to have to give it a rather strict two stars.
Difficult to pass judgment
There are both positives and negatives, so it is difficult to pass judgment.
This is strictly a blade cleaner and cleans the front of the blade nicely.
I think it is a good match for this kind of razor that has a high precision blade.
Positives: Cleans dirt such as sebum and soap scum off the blade as intended.
(Although only on the front side) If those dirt were the reason the blade was dull, then you can use it for longer.
Negatives: Drastically reduces the life of the smoother.
For blades that have a titanium or ceramic coating, etc., it causes the coating to peel off easily.
(Most of the coating peels off after you use the razor 2-3 times, so I think it is better to use this cleaner after that.
You need to be careful with razors that say not to wipe the edge of the blade.
) I've heard that you can use the anti-fall rubber pads that you put under furniture to protect it in an earthquake as a substitute, so I'm not sure that this is good value for money.
*I find that my razors are lasting 20-30% longer as a result of using it.
It's difficult to judge when to throw away a razor blade, but I think it is when the blade has become damaged by shaving and the edge of the blade is all rough.
For that reason, I think it is a good product because it prevents the blade from becoming blunt due to dirt.
(Thi is only a cleaner at the end of the day, and it does not have any sharpening ability. Sometimes the blade does feel as if it's been sharpened, but I think it just feels like that because small amounts of rust have been removed.)
I was tempted by a TV commercial...
I saw on a TV commercial how a fairly elderly lady's face had firmed up after just one application, and ended up buying some for myself.
On actually trying it, I find that the texture is a little harder than a regular gel, and I cleanse with a pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it feels sticky and unpleasant, but while applying it with a massaging motion, it does start to become absorbed by my skin.
After it is absorbed it no longer feels sticky, and it feels like my skin bonds to my hands.
As expected, the lifting effect was not like I saw on TV.
The firming effect was immediate.
I think this alone is not enough for me because I have really dry skin, so lately I've been using a certain Moisture Surge 72 before using it.
My skin feels nice and moisturized.
I was hoping this product would also work on large pores, but it does not.
After using a bottle to see its effects, I might repeat the purchase.
It must have been hard work collecting it all together, but...
A considerable effort that looks back on what politicians have said over the years.
Reading through it, you come to realize what was meant when a politician said a particular thing.
However, when reviewing this as a book, it's questionable whether what the authors call "fact checking" is enough.
To be honest, it's not an interesting read.
I've thought about it a lot, and I think the major flaw of this book is in its methodology.
Ultimately, no one knows if the things that this book calls "facts" will remain facts forever.
From the way they've written it, I'm suspicious as to whether the authors were aware of the weakness (or perhaps I should say falsifiability) of their "fact checking".
The future looks a little bleak if this is the level of today's Japanese journalists' understanding of "facts."
It seems many people are recommending this book, and I guess it may be suitable for people who want to learn a little about the events covered in its pages.
However, I don't think this book is suitable for anyone like me who is interested in the "fact checking" carried out by today's Japanese mass media.
For people whose marks don't improve in mock exams.
At my school, since political economy was taught using printouts, the learning felt forced and the lessons were really boring, so I came to hate political economy.
To be honest, I was saved by this reference book.
I'm currently in the third year of high school, and will be taking the National Center Test for University Admissions this year.
Since buying this book in March, I have been using it as my study partner during the hour to and from school.
To sum up my impressions of this book, it is very easy to understand.
It's attained perfection.
After one readthrough, I attempted a past paper, and got a 70, whereas my past average was 40.
I was surprised at the result.
My result had improved to the point that I wondered whether I had ingested something suspicious.
I realized that what this reference book gave me was not only knowledge on political economy, but I also felt that my own strengths and motivation for studying were increasingly synergistic.
I'm really glad I came across this book.
Crime prevention
Having experienced someone trying to pick the lock on my front door twice eight years ago, I decided to take security measures.
This camera is a replacement for the one I bought eight years ago.
Previously, I used one that had infrared illumination up to 30m (from a different company).
As somebody else has written, the camera can do nighttime facial recognition at a distance of about 5m.
I agree with that.
It's only just arrived and so I haven't finished setting it up, but I have checked and compared the camera image and checked for any defects.
The image quality is much better than the camera I bought eight years ago (I suppose that's obvious).
I had four split screen images displayed on a 32" monitor, but it's fine as long as you set the image to the maximum size.
So far, the product seems to have no issues either.
Aside from crime prevention, if the range in which it can perform facial recognition is one of the things you are considering, then you may be disappointed especially with night-time capture, but it really is top quality for the price!
I use it for security, and I'm not interested in facial recognition.
That's because, if someone wears a mask or other face covering, you won't be able to tell who they are (especially at night).
Professional intruders (burglars) know about security cameras.
Apparently, they're able to detect high-performance cameras and recording equipment even if they are small.
On the other hand, it is petty criminals for whom cameras present a problem.
Having said so, recent burglars are skillful and daring, so you can't rely on a camera alone, and I recommend using one together with other security equipment.
For instance, you can pick up a white solar LED garden light for about 1,500 yen at a DIY store (the latest ones are very bright. I have 6 LEDs mounted).
They don't require electricity because they are solar, but in the winter months, they don't stay lit until the morning, so I have also mounted three 100V LED motion detector lights.
With this combination I've ensured that the distance people can be recognised up until is 30m.
Furthermore, if you think that small cameras are less of a deterrent during the day, then there are some things you can do to compensate.
I have put up a sticker that says "Security camera in operation 24 hours".
It came with the security camera that I previously used.
The ones from the manufacturer are more effective than what you can buy in a DIY store.
As for location, you should place the sticker at an entryway that a burglar might use that is not covered by the camera.
For that reason, I wish there was a sticker included with this camera.
Another negative is that the instructions for the internet settings were unclear.
If I encounter any issues after installing and setting up the camera, I will add them here.
While reading, I empathized to the point it was painful
Having been born in Japan in 1982, I feel the social situation is somewhat better than that of the protagonist, but even though the equal employment act has been implemented, the reality is that equality is still a long way off.
As I continued to read, the painful memories of surviving as a working adult amidst discrimination came back to me, and I got choked up.
This book depicts the suffering borne by all women, not just in Korea and Japan, but feudalistic societies as well, of just trying to live their lives as people, and not specifically as women.
Rather it is time for women at least to cease their emotional conflicts and stand united in opposition of this society.
A drama that makes you think "men are the worst"
This is the story of someone who was sexually abused by their own father as a child.
Needless to say, they carry that trauma with them even as an adult.
All the men who appear in the show are simply the worst.
In a certain sense, the protagonist's husband, who seems gentle and devoted to his family, is the worst.
Spoilers ahead ↓  Even though he knows that the protagonist's younger sister is a victim of domestic violence at the hands of her husband, he ignores it, then, when she finally plucks up the courage to go to the police, the protagonist's husband, who is a policeman, lets it slide, and the plot development just makes you really frustrated about men.
The protagonist's mother, who is pretending to be senile, knows her daughter killed her husband (the protagonist's biological father), but the daughter doesn't know she knows (the publicly stated cause of death of the father is a drug overdose).
Basically, it seems that after the death of her rapist father, the daughter was not sent to receive counseling, so it's no wonder that the protagonist would start to go a bit crazy.
And the fact that the protagonist's daughter is really curious about her dead grandfather?
Does anybody care about a dead old man at that age?
Too many ? in this drama.
A few years ago, there was a news report that France was hit by a summer heat wave and many elderly people died, but when hospitals and other facilities contacted their children, many of them said that they couldn't come to collect the body because they were on holiday, and the morgues in Paris filled up.
These people are unemotional.
On watching the husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that they too were unemotional.
French productions are completely different from shows from America and other countries, and there are many shows that leave pleasant lingering feelings due to their ambiguous nature, but in this particular show, there was a relatively large number of scenes that I thought should maybe have been cut, and I watched those on fast forward.
Boundary Lines of Professionalism
If a completely unforeseen accident that affects someone's life occurs despite having made meticulous calculations, maybe it is worth risking her own life to some extent even with those initial calculations.
The script brilliantly portrayed the subtle emotional turmoil of a person struggling with her own conflict in private, and the extent to which she is willing to deceive the people close to her in order to stick to her convictions.
Moreover...Jessica's performance was simply amazing.
Her performance is great whatever she appears in.
She truly does a professional job.
Tried it. Then it Broke
I have used three of these so far, and they break so quickly, for whatever that's worth.
The reason I chose this product in the first place was because the first one had a built-in 2200mA vaporiser, but the battery ran out after using it for 3 5-minute sessions at 200°.
The second one had a defective USB port.
It wouldn't charge.
This product was supposed to solve all the problems I had previously encountered, but, after reinserting the battery about 15 times (to prevent the USB port from breaking, this time I used the battery with the charger) the connection seemed to deteriorate, making it difficult to turn on.
The power comes on when the lid is held down.
I believe IQOS users can attest to having similar experiences.
It's that condition.
As it says in the instructions, I don't use any batteries other than the one supplied with it.
The contacts and catch appear to have been machined, so I don't think they could have bent.
That's why I returned this after about 10 days.
I bought one without a Starry logo while I returned this, and will compare the two below.
The size and appearance are the same.
The chamber and drawer are the same.
The LCD display is clearer on this one.
It might be newer than the one without a logo.
This one has a more subdued vibration.
It's about the same as a smartphone's vibrations.
The one without a logo is more like a loud sound than vibrations.
It's like a cheap Chinese smartphone.
Although this product is also Chinese...
The accessories differ slightly.
This one features a case for the liquid.
The one without a logo has a lump of something like steel wool.
Those are the main differences, roughly speaking.
I think the Starry one might have been better, but I've lost faith in them because they break so easily.
I wanted to exchange it, but I was only given the option to return so I went ahead with the return procedure even though it was a pain.
They're just ear straps, but not any old ear straps
These flat elastic straps really don't hurt at all.
This is the best mask of this kind I've ever used in terms of how good it feels around the ears.
Even flat elastic straps can be prone to twisting, and then the twisted edge can rub against the base of the ear and end up hurting more than rounded elastic, but with this product, not only is it soft, I think the straps are made just the right length to make them difficult to twist.
The mask also has a good three-dimensional fit, as it not only fits well, but the part between the nose wire and the bottom edge under the chin = The front of the mouth has just the right amount of space so it's not difficult to breathe.
That may be down to the fact that it fits my own particular facial dimensions.
I don't know if they would fit everybody the same way, but if you've ever thought that other small sized ones are not up to par, then I would recommend trying these.
When you open the outer box, there is plastic inside with a slit in the middle like a tissue box, and when I tried to take the first one out, both ear straps got caught, making it difficult to remove, so I am knocking one star off for that.
1-star service by the vendor
Absolutely no complaints about the price or flavor, but I am dissatisfied with the vendor for ignoring the date I specified for delivery.
I bought some drinks in bulk at the same time.
I usually purchase from Amazon, so I know the courier.
I wanted to coordinate the arrival date, especially since they always carry the heavy items up to me, but it was messed up.
I know Amazon makes it difficult for delivery companies, so I always think about what I can do to help out as a user.
I'm disappointed with the arrogant conduct of this seller.
However, it was cheap.
Consider the price of disposal if thinking of buying
I have so many complaints that I don't think I'll be using this for long.
I think it's a good idea to consider the cost of disposal.
For reference, some municipalities operate centers that will take it off you for free if you bring it in yourself, or take away bulk rubbish for a low price.
[Comfort] The seat tilts slightly to the left and wobbles, so it's very tiring to sit on it.
It creaks loudly if you move even a little bit.
I can't use it at night because it's too noisy.
That's my biggest concern and I don't think I can continue to use it.
[Assembly] Assembly instructions are only provided as crude drawings.
Information pertinent to assembling it is missing, and there are a lot of mistakes.
・There's no explanation as to the orientation when attaching the seat to the supporting base. One review mentioned that the seat tilts forward, but perhaps they got the orientation wrong when attaching the seat to the base.
When properly attached, the height adjustment lever is on the right hand side facing backwards, and the knob for adjusting the tension of the back spring is in front.
However, because it is more natural to have the height adjustment lever facing forwards, it's likely that many people put it on the wrong way round.
There are no such basic precautions included in the instruction manual, and assembly is basically a process of trial and error while you stare at some crude drawings.
・ There's an error in the description of the contents. There's an error in the list of contents at the start of the instruction manual.
It lists 12 8ｘ20mm screws, which are nowhere to be found, and it seems lots of people who purchase it spend time looking for them.
The 8ｘ20mm screws are already screwed into the chair, so don't waste time looking for them.
The precision of the manufacturing is poor because even with the same size screws and holes, there are some combinations that fit together and some combinations that don't.
With some combinations, it is very difficult simply trying to insert the screw into the hole.
Perhaps that is why it is shipped with the screws already inserted like this.
Furthermore, there were no spare screws to be found that were mentioned in the manual.
[Others] The black part on the surface of the vinyl leather is blotchy, with white in places, so it's best not to expect anything as beautiful as in the product photos.
An email explaining that the instruction manual is incomplete and additional instructions on attaching the seat were sent to my email address that is registered with Amazon 2-3 days after the product arrived.
That information should really be sent at the same time the product is shipped.
I think most people who buy this will have completed the assembly within 2-3 days of it arriving, so sending that information out is completely pointless.
Hmm...
I'm a massive fan of Thermos and I've been using your bottle with straw line-up for over 15 years, but this model has to be the least user-friendly I've ever used.
Firstly, the tip of the straw is made of a harder material than before and its bottom is designed to click into the bottle but once attached, it won't detach from the bottle at all!
So much so that I broke a nail when I tried to pry it off!
Secondly, the tip of the straw, where the lips come into contact is narrower than prior models and I can no longer get the straw brush inside it.
Thirdly, the mysterious part on the end of the straw that's called the "valve" is thicker than the straw brush, making it dramatically more difficult to clean.
I'm a little shocked, considering that I didn't have a single complaint about using your bottle with straw line-up until now.
Not being able to detach the spout from the bottle is really frustrating.
The good point is its usual exceptional ability to keep the drink cool.
To the point that half of the ice is still there when you forget it in your bag and bring it out to clean the next day.
I don't drink hot beverages so I'll continue to be a straw type advocate.
Please make the necessary improvements for the next model.
First-time review (with a photo attached)
This will be my first review post.
(This is the thoughts of someone who is purchasing a doll for the first time and doesn't have the basic knowledge of even attaching a doll eye) I received the product just as in the attached photo.
Attaching eyes to an Obitsu doll, I'm very pleased with how they catch the light and how cute they look.
However, attaching the eyes (into the attachment holes) was quite hard as I had to use quite a lot of force.
I don't think I did it in the intended way, I forced them in by placing a tweezer into the doll's eyeholes.
Regarding the delivery, it was my first overseas order, so I expected it would take around 3 weeks, but it arrived earlier than expected (probably because I'm located near Narita Airport), taking only 8 days.
However, I didn't receive any shipping confirmation email leaving me anxious.
I checked the Amazon shipping status, which still says the product is still in transit.
There was no damage or air exposure to the eyes, as they were carefully protected and packed in a small airtight bag with bubble wrapped envelope.
However, I noticed that my phone number was printed on the envelope, which raised my concerns about the safety of my personal information,  considering that it was shipped from overseas.
This question prompts me to deduct one point from your rating.
I have no issues with the product itself and would say it offers great value considering the quantity you receive for the price.
Edit: 8mm doll eyes, iPhone SE
A little small (workspace is tight), terrible electrostatic issues
I checked the dimensions before ordering, but it felt like it was 2 sizes smaller than what I had imagined.
It's larger than A4, but the outer part has a groove for storing parts, so the actually space for working is smaller than A4 size.
I intended to use it to repair electronic devices and Gundam plastic figurines, but I would require at least the equivalent size of B4 to do that.
Maybe it'll be okay if I only use it for soldering and assemble and disassemble on a separate tray or mat.
Placing the tools and parts on it and doing work on top of that...isn't plausible.
I thought about ordering another one to double the workspace, but it builds up too much static while I'm working, and all the dust and cut parts get sucked onto it, so I think it'll be too challenging to continue using it.
A defective product with no redeeming qualities
I fought tooth and nail to open the battery cover as it just wouldn't open, and finally I managed to open it by using a non-slip rubber sheet and insert the batteries, but it wouldn't close no matter what I tried.
At this point, it's no good.
People who left a high rating!
Does your battery cover close???
Also, if I may add, instead of a protective film, it had a squishy piece of plastic wrap stuck to it.
Is this secondhand by any chance???
When it came to the instruction manual, there was a small piece of paper filled with nothing but English instructions.
It doesn't even have any diagrams and I have no idea how to operate this item.
Might be good for another finger...
I found a great product!
I thought to myself and bought it immediately.
I'll be wearing it as a pinky ring, but the size won't fit unless I wear multiple rings, which would create a bulky look, which is...too much.
But I think it'll be okay as long as I wear it on another finger.
I still think the product had a good concept.
Considering the price,
I shouldn't have expected quality from this sort of product.
One of the flower markings was squashed.
Judging from trying it on, the size seemed like a good fit.
Although, it may be a little difficult for anyone who has thick earlobes.
Rather, maybe I should've bought a plain one.
Awesome
The design's good but it's too big when I put it on my hand, would it be less effective if I put it on my foot?
In the bitter cold of eastern Hokkaido...
As other reviews have pointed out, the heating wires only have a dimension of 110 by 80 and they're not laid out vertically but horizontally.
I purchased this blanket despite being more expensive than the one you lay out on the bedding, thinking that I would be better off heating the entire futon, I guess it can't be helped since I can't physically check it in a store like those made by a famous manufacturer.
I guess I'll have to use it with a hot water bottle and **tori's N Warm.
On a side note, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
It's well-made but
It's compact and the wind power is satisfactory.
The battery can be replaced with a spare.
When adjusting it's angle on a desk, it seems to work well if you do as in the photo.
It gets blown away by its own wind if the desk is smooth, but there's no problem if you place down a handkerchief.
As for the noise, you may not hear it even on "medium" setting if you're using it when you're out or in a family restaurant, but if you use it in an office, even the "low" setting is too loud.
You need to consider it as something you can only use when you go out.
Also, if you use it in an office, even the "low" setting is too strong and it may make you feel cold.
It's ideal for scenarios such as cooling down with the "high" setting as you take refuge in a family restaurant while escaping the sweat-inducing heat.
However, occasionally, the power may accidentally turn on when you toss it into your bag and it continues to fan the inside of your bag without you realizing it.
It would be nice if some provisions were taken, such as indenting the switch or requiring a hold-down press of the switch to turn on, particularly for the "low" setting.
Because it is an essential item recently, when we experience life-threatening sweltering heat, it would be great if they made some improvements.
Multi-function light speaker
I've set it on the faintest warm color and placed it in my bedroom.
It's better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
You can adjust the brightness and color of the light through a touch-sensitive sensor.
The white color goes well with any room, and the colored lights are beautiful as they change gradually.
Also, you can select your favorite color with a single touch, which allows you to enjoy the illumination according to your mood!
It uses an LED light, so you can expect a long lifespan.
Regarding audio quality, it's more than satisfactory, coming from a person like me who has an untrained ear.
Moreover, the amazing thing about this light is its incredible range of functions.
・There's a large speaker attached to the upper part.
You can connect to it on your cellphone via Bluetooth, enabling you to enjoy wireless music.
・Pairing it to your cellphone allows you to make hands-free calls.
・Also, it's compatible with MicroSD cards, so you can connect it to your PC to enjoy it as an mp3 player.
Music programming and piano practice
I started trying (digital) music programming at the age of 66 to prevent dementia.
I purchased a computer and an audio interface.
At first, I tried music programming, but I got hooked on playing the piano and I've been practicing day and night every day.
I tried downloading the provided sound sources but the copy protection didn't work properly, I initially downloaded an ASIO driver, but the free piano sound source sounded so good that now I use it for piano practice.
I'm glad that I bought it.
I feel like I've been deceived by its appearance.
The product can be a hit and miss?
This is going to be a long review.
The synthetic leather of the Doshisha office chair (with flip-up armrests) that I used for 4 or 5 years was deteriorated and worn out, so I considered purchasing an office chair made of non-synthetic leather with flip-up armrests.
I browsed some home depots and furniture stores but couldn't find anything appropriate.
Despite being a little worried of not being able to see the actual thing, I made a compromise and purchased this product on Amazon due to its design and price.
The product's packaging was surprisingly light and compact.
There's a spare screw.
【Caution】The hex wrench and screw that came with the product was sticky with oil.
At first, I didn't realize there was oil on the hex wrench, so I panicked when I got some oil on the white product.
Completed assembling in 40 minutes.
Checked the product after completion.
The stiffness of the flip-up armrests differs between the left and right sides when raising and lowering; the left one feels stiffer than the one on the right, the armrests aren't very comfortable to use (there's no way of adjusting them).
The angle adjustment of adjustable headrest doesn't stay in position and it quickly sags down with a "click".
The seat, with non-recycled high-density urethane foam, feels firm and isn't very comfortable when sitting (maybe because of insufficient elasticity?)
The competitive-use mesh on the backrest is rough compared to other companies' mesh chairs, and hurts your back if you're not wearing thick layers of clothing.
I know I'm nitpicking, but the height from the seat to the floor wasn't 550 but 530 (the seat height is important for those who are tall) and the leg parts that support the casters aren't made of steel, which raises some concerns about their durability.
I've been using the chair with a cushion that I bought separately, and I also placed a towel on the mesh part as it's likely to deteriorate (get damaged) fairly quickly.
As a person who is 186cm tall and weighs 80kg, I found it supports my back well, but other than that, I don't think this product is very satisfactory, I also felt this is a hit and miss product.
As I suspected, maybe it's better to see office chairs in person before purchasing.
The manufacturer sent me an email through Amazon system after I purchased it, so should I make an inquiry about the armrests and headrest?
I'm considering it.
Yeah, I guess this is as expected.
I thought we could watch BS in 4K using right-handed circularly polarized wave at my home, so I purchased a less-expensive Pixelar 4K tuner with not much expectation.
I experimented with it and was able to watch free-for-view RHCP wave broadcasts like NHK BS in 4K, and the Panasonic 4K TV that I purchased at the same time has beautiful resolution.
(The screen lags sometimes) Shortly after purchasing it I got an update, which made it compatible for recording, so I've been watching some programs I scheduled to record, but maybe it's due to the external 2.5-inch HDD, the pictures still freezes while the audio continues, and the frame skips occur.
The user interface is not very good at all, at this point, I had no choice to but to accept that "it allows me to watch 4K broadcasts".
On another note, I can only do chasing playback of a scheduled recorded program during scheduled recording, which I'd accept as an additional function that comes with the ability to record in 4K on the HDD.
If you have high expectations when purchasing this product, you may be disappointed, so don't expect too much.
I hope it will improve through updates.
The heat-retaining function is OK
I've only used the heat-retaining function so far, but after inserting two 500ml plastic bottles of water, they warmed up in about two hours and became hot in about two and a half.
I've placed it and been using it in the footwell of the passenger seat of a compact car, the sound of the fan is noticeable when idling, but it doesn't bother me while I'm driving.
I've needed to open the windows for ventilation periodically due to the chemically odor emitted from the new fan.
As someone else mentioned in another review, the burrs where you need to put the shoulder strap through has some really bad edges, so you'll need to remove them with a flat-head screwdriver or something.
It breaks really easily
It suddenly broke today, after 2 months of use.
I really liked the size of the keys and their tactile feel but there's no point if it breaks.
I use my PC day and night for my video editing work, and I found that the sound volume automatically increases to 100%.
Even when I turn it down, it goes right back to 100%.
I can't use the earphones because they hurt my ears, and the volume is too loud to use my PC at night.
It seems to be sending signals to the PC every few seconds, repeatedly turning the volume bar on and off on the display.
On top of that, it's interrupting the signal of the mouse, which prevents me from using the mouse freely unless I turn off the keyboard.
The enter key and backspace key no longer respond.
I don't recommend it at all, but it may be worth buying to try out if it is in the 1000 yen level.
If you're lucky, you may be able to use it for about half a year.
This keyboard has a 6-month warranty, while other products in the same price range from different companies have warranties ranging from 1 to 3 years.
The short warranty speaks for itself.
The product is amazing, the packaging is terrible
The product is now my new favorite and I use it in various of colors.
I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for food storage containers!
However, the packaging was the worst, coming in a large cardboard box with so much space that the containers could roll around inside, and it didn't even include a delivery slip.
The lid had come off when I opened the box.
I recommend the product, but you may want to consider buying it from somewhere else.
I'm concerned about its durability, but anyway
I purchased it as I had lost confidence in the manufacturer's ability to provide customer support when I bought a replacement lid.
It serves its purpose as a sturdy lid, but it's made of flimsy plastic, so if you're not careful when opening and closing it, it makes a nasty "cracking (about to break)" sound.
You should choose something that matches the lid's thickness when making a purchase.
A cute paw print bag
I own a dog, and as I was looking for a bag for going out, I was attracted to this fashionable grey bag and decided to purchase it.
It's designed to be assembled and disassembled and surprisingly, it's lightweight enough to carry around without feeling heavy.
The zipper moves smoothly and doesn't get stuck.
It seems easy to carry even when travelling long distances.
It can be easily folded and it becomes very compact.
You can still see the paw print even when it's folded up and looks cute even when not in use.
Lightweight and comfortable!
The wheels move smoothly and is easy to use
Firstly, I fell in love with its appearance and the low price drove me to make an immediate purchase!
I've been into TSA-approved luggage locks for the past few years and I have several others as they're so useful.
As a professional at misplacing and losing keys, I recommend using combination locks.
I'm okay since my top priority lies in how light the suitcase is, but to be honest, if you're looking for durability and security this item can be cut open easily with a knife as the zipper line that wraps around the suitcase is made of cloth and it can be sliced open just like that! It'll be broken into in an instant if it gets cut.
Also, the alignment of the zipper isn't great so I would like them to work on improving the way the chains meet.
I recommend it for carry-on luggage when travelling overseas.
For now, I've used it for travelling by bullet train and it was comfortable to use.
Choosing the right size is difficult....
I have wide feet, so buying shoes is a struggle for me.
I wear Converse and Vans sneakers in size 24cm.
My MRL996s are also 24cm.
At first, I thought to myself, they're tight but it's okay once they broke in.
My elder sister said that the ML574s are too tight and they were surely tight when I tried them on.
I could feel my pinky toes touching the edges.
So I decided to purchase the 25cm ones.
It turned out they were big when I opened the box...
When I tried them on, they were a little loose even with socks.
I contemplated whether I should return them but it would be a hassle if I got the 24cm ones and they turned out to be too tight, so I'm considering wearing the 25cm ones with insoles.
I bought a pair of Team Reds, the red color is so vivid and they're great!
I often wear black-and-white clothing so wearing these shoes brighten up my overall look!
165cm, 40-year-old male
I just winged it and ordered an L, but if you are similar to the following specs I'd recommend an M.
Height: 165cm Weight: 60kg Waist: 81cm Around bellybutton: 100cm, a typical metabolic belly.
<Comfort> When in the water, the rash guard rides up, perhaps because the waist area is loose.
I fix the riding up part as I swim.
If you're careless, especially in a jacuzzi, your metabolic belly will end up in full view.
Also, walking quickly with a lot of up-and-down motion will cause the bottom part to ride up.
<Product quality> The material is strong and not too thin, so there's no need to worry about your nipples being visible.
I'm satisfied with the quality for the price, but I think it will fit better if you buy a smaller size.
It leaked gas after all...
The Silver Colt 25 was leaking gas after all, and when I was replacing the valve, I had the problem of a part of the tank being broken, but after sealing the tank with "Bath Bond Q" and greasing it up, it was able to shoot fine, if you want to buy this Colt 25, you'll need to be able to disassemble and reassemble, or ask someone who can do so for help, or you need to disassemble it while taking pictures, so I don't recommend it if you're not very confident, if you're fine with it breaking, you may have fun, I even bought another black Colt 25 and the trick to disassemble it without any parts flying off was holding the trigger with my left thumb and removing the left side, when reassembling it, I put silicon grease on the spring and small parts and held them together with it, when taking it apart, first remove the grip, unscrew the safety screw, pull out the safety, remove the two screws on the left side, remove the barrel tip without damaging it, and use pliers to pull out the front sight and inner barrel without pinching them, by doing so, you can disassemble it by slowly removing the left side with the square pattern as it is a hollow structure, however it's your own responsibility so don't blame anyone if you make any mistakes.
I wondered what kind of quality it'd be for 188 yen
It can be used for fast turning, or torque as needed
The good things are that it's lightweight, small, and above all, simple without any pretenses.
There's no rattling when the bits are installed, so I thought the cost of 188 yen was amazing value for money.
Now there's just to assess how durable it is.
You may not use it very often, but I think it's something good to keep in your toolbox.
I bought this along with the "1/4 inch hex shank magnetic quick release screwdriver knurling bit holder 60/100/150mm" from the same vendor.
No problems with this one either, or rather, it was extremely good for the price.
The controller stops working.
My character moves on its own and I can't control anything.
By reconnecting the cable, it works, but after a few minutes, the character starts moving in the wrong direction and I can't control anything.
You shouldn't buy this product.
Just a warning to you all.
It's a terrible product.
Although it's wired, I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It's reliable and hasn't yet broken even after using it for a long time.
It can also be used for PC games.
P.S. I was able to return the product within 1 month as defective and received a refund for an Amazon Gift Certificate, so I'm happy about that.
This improves calculation skills?
I think it's suitable for kids who understand calculations.
I don't think kids who don't have a certain understanding of calculations can use it.
The questions are difficult to solve.
Also, like when giving tools to the boss or other stuff, you have to slide your finger up the screen, and I tried it myself, but no matter how many times I did it, it didn't go smoothly.
In short, it might be easier to slide for people used to the DS?
I also can't bring myself to like the illustrations of the characters either, I mean, I think some people get into the DS and other games because of the interesting screen, but... for some reason, it doesn't grow on me.
The calculations are also like a race against time, for example, how many questions can be answered correctly in how many minutes.
I understand rushing them to prepare for exams and such, but... doesn't that make them rush through the math?
For some reason, I also don't like the gong that rings when it ends.
We're doing our best, so can't we have a more pleasant sound?
Paying 6,200 yen for this, I feel like I wasted my money.
I'd understand if it were half the price.
Sorry, those are the reasons why I gave it 2 stars.
Persona's music really is good!
I made it to the ending sequence of Persona 3.
I played 5 halfway through.
I have achieved all the Persona 4 trophies on the Vita.
What you can do hasn't changed from the previous entry, Persona 4.
Since there's no story, it feels shorter than the previous entry.
The music is still cool, though!
I get hyped just listening to them!
The Persona 3 characters were initially rendered in 3D, so I was moved when I saw them for the first time.
For some reason Junpei looked handsome (lol) Persona 5 looks great from the start, so it doesn't feel fresh... When I think of it that way, 3 seems like a better deal.
As a rhythm game, I found 5 easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mostly blue, so it was hard to see when the background was dark.
5 mainly has bright colors such as red and yellow, so its easy to see even if it overlaps with the background.
The wide variety of assist functions make it possible for people who are bad at rhythm games to play.
Rhythm game experts may find it more challenging when the challenge function is turned on.
The triple pack includes the soundtrack, and it's a decent 4-disc set, rather than a small bonus, so if you like Persona music, I recommend it.
Kind of a shame.
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the picture, but the actual product has a bluish tint to it, which is closer to black or charcoal gray.
And it's not oysterlock clasped.
I had thought of buying gold, but because of that I'm holding off on it for now, I guess I can give up since the price is so low?
Edit: After I posted the review, I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange the product for a new one.
The subsequent procedure was prompt.
Despite the product being inexpensive, the response was great.
4 stars for the support. Edit: I also bought gold afterward.
The colors are almost exactly as shown in the picture and I think they're gorgeous.
However, the buckle isn't an oysterlock clasp, and the difference from the photo in the description is obvious.
That's the only thing.
It gets really slow at night.
I used it with a SIM free iPhone7s.
I didn't know how to do the initial setup after I arrived in Korea and inserted a SIM card, so I asked the lady at the SK counter at Gimpo airport to show me how to do it (go to Settings > Mobile Communications > Communications Options and turn on Data Roaming) and I was able to set it up successfully.
I feel like the instructions that came with the product weren't really relevant...?
However, maybe because the signal was weak around Gimpo Airport or something, and I was only picking up 3G throughout.
When I went out into the city, I got 4G.
In the evening or at night, it loaded very slowly, but now that I think about it, I may have gone over my daily limit of a few hundred MB.
Better than I thought.
I used a SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, switched to SIM free and used it with Ymobile, then I was looking for a used Xperia phone since my Z4 was not working well, and I found this brand new phone that can use "Wallet Mobile" and bought it.
I was worried about whether it'd work properly since I was using Mobile Suica, but I didn't have any problems at all.
Due to the size, weight, and the fact I bought a silver one, I got an impression of an iPhone6 at first glance.
I don't play games, so the processing speed is the same as the Z4, but I get the impression that it's a little faster, among the reviews, some people mentioned that the fingerprint recognition is slow, and I do get the impression it takes a bit longer for it to be recognized, therefore, I use facial recognition which is faster.
I was amazed that it looks like an iPhone. I also upgraded my Android to Ver9, and I'm satisfied with my purchase.
The things that bothered me were it could be a bit smaller, and there's no hole for straps. *I use a case with strap holes, I haven't tested the water resistance of the case, It's a bit heavy, I haven't had it for long but I'm satisfied, I recommend it.
