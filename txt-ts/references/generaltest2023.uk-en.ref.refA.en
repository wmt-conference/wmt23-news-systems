The criteria for accepting children in preschool education in Kindergarten, Prague 8, in School 8 ‚Äì for the academic year 2022/2023
The applicant‚Äôs actual place of residence is decisive for the admission in preschool education, in case of foreigners ‚Äì a place of residence in appropriate MoH school district during the application for preschool education in Kindergarten, Prague 8, in School 8.
The age of the child is the other evaluation criterion.
Children are accepted gradually in accordance with the following criteria for upper limits of kindergarten.
And, if you can, pray for us, naming all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
‚Äì The letter from the occupation.
Kherson.
"Natasha, we hold on as best we can.
It is felt that they are afraid.
Extremely afraid.
They can stop anyone on the street and make them repeat several times that they are great, that they are powerful, and that we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat it, but in our heads is turning the following: how much do you afraid, b@t—Åhes, if to feel your greatness, you need someone to repeat about it.
How are you unsure of yourselves.
It‚Äôs like a sexual intercourse with an impotent, who needs you to repeat that he is strong, that he is doing well, you need to put much effort for him for a long time, while thinking: "When will this painful abuse, finally, be over."
We repeat it to save all of us.
Because it is very hard for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless body with a machine gun.
Because, when this vermin is kicked out of our city, we‚Äôll need to arrange the city.
Everyone says the same thing with whoever you talk now.
They say that there is a smell of rot in the city.
We‚Äôll, probably, need a lot of cleaning supplies to wash pavements, buildings and even trees for a long time. Because everything, these savages have touched, has the smell of rot.
Yesterday one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they are great.
Three big men stripped her and left on the street, forbidding anybody to approach her to help.
She stood undressed on the street for three hours, just saying loudly:
‚ÄúDo not approach to me, my dears.
Do not expose yourselves to danger.
Please!
We will have a lot of work to do with you...
Later!
And one more thing.
They are stealing.
They are stealing everything.
It is even difficult for me to come up with what they don‚Äôt steal.
We have never seen robbery of such as scale.
From children‚Äôs toys to box of rot vegetables.
They are afraid because someone constantly put up leaflets in the city.
Our leaflets with Ukrainian symbolic.
We‚Äôre waiting for UAF.
And when they get close, Kherson residents will kill vermin with bare hands and their teeth.
They are feeling it.
That‚Äôs why they are in a hurry.
And we will wait.
Will wait.
We will grit our teeth, clench ours fists up to numbness of the fingers and wait.
Because there‚Äôs a reason for us to wait.
So that it be once and for all.
And none of this vermin is left.
And then we will wash the city.
For a long time.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, naming all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names..."
The author of the above is not specified for understandable reasons.
and I need communication. I completely devastated. I know that no one really wants to communicate with devastated people, but I still remain hopeful
How satisfied are you with your accommodation?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same specialty as before you've left Ukraine?
These and similar questions are asked by Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs as a part of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The findings will help to be more aware about their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
The data are collected through a questionnaire.
Everyone, who has provided functional email, when applying for humanitarian assistance, receives an invitation to participate in the research (from the following address: invitation@click4survey.cz).
Everyone can fill out the questionnaire just once!
By filing the questionnaire, you will really help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
TECHNICAN IN THE PRODUCTION
, MECHANIC IN THE PRODUCTION
We manufacture electronic microscopes and spectrometers to help scientists around the world.
Contemporary materials, powerful electronics or modern medications ‚Äì none of these wouldn't exist without devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues, who want to work in unique environment, don't afraid of technologies and want to get a stable job with prospects, to join our production team.
We offer opportunities for both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I would like to say a few words on this occasion.
I have a strong desire to gather with the residents and discuss important, troubling questions, but gatherings are prohibited, because of the war in the country.
I would be grateful for practical advices and any assist in my ambition to do as much as possible for residents.
Together we are strong.
Together we will overcome any obstacles.
Together we will win.
So get in touch.
I'll hear you all.
I'd be extremely happy and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday on 18th of May, the Czech government approved amendments to the terms of humanitarian assistance payment to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all arriving Ukrainian refugees are entitled to a first assistance payment of 5,000 crowns without any additional conditions (only a Temporary Protection visa is needed).
To receive the same amount in the subsequent five months, the applicant must prove his/her difficult financial situation ‚Äì an unemployed status, the absence of property in the Czech Republic etc.
Ministry of Labor decided to change that practice as follows:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Assistance first payment will no longer be unconditional.
If the refugee has been provided with free accommodation, daily multiple meals and hygiene supplies, he/she won't be able to claim a payment of 5,000 crowns.
Authorities will consider that basic assistance has been provided in-kind (accommodation, meals and hygiene supplies) and therefore the purpose of humanitarian assistance has been fulfilled and there is no need for paying money.
This measure is intended to solve a problem with the gypsy refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for financial assistance.
2Ô∏è‚É£ entitlement to a payment of second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth assistance will still have only those refugees, who prove direct need (unemployment etc.).
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå as stated in the first paragraph, cash assistance be able to get only those Ukrainians, who hasn't been provided with free accommodation, daily multiple meals and hygiene supplies;
üìå the applicant must physically reside in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice "tourism for sake of assistance", when the refugee lives in one country and come to the Czech Republic for a few days solely for the money.
According to the law, every alien should inform MIA of the change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address on the questionnaire for assistance payment doesn't match the address indicated in MIA database, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence on the fact of living in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the assistance payment will be denied.
Currently, the Czech Republic has spent 2,626 billion crowns on humanitarian assistance payment.
And today I was digging in defense structures throughout the day and the whole city is digging in ‚Äì predictions for the coming period don't seem to be good.
Honestly, I'm tired, it's so difficult to organize such a process
We are helping the army to dig positions and trench, and for this, someone needs to organize equipment and people, and because I'm a chief of the village, this is my duty
All utilities are involved, and also we ask for help from farmers ‚Äì they have diggers and tractors.
We need to unite, otherwise we won't defeat katsaps
There is a large propaganda to make people desperate and lower opposition
Honestly, I didn't take a shovel into my hands today and hopefully won't have to
Children put girl's stickers on my phone case, so I wouldn't forget that I'm a female
What would happen if the bill is adopted?
‚òòÔ∏è The government Commission of representatives from the Office of the President, specific ministries, and business associations, that are rapidly revising means of government regulations of economic activity.
‚òòÔ∏è The Commission and other executive bodies will revise all permits on running business in most areas until the end of the year.
And they will suggest, which of the permissions and procedures need to be removed.
‚òòÔ∏è The Cabinet of Ministers will remove all "needless" permissions and procedures in an accelerated mode.
Without any public comment, in behind-the-scenes mode!
‚òòÔ∏è It won't matter if decisions of the Cabinet go against local regulations.
The public and deputies will lose their ability to influence the regulation of business activities that can harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something of the Constitution of Ukraine.
‚òòÔ∏è State regulation of business will be performed according to the "one new permission ‚Äì minus two of old one" principle.
Regardless of whether it makes any sense.
How does it relate to environment?
‚òòÔ∏è The Cabinet can change any documents related to permissions or procedures in the field of environment in behind-the-scenes mode.
Protection of forest, protection of wild animals, waste management, assessment of the influence on the environment etc. will be jeopardized!
‚òòÔ∏è Neither the public nor parliamentarians won't influence the process.
We won't even know who and how changes the subordinate legislations until the making final decisions.
‚òòÔ∏è Business Associations are the only ones, who will have access to the information and the ability of the influence.
The draft law No.8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Short terms of permission revising, non-transparent procedure, absence of any decision-making criteria means movement somewhere to the east, not to the EU.
We therefore call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the request
"Grandma, Russians approached the village; Grab your cat and get inside the minibus" ‚Äì they told her.
She answered: "Why me, I'm an old woman‚Ä¶ Save kids and girls, I'll manage here somehow‚Ä¶" The old woman goes down into a cellar, moves pickles, Rolls a barrel of junk, a bunch of troughs; There's the door ‚Äì iron bolts and silver locks.
And someone rattles chains behind the door.
"I didn't think I'd be alive" ‚Äì says the old woman.
Seventy odd years have passed ‚Äì and they are coming again.
"Go, just not through the garden, otherwise I'll curse you, You'll bring the "putin kaputt" closer to us."
The old woman's cat hisses, windows glass cracks.
Tanks rumble and scurry between houses.
Russians come into the village.
From the cellar comes a dog with three heads.
Good afternoon, go to the post office and confirm your person through the "check-in", then with the confirmation you will get a code, and you have to indicate this code again in the registration on the Internet and that's all.
You must use a bank card registered to a person who wants to receive financial assistance, otherwise it's not appropriate.
I did that; my friend also received a request for some key, but when she stood on line in the government and her turn came, they asked her, why she came as she was already registered.
This application also requested some key from her, but actually the registration is carried out without it
please help me too, the application was submitted online on May 5, but I cannot understand, whether I should go to the Labor Government or should wait
it is written that I will receive money on the card after my application is processed, but it says that the identity is not confirmed, the banking system shows an error
Good afternoon, ms. Angelina!
I want to share my perspective on using "–≤" / "–Ω–∞" with the word "–£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∞".
The use of this term has turned into a serious political issue in recent decades.
The current war of Russia against Ukraine was preparing for a long time and deliberately, including through the information and linguistic policy
Thank you for interesting exercises and tasks, for a clear grammar explanation, pleasant conversations.
Particularly we're grateful for meeting technical needs of the learning process, firstly, for the textbook that allowed us to understand things which sometimes were hard to follow at the lectures.
These three months laid down the foundation of our knowledge.
Hopefully, our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish creative inspiration, peace and happiness to the entire creative team!
In his performances, he popularizes world classics in Ukrainian, among which "Lolita" (V. Nabokov), "Perfume" (P. Suskind), "Sin" (M. Kotsiubynsky), "Letter from a Stranger" and "Wild" (S. Zweig) etc.
Writings that he stages are difficult to perceive, they require putting soul and heart in them.
The author intentionally evokes deep feelings and tears in the audience.
He believes, tears are purification, this is a path to healing for the modern person.
He won a number of awards.
In 2005, he earned the title "National Artist of Ukraine", Winner of the National Prize of Ukraine named after Taras Shevchenko (2007), but more than anything Mr. Mykhailo appreciates love and attention of the audience, and they reciprocate.
Connoisseurs of Mr. Mykhailo's talent hope that at the war's conclusion they will hear him playing the saxophone, see his unsurpassed ability to impersonate and be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art
Minerals of Ukraine
By origin, minerals are divided into magmatic, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Therefore, their location is intimately related to the structure of the Earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
Fuel minerals, mining in our state include: hard and brown coals, crude, natural gas, peat, oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel minerals.
The state fully meets the own needs in hard and brown coal.
In the meantime, Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of crude and natural gas.
Practice has shown, that an acute shortage in anything may arise until we had a rational economy created in our country.
Peat in Ukraine long ago was mined in Polissia.
Since the mid-1990s it was used as a fuel only for local needs in the countryside, in the household, at factories in food, glass, porcelain and faience industry.
Various chemical substances are also obtained from peat, for example acetone, phenols, paraffin, forage, yeast.
Significant deposits of oil shale are in Cherkasy and Kirovograd regions.
Geography of the fuel minerals location is related to tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel minerals are of sedimentary origin and therefore are included in covers of an ancient and young platforms, as well as in edge foothill troughs.
Hard coals.
94.3% of coal deposits of our state are hard coals.
Ukrainian hard coals are of high quality.
Due to the high content of carbon, it has high calorific capacity.
Ukraine has deposits of the best grade of coal ‚Äì anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of coal is coking.
After special treatment, it is used in the smelting of cast-iron and steel.
In proven reserves of coal, Ukraine ranks VIII worldwide and I in Europe, and in mining, respectively, XI and III.
Proven coal reserves in Ukraine are about 50 billion tons.
Estimated reserves are about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write "messages" on the missiles they drop on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
For example, Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian band, from the Eurovision stage called on to save the troops, blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol ‚Äì and the very next day the Russians wrote on the missiles "Kalush, as you requested! #to Azovstal".
The missiles, fired at the railway station in Kramatorsk by the Russian military on April 8, 2022, were written the words "For children".
Then, 61 people died from missiles with the cynical words, and 7 children among them.
The tradition of writing on missiles was established during the First World War.
During the Second World, Soviet troops also wrote such messages to their enemies.
And it helped the soldiers to keep morale up while they were protecting their land.
Today, writing put on missiles by Russian troops is a cynical and ferocious gesture of the aggressor army.
These missiles are killing civilians and destroying peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they don't like political direction of Ukraine.
Russia must be stopped, so such "messages" don't land to any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© checkpoint met us with a relatively short queue and welcoming Slovak border guards.
"We're bringing insulin, which requires a temperature regime ‚Äì it shouldn't heat up.
Would it be possible to pass the control in accelerated mode?"
The border guard allowed us to the front of the line, even trucks graciously gave us a way.
Lviv
The city of Lion is alive.
It is like aorta in Ukrainian body ‚Äì there is a constant flow of people.
People from all over the country have found refuge and sense of safety here.
Someone moves on to Europe, someone returns home, someone stays here.
At the first glance, the war immediately visible on roadblocks around the city.
The war is reflected in boarded up with plywood cathedral windows.
It covers monuments and sculptures with white canvases.
Yet, the war is not heard on Market Square, where thousands of voices sound at once, it is not heard in cafes and bars, where people go on to live.
Yes, life subsides earlier ‚Äì at 11 pm, life hides from curfew.
But it does exist: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 pm and the alarm was announced, we heard it only because of the warning from someone's phone.
The warning sirens on the street was drowned out by people's voices, who live their life.
Bucha, Irpin
Way to Kyiv we have paved through two of numerous martyred cities ‚Äì through Bucha and Irpin.
The city-heroes, where you can smell hope in the air.
People return and rebuild life through the pain.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Shells fragments or submachine gun bursts?..)
On the broken balcony, the flag of Ukraine is hanging.
At the front door, there are such holes, so that the living room gradually turns into a street.
And at that front door, three persons are working.
They are cleaning, repairing, building the wall and a new life with it.
And in the park two blocks down the street, a mother walks with her child.
I can't help but ask myself: "Did their dad survive the execution of males in Bucha?
Will he take a walk with them again?"
There is a cemetery of cars on the outskirts of Irpin.
These are the cars, by which civilians tried to leave and were mercilessly shot by Russian invaders.
This cemetery already become an object of peculiar "patriotic tourism".
If you go further and stand surrounded by car skeletons, you will feel heavy smell.
That is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slowdown air, seems like it can be cut with a knife.
And this is after weeks since passengers died‚Ä¶
If you look through holes in car bodies, you will see hundreds more of the same shots.
There is an abandoned bicycle in one car and a warm baby jumpsuit in another.
There is an unburned booklet with the instructions on using the airbag there.
Remains of someone's ordinary histories and someone's lives.
We ride further, I turn back to take one last look at the city and my gaze falls upon a that bridge under which frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is that overturned bus and down these broken-up plates, a Ukrainian soldier was carrying the child in white.
This child in white a jumpsuit, probably, survived.
But is there any chance that the child, who used to wear clothes left in one of the cars, is still alive?
A man with the camera over his shoulder sits on the dilapidated bridge.
He just sits and stares on the gulf between Kyiv and Bucha.
He doesn't take photos, just stares.
Maybe, he also imagines himself standing under the bridge and wonders: how is it?
"Congratulations!" ‚Äì the man joyfully exclaims at us. ‚Äì "Happy City Day!"
On May 29, war Kyiv celebrated 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Powerful and Independent.
Mykolaiv
Hero-city, the stronghold of Ukrainian South and my hometown.
The frontline city, which the invaders still cannot occupy.
And we believe they won't occupy ‚Äì the city is fighting and living.
Tires and Bandera smoothies are neatly stacked together at the corner of the streets and on every other crossroad.
Nowadays, the evening Mykolaiv is incredibly quiet ‚Äì the noise which was a background for the city is subsided.
There are neither voices nor cars in evenings.
And nights are really dark.
Blacking-out is for the sake of security.
People live "by candlelight" more precisely by flashlight mobile phones.
At home, we switch light only on the kitchen ‚Äì quickly and if necessary.
Grandma draped the windows with heavy blankets, through which the light didn't break.
There is a hunting rifle near the child's bed of my sister.
"It is on hand since 24th," ‚Äì says father.
When hearing the air alarm or the sound of explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But now not every time.
Living even in frontline city in constant alerts regime is very hard.
When will you live then?
The Russian army is in 30 kilometers from the city, the shots from "peonies" reach Zhovtnevy District and hit Kulbakyne.
Several times shots arrived close to my relatives.
To the neighborhood, across the road from us.
To the grandma's neighbors ‚Äì windows in grandma's house were shot out, her children took her to their own house in a more safe district.
And we live on the border of Ingul and Central Districts.
Life goes on.
The siren is wailing on the central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple is sitting on the bench, they're chatting about something, calmly discussing.
The bicyclist is passing by.
My father and I are looking at each other ‚Äì what shall we do?
"Well‚Ä¶ Let's have a coffee?"
So we're sitting on Cathedral Street (former Soviet Street, by the way) in the public garden near St. Nicholas memorial.
What else should we do?
Frankly, when a siren catch you off guard on the street, there is often no place to hide, there are no open air-raid shelters or basements nearby.
I'm looking at the building of the regional state administration, or rather through it.
That hole isn't just a hole in the building, this is a hole in the heart of each Mykolaiv residents.
A huge trident lies on the lawn by the entrance ‚Äì once it decorated the RSA.
Now, here is empty "nothing" left on the trident's place.
As well as on the place of the RSA chief executive's office and dozens of offices around.
The missile landed accurately on the Kim's desk.
The war gets absolutely different shapes when it is not in the news but just under your feet.
I'm walking down the RSA halls and with every my step, the glass crunching is heard.
The numerous documents are scattered on the floor ‚Äì someone submitted requests and applications, and now it doesn't matter.
There is a dusty cosmetic bag on the desk in one of the surviving offices.
There is a flower on the drawer.
We took it home and transplanted ‚Äì may at least it live.
We met the guard who was at his post on March 29.
He survived.
"It is patched up, stitched up, ‚Äì he points on the head. ‚Äì Already at work."
Only reporters can get into the RSA.
We have two reporters from Italy and BBC with us.
Photo, live broadcasts, interview.
According to official information, there were 36 dead.
This is "September 11 in Mykolaiv", "a memorial for Russian world", comments the press attache of the Regional Head.
Mykolaiv Regional State Administration is only one of the wounds on the Mykolaiv body.
And these wounds won't be healed soon.
Even when Denmark helps to restore the RSA, Mykolaiv residents will always see a horrible emptiness in it.
Russia began a new "gas war".
But this time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Starting from the military actions, Russian Federation reduced gas transit to EU via the Ukrainian gas transportation system more than by one-third.
In April, they completely stopped gas supply to Bulgaria and Ireland and in May to Finland.
In June, Russians significantly reduced gas supply via Nord Stream pipeline to European countries.
The official Berlin expects Russia to cut off natural gas supply via this way already in July.
Such blackmail was used by Russia in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine ultimately had chosen the European path of development, Russian Federation shut off gas supply to Ukrainians for two days.
Gas always was not just a commodity for Russia but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in building healthy economic ties.
Its primary desire is to recreate the Soviet Union and punish the West.
Financing of the Russian Federation economy is donation for World War III.
The coming winter will be severe, but will allow Europe to become independent of Russia's gas.
European countries already accelerate the transition to alternative energy sources and try to diversify gas and oil supplies quickly.
But to become energy independent of Russia's energy, EU needs time.
Meanwhile, Putin's regime intimidate Europe with inevitable energy crisis and lack of heating in houses.
European countries, especially those which dependent on Russia for fuel supplies, can feel its deficiency.
However, this crisis will encourage economic attitude to natural resources and increase power efficiency.
Europe will win, if it abandons the Russia's energy.
Because then Putin won't be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
Temporary discomfort should be overcome so that future generations of Europeans don't have to die in the new war against Russia.
Russia burns harvest on the Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary shells that destroy grain and oil crops.
With that, Russia causes widespread hunger.
Because of Russian war, the number of people that suffer who food shortage around the world can rise to more than 40 million.
While destroying Ukrainians harvests, Russians also steal already harvested grain from Ukrainians elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, block maritime exports.
The destruction of Ukraine's agricultural potential is another manifestation of Russia's military aggression.
So, Russia wants to further weaken Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on global one.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it won't be able to continue killing people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital Transformation launches an innovative format of hotline ‚Äì the Diia.Business virtual center.
Forced migrants from Ukraine often face the lack of information on rules and procedures for arranging the own staying, business registration, employment and getting assistance in European countries.
Therefore, the Diia.Business virtual center is launched in order to provide all necessary answers in a remote format until Ukrainians can come back home.
It's scary, that you have to be afraid of every important day, and you never know a day or a moment that may come
Good day, Anna, may I ask you to call the pediatrician and ask when is the next time we can come to get Darusya vaccinated.
We were expected to come tomorrow, but I can't because we have to replace the car battery, and we will receive it at the end of the week.
The neighbor brought cable, and we have charged our car from Maryna's car.
But the car's panel says we need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery, and Anastasia has to bring it to Ukraine on Wednesday, and then it will be replaced here
Tomorrow, I will try to start the car, if it runs, we will go by ourselves, I will leave grandma in the car and won't turn off the motor.
If it doesn't run, then I will write you, and you will come to pick us
I don't feel comfortable disturbing and distracting you from work.
All right, we will go with you at 11:45 a.m., so as not to risk.
"The war is not over yet, and the fates of our new neighbors also become our reality.
We hear stories about escape to a secure location, stories of mothers who tells their children about a long adventurous journey they are embarking together to put them into hastily loaded cars.
The stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of every adult, who still don't quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
The stories of children for whom the only recollection is a toy they were able to grasp to during many hours, spent in crowded trains surrounded by strange sad people, ‚Äì emphasize the organizers.
At the end of every trip there is a returning to a safe home.
But this trip is different, it's more frightening.
This trip didn't end even in about eight months.
Going back home is expected.
The theme of the war is omnipresent, therefore our procession may seem unnecessary.
On the contrary, in the conditions of growing antipathies and animosities, which are heated up and operated by the populists, we want noted that spontaneous travelers are still among us.
We want to give them opportunity to tell their story in poetic form and therefore to apply for participation in this feast of Czech civil society.
Presently, they are the part of it."
Regardless of the that painful theme, we still managed to make the parade light and encouraging.
It was made with help of masters who together with children and adults created costumes and masks, huge toys, sunflowers, motankas, houses and amazing shining birds.
The parade went from Kampa to Vaclavak and at each stop a great performance was played, the dramaturgy of which was made by Oksana Maslova, the Ukrainian playwright writer.
"It was important for me to keep the light idea of the parade and, at the same time, to demonstrate things which Ukrainians face now, ‚Äì says the playwright. ‚Äì Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects the normal life which is interrupted by air attack.
The shining birds are the first who come to rescue ‚Äì they cover children with their wings in the first place.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of the saving wings becomes even more relevant.
Children's voices start singing Ukrainian song.
This song spreads among the column.
And all the creatures come back to life: sunflowers, motankas, toys and even houses.
Such symbolism.
I'm so grateful to the Czech Republic and each Czech who helped and is helping Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe, together we can overcome this uneasy way and there will be peace in houses."
The wife sends the husband to the market to buy snails for skin cosmetic care.
The husband meets friends along the way and gets drunk for three days, not coming back home, of course.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers the snails, goes to the market, buys snails and returns home.
He tries to come up with what to tell his wife to explain, why he was gone for such a long time.
He rings the doorbell, pours snails to the floor, the wife opens, and he says, rushing them with his hands:
‚Äì Finally, we came!
Come in, come in, come in...
Our editorial staff spoke with Maryna, Ukrainian refugee, who worked in the Field of Buildings and Structures Architecture in native Nikopol.
"Now, I try to become a painter," ‚Äì told the Ukrainian woman.
Alert, insecurity, fear, worries about relatives.
When talk to Maryna, the Ukrainian refugee, you can feel her confusion regarding adaptation to new conditions in which she finds herself and her children.
However, the woman believes in herself and tries to adjust to life in Prague while still wanting to return to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Maryna is originally from Nikopol located in Dnipropetrovsk region.
That's where she met her husband and gave birth to two children ‚Äì son and daughter.
She worked as architect in a public institution in Nikopol.
"By education, I'm an architect of buildings and structures, I finished Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Before that, I went to school of art and graduated the lyceum in the specialty of graphic designer," ‚Äì told Maryna.
And everything was fine, but on February 24 her life has changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians, who were escaping from Russia's aggression in Ukraine, Maryna left Ukraine with her children without hesitation.
Prague became a shelter for the woman.
"Of course, this is a new city for us, it is big and crowded‚Ä¶ There is a new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian therefore I understand much of what Czechs tell me.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
Besides, I'm not ashamed to ask Czechs for help and I have never felt any aggression from them.
I appreciate that," ‚Äì shared Maryna.
According to her, people who have lived in Prague for years helped her in resolving issues in regard to finding accommodation, visa and insurance processing, applying for benefits.
But still many problems she has to solve on her own.
The lack of place in kindergarten
Maryna wished to find a job after she had obtained the visa.
"Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.
But employers shrug their shoulders when finding out that I have two children‚Ä¶" ‚Äì told her.
"We were not accepted to kindergarten because there are no places.
People say, we have to look for adaptation groups for children, but where to find them nobody knows exactly.
I met one girl who speaks Czech fluently.
She wanted to help me find a place in kindergarten for children, making calls to a number of various instances, but‚Ä¶" ‚Äì continues Maryna.
"In general, I'm very concerned about my children's condition, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become moody and naughty.
I cannot say that children bother me, but if they visit kindergarten, I would be able to quietly attend Czech courses.
One day, I came to Czech class with children, they played a little and then started to misbehave.
I, like a normal mother, distracted and couldn't study properly‚Ä¶ I wish there were language courses for adults with children or someone, who would play with children during classes‚Ä¶ But my daughter is so attached to me," ‚Äì the woman sighs.
"Of course, my children and I attend different free events created especially for Ukrainian refugees, and I'm grateful to the Czech Republic for them," ‚Äì added Maryna.
When the children sleep, Maryna is engaged in self-education and studies Czech online because she understands that it will help her find a job and somehow self-organize in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
One day, Maryna was looking for vacancies on the Internet and saw the following announcement: "As part of the initiative of the Association "Spolek Zaedno" with support of EU in the Czech Republic "12 stars for Ukraine" we are organizing a one-day art workshop in the Building of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian painters, brushes and colors are provided.
The participants are required only creative imagination‚Ä¶"
Maryna couldn't pass up this opportunity.
"I plucked up the courage and applied for participation.
All interested persons were invited to a meeting where we painted throughout the day.
Before that, I didn't sleep and was worried.
Besides, I didn't hold a brush for six years," ‚Äì told the Ukrainian woman.
During the art meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on the canvas of dimensions 80 —Ö 60 cm were created, 12 of which are works of Ukrainian artists.
"The theme of paintings was open, but we agreed to use Ukraine as a theme for our works ‚Äì as a palette basis we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
Therefore, the blue and yellow colors prevail in the collection of paintings," ‚Äì added Maryna.
30 candidates participated in the event and only 12 of them were chosen.
Maryna was among them.
On June 1, they will host an exhibition of paintings in Prague with support of EU in the Czech Republic.
"Here's how it happens in life.
All of your acquired knowledge and skills may be useful and support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic," ‚Äì pointed out Maryna.
"In the meantime, I try to become a painter.
Every step is a fight with my fears and myself.
But I have to do something‚Ä¶" ‚Äì told the woman.
Maryna is grateful to the Czech Republic for hospitality and friendliness, and she believes that the war will end soon, and she comes back to Ukraine with her children.
The active hostilities continue in the south of Ukraine.
Residents of temporarily occupied and frontline settlements continue to leave to the more safe territories.

The war destroys everything it touches.
And restoration of Ukraine after full-scale war that Russia has started will take a very long time.
However, Ukrainians don't wait for better times, they have already started to clear their cities and villages from Russians garbage, restoring infrastructure.
Kyiv region took upon the attack in the first days of full-scale war, when the Russian occupants wanted to break into the capital city and conquer it in three days.
These cities and villages went through active hostilities, atrocities of the Russian army, in some places ‚Äì the occupation.
In early April, the UAF had completely freed the region from the enemy.
Oleksandr Khomenko, the photographer, collected photos of Kyiv and the region, which were made right after the active hostilities and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians restore their property and public space.

Any response from Ukrainian servicemen to aggressor country is reasonable.
After the failure of plan to conquer Ukraine fast, Russia started a new stage of this war ‚Äì an information stage.
The Russian Federation tries to force the world to change its perspective of Russian war and decrease support of Ukraine from international community.
The international organizations evaluate the Ukrainian defenders actions instead of helping the UAF to fight against an aggressor, thus becoming complicit in Russian information warfare.
For example, a famous human rights organization stated in the report: Ukrainian servicemen are organizing positions within the territory of civilian infrastructure facilities.
At the same time, they ignored the fact that we are talking only about the facilities where the civilians were completely evacuated.
Don't succumb to Russian information attacks!
Remember: Russia invaded Ukraine, seizes it territory, kills and tortures civilians, destroys cities and villages.
The Russian Federation is to blame for the war, it has no right to any actions on the territory of our country.
Ukrainian servicemen have the right to protect their land and kick out enemy from occupied territories.
Help Ukraine to stand against Russia on all fronts!
I'm sure, every person in the world ever dreamed about his/her ideal house.
Believe me or not, I'm no exception.
Now, let me tell you about my ideal house.
My ideal house would locate on the island in the tropics.

There will be big, comfortable beds with bedside tables and dressers in the bedrooms.
There will be a lots fun books in bookshelves in the office.
The living room would become a most visited place in the house, the whole family could gather there to share the news or just to have fun.
This is why there will be a big sofa with small cushions, a few armchairs, a dresser, a large TV and a long built-in aquarium.
Furthermore, there would be a mansard in my ideal house, where we could make a home theater or entertainment room.
Behind my house, would be a swimming pool with a few hammocks.
Also, we will have a sports center where we could do exercises every day to keep fit or just to try a variety of team sports like volleyball, basketball, football etc.
My ideal house would be large and cozy, magnificent and beautiful.
I would enjoy living in it.
But this is just my dream‚Ä¶ I have to make it real.
Hello, how many people should be, so I know which room to prepare? Or she is alone?

They let me off the maternity hospital only for 10 days.

I still don't have bedclothes and a blanket.
Yes, they have to know, I hope they find, the main thing is not to panic, because now I don't know what to do and ready to start searching by myself, but I won't be allowed into Donetsk ‚Äì there are heavy battles there now, and I don't know what will happen with the search, this is hard
Yes, the last words I was told by him is that I am a hard worker, and it is good that I took sisters and brothers away, that they are safe
I have to hold on ‚Äì children are what holds me, they are my hope and support, I have nothing but them, they are everything for me, I'm happy to have them
My whole body is stiff, I don't feel anything at all, I'm glad I can walk at least, that has never happened to me
Yes, thank you, I can't go there today, in another time, I need to calm down and gather my thoughts, I have lots of thought

Photo caption,
In Minaj FC, they claim that this is a new photo from recent training sessions, which took place after the fight with the Russians
In Antalya, Turkey, there was a conflict between players of the Ukrainian Premier League football club Minaj and Russian Shinnik at a meeting.
The parties confirmed it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams happened to be staying.
Initially, the conflict that occurred on February 13 was reported by Ukrainian and Russian media.
Then both clubs confirmed the fight happened.
According to the official statement from Minaj FC, the Russians provoked the conflict.
Allegedly, one of them was drunk and was harassing a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
‚ÄúThere was indeed a fight, but it happened on the floor where the Russians were staying and in equal numbers.
The number of people injured on the Shinnik side only confirms the fact that the Russians are also ‚Äòabandoning‚Äô their own,‚Äù the statement said.
The club claims that after the fight ended, the Russians continued fighting among themselves, and the local police had to intervene.
‚ÄúBefore the start of the meeting, Minaj FC‚Äôs main request to the organizers was that there were no Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that it was the hotel that agreed to accommodate Shinnik,‚Äù the statement reads.
Roman Bebekh, a football journalist, who was one of the first to tweet about the situation, posted a photo of the Ukrainian player who defended the employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was indeed a fight, but insists that it was provoked by the Ukrainians.
In particular, the Baza telegram channel writes that representatives of Minaj approached the players of the Yaroslavl‚Äôs Shinnik and demanded that they sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians objected to this.
‚ÄúThey had a numerical advantage on their side.
Several people attacked our guy.
The guys from Yaroslavl stood up for him and defended him.
There were five or six of us and many more of the Ukrainians,‚Äù a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
‚ÄúThe Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, and their injuries included a split lip, a broken toe and what is suspected to be bruised ribs,‚Äù Kommersant reports.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how there could be Ukrainians in the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine,‚Äù Shinnik CEO Serhiy Kulakov said in a comment to reporters.
Later, Kulakov told the RIA Novosti, Russian news agency, that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but emphasized that they were not being forced to leave, they had decided to leave on their own.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what does it have to do with medicines for diabetics
7 minute(s) ago
Injections, which are gaining popularity, help to lose up to 15% of weight, but have many side effects.
In the UK, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell the Wegovy slimming injections, which are used by some famous people, including Elon Musk.
The main ingredient in Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in type 2 diabetes.
Elon Musk as well as Kim Kardashian, who have a large social media audience, have admitted to using it.
The medication is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other medications used to treat type 2 diabetes can actually help you lose weight.
They affect specific receptors in the body and suppress appetite as well as slow down food digestion.
As a result, a person feels hungry less often, gets full faster, and consumes fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick fix and not a miracle medicine that helps you lose weight without any effort.
Treatment is carried out under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and exercises.
Like any other medicine, Wegovy may have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or indigestion, bloating, and gases.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to the loss of facial fat and, for some people, to the hollowing of the cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
Doctors have named this effect "Ozempic face" after another medication for treating diabetes that is also used for weight loss.
Medical professionals advise not to take Wegovy for more than two years.

EU will strengthen sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
The European Union will introduce new sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of the full-scale Russian military invasion of Ukraine.
This was stated by Olaf Scholz, the German Chancellor, in a government statement made in the Bundestag on Wednesday, February 8, on the eve of the extraordinary EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU will support Ukraine ‚Äúfor as long as it is necessary.‚Äù
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide the largest financial support to Kyiv.
‚ÄúWe are also far ahead of everyone in continental Europe in terms of supplying weapons and ammunition,‚Äù he added.
At the same time, Scholz also criticized ‚Äúpublic bidding under the motto: battle tanks, submarines, airplanes - whoever demands more.‚Äù
In his opinion, only the Russian president and his propaganda benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Moreover, the German Chancellor emphasized once again that despite all the aid provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not become one of the parties in a military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue to closely coordinate the supply of weapons to Kyiv with partners.
Scholz reminded about the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022 to support it on its path to European integration.

Metsola urges to give Kyiv fighter aircraft and long-range weapons - DW - 09.02.2023
During a meeting on Thursday, February 9, at which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave a speech, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola urged to provide Ukraine with aircraft and long-range weapons.
‚ÄúEU member countries should quickly consider, as a next step, providing the long-range systems and fighter aircraft you need to protect the freedom that many take for granted,‚Äù Metsola stated.
In her opinion, the response should be proportional to the threat, which is very serious.
‚ÄúUkraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union,‚Äù she said, addressing Zelenskyy.
Zelenskyy: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
For his part, Zelenskyy also noted that Ukraine is on its way to EU membership.
‚ÄúWe are getting closer to the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
Ukraine that is winning will be a member of the European Union that is winning,‚Äù Zelenskyy said in his speech before the MEPs.
On top of that, he noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself against ‚Äúthe most anti-European force in the modern world.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey are trying to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life with a total war.
But for what purpose?
In order to destroy the European way as such after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of the 27 elements of the European way of life, for all 27 EU countries.
We will not allow this,‚Äù the President of Ukraine emphasized.
Zelenskyy will ask to speed up arms supplies
The day before, DW reported that Zelenskyy came to Brussels to get the support of the European Council and speed up the provision of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As a publication source from Zelenskyy‚Äôs advanced diplomatic team reminded, during the visit of Zelenskyy to the United States in late December last year, Kyiv received ‚Äúan agreement to transfer Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support, which was voted for by Congress.‚Äù
‚ÄúTherefore, the President of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally visits other capitals,‚Äù the source said.
However, the diplomat noted that ‚Äúof course, such decisions are not the responsibility of the European Council, but the decisions of the member countries.‚Äù
Zelenskyy is expected to voice the needs of Ukraine regarding weapons during the European Council summit and to talk personally with each of the 27 leaders of the EU member countries.
According to the source, Ukraine first of all needs long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia begins a major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
In the American Institute for the Study of War (ISW), they think that Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the western part of the region has increased significantly over the past week, say analysts in a February 8 report.
In addition, the report noted that geolocation footage of the combat operations confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvorichne, northwest of Svatove.
The UAF prevents Russia from achieving significant success
In the opinion of experts, the involvement of significant units of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this area indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces have so far prevented Russian troops from achieving significant success.
The ISW assumes that the offensive of the Russian Federation has not yet gained full speed, as the Russian command has not yet put into operation units of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to the Luhansk region in January after being deployed in Belarus.
‚ÄúAlthough Russian forces in Luhansk region currently have the initiative ( meaning that Russian forces are setting the terms of battle, ending the period of Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full engagement of these forces could lead to a final culmination at the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving their goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions,‚Äù the report says.
According to analysts, this culmination could likely create a window of opportunity for the Ukrainian forces, which could be used for their own counteroffensive.
However, in a morning report, the General Staff of the UAF said that Russian troops, while trying to take full control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on offensive operations in five areas: Kupyansk, Lyman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka in the areas of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Maryinka and Vuhledar.

‚ÄúAttempts to launch an offensive on both the Kharkiv and Zaporizhzhia directions will certainly be made,‚Äù he said in an interview with Reuters.
‚ÄúThe extent to which they succeed will depend on us.‚Äù

SpaceX restricts the ability of the UAF to control drones via Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
On Thursday, February 9, Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, urged the American company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kyiv in the war waged by Russia.
This was his reaction to the information that Elon Musk‚Äôs company had restricted the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite internet system.
‚ÄúCompanies have to decide for themselves: they are on the side of the right for a free life and with Ukraine, in which case they do not invent ways to cause trouble; or they are on the side of Russia and its ‚Äòright‚Äô to kill and seize territories,‚Äù Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink must not be a weapon
The day before, SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which is actively being used by the Ukrainian army to counter Russian aggression, ‚Äúwas never intended to be used as a weapon.‚Äù
‚ÄúHowever, Ukrainians use it in an unforeseen way that is not a part of any agreement.
We know that soldiers use it for communication, and this is fine.
But we never wanted it to be used for offensive purposes,‚Äù Reuters quotes the president.
In particular, Shotwell commented on the use of Starlink by the UAF to control drones, saying that SpaceX could ‚Äúrestrict their ability to do that.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere are things we can do and things we have already done,‚Äù she added.
She refused to specify what exactly the company has done.
SpaceX ‚Äúbargained‚Äù with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Right after Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX provided Kyiv with free Starlink systems to ensure the population's access to the Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it was no longer able to continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over the matter.
At that time, the company estimated the required funding until the end of 2022 to be $120 million, and about $400 million for the next 12 months.
The matter of securing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, as well as in the European Union, but soon after, the owner of the company, Musk, said that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US defense department to take over the expenses.
In December 2022, Ukraine reached an agreement with SpaceX to receive additional thousands of Starlink antennas.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine sent 10 search and rescue dogs and 18 pieces of equipment to Turkey along with the rescuers.
Klymenko said that the mission will stay there for approximately 10 days.
The number of victims of earthquakes in Turkey and Syria exceeded 17 thousand

Relations with Germany are developing in a wave-like manner - DW - 09.02.2023
Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, believes that relations between Berlin and Kyiv are developing ‚Äúin a wave-like manner‚Äù in the wake of Russian aggression, with ‚Äúups and downs.‚Äù
This position was voiced in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
‚ÄúI am a fast person by nature.
Others act more slowly, which may also be due to their bureaucracy,‚Äù Zelenskyy said, and added that in a time of war, Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people‚Äôs lives depend on the development of the situation every moment.
Acceleration of the situation with air defense
The President of Ukraine pointed out that at a certain stage the ‚Äúconservative attitude‚Äù of Germany changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
‚ÄúThen I finally also received support from Steinmeier (German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I previously had some difficulties, especially because of the so-called ‚ÄòSteinmeier formula‚Äô,‚Äù Zelenskyy said.
He emphasized that a ‚Äúgood job‚Äù had been done that allowed the relationship to change.
‚ÄúWe received IRIS-T air defense systems, and I am very grateful to Germany for that.
They saved many lives,‚Äù the President of Ukraine said.
In Zelenskyy‚Äôs opinion, Berlin has managed to increase the speed of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T systems to Ukraine in 2023.
Deceleration of the situation with tanks
However, the discussions over the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kyiv have brought relations with Germany ‚Äúback to a difficult phase,‚Äù the President of Ukraine noted.
He called the discussions on the matter ‚Äúemotional and difficult.‚Äù
‚ÄúI have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and keep convincing him that it is not us who need this help, but the Europeans,‚Äù Zelenskyy explained.
Being adamant about fighter jets
After the allies, including Germany, agreed to provide Kyiv with battle tanks, discussions began about supplying fighter aircraft, which Ukraine insists on.
Scholz was adamant about this: Under no circumstances will Germany provide combat aircraft.
However, at the same time, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kyiv ‚Äúas long as necessary.‚Äù
He made similar statements after his meeting with Zelenskyy and the President of France Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of EU leaders on Thursday.

A new prime minister has already been nominated - DW - 10.02.2023
The government of Moldova, including Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita, resigned.
The decision was made after consulting with President Maia Sandu, Gavrilita reported on Friday, February 10.
‚ÄúAfter a year and a half of work in the government, it is time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and implemented a policy of development, fighting corruption and integration into the European Union,‚Äù she stated.
She said that during her time in power, the government ‚Äúfaced blackmail over energy.‚Äù
‚ÄúThey thought that we would give up and act like former governments that betrayed national interests, but we did not. We were working in a constant crisis mode,‚Äù Gavrilita emphasized.
The reasons for her decision to resign were not specified, and she only referred to a lack of ‚Äúsupport and trust at home.‚Äù
Sandu thanked the prime minister ‚Äúfor her huge sacrifice and efforts,‚Äù also noting that Gavrilita took over the government during the crisis.
‚ÄúDespite some unprecedented challenges, she led the country responsibly, with great attention and dedication.
We have stability, peace and growth where others wanted war and bankruptcy,‚Äù the Moldovan president stated.

The Secretary of the Security Council may become the new Prime Minister
According to the law, the Cabinet of Ministers will continue to fulfill its duties until the new government takes the oath of office.
Sandu has already proposed her security advisor, the current secretary of Moldova‚Äôs Security Council and former interior minister, Dorin Recean, to replace Gavrilita.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, where the Party of Action and Solidarity has a majority.
Gavrilita was their representative, so voting for Recean should not be a problem, AFP notes.
Recean has already announced that he plans to continue to seek the membership of Moldova in the European Union.
He said that the priorities of the new government will be ‚Äúorder and discipline, breathing a new life into the economy, as well as peace and stability,‚Äù Reuters writes.
Due to Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine, in 2022 Moldova faced an energy crisis.
As a result of Russia‚Äôs strikes on Ukraine‚Äôs energy system, the country has faced two complete blackouts across the country.
Moreover, Russia has significantly limited gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to cut them off completely.
Chisinau has called the decrease in supply volumes a political decision that has nothing to do with payment issues.

Why are aftershocks dangerous?
Although there is less and less hope for saving people due to subzero temperatures in the region, rescue efforts continue.
In fact, according to the state news agency Anadolu, a family of six was rescued from under the rubble 102 hours after the earthquake in southern Turkey.
A total of 166,000 Turkish and foreign rescuers, police officers, doctors and volunteers are involved in the rescue efforts.
Out of these, more than eight thousand rescuers are from 61 countries.
A total of 97 countries have sent aid to Turkey, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported.
White Helmets in Syria criticize the UN for its lack of assistance
The United Nations (UN) estimated that the earthquake left about 5.4 million people homeless.
Read also: What do we know about the most destructive earthquakes in human history?
In Turkey, in the region, which was affected by the underground shocks, nearly 171,000 tents have been set up.
According to the official data, more than one and a half million blankets have been brought to the disaster site.
Meanwhile, in Syria, representatives of the White Helmets non-governmental organization, which carries out a rescue mission in regions under the control of the rebels, complain that there is a lack of support for them.
On February 10, a representative of the White Helmets said that only two small international teams of volunteers had arrived in the region to provide aid, and that they do not have any rescue equipment.
Moreover, according to him, no humanitarian aid from the UN is arriving in the region.
In the meantime, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which operates in London and reports on events in the northern regions of Syria under the control of the rebels, noted that one batch of aid from the UN arrived in the region the day before, but it did not contain tents for shelter and equipment for removing rubble.
About three thousand members of the White Helmets are involved in rescue efforts in northern Syria.
According to their data, the group has managed to save nearly three thousand people.
There have been found the bodies of about two thousand people, and more than 3.3 thousand people are believed to be dead.
More than 10,000 more were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
In the early morning of February 6, a powerful earthquake with a 7.8 magnitude struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria.
This earthquake was the most powerful in nearly a century of observations.
The last time when Turkey experienced earthquakes of this magnitude was in 1939, when about 33,000 people died.
In less than 12 hours, a second powerful earthquake with a 7.5 magnitude shook southeastern Turkey, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

A decisive round of presidential elections takes place in Cyprus - DW - 12.02.2023
On Sunday, February 12, the second and decisive round of the presidential election is being held in the Republic of Cyprus.
Nicos Christodoulidis, the country‚Äôs former foreign minister, and Andreas Mavroyianis, the former permanent representative of Cyprus to the UN, have entered the second round.
In the first round, the conservative politician Christodoulidis received 32 percent of the votes, while Mavroyanis, his rival in the second round, who is supported by the Left, received 29.6 percent, surpassing Averof Neofita, the leader of the ruling Democratic Union (DISY) party.
After its candidate was defeated in the first round, DISY could not decide on a candidate to support, making the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, AFP agency reports.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is chosen by a popular election.
He forms and heads the government of the country.
The winner of the current election will serve as the head of state for five years and will become the eighth president of Cyprus.
In 1974, Cyprus was divided into two parts as a result of a coup which was supported by the Greek junta and the subsequent intervention of the Turkish army.
In 1983, the northern sector of the island, which was occupied by the Turks, proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and was only recognized by Ankara.
The most recent negotiations regarding the attempt to reunify Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots, about 560,000 people, vote in the election.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote.

Energoatom reported about a new threat to ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
Petro Kotin, the President of NNEGC Energoatom, has called the draining of water in the Kakhovka reservoir by the Russians a new threat to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).
‚ÄúThere are many threats at ZNPP.
The decrease in water in the Kakhovka Reservoir is an additional threat,‚Äù Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He pointed out that as of the evening of February 11, the level of the reservoir was 13.8 meters, while the normal one is 16 meters, ‚Äúto ensure that the plant receives power for its generators, turbine capacitors and security systems.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and is growing a little bit, because it reached 13.7 meters, 13.6 meters,‚Äù Interfax-Ukraine quoted Kotin as saying.
He explained that the Russians, who control the gateways at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, began to reduce the amount of water released, while the inflow in the upper part of the Dnipro increased.
The president of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pool at ZNPP is filled enough and there is currently sufficient amount of water, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, according to him, ‚Äúit would be a big problem for ZNPP.‚Äù
Kotin emphasized that the critical level would be 12 meters, while the emergency level would be 12.8 meters, and expressed his hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, would prevent a critical situation.

As Interfax-Ukraine reminds, on February 10, 2023, the SNRI issued an order banning the operation of Zaporizhzhia NPP units 3, 4, 5, 6 at energy levels due to the inability to eliminate the discovered violations of nuclear and radiation safety requirements.

Shelling of the areas near the plant has also been registered, causing damages to the ZNPP buildings.
The Russian and Ukrainian sides blame each other for this, and there is no objective evidence of who is shelling the plant.
Israel will intensify campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to intensify the campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, February 12.
‚ÄúThe government is meeting today to prepare for an even broader counteraction against those who commit terrorism,‚Äù Reuters quoted Netanyahu as saying.
This statement was made after a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, resulting in the deaths of three Israelis, including boys aged six and eight.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
The police officers shot the man dead at the scene, and arrested and interrogated the family members of the Palestinian.
Israeli law enforcement officers sealed the doors and windows in the house of a family of a Palestinian.
The next step after the sealing may be the demolition of the attacker‚Äôs house, AP reports.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot dead during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, on Saturday evening, Palestinians fired a missile toward the Israeli border in the Gaza Strip.
The Israeli army claimed that the rocket was intercepted, dpa reports.

The security situation in Israel and in the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army conducts almost daily raids in the West Bank, which has resulted in repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported to have been killed during these raids or during their own attacks.
Moreover, as a result of Palestinian attacks in 2023, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman were killed.
According to the data of human rights activists, in 2022, about 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which made this year the deadliest in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, 30 people were killed during Palestinian attacks on Israelis last year, AR reports.
Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Currently, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, dpa reports.

The Foreign Minister of Greece visited Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
The earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a careful diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece, which have been longtime opponents, dpa reported on Sunday, February 12.
On the same day, the foreign ministers of the two countries, Nikos Dendias and Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu, held an unexpected meeting, during which they even hugged, which was captured on the cameras of Greek television.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
√áavu≈üoƒülu expressed his gratitude to Dendias for Greece being one of the first countries to provide immediate aid to Turkey after the natural disaster.
He added that both countries will try to restart a dialog and solve their issues.
‚ÄúThe help of Greece to the Turkish people does not end there,‚Äù the Foreign Minister of Greece emphasized.
According to him, Athens will ‚Äúdo everything‚Äù - at the bilateral level, as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first foreign minister of the EU to visit the disaster area.
There are several Greek rescue teams working in the Antakya and Hatay regions.
A new beginning in the bilateral relations?
Over the past few days, political observers and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing hope that the aid provided by Athens to Ankara might become a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both members of NATO have already demonstrated solidarity with each other during the massive earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This aid, known as ‚Äúearthquake diplomacy,‚Äù helped to achieve some d√©tente at that time.
The conflict over the islands
For decades, Athens and Ankara have been arguing over the sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
Ankara questions Greece‚Äôs sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesvos, Samos, and Kos.
Greece supposedly violates international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens explains that the presence of troops on the islands is justified by the threat of numerous landing craft on the western coast of Turkey and the right of each state to self-defense.
Read also: Are Greece and Turkey on the verge of an armed confrontation?
Almost every day, Turkey reinforces its claims by flying fighter aircraft over the Greek islands.
Moreover, in recent months, President Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Warming relations between Ankara and Armenia
In the wake of the tragedy caused by the earthquakes, Turkey‚Äôs relations with Armenia have also warmed.
Ankara opened a crossing that had been closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia for the victims of the disaster passed.
Moreover, Armenia announced that it was sending two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake that occurred on February 6 and killed more than 33,000 people.
For historical reasons, relations between Ankara and Yerevan are tense - about 1.5 million Armenians became victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
As the successor to the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits that it exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the genocide of Armenians has been condemned, in particular by the United States, Germany, and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
In the wake of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and the support given by Turkey to Azerbaijan, the situation only got more complicated.

NATO discusses further support of Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
The two-day meeting of defense ministers of NATO countries has begun in Brussels, where a meeting in the so-called Ramstein format is also being held on Tuesday, February 14.
The agenda of the event focuses on further increasing support for Ukraine in the war and increasing the speed of ammunition production.
Before the meeting, Jens Stoltenberg, Secretary General the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said that NATO should provide Ukraine with the weapons it requires ‚Äúto win this war.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe do not see any signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensives and new attacks,‚Äù Reuters quoted him as saying.
‚ÄúThis is a war of exhaustion, and therefore a battle for logistics,‚Äù Stoltenberg added, referring to the need of Ukraine for more weapons and negotiations about the possible provision of fighter aircraft to Ukraine.

It is expected that during the meeting, the ministers will approve long-term guidelines for the defense planning of the Alliance.
‚ÄúThe allies will discuss investment in defense, as well as ways to protect our critical infrastructure,‚Äù Interfax-Ukraine quoted Stoltenberg as saying.
What can we expect from the ninth Ramstein?
On the same day, the Contact Group, led by the United States, meets at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, with Oleksiy Reznikov, Defense Minister of Ukraine, in attendance.
The head of the Defense Ministry of Ukraine will also join a special session of the NATO Defense Ministers‚Äô meeting.
‚ÄúMore than 50 countries in the Contact Group are united with you in this fight for the sovereignty and self-defense of Ukraine,‚Äù Lloyd Austin, the Pentagon chief, wrote on Twitter, posting a video of his meeting with his Ukrainian colleague.
The Ukrainian military and political leadership has previously expressed hope that at the next Ramstein meeting, the partners would decide to provide Western-style fighter aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that as a result of this meeting, the allies will announce the exact number and timing of tanks to be provided to Ukraine.

Ukraine seeks a ban on tours of Russian artists in the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine is gathering information about Russian artists who actively promote the policy of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support the Russia‚Äôs war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations that are funded by the Russian state budget in order to include them in the new EU sanctions package.
This was reported by Halyna Hryhorenko, Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine, in an interview with DW.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
As Hryhorenko emphasized, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and to justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
‚ÄúCulture is a strategic weapon of Russia.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum clearly states that the museum‚Äôs exhibition projects abroad are their own special operation,‚Äù Hryhorenko said.
In her opinion, a dialogue through culture with Russia is currently impossible.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform in European countries on the same stage as Russian artists, poets, and musicians, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine explained.
For example, the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine recently refused to perform on the same stage with Anna Netrebko, a Russian opera singer who was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign in 2012 and supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called ‚ÄúDPR‚Äù in Donbas in 2014.

EU sanctions will officially deny Russian artists the opportunity to tour
However, in Hryhorenko‚Äôs opinion, this is not enough, as those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin‚Äôs policy still manage to go on tours in Europe.
‚ÄúIn order to cancel such tours officially, it is necessary to have names in the European sanctions lists,‚Äù says Hryhorenko and adds: ‚ÄúWe are working on ensuring that Russian artists who promote Russian narratives outside of Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will provide an opportunity to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts, in the EU.‚Äù
According to Hryhorenko, in Ukraine, this matter is being dealt with by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, and a special working group under the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As was reported earlier, on February 9, Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, at a joint press conference with Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the President of Ukraine, said that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at the summit in Kyiv.
She promised that a lot of propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of cultural and media workers from the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 names.

The US is ready to sell HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment to Poland worth $10 billion
The US State Department has approved a potential sale of military equipment and services to Poland worth about $10 billion.
This was reported by Jeff Seldin, a correspondent for the Voice of America, with reference to the Pentagon‚Äôs Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
First of all, it is about the launchers of the M142 HIMARS highly mobile artillery missile system and ammunition, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, and other military equipment.
‚ÄúThis acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a NATO member that is a force of political stability and economic progress in Europe,‚Äù the agency said in a statement.
According to the statement of the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the acquired equipment ‚Äúto modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to improve its internal defense and deter regional threats.‚Äù
In total, Poland has submitted a request to purchase the following equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of HIMARS loading device module;
- 45 M57 Army TACtical Missile System (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of the GMLRS guided multiple launch rocket system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
In addition, the agreement includes missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and staff equipment, system integration support, engineering and technical and logistic services of the US government and contractors, training, sensors, and other related hardware and software elements.
According to information from Bloomberg, the new equipment is an addition to the launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw has also requested missile launchers from South Korea, the media reports.
NATO Secretary General called on the US to be ready for the long war of the Russian Federation in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighters to Ukraine to defend itself in the war against the Russian Federation is not off the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak claimed during the press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyi.
‚ÄúThe first step in providing advanced aircraft is to have soldiers or aviators who can use them.
It‚Äôs a process that takes some time.
We started this process today,‚Äù Sunak said about the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
‚ÄúNothing is removed from the agenda, and our leadership on this issue is something we should all be proud of.‚Äù
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks will arrive in Ukraine as early as ‚Äúnext month‚Äù and said that Ukraine ‚Äúshould never again be left vulnerable to attack,‚Äù and also called for ‚Äúarming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term.‚Äù
According to his words, the UK agreed to expand its training program, according to which 10 thousand troops were trained over the past six months, and promised, according to CNN, to ‚Äúaccelerate the delivery of our equipment‚Äù to ensure Ukraine‚Äôs achievements on the front line in the coming ‚Äúdays and weeks, not years.‚Äù
During the press conference, President Zelenskyi expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: ‚ÄúToday it is obvious that we have the support of the UK.
Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity.‚Äù
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he once again repeated the call for the provision of Western fighters to Ukraine and added that he ‚Äúheard from Mr. Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighters‚Äù to Kyiv.
The Russian embassy in London has already stated that Britain‚Äôs decision to provide Ukraine with fighters will have ‚Äúmilitary-political consequences‚Äù for the whole world.
These days Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba claimed on Twitter that Kyiv continues to talk with Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: ‚ÄúI talked to Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra to coordinate our international steps as Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion approaches the annual mark.
I thanked for the last decision on tanks.
I also raised the question of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation.‚Äù
A spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Forces, Yurii Ignat, said in a commentary for CNN that Ukraine would need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say that the West has a short period of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the start of the expected new Russian offensive in the spring or even in February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin has already been trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since early January.

‚ÄúPolitics and profits‚Äù stand in the way of vaccination
The Director General of the World Health Organization claimed on Sunday that if countries do not effectively use existing tools to fight the pandemic, it cannot be ended.
‚ÄúThe pandemic will end when the world decides to put an end to it,‚Äù said Tedros Adan Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum hosted by Germany.
‚ÄúWe have all the necessary tools‚Äîeffective health care tools and effective medical equipment.
But the world has used these tools poorly,‚Äù Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries.
Obstacles on the way to achieve the WHO‚Äôs goal of vaccinating 40% of each country‚Äôs population against the coronavirus are ‚Äúpolitics and profits,‚Äù the WHO chief said, ‚Äúnot the production.‚Äù
‚ÄúCountries that have already achieve the goal of 40%, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue in favor of COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust,‚Äù Tedros said.
COVAX is an international cooperation initiative created to equitably distribute the COVID vaccine.
Ghebreyesus also underlined that no country can put an end to COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
‚ÄúAnd no country can protect the health of its own nation without cooperation to protect other nations.
Together!‚Äù, noted Ghebreyesus in the social network Twitter.
The WHO official representative also called on vaccine manufacturers to ‚Äúmake priority and execute their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust]‚Äù and become ‚Äúmuch more transparent about wherever everything is directed.‚Äù
AVAT is an African Union initiative aimed at providing access to COVID-19 vaccines throughout Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to ‚Äúshare know-how, technology and licenses and waive the intellectual property rights.‚Äù
Earlier, Karren Attia, a correspondent for The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share the ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù of the Moderna vaccine with the world.
‚ÄúThe US administration has proclaimed about the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, this is not kind-hearted philanthropy; it‚Äôs haughtiness.
Poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they initially asked for a fair chance,‚Äù said the observer.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not asking for charity,‚Äù Tedros said, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre calling for reasonable investments into global recovery.‚Äù
As Voice of America reported, earlier this year the Biden administration called for waiving patent protections on COVID-19 vaccines.
Such a refusal should, according to the US administration, allow poorer countries to produce analogous drugs to patented vaccines.
Pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, and others stood against this.
In August, Moderna and Pfizer pharmaceutical companies announced about the increase of the prices of their coronavirus vaccines.
The John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center reported on Monday that it has recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university data, almost 7 billion vaccines have been injected.

The Polish President Andrzej Duda said the decision to send F-16 aircraft to Ukraine would be a ‚Äúvery serious decision‚Äù that is ‚Äúnot easy to make.‚Äù
This was stated by one of the closest allies of Ukraine in an interview with CNN amid the discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
As reported to CNN by correspondent Laura Kiunsberg, in Warsaw in an exclusive interview that will be aired on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16 aircrafts would create a ‚Äúserious problem‚Äù for Poland, because the Polish Air Forces have less than 50 aircrafts, and the Poles themselves ‚Äúdo not have enough... and we will need much more.‚Äù
Duda also underlined that combat aircraft, like F-16, have a ‚Äúvery serious need for maintenance,‚Äù so ‚Äúit‚Äôs not enough just to send a few aircrafts.‚Äù
These concerns by President Duda were spoken against the background of the discussions about new arms supplies to Ukraine, including Western tanks and longer-range missile launchers.
Poland is one of Ukraine‚Äôs closest allies, and Warsaw has urged its NATO allies to send Patriot launchers and Western-made tanks such as German Leopard tanks to Kyiv.
The President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyi made an unannounced European tour this week, during which he called on Western partners of Ukraine to provide it with the antiweapon means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelenskyi called combat aviation as the ‚Äúwings of freedom‚Äù of Ukraine.
The same message was repeated by Zelenskyi in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelenskyi said he was ‚Äúvery grateful‚Äù for the assistance provided, and hoped that the next negotiations on the provision of aircraft to Ukraine would also be successful.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard from some European leaders about their readiness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aircraft.
Now I have a series of bilateral negotiations, we will raise the question of fighters and other aircraft.
Therefore, we continue to work here in Brussels,‚Äù Zelenskyi said.
As reported by Voice of America, last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to transfer its F-16 fighters to Ukraine in ‚Äúfull coordination‚Äù with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said that his government would have considered Kyiv‚Äôs request for the F-16.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied the supply of F-16 aircraft from the United States, but Western experts believe that these aircraft can come to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that earlier weapons that the United States refused to supply eventually reach out Ukraine if European NATO allies agreed to transfer it.

CHISINAU, Moldova (PA).
On Monday, the President of Moldova has claimed Moscow‚Äôs conspiracy to use external spies to overthrow the country‚Äôs government, transfer the country ‚Äúto Russia‚Äôs disposal‚Äù and disrupt its aspirations to join the European Union.
The President Maia Sandu‚Äôs briefing had been held a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that his country had intercepted plans by Russian intelligence services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.
‚ÄúThe plan for the next period is designed to involve the spies with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will use force, attack some state buildings and even take hostages,‚Äù Sandu told reporters at the briefing.
‚ÄúThe purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate power of Chisinau to illegitimate,‚Äù Sandu said, ‚Äúwhich would transfer our country to Russia‚Äôs disposal and stop the process of European integration.‚Äù
She promised: ‚ÄúThe Kremlin‚Äôs attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed.‚Äù
Russian officials did not react to Sandu‚Äôs statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.6 million people, has tried to build closer relations with its Western partners.
Last year in June it received the status of a candidate for the European Union, on the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in ‚Äúseveral cases of organizing criminal elements and stopped attempts of violence.‚Äù
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a member of NATO, has faced a number of problems.
It includes serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply reduced gas supplies; rapid inflation; as well as several incidents related to missiles crossing airspace and debris found on its territory in recent months.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile during the war in Ukraine has entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu stated that Russia wants to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the secret services contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry to Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
‚ÄúI assure you that government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control,‚Äù Sandu said.
She said Moldova‚Äôs parliament should adopt draft laws to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the prosecutor‚Äôs office, with ‚Äúnecessary tools to more effectively combat the country‚Äôs security risks.‚Äù
The President added that the plan would ‚Äúrely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups,‚Äù and suggest names of two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Volodymyr Plakhotniuk, both of whom are now in exile.
Last year, the United States and the United Kingdom imposed sanctions on both men.
Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by Shor‚Äôs populist, Russia-friendly party also rocked Moldova in conditions of an energy crisis.
The president‚Äôs press briefing on Monday was held after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrylita resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Rechan, as a successor of Gavrylita.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that ‚ÄúRussia has for years supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova that often involve the use of corruption in the form of weapons to achieve its goals.‚Äù

I would like to talk to you in person, but we are at home.
Darynka feels pain in ear, so we went to hospital today. So we‚Äôll be under treatment until Thursday.

War stories: ‚ÄúOld woman with a red flag‚Äù threw it away when she found out about Bucha
An employee of the Strategic Communications Centre has found exactly that woman.
üîª A living symbol of ‚Äúpro-Russian Ukraine‚Äù, a woman who, according to Russian propaganda‚Äôs version, ‚Äúbravely resisted the nationalists‚Äù, is actually grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only provide her goods, but also protected from ordinary Kharkiv citizens‚Äô anger.
üîª Anna Ivanivna explains that she came out with a red flag to, as she thought, the Russian military so that they ‚Äúto not devastate Ukraine.‚Äù
And in the aggressor country her motives were corrupted, which is why she now feels like a ‚Äútraitor.‚Äù
üîª Currently, she is in one of the city hospitals in Kharkiv with her husband.
üí¨ The military calls to not to despise the old woman.
‚ÄúNow when Anna Ivanivna received a mine into the yard from the Russians, and help from the Ukrainians, her grandson is saved in Poland, when she found out about Bucha and everything else, she threw that red flag away,‚Äù says the troop commander with pseudonym ‚ÄúCadet‚Äù
The enemy creates conditions for the attack on Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih ‚Äî summary
The Russian troops are conducting military operations to reach the administrative borders of the Kherson region and create suitable conditions for the attack on the cities of Mykolaiv and Kryvyi Rih.
Source: AFU General Staff
Verbatim: ‚ÄúTo increase the pace of the offensive operation, the command of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation continues to take measures to strengthen the strike potential of its troops.
Weapons and military equipment removed from storage in the Western, Central, Eastern Military Districts and the Northern Fleet are transferred to the areas close to Ukraine border by rail.‚Äù
Details: The enemy did not conduct active actions in the Volyn and Polissia directions.
There were no significant changes in the situation in these areas.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
There is a continued risk of the enemy‚Äôs missile strikes on military and civilian infrastructure throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as the enemy's provocations on the specified area of Ukraine state border.
We refuse Soviet weapons and switch to NATO samples ‚Äî Zaluzhnyi
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi held a telephone conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.
Source: AFU General Staff
Direct speech of Zaluzhnyi: ‚ÄúWith my American counterpart we have also discussed a promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to refuse Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO samples.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will finish it.
I also informed General Milley about the difficult situation in the East of our state, in particular in the Izyum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready units.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, keep occupied borders and positions.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe one who invented this infernal summer was evidently nuts,‚Äù complained Wildling, and stretched out her arms before her, as if she wanted to reach for the ghostly coolness.
‚ÄúYou say the same thing every time,‚Äù said Guard indifferently, stirring the ice in a cocktail. In the fall, because of rain and drizzle, and the grasses are rotting.
In winter, cause it‚Äôs cold and the herbs freeze.
In spring, cause it‚Äôs raining again...
‚ÄúYou should‚Äôve better sat in the Carpathians,‚Äù Guard shrugged her shoulders indifferently.
Although she did not particularly like the city.
It diffused all the beauty of its past in haste and vanity.
The girl liked to imagine calm, quiet and greener familiar streets, like a hundred years ago or earlier.
But there is no magic that would allow you to go back in time.
‚ÄúHaha!
What a thing to say!‚Äù, Wildling slapped with her palm on the table ‚Äî and vases with flowers began to cowardly jingling. ‚ÄúIf you were sitting for a week in the meadow at my grandma Rutmera with her friends, you would pray on every passing truck, begging to be taken away from there to any city.
Unless you loved to rogue the beds, sort out the herbs, hang them under the ceiling and at the same time sing old spells from morning till night.
Because grandma is so stubborn, that without words none of my potions would be like it should be.
And wait, I haven‚Äôt yet mentioned about gathering any scarecrow at night!..
But no, our lily handed, you would die, even a week would not pass!
Because of such films, most people think that women become prostitutes for a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù life, and that they like such a ‚Äújob‚Äù, that it‚Äôs their conscious choice and so on.
But if you start to really see into this topic, it becomes frightening...
Now there is an especially acute problem with the involvement of Ukrainian women in prostitution.
A problem does exist.
Our current president even had the idea to legalize prostitution... because of this, my attitude to him was not very well.
I think that we need to adopt the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of ‚ÄúSwedish model‚Äù.
In this case they don‚Äôt punish a woman, but a client.
They help women to get out of this ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù instead of making it legal.
Legalization does not necessarily mean security and social guarantees.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there‚Äôs no more hope for anything.
Men should also think about what they are buying ‚Äî ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù or violence...
There is a need of a different kind... can look for me where the nearest optics with a doctor who can prescribe glasses.
And I need to buy a high-quality frame... I searched on some sites with frames, and I was pleasantly impressed ‚Äî it‚Äôs cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $300 for them, the frame was of middle level (or even lower).
I do not know what frames are in stores, but prices in online stores are quite normal.
But, regarding some cosmetics, I can say for sure that it is more expensive here.
Much more expensive.
Multifocal lenses in glasses are very expensive here (when compared to our average salaries).
Taken into account the budget of our family (especially the fact that it is necessary to rent housing), $300 for glasses is quite high amount.
Did the doctors offer you an artificial multifocal crystal?
I had been used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then lens intolerance had begun, a year after that I wore hard lenses, a strong allergy to almost all cosmetics began.
I‚Äôve been wearing glasses constantly for 4 years, I wear lenses very rarely.
Yes, I also read that Covid affects the vision.
Also after 40 years of age there is a need in glasses for reading.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than $1000, that is very expensive.
Yes, glasses are in fashion now.
I asked a doctor why he does not wear lenses or does not undergo a laser correction, and he replied that glasses are stylish)
For a retiree with a pension of 1500 UAH, this amount is unrealistic
My glasses now mask wrinkles
Yes.
My mom has little work experience.
She worked not for long time: first, little kids who often get sick, then she took care of grandma... so the state gave her a minimum retirement pay.
Father earns 3,800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8,000 hryvnias and all these funds had to be paid for rental housing.
In good times (before Covid) there were incentive payments, but with the coming of quarantine there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
That‚Äôs why many Ukrainians go to work abroad to earn a living for a family or buy an apartment, but then the connection with the family is lost...
Yes, there are pros.
But when my husband has a day off, he goes to the bee-garden)

According to the order from the date of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until the restoration of control over these seaports.
It is indicated that such a decision was made due to the impossibility of performing the servicing of ships and passengers, ensuring an appropriate level of navigation safety and environmental protection during Russia‚Äôs military operations in these regions, which pose a threat to human life and health.
russian federation uses the troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, this is written by Reuters with referring to a statement by the British Foreign Ministry.
‚ÄúThe British Foreign Ministry on Sunday claimed that russia uses the troll factory to spread disinformation on social networks about the war in Ukraine and politicians of certain countries, including: United Kingdom and South Africa‚Äù, ‚Äî stated in the material.
It is noted that the Foreign Ministry came to these conclusions on the basis of an expert study.
‚ÄúThe department stated that this study has uncovered exactly how the Kremlin disinformation campaign operates, aimed at manipulating international public opinion regarding the invasion to Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers,‚Äù Reuters writes.
According to the research, the troll factory used Telegram to involve and coordinate new supporters, who later acted against critics of the Kremlin, bombarding them with comments in support of president putin and his war.‚Äù
British ministers and other world leaders were among the targets of this factory.
‚ÄúThe traces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including: Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok‚Äù, stated in the report.
British Foreign Ministry Liz Truss said in a statement that her government had already "warned international partners and will continue to collaborate closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe cannot allow the Kremlin and its shady troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin‚Äôs illegal war,‚Äù Truss concluded.
Ivanna, I‚Äùll explain it to you.
Your hair has such a structure so that all your hair is almost the same length.
There are very little short layers.
To achieve the most smooth result we need to do tampering of the hair.
But it will significantly affect hair thickness.
That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt do that.
Or you need to dye roots to make a transition more smooth.
Upon your request I didn‚Äôt dye roots as well.
So the transition can be a little bit abrupt.
I can make the transition more smooth, but I will need to decorate roots.
Roots will be dyed aligned with your color, so when your hair will have grown you won‚Äôt notice the difference.
Regarding hair quality.
Unfortunately, any bleach affects hair quality.
Hair can become more dry, it‚Äôs normal because it‚Äôs blonde.
Such blonde can‚Äôt be done without loss of quality.
If proper hair treatment is made, hair condition will get back to normal.
Please, write, which treatment from Matrix you use.
Maybe, it is too weak for blonde.
We can enroll for free toning in order to make a more smooth transition.
There is also quite abrupt transition on this photo.
Because a large percent of blonde is in a near root zone.
Please, write when you can come here so that I can look at you.
If we do toning, it‚Äôll take about three hours.
There‚Äôs a lot of positivity from what I do at my job.
I help people ‚Äî it‚Äôs the main thing and I was striving for it.
Even this way, but it is help for people who are not receiving any help from almost no one in the world and no one says ‚Äúgood afternoon‚Äù with smile in heart to them.
Today I found great basic courses or learning Czech language in the Internet.
In the morning I clean in the chambers where homeless sleep, at this time I‚Äôm alone and the doors to these 3 chambers are closed.
I listen to these lessons in headphones and repeat after the lector.
From the side it seems that I talk to myself, but it is good that at this time nobody sees and hears me üòÖ I think I can learn the language about an hour a day this way.
So another huge positive side of this work is the study of language in headphones and in practice when directly communicating with colleagues üôÇ
In over a century Russia has conducted 31 military companies.
Her longest period of peace lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders with 14 countries.
She has attacked 10 of them.
Most part of modern Russia‚Äôs territory was once occupied by nomadic tribes which had significantly influenced the formation of Russians‚Äô cultural background.
The cult of conquest and raids was successful throughout all the history of Russia: in Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then 20 years of Putin‚Äôs regime.
These cultural features have generated state institutions which cultivate the policy of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians support the invasive war because they believe that their country is the most majestic and has the right to attack other countries.
The Russians have not yet fully felt the consequences of the economic sanctions.
Their standard of living has not declined to the point to provoke mass protest movements within the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand the toughening of the sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from the inside!
Russia poses a threat of new Chornobyl and Fukushima.
Russian military bombard and seize nuclear power plants on he territory of Ukraine.
They de-energized Chornobyl NPP.
They fired from tanks and took control of Zaporizhzhya NPP ‚Äî the largest in Europe.
The Russian missiles were also observed above the Yuzhnoukrainsk NPP in Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention which prohibits the attack on the NPP.
Rocket hits, overheating of the reactor or spent fuel due to failures in the supply of electricity and water can lead to radiation leakage.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia in not necessarily has to press ‚Äúred button‚Äù to cause a planetary disaster.
Support Ukraine ‚Äî only being together we can overcome Russian threat!
Russians rob Ukrainian farmers and illegally export grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and first yields from Ukraine.
Such cases were registered in four regions of Ukraine, temporarily occupied by Russia.
This is a deliberate policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of Krasnoyarsk Territory made a decision ‚Äúto expropriate the surplus yields of the previous and this year‚Äù from the South of Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take seed from farmers, but at the same time require them to make a successful sowing in order to send new yields to Russia.
It prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
If disagree ‚Äî threatens with physical harassment.
Russia repeats the USSR's policy of mass robbery of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
Thus begun the Holodomor in 1932-1933 and private property on Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the mask of a ‚Äúliberating war against the Nazis‚Äù, Russia, in particular, provokes famine in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods!
And demand from your country to refuse any collaboration with Russia!
Russian soldiers on the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine take children as hostages.
They made their mothers to infer the location of Ukrainian military, if case of refuse they threaten to kill children.
The people are forced to make a hard choice: to loose children or to become traitors of the Motherland and to be punished for it.
Human rights ombudsman in Ukraine Liudmyla Denisova repeatedly reported about mass kidnapping of orphaned children by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated amendments to the legislation ‚Äúto organize an expedited procedure of the adoption of children from Donbas‚Äù.
Call on your authorities and the international community not to allow the kidnapping of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join too NATO, but I don‚Äôt like their uncertainty.
Due to the fact that NATO doesn‚Äôt close the sky over Ukraine, thousands of people die.
More than 50,000 civilians have been killed.
However, we would have been powerless without Western weapons, but I have to say that it comes in insufficient quantities and with a delay.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think that the alliance itself will benefit from it because having the weapons from NATO and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most competent army in Europe
Did you know that Ukrainians have invented how to reload ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù nlaw anti tank complex?
I think Americans will shoot down these warheads at the stage of launch
Russians deserve the worst and the most terrible things that one can imagine.
That‚Äôs why to some extent I‚Äôm happy about what‚Äôs going on.
Because this war lasts much longer than 4 months, it began in around 15th century, I just can‚Äôt recall right now.
But all these hundreds of years there is an attempt to make us their slaves.
While one generation is still alive, the other is born and takes the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime wasn‚Äôt punished and now they have come back to us again.
This history is repeating itself, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, that‚Äôs why it is our chance to destroy russia as a state
It‚Äôs totally crazy for me to realize that the enemies were just near my house and I have seen them.
But due to the evanescence of the events, I didn‚Äôt even have time to comprehend, to reflect on the fact that there is a war and what it means to me
It‚Äôs great here, but I need to learn the language and go to work, I can‚Äôt sit on the expense of the Czech state, but the problem is that my husband does not want me to go to work, constant quarrels.and we will have to return to Ukraine and we could stay, but he will do his best to ensure that we go back.it is very difficult situation
He does not want us to live, that is his reply
But he is glad that we are here but he wants us to sit constantly at home, I took children to school and swimming by my own, I beg him to stay here after the war and he says that we will immediately go home, he will not make documents for us
I probably will not be able to leave by my own if he has a lot of work to do, and he may not give permission to take children to the Czech Republic
Long-term residence
When the war will end I want to learn to become a hairdresser and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic, if he does not want to then probably have to seek a lawyer.now it is early to do something.but here he told us very clearly that after the war we will immediately go home.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine, he said that he would))) well, now I know the truth
Yes. Thank you.we will overcome the situation, the main thing is that the war ends!!! everything will be ok.!!!
No, at the moment he does not have anyone, that‚Äôs for sure. I think the reason is that children want a lot of things in Czechia, asking him to buy toys or to go to Mac Donald's, screaming, running around the house.and he used to quiet when no one bothers him and does not ask for anything.and then we came and everything annoys him and he need to spend money on us, and he is such an economizer.it is better for him that we live in Ukraine.

Comrade authorized operative Orlov was lying on a narrow Spartan bed, habitual for him, as it was exactly the same as his own narrow Spartan bed at his home.
He unfolded simple kit for business traveler‚Äîrye bread and axunge wrapped in grey wiper.
Comrade Orlov was very injudicious in his eating, and very injudicious in his living, he had forgotten about how people enjoy life and have fun for no reason because he was doing only useful things for country and world revolution.

Or to find a job with accommodation.
I don‚Äôt see other options ((
I don‚Äôt want to just sit because accommodation will not be free for long.

I don‚Äôt want to take money from you.
I don‚Äôt want the opinions about lazy people from Ukraine to affect other.
I just want to find a job and a room for a living in an ordinary city, not a capital.
Hard way from Ukraine during three days and a big city where a foreign language frightened me a lot.

Maybe you know someone in small towns?
I can be a babysitter, cook a food, clean, work in a garden...
I can sew, I have learned to sew on sewing machine.
I sewed bedclothes and some clothes on order.
Maybe there will be such job.

Thank you for your letter, I express my personal opinion which not always matches the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion the matter of excluding or not excluding the association of Russian psychologists from European associations is very difficult.
The organization members might have different opinions regarding Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion the protection of basic human rights and right to life are paramount.
I‚Äùll give an analogy.
If in the sandbox one child takes away a toy from another child, the adults supervising the children most likely will try to reconcile the children and after some time their game goes on.
But if one child in the sandbox begins to hit another child in the face with a showel, this child will be isolated, and no one will play with that child.
I liked another analogy from a counterpart Russian psychologist regarding that fact that if somebody from an apartment nearby kills someone, all the residents of the apartment building will not be put to the jail.
There is a lot of controversy among Ukrainian psychologists regarding the exclusion of Russian associations from European ones, many people feel so much pain and therefore can stand a communication with Russian psychologists.
I personally feel a lot of pain and sadness about war in Ukraine but I am ready to continue a collaboration with several psychologists from Russia which I know, and to share knowledge in order to treat traumas of the clients from both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who are trying to do a lot of things on their level for development of universal human values in Russia.
That‚Äôs why I definitely endorse the differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I firmly believe that in Russia only 5-10% of population support war, and different figures in social surveys are drawn by propaganda.
My wife has left her native motherland Ukraine because the war there is continuing.
My wife had a great job and if there was no war she would never left her home.
To not to be a heavy burden to Czech Republic my wife is trying to earn money since once in 2009 she received the certificate of completion of massage courses.
Everyone do what they can to earn money in Czechia.
The only problem is to learn Czech language.
My wife is learning language and earning for herself and a child for food, kindergarten, travel ticket in a bus, mobile services, clothes.
At this time I defend my Motherland.
I thank to people who understand this.
I thank to Czech Republic for providing a shelter to women and children from Ukraine at very difficult time. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáøü§ù‚úä
I want to thank you for providing a possibility to place my wife‚Äôs advertisement for the provision of massage services in your community.
My wife earns money on her own because she doesn‚Äôt want to live at the expense of taxes of the Czech people.
Thanks
I‚Äôm sincerely grateful to you.
It really helps my wife to earn money for her family.
Ok, I will tell this my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of Ukrainian people.
Some people laugh at my wife‚Äôs advertisement, but my wife is offering her services.
In Ukraine my wife was a nurse, I am working in the police, but we are split by the war.
It is good that my wife wants to work and to earn money instead of waiting for assistance from your republic.

In 2020-2021 I participated in researches of Bat rehabilitation center in Kharkiv as a volunteer.
In this organization I helped to conduct the monitoring of the bat populations in Kharkiv region and to organize the hibernation for bats that were disturbed by people in a cold season.
In the fall of 2021 I also worked as a guide in Kharkiv Zoo, where I have improved my skills of communication with an audience and have learned to excite the curiosity of others in a topic of saving the biodiversity that is important for me.
In Ukrainian university I also was able to get acquainted with scientific works about tardigrades, to observe their vital activity with the microscope and to talk to scientists researching them.
Therefore I also interested in the option of more profound studying of these and other microscopic organisms.
How has the attitude toward Ukrainians changed, and why isn't the EU paying for refugees ‚Äî expert analysis
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive any refugee assistance from the EU ‚Äî it‚Äôs the most discussed topic in meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milos Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that Poland has become the primary defender of European values and has taken upon itself the responsibility of resolving many issues since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.
It has provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, offered housing assistance, and provided financial aid.
Approximately 500 thousand people have arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget the vigorous support of neighboring countries, Poland and the Czech Republic, and will be endlessly grateful!
The ProUkra—ónu newsroom interviewed Yaroslav Kot, a coordinator and translator at the Refugee Centre in Lublin, about how Poland is managing the sudden wave of refugees and the financial burden.
He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analytics, which has representative offices not only in Poland but also in Canada, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan.
How does Poland provide assistance to Ukrainians
The Czech Republic has hosted up to half a million Ukrainians, which has had a significant impact on the Czechs' daily life.
There are long queues at labor offices, and significant price increases are being observed in shops.
What is currently happening in Poland, which has hosted millions of Ukrainian refugees?
When hostilities broke out, the Polish government quickly organized and commenced providing assistance.
It was anticipated.
In recent months, there have been discussions in Poland about the emergence of such a significant issue.
Even in Ukraine, there was much less preparation for what was going to happen, while Poland was actively preparing.
For instance, there were already plans in place regarding the placement of refugees from Ukraine in the border regions of Poland and Ukraine, even prior to the onset of the war.
In Ukraine, there hasn't even been a consideration that such a thing could happen.
I have heard that there was mockery regarding Poland's fear of the refugees.
However, it was a well-considered decision to prepare for all of these events before the onset of the war.
I would like to emphasize that a substantial amount of funding was allocated from regional and state budgets to assist Ukrainians fleeing from the bombing by the Russian aggressor.
First and foremost, assistance was provided in logistics, specifically in facilitating movement throughout the territory of Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical trains for the wounded and sick.
There are airplanes flying through the territory of Poland, connecting cities within the country, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I have had the experience of collaborating with flights to Portugal, France, Romania, and Spain from Lublin.
Although Lublin is comparable in size to Lutsk, it does not have a population exceeding one million, as one might assume.
The transportation issue remains of great importance.
The passenger fare for Ukrainians has been waived in Poland.
They can travel on trains and public transport free of charge.
Furthermore, Poland has reached an agreement with German carriers who have organized free trains from several Polish cities to Germany.
This means that refugees have the opportunity to reach their intended destinations free of charge.
Another important aspect is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local self-government authorities.
Typically, these consist of small enclosed school stadiums or complexes where temporary halls are equipped with beds.
Additionally, free meals and medical first aid are provided at these facilities.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for several days, while on-site efforts are made to explore possibilities for relocating them to more comfortable conditions.
Cities like Warsaw, Gdansk, and Wroclaw have recently intensified their activities, leading to the establishment of entire Ukrainian neighborhoods in these areas.
The case of Warsaw is unique in that they were able to negotiate with the Russian Embassy to reclaim the facilities that were vacated by the embassy staff.
For decades, large residential complexes remained abandoned, with Russians not granting access to anyone.
The Polish local authorities effectively nationalized these complexes.
They took them over for the benefit of Ukrainians, and now Ukrainian families will reside there.
These are multi-family housing units that can accommodate 200‚Äì300 families at once.
The buildings will be provided with water and electricity, and they have been insulated.
Refugees from Ukraine will be able to begin living there within a week or two.
The third aspect is social care.
After February 24th, Poland took a unique step: the Sejm passed a law on refugees from Ukraine, which was later approved by the Senate.
According to this law, Ukrainian citizens are granted the right to legally stay in Poland for a period of 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all European countries.
This law includes provisions for medical services.
In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotych for providing free medication assistance to Ukrainians.
You simply need to send an SMS message and receive a code on your phone.
And you can receive medications in Poland for free, up to the equivalent amount of 5,000 hryvnias.
Social care includes an amount of three hundred zlotych, which is given to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age, and is provided without the need for repayment.
Various funds, such as Caritas and the Red Cross, are widely available, providing packages containing food, household items, and clothing.
As the Poles say: ‚ÄúNiespotykana skala‚Äù.
It means ‚Äúan event that is one of a kind‚Äù.
It showcases immense hospitality.
These costs pose a significant burden on the Polish State.
The European Union has not allocated not a single euro to Poland thus far.
In reality, it represents a significant blow to the Polish budget.
What is the greatest challenge in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
A language problem.
The challenges begin with polyclinics, as Ukrainians often require an interpreter to navigate their way through.
Often, they encounter complex medical issues and illnesses.
Another challenge is faced in schools, where students, particularly those in higher grades, struggle to cope with and understand the terminology.
It is worth noting that Ukrainian children often possess a higher level of knowledge compared to their corresponding grade level.
This often comes as a big surprise to Polish teachers.
Children come well-prepared with knowledge, demonstrating not only a good command of English but also a level that exceeds their grade level.
It‚Äôs also interesting.
This indicates that Ukraine has a strong educational system.
Indeed, children in Ukraine excel academically as they receive high value and recognition here.
Undoubtedly, language proficiency plays a crucial role for employment opportunities.
Unfortunately, professionals who have worked as doctors, accountants, lawyers, and other similar occupations in Ukraine may face greater challenges in adapting and pursuing the same career here.
A lawyer or accountant, I am not aware of any such cases.
In certain premises, particularly in Lublin, there is a company that has established its own small polyclinic where Ukrainian doctors are now practicing.
This Polish initiative allows Ukrainian doctors the opportunity to legally provide medical treatment to fellow Ukrainians.
The language barrier often becomes a significant reason for families to return to their home country after a few weeks of staying here.
There are a lot of such cases.
In the past few weeks, there has been an influx of refugees who initially fled during the early weeks of the war and are now returning back.
These are the regions of Zakarpattia and western Ukraine, where there are currently no active military actions.
They have faced challenges in settling down and finding employment here.
The living conditions in their current location do not meet their needs, making it more convenient for them to choose to return home.
This has also been one of the problems that has arisen in recent weeks.
How has the attitude towards Ukrainians changed
According to the Ukrainian ambassador in the Czech Republic, significant changes have taken place.
While there was a time when the Czech embassy regarded Ukrainians solely as labor migrants, they now acknowledge and admire the resilience of Ukrainians defending their country.
How did the Polish people treat the millions of Ukrainian refugees?
A similar situation can be observed in Poland.
In Poland, all television channels often quote the phrase of the President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
He was in Tbilisi with President Yushchenko and other leaders when Georgia came under attack by Russia.
He made a remarkable statement there, suggesting that Russian aggression might not stop at Georgia and that Ukraine could be the next target.
The Baltic States could become involved later, and even Poland might be affected.
So it was a sort of prediction.
In fact, Ukrainians are currently defending Poland with their blood, demonstrating their loyalty and heroic deeds.
Poland and its residents deeply appreciate it, which is why they open their homes and selflessly assist the Ukrainian refugees.
Poland is perceived as a threat.
Despite Poland's NATO membership and the presence of American military bases, there is a sense of apprehension that the war might eventually reach our country.
That's why the attitude has changed to a positive one.
The Ukrainian flag and anthem are no longer seen as the ‚Äúsong of the nationalists‚Äù or associated with enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are small groups within the population who have not altered their views; such groups exist in every country.
But fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now hold a significantly different perspective on Ukrainians compared to before.
The statement regarding nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians frequently assert that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eradicated.
In Poland, these so-called "nationalists" are often perceived with humor, as they have turned out to be individuals who are completely unrelated to any political implications.
And that is indeed impressive, as this face-to-face contact has influenced the change in public opinion among social groups who previously harbored doubts regarding certain historical issues.
Now it turns out that these doubts have been dispelled.
Ukrainians are the heroes.
When Poles start thinking that there might be a war, they immediately realize that they wouldn't be able to resist and sacrifice their lives as is happening in Ukraine now.
Here, people constantly talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha, and other Ukrainian cities.
How does Poland perceive the Russian threats
Ukraine believes in its victory but prepares for the worst-case scenario because this terrifying war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are deeply concerned about their own safety.
Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons as a response to the support for Ukraine.
How does the government and society of Poland react?
Wish for peace, but be prepared for war.
Actually, that's what Poland does: it maintains very good contacts with the USA and other NATO countries.
The military forces have been increased.
Currently, additional recruitment for the provincial armed forces is taking place in Poland.
So they are actively preparing for various military scenarios.
Citizens feel that the state is preparing for such events.
Additionally, a new law on homeland defense was recently enacted, which has substantially increased the budget allocated to Poland's military requirements.
Requirements for military recruitment have been revised, with many aspects directly related to potential military threats taken into consideration.
I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.
Your predictions became a reality in Syria; you warned about a potential Russian invasion.
What can you say after analyzing the situation: when will Ukraine achieve victory, and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
It‚Äôs the worst scenario.
I don't really believe in a nuclear attack.
But such a scenario is possible.
Such a nuclear attack should be more indicative for NATO countries, including Poland.
According to various estimates, such an attack could potentially occur in the Volyn region.
To be clear, I hope it never happens, but it is indeed the worst-case scenario.
A strike of small magnitude, but one that would generate a ‚Äúmushroom cloud‚Äù visible on all television channels.
So that it would be visible in Poland and the Baltic States.
In this case, Russians anticipate a retreat and the loss of combat capability of the NATO forces.
The positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian forces, problems with Putin and the surrounding oligarchs who are currently facing financial difficulties, and various regional issues in Russia.
We have reports of fires at the hydroelectric power plants in Sakhalin and indications that people are becoming outraged by the rising prices.
Such regional issues will have an impact on the integrity of the Russian Federation.
In one of my predictions, I suggested that Russia would disintegrate into 19 smaller countries.
We also have tendencies towards a peaceful resolution of the war.
Different EU countries, including Germany and Hungary, are motivated to prevent significant military aggression in Ukraine as they rely on Russian energy resources.
This is expected to continue until the end of this year at most.
How to live without Russian gas
There are discussions in the Czech Republic regarding the potential cessation of gas supply.
It'll be an inconvenience since the Czech Republic almost entirely relies on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia has completely halted gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did it affect Polish citizens?
As an analyst, I made that prediction.
I just cut off the gas supply in my home in advance.
My family won't be adversely affected by the lack of this resource.
But there are a vast number of Polish families, millions of them, who will experience the impact of rising prices.
Citizens may not experience it in the first few months, but prices for all resources will certainly begin to rise.
Now they are exploring various opportunities for alternative sources of energy.
In addition, there are already several companies in Poland involved in the importation of liquefied gas, and there is a large port in Poland.
Regarding oil, it is worth noting that the Prime Minister of Hungary is cooperating with Putin.
Currently, there is a process underway where Hungarian companies are acquiring gas stations in Poland to utilize Russian oil.
These are indeed the sore subjects that involves geopolitical and international issues.
If Europe were to stop relying on Russian energy resources, Russia would have lost a source of financing for its troops.
Russia would just lose the ability to exist and would go bankrupt very quickly if it were to stop selling oil and gas, this is a well-known fact and easily understandable.
Ukraine in Polish media
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to the Polish media.
What is being said about it in the Polish media?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has significantly increased.
This growth is considered unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy expresses gratitude for the assistance and talks about the real things happening around; he is in a city within a war zone.
So politicians, analysts, and government representatives evaluate the President‚Äôs actions as highly active.
They highlight that the Ukrainian government is prioritizing the acquisition of military and financial aid to provide support for the refugees fleeing Ukraine.
In the media, these topics are being discussed in a highly positive context regarding the Ukrainian government.
There is no negativity, which sometimes occurs in the Ukrainian media regarding sabotage or regional issues.
We don't have that here.
And in my view, it is great because the image of Ukraine has significantly improved in terms of heroism, resilience, and the ability to fight the enemy.
It doesn‚Äôt wane or decline.
That's the most important thing, as the image remains unaffected.
The image of Ukraine indeed holds a strong position, and that is crucial.
Good morning.
I'm sorry for bothering you again with my problems.
I feel very uncomfortable and embarrassed about complaining to you.
Yesterday, we tried to reach a conclusion, but our efforts were in vain.
Even my mother-in-law's friend, who assisted in finding this apartment, became involved in the conflict.
She said that she wasn't looking for it for us, and if we're dissatisfied with anything, then it's us who should leave, and she will make sure that it's my mother-in-law, not us, who stays here to live.
Unfortunately, none of them appear to be considering the well-being of the child, who has grown accustomed to this place, considers it their home, and has already gone through six relocations in the past three months.
I'm really sorry, I couldn't even imagine that such a situation would occur
My apologies again for causing you any inconvenience.
Regarding the situation with the bed, it does seem rather peculiar.
My husband and I had discussed this matter before I wrote you that the bed is not needed.
He was coming here to be with me and the child, and he truly desires to sleep and wake up with his family.
However, my mother-in-law decided on her own that he would sleep in her room, completely disregarding his opinion and wishes.
I feel very embarrassed in front of you, your husband, Sharko and Yan, and the landlady.
You have tried so hard for us
Understood.
I thought that it would continue for a longer period of time.
Considering our situation and Andriy's treatment, do you think it would be possible to resolve this by the end of summer?
A medical certificate stating his illness may be necessary for Andriy.
In Ukraine, they would likely grant disability status with such a diagnosis.
And since Inna is not attending daycare yet, I don't have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside of the home
I understand, it would be great to go together with you tomorrow, then.
I will create a barcode for myself and Andriy
I'm concerned that they might cease providing humanitarian aid for him, and the treatment and rehabilitation could take a significant amount of time.
Can you advise me on anything?
I also wanted to ask if you have received the money for the medications that you purchased for Andriy?
The handle attachment is coming loose.
It is short, so it is necessary to be very careful and avoid losing it.
Today, only 2 portions were sold.
We ran out of apricot.
I poured some mango.
Mango doesn't go very well.
Most people wanted apricot.
Currently, people are preferring vanilla over mango as they don't like mango.
Great, mango is gaining popularity.
But it has started squeaking againüò≠
People have started actively buying ice cream, and it can't keep upüò≠
Tomorrow we will have blackcurrant
Today, we will definitely run out of mango, but blackcurr
I am all of a trembleüò≠
It's over-freezing again, and it's squeaking.
Hardness at 4.0.
As soon as people start actively buying, it completely stops dispensing the ice cream.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
As soon as a line forms for the ice cream, it starts producing these issues, and people move on.
Over-freezing.
If there is a shortage of one ice cream, it will squeak, and the piston will rub.
Vanilla cannot be poured into the mango.
Can Magdalena come at 8:00 tomorrow?
It is necessary to clean the ice cream.
Today, we ran out of ice cream, but we will have a different flavor tomorrow.

The Maidan is a place where people protest
Mykola Mikhnovsky recited the text of independent Ukraine for the first time in 1990
He was an ordinary man who fought for the independence of Ukraine
Leonid Kravchuk is the first president of an independent Ukraine
I believe there was a dictatorship because people had just emerged from Russia and couldn't fully understand whether they liked being an independent country or if they wanted to be an autonomous republic of Russia
when Ukraine became independent it was already Kyiv but during the Soviet Union it was Kharkiv from 1912 to 1934
I can't say that there were any other significant events but if there had been democracy from the beginning it would have been much better and perhaps now we would be part of the European Union
