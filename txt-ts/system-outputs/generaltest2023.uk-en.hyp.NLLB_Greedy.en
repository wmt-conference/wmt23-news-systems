Criteria for admission of children to preschool education do Kindergarten, Prague 8, U School garden 8 - for the academic year 2022/2023
The place of actual residence of the applicant, in the case of foreigners, is decisive for admission to pre-school education, in the corresponding school district of the Ministry of Education, at the time of applying for pre-school education in Kindergarten, Prague 8, in School kindergarten 8.
Another criterion is the age of the child.
Children are admitted in stages according to the criteria below until the capacity of the kindergarten is filled.
And if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names"...
Letter from the occupation.
I'm with you.
Natasha, we're holding on as best we can.
You can tell they're scared.
They're very scared.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat over and over again that they are big, that they are strong and that we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and our heads spin - how can you be scared, if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat that greatness.
How unsure of yourself.
It's like, you know, having sex with an impotent person, who has to be told over and over again that he's strong, that he's going to get it, for a long, long time, and he has to try and try and think about when this painful abuse is going to end.
We're doing this to save us all.
Because it's very difficult for an unarmed man to fight a brainless man with a machine gun.
Because then, when this evil is driven from our land, we'll have to clean up the city.
Whoever we're talking to right now, they all have the same words.
Word is the city smells of rot.
We're probably going to need a lot of detergent just to keep the pavement, the houses, and even the trees clean for a long time. Because everything these people touch smells like rot.
Yesterday, a woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were big.
Three healthy men stripped her naked and left her on the street, forbidding anyone to come near her to help her.
For three hours she stood naked in the street and only said out loud:
Do not come near me, my brothers.
Do not put yourself in danger.
Please!
We'll have a lot more to do with you...
Then!
And then some.
They steal.
They steal everything.
I can't even imagine that they don't steal.
We've never seen a theft on this scale.
From children's toys to a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because the city is always posting postcards.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We're waiting for the U.S.S.
And when they are near, the Hersonites will play with their filth with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they hurry.
We wait.
We wait.
We clench our teeth, clench our fists until we're numb in our fingers, and we wait.
Because we have something to look forward to.
Once and for all.
And none of that filth was left.
And then we'll clean up the city.
It's been a long time.
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine!
And if you can, pray for us, mentioning all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names"...
For obvious reasons, the author is not mentioned.
I need to communicate. I've lost a lot of things. I know that people don't want to communicate with people who are sour, but I still have hope.
How satisfied are you with your accommodation?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same profession as before you left Ukraine?
These and similar questions are now reflected by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in the framework of studies among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The findings will help you to understand their situation better and plan the most effective treatment.
The data collection is done through an online questionnaire.
Invitations to the survey (from invitation@click4survey.cz) are sent to all those who provided a functional email address when requesting humanitarian aid.
The questionnaire is filled in only once!
By filling in the questionnaire, you will be helping to map out the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!

"Mechanics of the Force"
We make electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics or modern medicine -- none of this would have happened without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues to join our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities to recent graduates as well as experienced professionals.
I want to say a few words about that.
A great desire to meet with the residents to discuss important, pressing issues, but the gathering is forbidden by law because the country is at war.
I would appreciate any advice and any help in my quest to do as much as I can for the residents.
Together we are a force.
Together we can overcome any adversity.
Together we will win.
So turn around.
I'll listen to all of you.
I would be immensely grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the terms of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all Ukrainian refugees who arrive are entitled to a first aid payment of 5000 kroner without any additional conditions (only a temporary protection visa is required).
To receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his/her financial situation is difficult  be considered unemployed, not to have property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labour decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è The first benefit payment will no longer be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily reusable food and sanitary facilities, he cannot claim a payment of 5,000 kroner.
The government will assume that basic aid has been provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene), meaning that the humanitarian aid is intended and no money is needed.
This event is intended to solve the problem of Roma refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic just for financial help.
2Ô∏è The right to receive second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth aid in cash will continue to be granted only to those refugees who can prove their immediate need (lack of work, etc.).
However, two other conditions must be met:
üìå as in the first paragraph, only those Ukrainians who were not provided with free housing, daily reusable food and hygiene equipment will be able to receive financial assistance;
üìå the applicant must actually reside in the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of 'tourism for help' where a refugee lives in one country and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days purely for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about a change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address on the application form does not match the address in the database of the Ministry of the Interior, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that he or she actually resides in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the aid will be refused.
To date, the Czech Republic has spent 2,626 billion crowns on humanitarian aid.
And I've been digging up defences all day, and the whole city is digging up, which is not a very good forecast for the near future.
I'm tired, to be honest, it's very difficult to organize this process
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, for this, someone has to organize the equipment and the people, and I am the mayor of the village, so this is my responsibility
We're reaching out to all the utilities, and we're reaching out to the farmers, and they have excavators and tractors.
We must band together, or we will never defeat the Katzapov.
A lot of propaganda to discourage people and weaken the opposition.
I haven't even picked up a shovel yet. I hope I don't have to.
I had the kids put girl stickers on my phone so I wouldn't forget I was a girl.
What happens if the bill passes?
Ô∏è A government commission will be formed from representatives of the President's Office, some ministries and business associations, which will expedite the review of the instruments of state regulation of economic activities.
Ô∏è The Commission and other executive bodies will review all permits for doing business in most areas by the end of the year.
And they'll suggest which of the permits or procedures need to be removed.
Ô∏è The Cabinet will remove all unnecessary permissions and procedures in the expedited mode.
No public discussion, just a backroom show!
Ô∏è It will not matter if the Cabinet's decision is contrary to the laws in force.
The public and MPs will lose the ability to influence the regulation of economic activities that can harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
Ô∏è Business regulation by the state will be done on the principle of one new license  minus two old ones.
Whether or not it makes any sense.
How does this affect the environment?
Ô∏è In the backstage mode, the Cabinet will be able to change any documents regarding permits or procedures in the field of environment.
The protection of forests, wildlife, waste management, environmental impact assessment, and more are at stake!
Ô∏è Neither the public nor the parliamentarians will influence the process.
We don't even know how or by whom the bylaws are being changed until the final decisions are made.
Ô∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the ability to influence  are business associations.
Bill 8058  is a direct threat to the environment.
The tight deadlines for reviewing permits, the opaque procedure, the lack of any decision-making criteria  this is a move somewhere east, not to the EU.
So we're calling on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the above
They said to her, "Grandma, the Russians are coming to the village; grab your cat and get in the van.
But I refused, so I, an old mare... Save the children and the girls, I'll be here in a moment... Grandma goes down to the cellar, chops cucumbers, unlocks the hut with a mortar, a lot of pots; there are doors... iron bars and silver locks.
And there's a chain-smashing at the door.
I didn't think I'd live to see the day.
Seventy-one years old and still a whip.
Go not thou with the goats, for the damned, thou shalt bring the goats to us.
The cat of the ladies hisses, the glass in the windows cracks.
Tanks are buzzing and moving between houses.
The Russians are coming into the village.
A dog with three heads emerges from its nest.
Good afternoon, go to the post office and confirm your identity through "check-in" then when you confirm you will be given a code, and this code you have to enter again in the online registration and you are ready.
It is necessary that the bank card is registered to the person who wants to receive financial assistance, otherwise it is not suitable.
I was doing so familiar too, it indicated that some key was needed, but when she resisted, she waited in the government there to tell her why she had come since she was already registered.
It also showed her, in this app, that it needed some kind of key, but actually it's already logged in without it
help me out and applied online again may 5th but something is not fashion understand whether to go to the government work or wait
It says you'll get your money back on your card after your application is processed, but it says your identity is not verified because of the banking system's error.
Good afternoon, dear Miss Angelino!
I want to express my point of view regarding the use of "in" / "on" in relation to the word "Ukraine".
The use of the term has become a serious political issue in recent decades.
Today's war of Russia against Ukraine has been prepared long and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy
Thank you for the interesting exercises and problems, the clear explanation of grammar, and the pleasant conversation.
Thank you for the technical support of the course, first of all, for the textbook that allowed us to understand what we could not learn in the lectures.
These three months laid the foundation for what we know.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful!
We wish all the creative team creative success, peace and happiness!
In his productions, he popularized world classics in Ukrainian, among them Lolita (V. Nabokov), Perfumer (P. Zuskind), Sin (M. Kotyubinski), The Letter of the Unknown and "Wild" by S. Zvejga, etc.
The works he performs are difficult to grasp, requiring the dedication of heart and soul.
The author deliberately brings the viewer to tears and deep emotions.
He believes that tears are a cleansing, a path to healing for modern man.
He has a number of awards.
In 2005 he received the title of "People's Artist of Ukraine", Laureate of the National Prize of Ukraine named after Taras Shevchenko (2007), but most of all Mr. Mikhail appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate him.
Those who appreciate Mr. Mikhail's talent hope that after the war they will hear him play the saxophone again, see his unparalleled ability to reincarnate, be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to the high art
Mineral resources of Ukraine
Minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic by origin.
So their location is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
The fossil fuels that are mined in our country include: coal, oil, natural gas, peat, and fuel shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully supplies its own needs in hard and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing acute shortages of oil and natural gas.
And the evidence is that unless we have a rational economy, there can be acute shortages of anything.
Peat in Ukraine was mined in Polissy long ago.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as a fuel only for local needs in rural areas, farms, glass, porcelain and faience, and food industries.
Peat also produces various chemicals, including acetone, phenols, paraffins, feedstocks, and yeasts.
Numerous deposits of combustible shale are found in the Cherkasy and Kirovograd regions.
The geography of the location of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are sedimentary in origin, so they enter the old and young platforms' shells, as well as the extreme foothills.
Coal is hard.
94.3% of our state's coal reserves are coal.
Ukrainian hard coal is distinguished by its high quality.
Because of its high carbon content, it has a high heat capacity.
Ukraine has deposits of the best variety of coal  anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of coal is coke.
After special treatment, it is used in the smelting of cast iron and steel.
By explored reserves of hard coal, Ukraine occupies the 8th place in the world and the 1st place in Europe, and by production  the 11th and 3rd place respectively.
Explored coal reserves in Ukraine amount to about 50 billion tons.
Estimated reserves are about 120 billion tons.
The Russians like to write "message" on the shells they drop on the peaceful Ukrainian cities.
Yes, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the Eurovision stage to save the soldiers trapped at "Azovstal" in Mariupol and the next day the Russians wrote "Kalush" on the shells, as you asked! #naAzovstal.
The missiles that the Russian military fired at the station in Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022, were written "For children".
Then 61 people were killed by shells with cynical writing, among them  7 children.
The tradition of writing on shells started in World War I.
During World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to their enemies.
This then helped the soldiers to maintain their fighting spirit while defending their homeland.
Today, the inscriptions left on the shells are Russian military,  a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
They use these missiles to kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine only because they don't like the political course of Ukraine.
Russia must be stopped so that such "messages" do not reach any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing met us with a relatively short line and welcoming Slovak border guards.
We're taking insulin, it needs to be in a temperature mode. It can't get warm.
Can I get through the control in fast-forward mode?
The border guard let us stand at the front of the line, and even the vans gave way.
Lviv and
The city of Leo lives.
It's like the aorta of the Ukrainian body  the endless flow of people.
People from all parts of the country have found refuge and security here.
Some go on to Europe, some return home, some stay.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at the checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the windows of the cathedrals that have been smashed with dictation.
She covers monuments and sculptures with white canvases.
But you don't hear the war in the Market Square, where thousands of voices are heard at once, you don't hear it in the cafes and bars where people continue to live.
Yes, life goes on before 11 p.m. Life is hidden from the curfew.
But it is: when we were sitting in the cafe at 9 p.m. and sounded the alarm, it was only heard from an alert on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Butch, Irpin
We made our way to Kiev through two of the many martyr cities - Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities, with the air of hope.
People go back and rebuild their lives in spite of the pain.
It's a private house.
The park is as it should be.
(Shotgun shells or automatic lines?)
On the shattered balcony  the Ukrainian flag is stretched.
There are holes near the front doors, so that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And there are three of them at the front door.
They clean, they tune, they build a wall, and with it, a new life.
And two blocks down the park, a mother and her baby are walking.
I can't help but wonder: Did their dad survive the shooting of the men in Butch?
Is he still going out with them?
On the way out of Irpen there is a car cemetery.
These are the same cars that civilians tried to get out in and were ruthlessly shot by the Russian occupiers.
The cemetery has already become a kind of "patriotic tourism".
If you go deep and stand around the car skeletons, you can smell a heavy smell.
That must be one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow air, it looks like it could be cut with a knife.
And it's been weeks since the passengers died...
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds of these same shots.
And in one of the cars, there's an abandoned bicycle, and in the other, there's a warm baby suit.
The safety-bag manual was missing.
Remnants of someone's daily stories and someone's lives.
As we drive on, I look back at the city for the last time, and I see the same bridge that scared civilians were hiding under.
This is the same bus that was knocked over, and right here on these broken tiles is a Ukrainian military nose of a child in white.
This kid in the white jumpsuit, he probably survived.
But is there any chance that the child who was wearing the clothes left in one of the cars is still alive?
A man sits on a broken bridge with a camera over his shoulder.
Just sitting there looking at the chasm between Kiev and Buche.
He doesn't take pictures, he just looks.
He might also imagine himself standing under a bridge, thinking, 'What's this?
Happy holidays! A man shouts to us joyfully. Happy city day!
On May 29, the military Kiev celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
The Mykolaiv
Hero city, outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A frontline city that the occupiers can't possibly take.
And let us hope that they will not take the city that fights and lives.
At street corners, at every other intersection, there are neatly folded together tires and Banderie strips.
The evening of St. Nicholas now incredibly quiet  noise, against the background of which lived the city, the verse.
No voices, no cars in the evenings.
And at night it is extremely dark.
Light cloaking for safety.
People live by candlelight, or more precisely, by cell phone lights.
At home, we turn on the kitchen light only  quickly and as needed.
Grandma had the windows covered with heavy blankets that prevented the light from passing through.
There's a shotgun by my sister's crib.
"Under the 24th hand", says the father.
When we hear an air alarm and an explosion, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in a frontline city, living in a state of constant anxiety is very difficult.
When to Live?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers from the city, shots from the peons fly to the October district, covering Kulbakina.
He's flown in close to my family a few times.
It's the next block, across the street from us.
The neighbors of the grandmother -- the windows of the grandmother were taken out, the children took them to their own, to a safer neighborhood.
And we're on the border of Ingle and Central districts.
Life goes on and on.
The siren is sounding in Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple are sitting on a bench, discussing something in a calm, quiet way.
A cyclist passes by.
We'll see you later. What are we gonna do?
So... how about a cup of coffee?
So we are sitting on Cathedral Street (formerly Soviet Street, by the way) in a small garden near the monument of St. Nicholas.
What else can we do?
To be honest, when the siren catches you off guard on the street, there's often nowhere to hide, no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I'm looking at the county government building, or rather, through it.
It's not just a hole in the building, it's a hole in the heart of every Nicholas.
On the lawn near the entrance lies a huge trident  once from the decorated ODA.
Now, the place where the trident was painted is empty of "nothing".
So is the ODA chairman's office and a dozen offices around it.
The rocket landed safely on Kim's desk.
War takes on a very different character when it's not in the news but under your feet.
I walk down the ODA corridors, and every time I step in, I hear glass crunching.
There are many documents scattered on the floor. Someone has filed requests and applications, but now it doesn't matter.
On the table of one of the surviving cabinets there is a powdered cosmetic.
There is a flower on the tablecloth.
They took her home, they transplanted her, even if she's alive.
We met a guard who was on duty on March 29th.
He survived.
Stomped, stitched,  points to the head.  Already at work.
Only journalists can access the ODA.
We're joined by a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
The photos, the live feed, the interviews.
Official figures show that 36 people were killed.
It is "September 11 in the Nikolay style", "a monument to the Russian measure", comments the press attache of the regional head.
Mykolaiv Oblast State Administration  is just one of the wounds on Mykolaev's body.
And those wounds won't heal soon.
Even if Denmark helps to rebuild the ODA, the Mykolaivs will always see a terrible emptiness in it.
Russia has started a new "gas war".
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of the hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced by more than a third the gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transport system.
In April, it completely stopped gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, and in May to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream pipeline.
Official Berlin expects Russia to cut off natural gas supplies through this route as early as July.
Russia used this blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians for two days.
Gas has always been for Russia not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in building healthy economic ties.
Her priority is to rebuild the USSR and punish the West.
The financing of the Russian economy is donating to World War III.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating their transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to diversify their gas and oil supplies rapidly.
But it will take time for the EU to become energy independent from Russian energy.
Meanwhile, the Putin regime is terrorizing Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and a lack of heating in the houses.
European countries, especially those dependent on Russian fuel supplies, may feel the shortfall.
But this crisis will spur a more conservative approach to natural resources and energy efficiency.
Europe will benefit from the elimination of Russian energy.
Because then Putin won't be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
The temporary discomfort is worth living through so that future generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia is burning the crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary shells that destroy mature crops of grain and oil crops.
In this way, Russia is contributing to the spread of world hunger.
The number of people in the world who suffer from food shortages may increase by more than 40 million because of the Russian war.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, the Russians steal already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, block maritime exports.
The destruction of Ukraine's agricultural potential is yet another manifestation of the Russian military aggression.
So Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it can't continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
Mincifer is launching an innovative hotline format  virtual Action.Business center.
Forced migrants from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registering their own residence, registering a business, getting a job and receiving benefits.
So a virtual center is being launched, Dia.Business, to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format until Ukrainians can return home.
How dreadful it is to be afraid of every important day, and how you never know the day or the minute that may come
Hello, Anna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician again and ask when Darusya can come for her next vaccination?
It's supposed to be tomorrow, but I can't make it because I have to change the battery in the car, and it'll be here by the end of the week.
A neighbor brought in a cable, and we charged from Marina's car.
But the dashboard says you need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia is supposed to bring it from Ukraine, and here I have to replace it
I'll try to get the car started tomorrow, if it works, we'll go alone, I'll leave Grandma in the car and I won't turn off the engine.
If I don't, I'll write to you and you'll come for us.
I'm very uncomfortable disturbing you, distracting you from your work.
All right, we'll go with you at 11:45 to avoid any risk.
"The war is not over, and the fates of our new neighbors are also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escaping to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure they embark on together to get them into the rushed-out trucks.
Stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all the adults who still don't quite understand why their parents stayed home.
The stories of children whose only memory of home is a toy they could cling to during the many hours spent in crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, emphasize the organizers.
At the end of each trip, return to the safe house.
But this trip is different, scarier.
The trip did not end even after more than eight months.
Homecoming is anticipated.
The theme of war is everywhere, so our walk may seem unnecessary.
On the contrary, in a climate of growing antipathy and hostility in society, fueled and exploited by the Narodniks, we want to point out that the Intuitive Travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in poetic form and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
They are now part of it".
Despite the painful theme, the parade was still made bright and hopeful.
The craftsmen and craftswomen, along with children and adults, have contributed to the costumes and masks of giant toys, sunflowers, dolls, houses, and amazing, glowing birds.
The parade ran from Kamp to Vaclavak, and at each stop there was a huge performance, the dramaturgy of which was developed by the Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important to me to keep the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians are facing now", says the playwright. "So the structure of the performance reflects normal life that is interrupted by an air attack.
The first to come to the rescue are the glowing birds - they cover their wings first, the babies.
And after the recent massive missile attack, this symbol of protective wings becomes even more relevant.
The children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song is spreading by the column.
And all the creatures came back to life: sunflowers, and motorcycles, and toys, and even houses.
It's such a symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and to every Czech who has helped and is helping Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we can make this journey safe and secure".
The wife sends her husband to the market to buy some cosmetic oils for skin care.
On the way, a man meets friends and gets drunk for three days, often without coming home.
Finally, on the third day, she remembers the snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
He thinks he's going to tell his wife why he's been gone so long.
He rings the doorbell, he spills the snails on the floor, his wife opens the door, he raises his hands and says,
Oh, here we are!

Our editorial team spoke with Marina, a Ukrainian refugee who worked in the field of architecture in her native Nikopol.
"I'm trying to make a living as an artist", the Ukrainian woman said.
Anxiety, insecurity, fear, worrying about your family.
Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, is puzzled about adjusting to the new circumstances she and her children are facing.
But the woman believes in her strength and tries to adapt to life in Prague, not giving up the idea of returning to Ukraine.
From Nicopolis to Prague
Marina is from Nikopol, in the Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and had two children - a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect in the State Nikopol institution.
I am an architect by training, graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Before that, she studied at an art school, graduated from high school with a specialty in "artist-design", Marina said.
And everything was fine, but on February 24th, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina and her children left Ukraine without hesitation.
Prague became a refuge for women.
Of course, a new city, big, crowded... New language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so much of what the Czechs say to me, I understand.
Knowing English and sign language also helped me.
I am not ashamed to ask the Czechs for help, and I have never felt any aggression from them.
"I thank them for this", shared Marina.
She says that she has been helped by people who have lived in Prague for a long time to find housing, apply for visas and insurance, and apply for benefits.
But she has to deal with many of her problems on her own.
Lack of space in the garden
After obtaining a temporary residence permit, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
Of course I want to find a job in a professional field.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they divorce me with their hands...,  she said.
We were not allowed into the nursery because there was no room.
They say we need to find some kind of support groups for children, but no one knows exactly where they are.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She tried to help me find a place in kindergarten by calling a number of different agencies, but..., continues Marina.
In general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, they have difficulty adapting to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient.
I can't say that the children bother me, but if they went to kindergarten, I could attend Czech language classes without any problems.
One day I took my kids to a Czech class, and they played a little, and then they started acting up.
I was distracted, like a normal mother, I couldn't study normally... If only there were language courses for adults with children or with little ones someone was there during the study... But my daughter is so attached to me", the woman sighs.
Of course, we go with the children to various free events that are created especially for refugees from Ukraine, for which the Czech Republic is very grateful, added Marina.
While the children are sleeping, Marina is self-educating, learning Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
One day Marina was looking for vacancies on the Internet and saw an ad: As part of the initiative of the Association Spolek Zaedno with the support of the EC Representation in the Czech Republic 12 stars for Ukraine we are organizing a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We're looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.
All that is required of the participants is creative imagination...
Marina could not help but take advantage of this opportunity.
I took courage and applied.
We invited all who wanted to attend to a meeting where we spent the day painting.
I was worried about my sleep.
"I hadn't touched a brush in six years", the Ukrainian woman said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas of 80 x 60 cm were created, among which 12 paintings  works of Ukrainian artists.
The subject of the paintings was free, but we still agreed to use Ukrainian themes in our works  as the basis of the palette we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag.
Therefore, the collection of paintings is dominated by blue-yellow colors", Marina added.
The event had 30 applicants, of which only 12 were selected.
Marina was among them.
On 1 June, an exhibition of their paintings will be held in Prague, supported by the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic.
That's the way it is.
All your knowledge and skills can be used, and also support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic, "said Marina.
And now I'm trying to make it as an artist.
Every step is a battle with your fears and yourself.
But something has to be done...,  said the woman.
Marina thanks the Czech Republic for their hospitality and warmth, but she believes that the war will soon be over and she and her children will return to Ukraine.
The fighting continues in southern Ukraine.
Residents of temporarily occupied and frontline settlements continue to leave for safer areas.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will take a long time to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia started.
However, instead of waiting for better times, Ukrainians have already begun to clean up their cities and villages of Russian garbage by rebuilding infrastructure.
Kiev took the blow in the first days of the full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital and capture it in a few days.
These towns and villages have experienced active fighting, atrocities of the Russian army, and occasional occupation.
In early April, the U.S.S.R. completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksandr Khomenko has collected photos from Kiev and the region taken immediately after the active fighting and weeks afterwards to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public spaces.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly capture Ukraine, Russia began a new phase of this war  information.
The Russian Federation is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce the support of Ukraine from the international community.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces of Ukraine to fight the aggressor, and thus become accomplices in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization in its report noted that the Ukrainian military is setting up positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure facilities.
It ignored the fact that these are only facilities from which the civilian population has been completely evacuated.
Do not be subjected to information attacks by the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia has invaded Ukraine, invaded its territory, killed and tortured civilians, destroyed towns and villages.
Russia is guilty of war, it has no right to any action on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and to drive the enemy out of the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine stand up to Russia on all fronts!
I'm sure that every person in the world has dreamed of their own perfect home at some point.
Believe it or not, I'm no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.
It would be right on the beach and have a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I'm sure I'll be happy to live in the heart of a picturesque landscape.
My house would be a two-story cottage with a beautiful exotic garden in front of the house, and there would be many different flowers and fruit trees.
I'll also have a garage for my car.
I can drive to work, to the shops, or just to travel with my family, wherever our eyes take us.
My ideal home would have at least six rooms: a bright and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, a study with a work area, and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will be large, comfortable beds with nightstands and chest of drawers.
There will be many interesting books in the office in the bookcases.
The living room would become the most frequented place in the house, where the whole family could gather together, share news or simply have fun.
That's why there would be a big sofa with little pillows, a few chairs, a dresser, a huge TV and a long built-in fish tank.
And also, my ideal home would have an attic where we could have a home theater or a rec room.
Behind my house would be a pool with several hammocks.
We'll also have a sports center where we can do daily exercise to keep fit or just do different team sports like volleyball, basketball, soccer, etc.
My ideal home would be large and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I would love to live in it.
But it's just my dream... I have to make it come true.
Hi, how many men do you need to have so I know which room to cook? Is she alone?
I sent the letters to your secretary.
Yeah, of course, I'm asking a bunch of them to know where to move them.
Right, you tell me right now what I know.
To clean up the room
Tell me how to send a link to Ukraine. Bride number six is about to give birth and probably needs our help. She's alone now.
The food, the diapers.
It's just that I'm going to bed on June 6th.
I was only released from the maternity home for ten days.
I didn't have time to buy everything for the baby.
There's no beds yet, sweetheart.
So they have to know I hope you find the main do not panic because now I do not know what to do ready to go and do the search myself but I will not let you into Donetsk there now heavy fighting and I do not know how to go with the search is difficult
So the last words I heard from him were that I'm a worker and well that I took my sisters and brothers that they're safe
I have to keep the kids that's what keeps me they're my hope and my support apart from them nothing for me they're all I'm happy that they have me
I'm all numb, I don't feel anything. It's okay, I can walk with me. It's never been like this.
So thank you I can't go out there today other times need to calm down and gather with the thoughts of the mind a lot

How Ukrainian and Russian football teams fought in Turkey

The Minay FC claim that this is a fresh photo from the last training after the fight with the Russians
In Antalya, Turkey, a conflict broke out between the players of the Ukrainian football club Minaya from the Premier League and the Russian "Shinnik" at a meeting.
The parties confirmed that the fight took place on the grounds of a local hotel, where both teams had accidentally taken up residence.
The conflict, which took place on February 13, was first reported by Ukrainian and Russian media.
The fight was later confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of the Minsk Football Club, the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
Apparently, one of them was drunk and was clinging to a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
"The fight did take place, but on the floor where the Russians were stationed, and in equal numbers.
The number of casualties on the Shinik side only confirms the fact that the Russians are still "throwing" their own, the statement said.
The club claims that after the fight ended, the Russians continued to fight among themselves, and the local police had to intervene.
"Before the start of the meeting, the main requirement of FC "Minai" to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to host the "Shinnik", - the statement says.
Football journalist Roman Bebek, who was one of the first to tweet about the situation, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player defending a co-worker.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that the Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Baza Telegram channel writes that representatives of "Miny" approached the players of the Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians denied this.
"The numerical advantage was on their side.
A couple of people attacked our boy.
The Yaroslavs defended him and defended.
We had five or six people, the Ukrainians were much more", a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
"The Yaroslavl players were examined by a doctor, and among the injuries were a severed lip, a broken toe and a suspected rib injury", says Kommersant.
"I don't understand how the Ukrainians could come from the hotel, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine", - was outraged the general director of "Shinnik" Serhiy Kulakov in a comment to journalists.
Kulakov later told the Russian agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but stressed that they were not being evicted, they had decided to leave themselves.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian are losing weight.
And what's the point of diabetes medicine?
7 minutes ago
Increasingly popular injections can help you lose up to 15 percent of your body weight, but they have many side effects.
In the UK, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy weight loss injections, which have been used by some celebrities, notably Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps manage obesity in type 2 diabetes.
It has been acknowledged by Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have large social media following.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other treatments for type 2 diabetes may indeed help with weight loss.
By affecting specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, you feel less hungry, eat more quickly, and consume fewer calories.
However, experts warn that these are not quick fixes or miracle cures that help you lose weight effortlessly.
Treatment is supervised by a specialist and is supplemented by diet and exercise.
Like all medicines, Wegovy can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Among the most common are nausea or stomach upset, bloating, and gas.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to loss of facial fat and, in some people, to the loss of cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
Doctors have dubbed this effect "Olympix's face", after another diabetes drug that is also used to help people lose weight.
Doctors recommend that Wegovy be taken for no more than two years.
The U.S.S.R. has regained some of the positions it lost.

In some areas of the front, the Soviet Union managed to regain previously lost positions and consolidate there.
This was stated by the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny during a conversation with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhny, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk direction, where the Russians carry out up to 50 attacks every day.
Heavy fighting continues in the area of Vuhledara and Mar'inka, where according to Zaluzhny, the FSA is firmly on the defense.
"Despite the constant pressure of the enemy, we continue to hold Bahmut and take measures to stabilize the front line around this city", Zaluzhny said.
In a conversation with General Milli Zaluzhny shared his concern about Russia's use of maritime drones, which pose a threat to civilian navigation in the Black Sea.
Russian forces continue to tighten the ring around Bakhmut after capturing Soledar.
Now this city is the main target of the Russian army.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Defense, Sergei Shoigu, said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut was "developing successfully" for his troops.
On February 11, the evening meeting of the General Staff reported that Russia was strengthening its troop buildup in the Limansk and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and the night of February 11, the Russians attacked Ukraine's critical infrastructure in several regions.
As reported in the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from 6:00 pm on Friday and until midnight Ukrainian air defense units destroyed two dozen "Shaheds" that the Russians launched from the eastern coast of the Azov Sea.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile strike against Ukraine.
The result is destruction in the capital and many regions.
More than 11,000 people have died.
The death toll from the devastating earthquake in Turkey and Syria continues to rise.
As of noon Wednesday, February 8, 8, the death toll in Turkey was 8,574, with more than 49,000 injured.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made the announcement during a visit to one of the worst-hit cities, Kahramanmara≈ü, dpa reports.
According to figures released by the Syrian government and rescue groups in areas not controlled by the government, at least 2,662 people have died in the country.
Thus, the total number of earthquake victims has exceeded 11,000.
Rescuers continue to search for survivors beneath the rubble.

Turkey Is Working to Eliminate the Disaster
During a tour of the affected city, Erdogan stressed that his country is doing everything possible to eliminate the effects of the natural disaster, Anadolu reports.
According to him, more than 6,400 buildings were destroyed in total.
A number of hotels in Mersin and Antalya have agreed to provide shelter for the victims.
"Our citizens need not worry.
We will never allow them to be left without shelter", the president said.
Erdogan also promised that each affected family would receive 10,000 Turkish liras (about $500) and that "mass resettlement operations" would be launched in the 10 affected provinces within a year.
A state of emergency was declared in these provinces the day before for a period of three months.

EU toughen sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
The European Union is introducing new sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of an extraordinary EU summit.
Scholz pledged that the EU would support Ukraine "as long as it is necessary".
The chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kiev with the largest financial support.
"We are also far ahead of continental Europe in the supply of arms and ammunition", he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized "public tenders under the slogan: tanks, submarines, planes - who will demand more".
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda stand to gain from such discussions and disagreements.
Scholz: Putin used NATO as an excuse for long-planned "enlargement" of Russia
NATO must not become one of the parties to the conflict
In addition, the German chancellor reiterated that, despite all the assistance provided to Ukraine, the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO) should not become one of the parties in a military conflict with Russia.
He also promised to continue to coordinate closely with partners in arms supplies to Kiev.
Scholz recalled the promise he made to Ukraine at the EU summit in June 2022 to support Ukraine on its path to European integration.
At the upcoming extraordinary summit, EU countries intend to confirm their commitment to Ukraine's European path, he stressed.
Ukraine belongs to Europe, and its future is in the European Union, the chancellor added.
The extraordinary summit of the European Union will take place on February 9-10 in Brussels.
One of the main topics will be Russia's war against Ukraine.
According to Reuters, the summit of EU leaders will be attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Metzola called for Kiev to be given fighter jets and long-range weapons - DW - 09.02.2023
European Parliament President Roberta Metzola called for Ukraine to be given aircraft and long-range weapons during a meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke.
"EU member states should quickly consider, as a next step, providing the long-range systems and fighters you need to defend the freedom that many take for granted", Ms. Metzola said.
She said the response should be commensurate with the threat, which is very serious.
"Ukraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union", she said, addressing Zelensky.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
Zelensky, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on the path to EU membership.
"We are approaching the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
Ukraine, which is winning, is a member of the European Union, which is winning", Zelensky said in his speech to the European Parliament.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself against "the greatest anti-European force in the modern world".
"The Ukrainian European way of life is being destroyed by a total war.
But for what?
To destroy the European way of life after the Ukrainian European way of life.
For each of the 27 elements of the European way of life, the 27 countries of the European Union.
We will not allow this", the President of Ukraine stressed.
Zelensky will ask for an expedited arms shipment.
On the eve of the meeting, DW reported that Zelensky arrived in Brussels to seek support from the European Council and to speed up the delivery of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As a source from Zelensky's advanced diplomatic team reminded the publication, during Zelensky's visit to the US at the end of December last year, Kiev received "an agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support voted for by Congress".
"So the president of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally goes to other capitals", the source said.
The diplomat noted that, "of course, such decisions are not the business of the Eurogroup, but the decision of the member states".
Zelensky is expected to make Ukraine's arms needs known at the Euro Council summit and will speak personally with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member states.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine needs primarily long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia has launched a major offensive in Luhansk. - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of Warfare ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatovo-Kremlin line in the west of the region has increased significantly over the past week, analysts report on February 8.
It also notes that geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvoretskyi northwest of Svatovo.
The USSR is preventing Russia from achieving significant successes
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces are not yet allowing Russian troops to make significant progress.
ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full momentum, the Russian command has not yet activated parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was moved to the Luhansk region in January after deployment in Belarus.
"Although Russian forces in the Luhansk region now have the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces are setting the conditions for the battle, ending the period of the Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final culmination on the Svatovo-Kremlin line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions", the report says.
Analysts predict that this culmination could likely create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces that they could use for their own counter-offensive.
At the same time, in the morning briefing, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Russian troops, trying to take full control of Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on offensive actions in five directions: Kupyan, Liman, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novo-Pavel in the areas of Kreminnoye, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opitnoye, Marynka and Vuhydrat.

On the eve of the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Alexey Danilov suggested that the new Russian offensive, which is predicted in February, may take place not only in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, but also in other directions.
"There will certainly be attempts to attack both the Kharkiv and the Zaporizhia directions", he told Reuters.
"How successful they are is up to us".

SpaceX has restricted the ability of the U.S.S.R. to control drones via Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
Advisor to the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mikhail Podolyak on Thursday, February 9, called on the American company SpaceX to determine whether it supports Kiev in the war unleashed by Russia.
Thus, he reacted to information that Elon Musk's company has restricted the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
"Companies have to decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to free life and Ukraine - and then they don't figure out how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its 'right' to kill, seize territories", Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink is not supposed to be a weapon.
Earlier, SpaceX Chief Operating Officer Gwynne Shotwell said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army is actively using in countering Russian aggression, "was never intended to be used as a weapon".
"However, the Ukrainians are using it in an unpredictable way that is not part of any agreement.
We know the military uses it for communication, and that's okay.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes", the director was quoted as saying by Reuters.
Specifically, commenting on the Ukrainian Armed Forces' use of Starlink to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could "limit their ability to do that".
"There are things we can do, and we have done", she added.
The company declined to say what measures it had taken.
SpaceX "traded" with the US Defense Department for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX gave Kiev Starlink systems for free to provide the population with Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX informed the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over the matter.
At the time, it estimated the funding needed by the end of 2022 to be $120 million, and for the next 12 months to be approximately $400 million.
The issue of providing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, and in the European Union, however, soon after, the company's owner Musk said that SpaceX had withdrawn its request to the US Department of Defense to bear the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany are developing like a wave - DW - 09.02.2023
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that relations between Berlin and Kiev against the backdrop of Russian aggression are developing "wavy" - they have "ups and downs".
He made this point in an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegel published on Thursday, February 9.
"I'm a fast person by nature.
Others act more slowly, which may also be related to their bureaucracy", Zelensky noted, adding that in war conditions Ukraine does not have weeks and months, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every minute.
Revival with the PTO
The President of Ukraine noted that at a certain stage the "conservative attitude" of Germany changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
"Then I finally got support from Steinmeier (German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I had previously had difficulties, especially - because of the so-called "Steinmeier formula", - said Zelensky.
He stressed that "good work" had been done to change the relationship.
"We have received the IRIS-T air defense system, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives", the President of Ukraine noted.
According to Zelensky, Berlin has managed to increase the rate of production of these systems.
Germany previously promised to deliver three more IRIS-T systems to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate over the supply of Leopard combat tanks to Kiev has returned relations with Germany "to a difficult phase", the President of Ukraine noted.
He called the discussions "emotional and complex".
"I have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is not needed by us, but by Europeans", Zelensky explained.
Categorical with regard to fighters
After the Allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kiev with battle tanks, discussions began on the transfer of fighters, which Ukraine insists on.
Scholz took a firm stand: Germany would not, under any circumstances, hand over the warplanes.
Meanwhile, the chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kiev "as long as it is necessary".
He made the same statements after meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of European Union leaders on Thursday.
Leopard 2 tanks for the USSR: why they are so important
The new prime minister has been proposed.
The Moldovan government along with Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilitsa resigned.
The decision was made after consultations with President Maya Sandu, Gavrilitsa said on Friday, February 10.
"After a year and a half of government service, it is time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, the fight against corruption and integration into the European Union", she said.
She said that during her tenure, the government "had to deal with energy blackmail".
"They thought we would surrender and act like previous governments that betrayed the national interests, but this was not the case. We worked in a mode of continuous crisis", Gavrilitsa stressed.
She did not specify the reasons for her decision to resign, citing only a lack of "support and trust at home".
Sandu thanked the prime minister "for the enormous sacrifice and effort", also noting that Gavrilitsa led the government during a period of crisis.
"Despite unprecedented challenges, the country was run responsibly, with great care and dedication.
We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted wars and bankruptcies", the Moldovan president said.

The new Prime Minister could be the Secretary of the Council of Security
According to the law, the cabinet of ministers will continue to perform its duties until the new government is sworn in.
Sandu has already proposed her security adviser, the current secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and former interior minister Dorina Rechana, as a replacement.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, in which the Action and Solidarity party has a majority.
Gavrilitsa was its spokesperson, so voting for Rechan should not be a problem, AFP notes.
Recan has already stated that he plans to continue to pursue Moldova's membership in the European Union.
He said the new government's priorities would be "order and discipline, breathing new life into the economy, and peace and stability", Reuters reported.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.
The country has twice experienced a nationwide blackout due to Russian strikes on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly restricted gas supplies to Moldova and has repeatedly threatened to cut them off completely.
Chisinau called the reduction in supply a political decision unrelated to payment issues.

Ukraine to receive $60 million to boost cybersecurity - DW - 11.02.2023
USAID is allocating $60 million to strengthen Ukraine's cybersecurity, which will help protect critical infrastructure from Russian cyberattacks.
This was announced at the end of a meeting on Friday, February 10, between Minister of Digital Transformation Mikhail Fedorov and Deputy Chairman of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Isobel Coleman.
As noted in a corresponding message on the Ukrainian government website, the USAID money will be used to protect against cyberattacks, in particular, energy, telecommunications and data storage systems.

Thanks to USAID's support in the framework of cooperation in the field of cybersecurity, Ukraine launched the Dia application and portal ("The State and I" - Ed.) in 2020, as well as the Registry of Damaged Property and a number of anti-corruption projects.
As Fedorov noted in Telegram, USAID's support for cooperation with minidigi in Ukraine also operates "dozens of the most popular services that you get in a few clicks".

What are the dangers of aftershocks?
Despite the fact that the region is experiencing freezing temperatures, and the hope of rescuing people is diminishing, rescue efforts continue.
A family of six was rescued from the rubble 102 hours after the earthquake struck southern Turkey, reports the state-run Anadolu news agency.
A total of 166,000 Turkish and foreign rescuers, police, medical personnel and volunteers are involved in the rescue efforts.
Of these, more than 8,000 are rescue workers from 61 countries.
A total of 97 countries sent aid to Turkey, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
White Helmets in Syria criticize the UN for not providing aid
The United Nations estimates that some 5.4 million people were left homeless by the earthquake.

In Turkey, nearly 171,000 tents were torn down in the region that was hit by the earthquake.
Officials say that over one and a half million blankets were delivered to the scene of the disaster.
Meanwhile, in Syria, the White Helmets, an NGO carrying out rescue missions in rebel-held areas, complain of a lack of support.
On February 10, a White Helmets representative said that only two small international volunteer teams had arrived in the region to provide assistance, and that they did not have any rescue equipment.
In addition, he said, there is no humanitarian aid from the UN coming to the region.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which reports from London on the rebel-held northern regions of Syria, noted that one UN aid shipment had arrived in the region the day before, but lacked tents for shelter and equipment to clear debris.
Some 3,000 White Helmets volunteers are involved in rescue operations in northern Syria.
According to them, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people have been found, and more than 3,300 people are believed to have died.
More than 10,000 were injured.
The strongest earthquake since 1939
Early on February 6, a powerful earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria.
This earthquake was the strongest in almost a century of observations.
The last earthquake of this magnitude to hit Turkey was in 1939, when some 33,000 people were killed.
In less than 12 hours, a second powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.5 struck southeastern Turkey, and it was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

Cyprus is in the final round of the presidential election - DW - 12.02.2023
The Republic of Cyprus will hold the second and decisive round of the presidential election on Sunday, February 12.
It was attended by the country's former foreign minister Nikos Christodulides and Cyprus' former permanent representative to the UN Andreas Mavrouianis.
Conservative politician Christodulidis won 32 percent of the vote in the first round, while his opponent in the second round, Mavrouiannis, who is supported by the leftist forces, won 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling Democratic Union (DISY) party, Averof Neofit.
DISY party after losing its candidate in the first round could not decide who to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, AFP reports.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal suffrage.
He forms and heads the government of the country.
The winner of the current election will hold the office of head of state for five years and will become the eighth President of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided in two in 1974 following a coup d'√©tat backed by the Greek junta and a subsequent intervention by the Turkish army.
In 1983, the Turkish-occupied northern sector of the island declared itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which is recognized only by Ankara.
The last negotiations on the attempted reunification of Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots - about 560,000 people - participate in the elections.
The residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote for them.

Energoatom has announced a new threat to the nuclear power plant.
The president of Energoatom Petro Kotin called the reduction of water in the Kakhov reservoir by the Russians a new threat to the Zaporizhia Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).
"There are many threats to the nuclear power plant.
The decline of water in the Kakhov reservoir is a new added threat", Kotin said during a briefing at one of the power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the reservoir level was 13.8 meters (43 feet) above the normal level of 16 meters (52 feet), "so that the station could receive power for its generators, for the turbine capacitors and for the safety systems".
"In recent days we see that the level has stabilized and is rising a little, because it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m", quotes Kotin "Interfax-Ukraine".
He explained that the Russians who control the locks at the Kakhovskaya Hydropower Plant had started to discharge less water, while the flows up the Dnieper had increased.
The president of Energoatom specified that under such conditions the cooling station at the ZAES is sufficiently filled and there is enough water for now, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, this, according to him, "will be a big problem for the ZAES".
Cotin stressed that the critical level would be 40 feet [12 m], the emergency level 40 feet [12.8 m], and expressed hope that the international community, with the help of the International Atomic Energy Agency, would prevent a crisis.

As reminded by "Interfax-Ukraine", the State Regulatory Authority by order of February 10, 2023 prohibited the operation of power units No. 3, 4, 5, 6 of Zaporizhzhya NPP at energy levels of capacity due to the impossibility of eliminating the identified violations of nuclear and radiation safety requirements.

During Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 4 March 2022, the ZAES was captured by Russian troops.
Since then, the station continues to be serviced by Ukrainian personnel under the control of the Russian Federation.
The area around the plant is also being shelled, causing damage to the nuclear power plant buildings.
The Russian and Ukrainian sides blame each other for this, there are no independent data on who is firing at the ZAES.
Israel will step up its campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to step up its campaign against Palestinian militants in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday.
"Today the government is coming together to prepare for an even greater counteraction against those who commit terrorism", Netanyahu was quoted as saying by Reuters.
This statement followed a deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian man drove into a crowd at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including a boy aged six and an eight-year-old.
According to media reports, the attacker was released from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
The police shot the man dead at the scene and arrested and interrogated the Palestinian's family members.
Israeli law enforcement officers locked the doors and windows of the Palestinian family's home.
The next step after sealing may be to demolish the attacker's home, reports the AP.
Just a day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot dead during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired a missile toward the Israeli border on Saturday night.
The Israeli military said the missile was intercepted, dpa reports.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army conducts almost daily raids in the West Bank, which has led to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of the year, 45 Palestinians have been reported killed in these or their own attacks.
In addition, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman were killed in Palestinian attacks in 2023.
According to human rights activists, in 2022, about 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, making it the deadliest year in these territories since 2004.
Meanwhile, 30 people have been killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the past year, according to the AP.
Israel took the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600,000 Israeli settlers live there, reports dpa.

Greek Foreign Minister visits Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - longtime opponents, writes Sunday, February 12, dpa.
On the same day, the foreign ministers of the two states, Nikos Dendias and Mevlut Cavusoglu, held an unexpected meeting, which was captured by Greek television cameras, where they even embraced.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
Cavusoglu thanked Dendias for making Greece one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the disaster.
He added that both states would try to resume dialogue and resolve their problems.
"Greece's assistance to the Turkish people does not end there", the Greek foreign minister stressed.
According to him, Athens will "do everything" - bilaterally as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit a disaster area.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the Antakya and Hatay region.
A new beginning in bilateral relations?
For several days, political commentators and columnists in the Greek press have expressed the hope that the assistance provided by Athens to Ankara could be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members have already shown solidarity with each other during the strong earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This aid, known as "earthquake diplomacy", helped to bring about a measure of calm.
Conflict over the islands
Athens and Ankara have been fighting for sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and eastern Mediterranean for decades.
Ankara has challenged Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean Sea - Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos, and Kos.
Greece is allegedly violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the deployment of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous amphibious ships on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
See also: Are Greece and Turkey on the verge of armed conflict?
Turkey is increasing its claims by flying fighter jets over the Greek islands on a daily basis.
And in recent months, the country's leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Warming of Ankara and Armenia
The tragedy of the earthquakes has also seen a warming of Turkey's relations with Armenia.
Ankara has opened a crossing that has been closed for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia have passed for the victims of the disaster.
In addition, Armenia reported sending two rescue brigades to Turkey and Syria after the February 6 earthquake that killed more than 33,000 people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are strained for historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic killings in the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
As the legal successor to the Ottoman Empire, Turkey acknowledges that it has exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide has been condemned by the United States, Germany, and France, among others.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
The situation was further complicated by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan.

NATO is discussing further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers has begun in Brussels, with a meeting in the so-called "Rammstein" format on Tuesday, February 14.
The agenda is to further build support for Ukraine in the war and increase the pace of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told the meeting that NATO must provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs "to win this war".
"We see no signs that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensive actions and new attacks", he was quoted as saying by Reuters.
"This is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics", added Stoltenberg, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations over the possible provision of fighter jets to Ukraine.

It is expected that at the meeting, ministers will adopt long-term policy recommendations for Alliance defense planning.
"Allies will discuss investing in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure", Interfax-Ukraine quotes Stoltenberg as saying.
What to Expect from the Ninth "Ramstein"
On the same day, the US-led Contact Group meets at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, with the participation of Ukraine's Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov.
The head of the Ukrainian defense ministry will also join a special session of the NATO defense ministers' meeting.
"More than 50 countries in the Contact Group stand with you in this fight for Ukraine's sovereignty and self-defense", Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership had previously expressed hope that at the next Ramstein meeting, the partners could decide on the provision of Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kiev also expects that the Allies will announce the exact number and timing of the delivery of tanks to Ukraine as a result of this meeting.

Ukraine wants to ban Russian artists from touring the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine is collecting data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine, or work in institutions and organizations funded by the Russian state budget, in order to include them in the new EU sanctions package.
This was reported in an interview with DW by the Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Galina Grigorenko.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
As Grigorenko pointed out, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
"Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum very clearly says that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation", says Grigorenko.
She believes that cultural dialogue with Russia is impossible.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
So, recently the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a trusted person of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called "DPR" in the Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deny Russian artists the opportunity to tour
However, Grigorenko believes that this is not enough and those representatives of Russian culture who support Putin's policy still manage to tour Europe.
"To officially cancel such tours, you need to have names on European sanctions lists", Grigorenko says, adding: "We are working to make Russian cultural figures who promote Russian narratives outside Russia part of the next sanctions package.
This will allow the EU to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts".
According to Grigorenko, this issue in Ukraine is dealt with by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group at the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As previously reported, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9 noted that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at the summit in Kiev.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of Russian cultural and media figures, which contains more than 300 names.

The United States is ready to sell Poland HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment for 10 billion dollars
The U.S. State Department has approved a possible sale of military equipment and services to Poland worth about $10 billion.
This was reported by VOA correspondent Jeff Seldin, citing the Pentagon's Defense Cooperation Agency (DSCA).
These are primarily the launchers of the M142 HIMARS high-mobility artillery missile system with ammunition to them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
"Such acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member that is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe", the Agency said in a statement.
According to a Pentagon statement, Poland intends to use the acquired equipment "to modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen internal defense and deter regional threats".
In total, Poland applied for the purchase of such equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of the HIMARS loading device module;
- 45 military tactical missile systems M57 (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of the GMLRS guided missile system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
Also included in the deal are missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, training and equipment for personnel, support for system integration, engineering and logistics services for the U.S. government and contractors, training, sensors, other related hardware and software.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is in addition to launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019 that have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw also invited missile systems from South Korea, the newspaper reports.
NATO Secretary General urges the US to be prepared for a long war of the Russian Federation in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighter jets to Ukraine to protect in the war against the Russian Federation is not off the agenda, said British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"The first step in providing advanced aircraft is having soldiers or airmen who are able to use them.
It's a process that takes some time.
We started this process today", Sunak said about the previously announced program of training Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
- Nothing is off the agenda, and our leadership on this issue is something we should all be proud of".
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks would arrive in Ukraine as early as "next month" and stated that Ukraine "should never again be left vulnerable to attack", and also called for "arming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term".
He said Britain had agreed to expand its training programme, which has trained 10,000 troops in the past six months, and promised, as CNN reports, to "accelerate the delivery of our equipment" to ensure Ukraine's achievements on the front line in the coming "days and weeks, not years".
President Zelensky during the press conference expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: "Today it is clear that we have the support of Great Britain.
Thank you to the people of the United Kingdom, thank you for 350 days of unity".
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he reiterated the call for Ukraine to receive Western fighter jets and added that he "heard from the Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighters" to Kiev.
The Russian embassy in London has already said that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighter jets will have "military-political consequences" for the whole world.
Now, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kiev continues to talk to Western partners about the possibility of providing fighter jets: "I have spoken to Dutch Foreign Minister Vopke Gukstra to coordinate our international steps as the full-scale Russian invasion approaches the year mark.
I thanked him for his final decision on the tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We are continuing our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation".
The spokesman of the Ukrainian Air Force Yuri Ignat in a comment for CNN said that Ukraine will need dozens of Western fighter jets to win the war against Russia.
However, observers say the West has little time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the expected new Russian offensive begins in the spring or even in February.
By some estimates, the Kremlin is already trying to restart a major offensive in Ukraine since early January.

"Politics and Profits" in the Way of Vaccination
The director-general of the World Health Organization said Sunday that if countries do not use existing tools effectively to combat the pandemic, it will not be able to end.
"The pandemic will end when the world decides to end it", Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a speech at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
"We have all the tools we need - effective health care and effective medical tools.
But the world has misused these tools", Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries around the world.
The obstacles to reaching the WHO target of vaccinating 40% of each country's population against coronavirus are "politics and profits", the WHO chief said, "not manufacturing".
"Countries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue to COVAX and the African Vaccine Acquisition Fund", Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaborative initiative created to equitably distribute the COVID vaccine.
Gebreyesus also stressed that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic in isolation from the rest of the world.
"And no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperating to protect other people.
Together!" - said Gebreyesus on Twitter.
The WHO official also urged vaccine manufacturers to "prioritize and fulfill their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [the African Vaccine Acquisition Fund]" and to become "much more transparent about where it is going".
AVAT is an African Union initiative aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to "exchange know-how, technologies and licenses and to waive intellectual property rights".
Earlier, Karen Attia, a columnist for The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share the "recipe" for the Moderna vaccine with the world.
"The US administration has been hyping up the vaccines it has donated to the world.
But when a rich country donates vaccines instead of knowledge, that's not charitable philanthropy; that's superficiality.
Poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; they asked for fairness from the start", she noted.
"We are not asking for charity", Tedros said, "we are calling for smart investment in global recovery".
As reported by Voice of America, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the abandonment of patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
The U.S. administration's intention in denying the vaccine is to allow poorer countries to produce drugs that are analogous to patented vaccines.
The pharmaceutical companies, the EU, and others have opposed it.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center reported on Monday that it had recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, nearly 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the decision to send F-16s to Ukraine would be a "very serious decision" that would be "not easy to make".
This was stated by one of Ukraine's closest allies in an interview with CNN on the background of discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
In an exclusive interview to be aired Sunday, CNN correspondent Laura Kunsberg reports that in Warsaw, President Duda said that sending F-16s would create a "serious problem" for Poland because the Polish Air Force has fewer than 50 planes and the Poles themselves "don't have enough... and we will need much more".
Duda also noted that the fighter jets, like the F-16, have "a very serious need for maintenance", so "it's not enough to just send a few planes".
These remarks by President Duda came amid discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine, including Western tanks and older anti-missile systems.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has been pressing its NATO allies to send Patriot units and Western-made tanks, such as German Leopard tanks, to Kiev.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made an unannounced European tour this week, during which he urged Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with air defense against Russia.
In London, President Zelensky called the combat aircraft "wings of freedom" of Ukraine.
This is the message Zelensky repeated in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelensky said he was "very grateful" for the assistance provided, and hoped that the next negotiations on providing Ukraine with aviation would also be successful.
"I have heard from some European leaders that they are willing to give us the weapons we need, including aircraft.
I'm having a series of bilateral talks, and we're going to be discussing fighter jets and other aircraft.
That is why we continue our work here in Brussels", Zelensky said.
As reported by Voice of America, last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to hand over its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Gokstra said his government would consider Kiev's request for the F-16.
Earlier this month, US President Joe Biden denied the supply of F-16s from the US, but Western experts believe that these aircraft could come to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that previously, weapons that the United States refused to supply ended up in Ukraine if the European NATO allies agreed to hand them over.

I am a member of the Christian congregation in Chisinau, Moldova.
On Monday, Moldova's president said Moscow was plotting to use foreign saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country "at the disposal of Russia", and derail its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maja Sandu's briefing came a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had intercepted plans by Russian intelligence services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.
"The plan for the next period is to involve military-trained saboteurs disguised as civilians who will resort to violent actions, attack some government buildings and even take hostages", Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The aim of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate power of Chisinau to an illegitimate one", Sandu said, "which would put our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration".
She promised: "The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence into our country will not succeed".
Russian officials have not responded to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of some 2.6 million people, has sought closer ties with its Western partners.
In June last year, it was granted candidate status for the European Union, the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, the Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in "several instances of organized criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence".
Moldova, which is not a NATO member, has faced a number of challenges in the past year.
These include a severe energy crisis after Moscow drastically cut off gas supplies; rapid inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed airspace and debris that was found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another wartime missile in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu stated that Russia wanted to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the intelligence services contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry into Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
"I assure you that the government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control", said Sandu.
She said the Moldovan parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the prosecutor's office, with "the necessary tools to more effectively deal with risks to the country's security".
The president added that the plan would "rely on several domestic forces, but especially on criminal groups", and went on to name two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilana Shora and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.
Both men were sanctioned by the U.S. and the U.K. last year.
Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shora party also rocked Moldova amid the energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday came after the resignation of Moldova's Prime Minister Natalia GavrilƒÉ on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her adviser on defense and security, the pro-Western economist Dorina Rechan, as successor to Gavrillit.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, US State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has for years supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova that often involve the use of corruption as a weapon to achieve their goals".

A fellow employee at the Center for Strategic Communications contacted the same woman.

Details: The enemy did not carry out active actions on the Volyn and Polish directions.
There was no significant change in the situation in the above areas.
Designated units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in Brest and Gomel regions.
The threat of missile strikes by the enemy on military and civil infrastructure facilities throughout the territory of Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as the implementation of provocations by the enemy on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine, remains.
We're giving up Soviet weapons and switching to NATO-style weapons.
The commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation Valery Zaluzhny held a telephone conversation with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to cash weapons samples.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation
Direct speech of Zaluzhny: "We also discussed with my American colleague the prospective model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we can finish it.
I also informed General Millie about the difficult situation in the east of our state, in particular in the Izum and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-capable groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we are providing defense, holding lines and positions".
"Whoever invented this hellish summer was clearly insane!" complained the Wildcat, and stretched out her hands as if to reach for the nightmarish cold.
"You say the same thing every time", remarked Worth, mixing ice in the cocktail. "Autumn - for it is rainy and dark, the grass is rotting.
In winter, the leaves freeze.
In the spring, it rains again...
‚ô™ I'd sit on my Carpathians ‚ô™ ‚ô™ The guard shrugged his shoulders indifferently ‚ô™
Although she didn't like the city much either.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past into haste and hurry.
The girl liked to imagine familiar streets as calm, quiet and greener than they were a hundred years ago or before.
But there is no magic that can take you back in time.
Whoa!
You'd say this!  The wild one clapped her hand on the table  and the flower pots were shaking fearfully  I'd sit captive for a week in my grandmother Rutmere's with her colleagues, praying at every truck crossing that you would be taken away to any city.
Unless you liked to spend the night weaving bedsheets, picking herbs, hanging them under the ceiling, and singing old hymns.
Because Grandma said that without words, none of my potions would be as good as they should be.
And wait, I didn't mention picking up all the trash at night!
But wherever you are, my white girl, you'll be dead in a week!
Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a "beautiful" life, that they enjoy the "work", that it is their conscious choice and so forth.
But if you start to really get into it, it gets scary.
The problem of Ukrainian women being drawn into prostitution is particularly acute.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea to legalize prostitution... so I didn't feel very good about it.
I think we need to take the Swedish experience, there's a kind of "Swedish model".
It's not the woman who's being ordered, it's the client.
Women are being helped out of this "business" and not made legal.
Legalization is not about security and social security.
I hope the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything anymore.
Men too should consider what they are buying - "pleasure" or violence....
There's another thing... you can look me up at the nearest optician with a doctor to write a prescription for glasses.
And the treatment should be bought, quality... looked at some sites with treatment, it was pleasantly surprised - here cheaper than in Ukraine.
I ordered the glasses two years ago, paid about $300 for them, and the handle was average (or even lower).
I don't know what the stores are selling, but the prices in the online stores are pretty normal.
But as for some cosmetics, I can tell you for sure that they are more expensive.
A lot of dogs.
We have multifocal lenses in our glasses that are very expensive (compared to our average salary).
Considering our family budget (especially the fact that we have to rent a place), $300 for glasses is quite a sum.
Did your doctor ever suggest an artificial multifocal lens?
I wore soft contact lenses for 10 years, then I developed a lens intolerance, then I wore hard contact lenses for another year, and I developed severe allergies to almost all cosmetics.
For four years now, I've been wearing glasses all the time, and I've rarely worn contact lenses.
Yeah, I read that covid affects eyesight, too.
Also, reading glasses are needed after the age of 40.
My mom was offered multifocal glasses, the price was over $1,000, very, very expensive.
Yes, glasses are in fashion now.
I asked one doctor why he didn't wear contacts or get laser correction, and he said glasses were cool.)
For a pensioner with a pension, 1,500 UAH is an unrealistic amount
I'm wearing glasses to hide the wrinkles.
I did.
My mother has little work experience.
She worked little: first the little children who were often sick, then she looked after her grandmother... so the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father earns 3800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about $1,000, and all of that was to pay for the rent.
In good times (before covid) there were premiums, but with the onset of quarantine there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
So many Ukrainians go abroad to work to provide for their families or to buy a card, but then they lose contact with their families...
Yes, there are advantages.
But my husband, when he has a day off, he goes to the toilet.
Good afternoon.
According to the order from the day of its official publication, the sea ports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until the restoration of control over the mentioned sea ports.
It is stated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the impossibility of providing services to ships and passengers, ensuring an adequate level of safety of navigation and environmental protection during the conduct of military actions by Russia in these regions, which pose a threat to human life and health.
The Russian Federation is using the troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
This is reported by Reuters, citing a statement from the UK Foreign Ministry.
The UK Foreign Office said on Sunday that Russia is using a troll factory to spread misinformation on social media about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including the UK and South Africa.
It is noted that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reached these conclusions on the basis of an expert study.
The agency said the study revealed how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign was designed to manipulate international public opinion about the invasion of Ukraine, boost its support and attract new sympathizers.
According to the study, the troll factory "used Telegram to recruit and coordinate new supporters who then acted against Kremlin critics by bombarding them with comments in support of President Putin and his war".
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
"Traces of the operation were found on eight social media platforms, including Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok", the report said.
UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said in this regard that her government has already warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations.
"We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadow troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war", Truss concluded.
Ivanna, I'll explain it to you.
Your hair is so structured that it's almost the same length.
Very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest possible result, you may need to do a hair wax.
But it will have a big effect on the density of the hair.
So I didn't do that.
Or do a root dye to make the transition smoother.
I didn't paint the roots either, as you asked.
So the transition can be a little bit abrupt.
I can give you a smooth transition, but you'll have to decorate the roots.
The roots will be dyed to your color, so when the hair grows back, you won't notice the difference.
The quality of the hair.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
The hair might get a little bit drier, which is normal, because she's blonde.
It's impossible to make a blonde like that without losing quality.
If properly cared for, the hair will return to its normal condition.
Please write down what care from the Matrix you use.
Maybe he's too weak for a blonde.
We can sign up for free diving to make a smoother transition.
This photo also shows a pretty sharp transition.
Because a high percentage of blondes are in the root zone.
Please write when you can come up so I can take a look.
If we're going to do a dive, it's going to take about three hours.
There's a lot of good in what I do at my job.
I'm helping people, that's what I'm doing, and that's what I wanted to do.
In this way, perhaps, but it is helping people whom hardly anyone in the world helps at all and says "good day" with a smile on his face.
I found some great basic Czech lessons online today.
I'm cleaning the rooms where the homeless sleep in the morning, and I'm alone, and the doors of all three rooms are locked.
I listen to these lessons in headphones and rehearse with the lecturer.
I'm talking to myself from the side, but it's good that no one can see or hear me at this time üòÖ I think I can learn a language for an hour a day like this.
So another huge plus of this work is learning language in headphones and in practice directly while interacting with colleagues.
Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns in the last 100 years.
The longest period of peace in the Soviet Union lasted 12 years, between the 1956 invasion of Hungary and the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia.
Russia borders 14 countries.
She assaulted 10 of them.
Most of modern Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, who had a significant influence on the formation of the cultural background of the Russians.
The cult of conquest and raiding has been successful throughout Russian history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then  20 years of Putin's regime.
These cultural features have shaped the state institutions that cultivate the politics of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of the war of conquest because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet felt the full effects of the economic sanctions.
Their living standards have not deteriorated enough to trigger mass protests inside Russia.
So demand more sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia is creating a new Chernobyl and Fukushima threat.
Russian military forces are shelling and seizing nuclear power plants in Ukraine.
They've shut down the Chernobyl plant.
They fired from tanks and took control of the Zaporizhia NPP  the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also spotted over the South Ukrainian nuclear power plant in the Mykolaiv region.
Russia's actions violate Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacks on nuclear power plants.
The rocket's entry, reactor overheating, or spent fuel due to power and water supply failures can lead to radiation leakage.
Ukraine has 15 nuclear reactors.
Russia does not have to press the "red button" to cause a planetary catastrophe.
Support Ukraine  The Russian threat can only be overcome together!
The Russians are looting Ukrainian farmers and illegally exporting grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and first harvests from Ukraine.
Such cases are recorded in four regions of Ukraine, temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a deliberate policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of Krasnoyarsk Krai decided to "expropriate surplus crops from last year and this year" from southern Ukraine.
The occupation authorities confiscate the planting material from the farmers, but at the same time require them to successfully sow so that they can then send new crops to Russia.
It prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement,  threatens to physically kill.
Russia is repeating the USSR's policy of mass looting of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
Thus began the Holodomor in 1932-33 and private property in Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of "liberation war with the Nazis", Russia in particular is provoking famine in the occupied territories and destroying Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Don't buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country renounce all cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine are taking children hostage.
Their mothers are forced to spy on the locations of Ukrainian military personnel, and their children are threatened with death if they refuse.
People are forced to make a difficult choice: lose their children or become traitors to their homeland and suffer the consequences.
Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine Lyudmila Denisova has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to Russian territory and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated amendments to the legislation to organize an accelerated procedure for adopting children from Donbas.
Call on your government and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I don't like their indecision.
Thousands of people are dying because NATO doesn't close the skies over Ukraine.
More than 50,000 civilians have been killed.
However, without Western weapons we would be powerless, but I must say that they are coming in too little and too late.
However, we need to join NATO for our future.
I think it's good for the alliance itself, because with NATO weapons and nine years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most efficient army in Europe.
Did you know that the Ukrainians figured out how to reload the disposable NLAW anti-tank complex?
I think the Americans are assembling these warheads at launch stage.
The Russians deserve the worst and the harshest that you can imagine.
So in a way, I'm happy about what's happening.
Because this war is not 4 months long, it started in the 15th century, I can't remember exactly now.
But all these hundreds of years, they've been trying to make us their slaves.
Before one generation dies, another is born and takes up the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have come back to us again.
This story has happened before, but for the first time, Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state.
It's just weird to think that the enemy was right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the speed of events, I didn't even have time to think about, to reflect on the fact that there was a war going on and what it meant to me.
It's great, but you have to learn the language and go to work I can't sit on the maintenance of the Czech state, but the problem is that my husband does not want me to work constantly arguing. and will have to return to Ukraine or we could stay but he will do everything to make us go back. very difficult situation
He doesn't want us to live here. That's his answer.
So he's happy we're here but to stay at home all the time I took the kids to school and to the boat, I ask that we stay here after the war and he says we'll go home right away, he won't do us papers
I probably won't be able to leave on my own if he has a long-term commitment, and he may not be able to give me permission to take the children to the Czech Republic.
The Long-Term Beating
I want to learn to be a hairdresser when the war is over and then I'll tell him to take us to the Czech Republic if he doesn't want then we'll probably have to go to a lawyer. It's too early to do anything.
We're going home, but I already know he won't take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine he said he would))) now I know the truth
Yes, thank you. We will get out of this situation, the main thing is that the war ends!!! everything will be fine.!!!
No, at the moment he has no one that's for sure. I think the reason is that children want a lot of things in the Czech Republic ask him toys and mac donals to go down, scream, run all over the house. and he is used to the peace that no one bothers him and lower does not ask. and here we came and he is annoyed and we need to spend money and he is very economical. it's better for us to live in Ukraine.
Behind the train window are the majoriles sprinkled with fine gray boards, the marshes and spruce trees sprinkled with black and white confetti, the mourning water trucks and freight cars.
Comrade Commissar Orlru lay on the narrow Spartan bed he was used to, for it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed at home.
He unfolded a simple set of stale bread and butter wrapped in a grey pot.
Comrade Orlov was frugal in food, and frugal in life, he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simply, for he only did what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he bent over the old unrolled suitcase and carefully with two hands pulled out the crystal dome that glowed dimly in the gray light of the middle lane.
"What is this, comrade?" asked the young cadet, his neighbour, in a panic.
"A rarity", said Comrade Orlov, with a gentleness unexpected for himself, as he securely placed the skull on the merchant's table, "yes, see, the thing... a very interesting and interesting thing.
That, my friend, is...
Yeah, I'm looking at work on five sites.
But unfortunately I find work for men, for special education.
I don't speak Czech, I'm a teacher of young children, I'm not an engineer and I don't have a driver's license.
And the big question is housing.
I'm a first-time immigrant and I just don't know what to do or how to act anymore.
I haven't been able to find a job for a month, I've only been cleaning one house.
I understand that Prague is a very difficult situation, so I'm not even going there.
Here I have problems everywhere üò≠ I'm a first time foreigner, I don't know the language and I'm all alone.
I was fired by the agency after three weeks of work, along with 20 other people.
I can't find a job anymore.
I ask people, I look at websites, nothing.
This is the village where I attend the course.
One lesson a week on Tuesdays
Unfortunately, the way things are going, I'm stuck with free housing while it lasts.
And look at the work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with a place to live.
I don't see any other options.
I don't want to just sit around, because the housing won't be free for long.
I see.
I don't want to take money from you.
I don't want the opinions of lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a place to live in a normal city, not the capital.
The difficult journey from Ukraine, three days, and the big city with a foreign language really scared me.
I didn't come here to go to the cafes and museums in Prague.
It's about saving lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Maybe you know someone in a small town?
I can take care of the children, cook, clean, garden...
I know how to sew, I have a sewing machine training.
I made custom-made bed linen and some clothing.
Maybe there will be a job.
I can do this!
I hug and send greetings to everyone!! üôèüèªü§óü§óü§ó
It's so good to read you!
We have another airborne emergency.
Today more than 100 missiles landed in Ukraine
I was working with the wounded today, so it was hard to concentrate.
All my thoughts were with the child.
Jan was home schooled...
It's all going to be Ukraine!
We're serving this evil!
In the surgical department, I volunteer with my colleagues
Sometimes it covers up, of course.
I clean, cook, and socialize.
Because this is my home, my land!
Give my regards to everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! üôèüèªü§ó
Thank you for your letter, and I express my personal opinion, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the question of whether or not to expel the Russian psychologists' association from European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But I believe that protecting basic human rights and the right to life is paramount.
Let me give you an analogy.
If one child takes a toy from another child in a sandbox, the adults watching the children will likely try to reconcile the children, and for a time the play continues.
If one child in the sandpit starts beating another child in the face with a shovel, that child is isolated for a long time and no one will play with him.
I also liked the analogy of a Russian psychologist colleague who said that when a neighbor kills someone, they don't put the whole apartment building in jail.
Among Ukrainian psychologists there are many discussions on the exclusion of Russian associations from European ones, many feel how painful it is that they cannot tolerate communication with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I'm willing to continue to work with a few psychologists from Russia that I know and share knowledge to treat the injuries of clients on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and I have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who at their level are trying to do a lot of things to promote common human values in Russia.
So I'm definitely for differentiating between different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia, 5-10% of the population supports the war, and the other numbers in the polls are dominated by propaganda.
My wife left her native Ukraine because there is a war going on.
My wife had a good job and, no matter what the war was like, she never left home.
My wife is trying to earn money so that she doesn't have to sit on her back in the Czech Republic, because she got her diploma as a masseuse in Ukraine in 2009.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money as he can.
Now the only problem is to learn the Czech language.
My wife studies and works and earns money for food, for kindergarten, for bus fare, for cell phone services, for clothes.
I'm defending my country.
Thank you for supporting people who understand this.
Thank you to the Czech Republic for giving shelter to Ukrainian women and children in a difficult time. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to place my wife's massage commercial in your community.
The wife earns money by herself because she doesn't want to live on the taxes of the Czech people.
Thank you.
I'm very grateful to you.
It really helps my wife to earn money for her family.
Okay, I'll tell my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of the Ukrainian people.
Some people laugh at my wife's ad, but my wife offers her services.
My wife was a nurse in Ukraine, I'm a police officer, but the war has torn us apart.
It's good that my wife wants to work and earn money and not expect help from your republic.
WATCH!!! What is it?

Supervision of students in class, during breaks and at school events by school staff.
Safety conditions in the gym, playground and in the professional classroom
Distance learning rules
If this is not possible due to the imposition of an emergency or quarantine
The school provides distance learning for interested students.
If a distance learning method is ordered in a school (classroom), students are obliged to do so in this way.
The Most Important Safety Rules
In particular, it is forbidden to bring items that threaten health and safety to school and school events
weapons (including knives), drugs (narcotics), cigarettes and alcohol.
Smoking and the use of alcohol or other drugs are prohibited at school and at school events.
I need someone who can translate for the Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were driving to Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we're dealing with the insurance company to fix the car.
The insurance company invited a person to come and translate the car from Czech into Ukrainian or Russian and back again during the inspection.
Can you help me with the translator?
In particular, I have experience writing a small scientific paper based on statistical analysis of body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a single population.
I also have experience in areas close to my field.
In 2020-2021, I participated in the research of the Kharkiv Rehabilitation Center for Khazars as a volunteer.
I helped to monitor the deer population in the Kharkiv region and to organize wintering for the deer, which were cared for by people during the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation, which is important to me.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to study the scientific work on the silkworms, observe their life under a microscope, and talk to the scientists who study them.
So the possibility of studying these and other microscopic organisms in more depth is also something that interests me.
How attitudes towards Ukrainians have changed and why the EU is not paying for refugees  Expert analyst
Poland and the Czech Republic are not receiving EU refugee aid - this is the most discussed topic in the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milo≈° Zeman.
The Czech President noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.
It has provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
About 500,000 of them arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such powerful support from their neighbors  Poland and the Czech Republic  and will be tirelessly grateful!
As Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial strain, ProUkraina asked Jaroslaw Kota, the coordinator and translator of the Refugee Center in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute of Global and Regional Analytics, which has representation not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland Helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this had a significant impact on the life of the Czechs.
There are long lines at the labor government, and there are big price increases at the store.
What is happening in Poland, where millions of Ukrainian refugees are living?
The Polish government was exceptionally quick to organize and provide assistance when hostilities broke out.
It was predicted.
In Poland, they've been saying for the last few months that there's going to be this huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, there was less preparation for what was going to happen, and in Poland, there was a lot of preparation.
For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine, even before the war began, there were already certain plans to accommodate refugees from Ukraine.
In Ukraine, they didn't even think that this could happen.
I heard them laughing about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very deliberate to prepare for all these events before the war started.
I will note that there has been an enormous amount of money from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing bombing by the Russian aggressor.
First of all, help with logistics  moving around the territory of Poland.
From Ukraine to Poland there are special trains, including medical trains, for the wounded and sick.
These are planes that fly across the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I had experience of working on such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, it is not a millionaire as one might think.
Transportation remains a major issue.
In Poland, the payment for travel for Ukrainians has been canceled.
They can travel free on trains and public transport.
In addition, Poland had agreements with German carriers, who arranged free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
This means that refugees are able to travel free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
Mostly these are closed school small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
There's free food, free medical first aid.
Refugees are given a place to rest and stay for a few days, and on the spot they are given opportunities to move to more comfortable accommodations.
The big cities of Warsaw, Gda≈Ñsk, Wroclaw, where whole Ukrainian quarters have now been created, have become very active.
The Warsaw case is unique in the sense that they managed to take objects from the Russian Embassy that were abandoned by the residents of the embassy.
Large housing complexes had been abandoned for decades, but the Russians would not let anyone in.
The Polish local government nationalized it, so to speak.
It's for Ukrainians, and Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200 to 300 families at a time.
They'll have water, electricity, they'll be insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine could be living there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland made a unique move  The Sejm passed, and the Senate approved the law on refugees from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legal stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is compulsory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private foundation that has provided ten million zlotys for free medical aid to Ukrainians.
All you have to do is text, get the code to your phone.
And for 5,000 hryvnia, you can get free medicine in Poland.
Social assistance  is three hundred zlotys, which is provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine regardless of age.
There are various foundations, including Caritas, the Red Cross, that give out food packages, chemicals, clothing.
As the Poles say: "Niespotykana skala" - the scale of the earth.
It is an "event without precedent".
It's such a huge opening.
This is a huge expense for the Polish state.
The European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland to date.
In fact, it's an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
The language problem.
Questions start from the clinics where Ukrainians can't help themselves without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems, illnesses.
The second problem is that in school, especially in the upper grades, students are also at first very confused, they can't understand the terminology.
I notice that Ukrainian children often come with a much higher level of knowledge than their class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
The children have knowledge not only of good English, but also of a general level higher than the class they are in.
That's interesting too.
So the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children do well in Ukraine, if they are valued so highly.
Of course, language is important in the workplace.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine, has a much harder time mastering this job here.
I'm not a lawyer or an accountant. I don't know any of those cases.
Doctors are now appearing in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
It's a Polish initiative where Ukrainian doctors are able to accept the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.
Language problems are often the reason why families return home after a few weeks here.
There are many such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled the wars in the first few weeks, and now they're coming back.
These are the Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there is no such active military action.
They didn't get the hang of it, they didn't get the job.
Where they live, conditions do not meet their needs and they are more comfortable returning home.
This is another one of those problems that has been going on for the last few weeks.
How Attitudes Toward Ukrainians Have Changed
According to the Ukrainian ambassador to the Czech Republic, there have been significant changes.
If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively as labor migrants, now it is proud of the steadfastness of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles feel about the millions of Ukrainian refugees?
Poland has a similar situation.
Here all the TV channels often quote the words of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When the events of the Russian attack on Georgia took place, together with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.
There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression will probably not stop at Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.
Then there could be the Baltic states, it could go to Poland.
I mean, he would have seen it coming.
In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Poles appreciate it, so they open their homes, they help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.
The threat is seen in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also be knocking on our door.
So the attitude changed to a positive one.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem is now in Poland not a "song of nationalists" or some enemies.
Of course, there are small groups of people who have not changed their views, and they exist in every country.
But fortunately, most citizens in society now think about Ukrainians very differently than before.
The claim about Ukrainian nationalists is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly say that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
This is just laughed at in Poland, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they have no political undertones.
And this is probably quite remarkable, because this direct contact has had the effect of changing the public opinion of those sections of society that were still skeptical about some historical questions.
Now it turned out that those doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
When Poles start thinking that there may be a war, they immediately begin to realize that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is happening in Ukraine.
People from Mariupol, Butch and other Ukrainian cities are constantly mentioned here.
How Poland Views the Russian Threat
Ukraine believes in victory, but prepares for the worst, because there is a terrible war.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are taking their own security seriously.
Russia is afraid of using nuclear weapons to punish Ukraine for its support.
How are the Polish government and society reacting?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
In fact, Poland does, it has very good relations with the United States, other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
There is a recruitment process in Poland for the Territorial Defense Forces.
So this is how preparation for various war scenarios happens.
Citizens sense that the government is preparing for such events.
Among these is the recently passed new law on the defense of the homeland, where the budget has been significantly increased for Poland's military needs.
There's been a change in recruitment requirements, a lot of it actually related to the potential military threat.
I know you as a specialist in future analysis.
Your predictions have come true in Syria, you warned of a Russian attack.
What do you think about the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for the nuclear strike, I'm not so sure.
But there is a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more visible to NATO countries, and Poland as well.
It could take place, according to various estimates, in the territory of the Volyn region.
I mean, I don't want to do this, but it's the worst-case scenario.
A small blow, but I want all the TV channels to show this mushroom.
I want him to be seen in Poland, the Baltic states.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be a flight and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, problems surrounding Putin, oligarchs who are currently suffering from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.
We have the facts of the Sakhalin HPP fire, some evidence that people are starting to be outraged by the price.
Such regional problems will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.
We also have a tendency to settle wars peacefully.
Various EU countries, notably Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop substantial military aggression in Ukraine because of their need for Russian energy resources.
At most, it will last until the end of this year.
How to Live Without Russian Gas
The Czech Republic is discussing a possible gas supply cut.
This will be a very significant blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect the Polish people?
As an analyst, I've seen this coming.
I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.
My family will not suffer the loss of this resource.
But there are a very large number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the price increase.
The citizens won't feel it for the first few months, but the prices of all resources will definitely start to go up.
Now they're looking for different ways to get to certain alternative sources.
In addition, we already have several companies that are transporting liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very large port in Poland.
On the oil front, we have the bright factor that the Hungarian prime minister is actually working with Putin.
They're going to buy out gas stations in Poland, actually, by Hungarian companies that will exploit Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international issues.
If Europe were to abandon Russian energy carriers, it would be a loss of a source of funding for the Russian military.
Even a schoolboy understands that without selling oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the ability to exist and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish media
Volodymyr Zelensky gave an interview to the Polish media.
What is the Polish media saying about this?
The President of Ukraine's rating has risen very much.
And this increase is being estimated as unprecedented.
Vladimir Zelensky thanks for the help, talks about the real things that are happening nearby, he is in a city in the war zone.
So the president's actions are judged by politicians and analysts and officials as very active.
They show that the Ukrainian authorities are very focused on getting military and financial aid to provide for the refugees who are leaving Ukraine.
The media discusses these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity that sometimes happens in Ukrainian media about certain sabotage or regional problems.
You can't hear it here.
And I think that's very good, because the image of Ukraine in terms of heroism, resilience, ability to fight the enemy has grown very much.
It does not fade or fall.
That's the most important thing, so there's no image loss.
In fact, Ukraine's image is holding up, and that's very important.
Good morning to you.
Sorry to bother you again with my problems.
I'm very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
Yesterday, they tried to come up with something, but it was a waste of time.
The conflict was joined by the girlfriend of the mother-in-law who helped find the apartment.
She said she wasn't looking for us, and if we didn't like it, we should leave, and she'd make sure that her mother-in-law, not us, stayed.
Unfortunately, none of them think about the child who has become accustomed to this place, considers it his home, and in 3 months has already changed 6 houses.
I'm so sorry. I had no idea this was gonna happen.
I'm sorry to trouble you again.
And the bed is a little weird.
My husband and I discussed this matter before I wrote to you that the bed was not needed.
He came here to see me and the baby and he really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law herself decided that he would sleep with her in the room and spit she wanted at his opinion and wish.
I'm very ashamed of you, your husband, Sharka and Jan, the landlady.
You've worked so hard for us.
I got it.
I thought it was going to be some kind of long-term thing.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andrew's treatment to do this at least until the end of the summer?
Maybe you need proof for Andrew that he's sick.
In Ukraine, this diagnosis would be considered a disability.
And since Inna doesn't go to kindergarten yet, I don't have the opportunity to go to work either, at least outside the home.
I understand, then it would be good to go with you tomorrow.
I'll make a barcode for myself and Andrew.
I'm worried that the humanitarian aid for him will be cut off and that the treatment and rehabilitation will take a long time.
Do you have any advice?
I also wanted to ask if you received any money for the medicine you were buying for Andrew?
The handle is falling off.
It is short, so you have to be very careful not to lose it.
Only two units were sold today.
We're out of apricots.
I poured some mangoes.
Mango is not very good.
Most wanted apricots.
They're taking more vanilla now because they don't like mangoes.
Norm, the mango is gone.

Tomorrow is blackcurrant.
Today we're definitely out of mangoes and black tar.
I'm scared of everything
He freezes again, squeaks.
Hades is at 4.0.
Once people are actively taking it, it doesn't release the ice cream at all.
I'm not sure.
It's just that when it's time for ice cream, it starts to get this shade and people move on.
It's freezing out.
If one of the ice creams is missing, it will squeak and rub against the pistons.
And you can't put the vanilla in the mango.
Can Magdalena come by tomorrow at 8:00?
We need to wash the ice cream.
Today we run out of ice cream, and tomorrow it's a different flavor.
You'll be home tonight so we can settle for last month
I'd be very grateful if you could come on a Sunday or a Saturday.

My story of learning Czech began a week after arriving in the Czech Republic
And I met a lot of interesting people.
When we started to learn the Czech language and met many interesting people
I started out as a volunteer.
There was a man, a historian, who came in after work to explain the elementary things in the Czech Republic.
This was my first experience of learning a language with a native speaker who knew neither Ukrainian nor Russian.

When Ukraine became independent, it was Kiev. But it was still part of the Soviet Union. Kharkiv was part of the Soviet Union from 1912 to 1934.
I can't say that there were any more interesting events but if there had been democracy first it would have been much better and probably now we would have been in the European Union
