Geesthacht: New beet signs should encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Umwelt, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blooms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors White and Pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blooms" is a Nabu campaign in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from clubs, schools, day-care centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been planted in the ground since 2015. : In the Geesthachter urban area, flowering islands are to be created over a wide area, on which insects can find food at any time. In favorable weather conditions, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe from Geesthachter Nabu. He himself has beehives on the property.
s explaining the plants are put up again and again so that the undertaking not only remains an action of conservationists and the city's environmental specialist service, but also extends to the private gardens. About 50 Signs are there so far. Passers-by should be able to find out in this way what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will deliberately replant at home.
In the first week of January, the Wildhasel had already started the season.
r dates are shrubs such as Winterduftheckenkirsche and Wintersneeball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. for a year now in the soil of the buckets on Bergedorer Straße, they are showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given other signs. "The winter-scented cherry tree is a very broad bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," it reads, among other information, about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bedding plants that are now in bloom. n the first week of January was already the start of the season for Wildhasel. It blooms particularly lushly on the Richtweg near the incline, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Steppen keeps me young"
- Tanz-Gott Fred Astaire would surely be proud of her if he looked down from the sky to the Munich Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there in the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m. sharp for a floating step dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, sorry young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, she recently celebrated her 102nd birthday. Birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) von der Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and stepping is my life, I can't imagine without it".
With Ernestine, Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing the dancing legs.
The 97-year-old is 1926 in Jena (Thuringia geborgen). She was a soubrette, today one would say Musical-Actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "I have spent my life with dancers, actors and singers".
At 79 years old, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the group of tap dancers. "We're just having fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl," she says.
Wikipedia: Steppantance was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates, which are more durable than the wooden soles initially used, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are generated during dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is the colloquial Tap dance and the French Claquettes. Spanish Flamenco may have influenced the Stepptanz. The toes of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.
The 77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studios at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are a big family, we are big and small, old and young are welcome".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? The movement keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol".
- The limits of the digital
As digitization progresses, the desire for analog grows again for some
The speed with which our everyday life went digital left us little time to set up rules for dealing with it and to adapt our communication and working methods to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to have a telephone conversation in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. either one was among the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or you belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call their relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you looked up a phone booth. get the smell of the plastic receivers and the clicking of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has tasked former Interior Minister Dorin Recean with forming a government.
The 48-year-old economic expert now has 14 days to do this. Recean was one of the President's advisors.
After only a year and a half in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita surprisingly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was attacked by pro-Russian forces.
The President thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifice".
Moldova is a neighboring country of Ukraine and suffers from the economic consequences of the wars. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
n the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.

Oberhof: Kühn Eighth in the World Championship Sprint
Bö continued his impressive streak despite difficult conditions and also won the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 world titles and joins his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even sometimes heavy fog does not prevent the permanent winner Bö from already collecting his second Gold on the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay had already been enough for a successful title defense.
Hardly anyone doubts that in the chase race number three will follow. In the pursuit, Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding, so that he can compensate for shooting errors to a certain extent, frighteningly easy.
At Doll, meanwhile, nothing ran together again. fter the veteran had missed every chance of a medal at the start with a penalty loop in the mixed relay and there was only sixth place, things didn't get any better three days later. penalty laps already in prone shooting and two more standing were a big disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who in 2017 had celebrated the greatest success of his career in this discipline.
n he surprisingly won Infilzen six years ago with a razor-thin lead of 0.7 seconds over Bö. t was one of only three career successes for Dolls, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. After his weak performance, the Beijing Olympia-Eighth pulled away without a word and initially gave no interviews. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, second World Cup debutant David Zobel took 35th place.
Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
n a meeting between US President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is primarily about the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
During a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, US President Joe Biden insisted on preserving democratic values.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." with a view to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, Lula replied: "Brazilians have isolated themselves for four years."
The left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. On January 1, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by heavy riots. Bolsonaro supporters had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasilia in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is grimly reminiscent of the storming of the US Capitol a good two years ago, during which supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently broke into the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much in international relations. "His world began and ended with Fake News, mornings, afternoons and evenings," Lula said. "It sounds familiar to me," Biden replied - an obvious nod to his predecessor Trump.
Brief note on the press - Friday
Does anyone remember the RAF wanted posters? You could see the members of the Red Army faction released for denunciation and shooting down.
n a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, such a public mood was created, against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Nothing here about the really dangerous ones in pinstripe suits and ties.)
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is otherwise more after Raudis in the S-Bahn or Onanists in the Park, is giving a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is ill-informed, because there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world that include Asia, Africa and Latin America than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not what it's about, but: In 1st to 5th place (!) is Ms. Wagenknecht, then Ms. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I no longer know anyone around me who reads this sheet. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the known level, where nothing is below it anymore.
And at the latest now, well dialectically, Ms. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all the not yet completely stupid, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here no differentiation is now necessary.)
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth

SS-Massakers in Oradour-sur-Glane: Letzter Survivor tot
n the devastated village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins have been preserved, a memorial center was set up in 1999.

He also contributed to Franco-German peace. The survivor had campaigned, among other things, for Franco-German youth encounters.
A curve layout for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
-Serie Nordlippische Weiler: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here the residents find pure idyll. In summer, 300 motorcycles a day sometimes brew along the winding route between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some even come back right away.
Deutsche Bank boss Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against the high inflation rate to be "absolutely" necessary. "The inflationary risks are still great. Energy costs can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give a temporary boost to prices," Sewing told the "Welt am Sonntag".
February, the European Central Bank (ECB) had raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and promised a further increase by another 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. Higher interest rates on loans can also lead to investment being postponed and thus to weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of persistently high inflation are significantly more serious than the higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course we have to keep that in mind, but a high level of debt must not stop the ECB from acting consistently."
For the euro area, the ECB is aiming for medium-term price stability with an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. In January, the price increase weakened again, but consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent above the level of the same months of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro. The sharp rise in energy prices, which significantly drive inflation, is also a burden for companies.
f inflation remains high, private consumption will "sooner or later collapse," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Federal Association of German Banks (BdB). I currently see this as the greatest danger for the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch boss Stefan Hartung is hoping for a broad debate on the "Germany-tempo" in infrastructure projects proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialogue on this. And it will perhaps also be a bit more controversial," he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes that in the end a set of rules will come out, with which it does not necessarily have to be as fast as with the LNG terminals put into operation around the turn of the year - but also not as slow as before.
n mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supply to some extent due to the lack of Russian gas supplies. Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany-tempo". In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the garden of the neighbor against his will. ", said Hartung. There must therefore still be a process of negotiating what society finds right and wrong.
In the past, attempts have been made with the classic set of rules and have not succeeded. "We should think again about whether the previous procedure was really right. Maybe we overdid it with the rules and made it too complicated for us".
n view of the many open tasks, for example in the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung. As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible".
Union warns against breaking up Bayer-Konzerns
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a break-up of the group after an announced change of boss at Bayer. From the point of view of the employees, Bayer with its three mainstays is exactly positioned for the challenges of the future," said Francesco Grioli, board member of the union and Bayer supervisory board, of the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
are the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the Consumer Health area with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business. "The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy that is based on risk diffusion and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism".
The background is the change of boss at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial Chef Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. At the beginning of June, the ex-pharmaceutical boss of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over.
Baumann has long been under criticism. The 2018 completed acquisition of the US seed manufacturer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars hangs on the Manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks from the weed killer Glyphosat into the house. Bayer shares were in a downward spiral for years. n 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It has long been known that Baumann is not seeking an extension of his contract, which should actually run until 2024. long-term oriented strategic Investors. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split of the group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health Division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the "Rheinische Post". On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against Rentenreform
Paris
Also on Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
A government project, the unions counter the concentrated protest on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected again nationwide on Saturday, who want to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the central government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already over a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 participants in protests were counted. A turbulent debate has been going on in Parliament for a week about the controversial reform.
Many people in France already work longer than until the age of 62, when they have not yet paid in long enough for a deductible pension when they reach the age limit. n many strenuous professions, people could hardly work longer, say the opponents of the reform. In addition, the employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not have their health completely worn out on the job.
Macron: Impending deficit in Rentenkasse
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, the employees would have to pay with their contributions for an increasing number of pensioners. order for the level of the pension to be kept stable, the population must work a little more. The critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state must find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But the government does not only want to screw on the retirement age. The increase in the necessary deposit period for a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain professional groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension should increase to around 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of the most important projects of President Macron. n the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron tried with varying success to reform the French pension system - broad protests and strikes were all certain.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative Republicans, who have announced their support. However, some of the deputies - even from Macron's parliamentary group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote is likely to be Macron's concern about crippling strikes at the moment. f the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the President said that he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers so that they would be calm and not lead to a blockade of the country.
s Calm weather expected - lots of sun at high altitudes
A powerful high pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that a lot of sunshine is to be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high pressure weather is expected at least until the middle of the week. n looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explains meteorologist Markus Übel from the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. "Although this high will shift a little to the east over the next week. However, the weather in Germany will continue to be determined."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sleepy weather, says Übel. "Such a high can even be quite mean and give the people in the lowlands sad high fog gray for days, while in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges there is pure sun".
This is how Sunday starts in most foggy-cloudy regions. From the Erzgebirge and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, according to the DWD, it can also rain a little. especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west the cloud cover loosens up in the course of the day and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country it remains heavily cloudy or covered with high fog. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, in the vicinity of the Rhine around 10 degrees.
On Monday, the gradually strengthening sun will nibble on the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more over the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, the sun is expected all day, elsewhere it first has to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine they are 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, only 3 degrees are expected. Weak winds blow from different directions.
On Tuesday in some lowlands there can again only be a tough resolution of fog or high fog. Otherwise, the weather after the fog clears is clear. In high altitudes, in large parts of NRW and on the edge of the Alps, according to forecasts, the sun shines all day. Temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees depending on the sunshine.
Dominatorin hadert: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
The beaten top favorite Sofia Goggia was very disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine Ski World Championships.
Méribel
I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can," the Italian said on ZDF after threading in a goal and being eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhiller in the World Cup for years. she has won four of the previous six races of the season in this discipline. Gold 2018 in Pyeongchang she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, has to wait for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline. t her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago she was absent due to injury.
"I actually thought I'd be in a good mood. It was a hundredth of a second," said Goggia after the surprise victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France. "I'm disappointed. I gave everything. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not."

y and Minister against Russia's Olympia-participation
Kyiv. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
n a joint conference call it was agreed to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Sports Ministry said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place at the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made the position of Great Britain very clear: as long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now make a joint statement on this issue."
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had earlier protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. while Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Zelenskyy said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag was ultimately soaked in blood and not portable.
Ukraine threatens to boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a warring party because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelenskyy called on the officials to work for the protection of the Olympic principles and to prevent the admission of Russian athletes to the competitions. The President also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The reason for the conference was the announcement by the IOC that it wanted to enable athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine also threatens a boycott should the IOC allow the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position
The Federal Ministry of the Interior responsible for sport stated that it had also confirmed during the consultations that it would reject a start for Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. From our point of view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to receive the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The effort of the IOC to resume the Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way," said a spokesman for the Ministry of the Interior when asked by dpa.
at the end of January, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already emphasized: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, emphasizes that sport and politics must be separated.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is aiming for a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the ban on discrimination.

Half of the vehicles lost? : USA sees Moscow's tank stock severely decimated
Lost half of the vehicles? USA sees Moscow's Panzer stock severely decimated
The Pentagon assumes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the beginning of the war. We are talking about the "half of the main stock".
According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the main stock of tanks" of the Russian army had been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, Secretary of State for International Security Affairs at the US Department of Defense.
t an online event of the think tank Center for a New American Security, Wallander did not provide any further information on the number of tanks seized and destroyed according to US estimates.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Great Britain has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2 battle tanks for March. In a coalition with other states, Germany wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The US has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams-type battle tanks. However, their delivery is likely to take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
n response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev held out the prospect of building and modernising thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy abroad has begged for planes, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now deputy head of Russia's Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is a matter of course for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology - including modern tanks".
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows for a stronger orientation of the economy towards the needs of the army. This means that, for example, individual sectors can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
a Post filling vortex at Heer
Because the post, which the former director of the Military History Museums (HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future, was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the action.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment to a previously unfilled job takes place, according to the minister. She did not want to comment on "speculation by a liberal personnel representative". Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of HGM. n addition to criticism of the Museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanners' point of view, these have been cleared up.
k also doubts the content suitability of Ortners. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". to the decision the "appearance of Postenschacher", says SPÖ-Wehrmacht spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are asking Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the swamp of corruption," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for state defense. he announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: The first fools get down on their knees before costs
s Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to stick to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs, among other things for security, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says Carnival President Marcel Kissling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total costs for the move.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades are cancelled. The "train of happy people" in Cottbus, probably once again the largest in East Germany, is taking place for the first time since the pandemic. No parades were canceled at the Swabian-Germanic Fastnacht either.
Schleswig-Holsteins Karnevalshochburg Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We are going through with our event," says the President of the Carnival Society, Heiko Claußen. But here, too, the financial concerns are pressing: If even more sponsors were not found or the previous ones were even more close, reserves would have to be touched - "that's not possible every year". The current deficit: about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: There is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent for confectionery, says Elvira Reuther from the Nürnberger Fastnachtszug association. by luck in misfortune 2020 had been ordered too much, which is why this time there is still enough stock. For the move, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. For security, twice as many personnel are needed as in 2020.
who stands at the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland am Wegesrand, could get less Kamelle than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have as much with them. Camel or not, the rush of visitors should be large: "I think if it doesn't rain from buckets that day, then we can definitely expect an increased rush of people," says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that for two years no regular Rose Monday procession has taken place. Of course, the procession cannot be replaced by anything."
The Festkomitee in Cologne does not comment on the costs in detail. But the train is generally "deficit", that is no secret.
The Ukrainian Diary: Dreams and Self-Burned Vodka
The Ukrainians are not considered in vain as a drinking festival. There are local beers such as Obolon from Kyiv or Bier from Lemberg. I always find German beers here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't see much difference in taste. The same applies to vodka, which is widely available. They burn it here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. Exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics, nobody knows. In Russia, the Minister of Health claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here too how little you can believe the Russians. It means that as a tourist you should be careful with it. But that only applies if he goes into the mass sale. then it will probably also be gepanscht.

Biathlon-WM: The Federal President sees Favoritensieg and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the Arena by Schornsteinfeger-Meister Tobias Böttger and the Oberhofer mascot "Flocke"
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the awarding of medals at the World Championships Sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
as hard as the Federal President tried, it was not clear from the grandstand on Saturday whether the windows on the shooting range really fell. "I had to get the results on my cell phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, referring to the wafts of fog that kept moving into the stadium, which severely impaired the view of the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed attending the 10-km sprint races at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof, and received numerous tips from the Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Since the Olympic Games in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, I have been fascinated by the Biathlon", he revealed and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The completely renovated arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes say the same - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the World Championships were awarded". In terms of sustainability, too, the location is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe for the next few years and even decades".
In terms of sport, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again surpassed the competition. spite a penalty loop after a shooting error, he secured his sixth win in the sixth Sprint of the Winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Championship title in Oberhof. behind him made his flawless shooter Brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 penalty round/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) make the Norwegian quadruple win perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the battle for the medals a day after the Denise Herrmann-Wicks Triumph. Johannes Kühn took eighth place as the best German after a shooting error and with a deficit of 1:04.8 minutes. World Championship debutant Justus Strelow shot flawless and finished 12th (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. his botched mixed mission on Wednesday, the Black Forester left five discs this time and disappeared as a 55. deeply disappointed and without comment in the cabin.
had entered the race in front of 14,300 spectators with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. : In his last two standing shots, however, he had the good fortune of being strong; they each landed on the edge of the discs and fell anyway. ng the award ceremony, the 29-year-old then enjoyed it together with his five-year-old brother: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's chase. For women, on the other hand, German hopes for Herrmann-Wick rest. If you start with the number one, the goal is not to get in as a tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one," sporting director Felix Bitterling took his "locomotive" to task. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 p.m. and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "Beenenschwarm" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych decides on Referee Ball.
gressively running players or complaining coaches? Germanys Referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. -Chief referee Fröhlich points to a role model function.
The top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in togetherness on the field. I do find that there are new behaviors of the players that surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told the German Press Agency. We discussed this during the winter break. We have decided that we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to that again - and we will also sanction it."
Recently, two coaches had also been given place references. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat against FC Bayern. For Freiburgs coach Christian Streich there was the league defeat in Dortmund Yellow-Red. "Coaching behavior also falls into the category of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike behavior has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to consistently punish such unsportsmanlike behavior," said Brych.
DFB-Chief Referee Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a fundamentally good cooperation between coaches and referees. Overall, the ratio fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. The person concerned then has to live with this. that shouldn't be anything world-moving," Fröhlich told the German Press Agency.
"Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into a personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures are taken by the referee," said Fröhlich. In the most recent cases, those involved would have cleared things up afterwards. "It would only be important if then a process of rethinking as a whole got underway, that such behavior simply does not belong," said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event of the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible repercussions on another level. "Of course, incidents from professional football always fade away. There is a role model effect, resulting in imitation. n recent cases in the Bundesliga the referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviours," Fröhlich said. regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful".

s after building collapse in Turkey
It is about construction defects that have favored the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, the judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants against dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. In southern Turkey, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for possible construction defects after buildings collapsed during the earthquakes. Arrest warrants have been issued against 33 people in the city of Diyarbakir, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported on Saturday, citing law enforcement officials. The accused are said to be responsible for construction defects that would have favored the collapse of the buildings.
According to Anadolu, the public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the suspects was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He is said to have tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu said. Nine more people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye.

st Prime Minister of the GDR Hans Modrow has died
Hans Modrow is dead, as announced by the left-wing faction in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Left politician as a "deeply sincere socialist".
Last night "Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95," said the left-wing faction in the Bundestag on Saturday. The party thus loses "an important personality", explained the parliamentary group leader Dietmar Bartsch and the former parliamentary group leader Gregor Gysi.
In the 1970s Hans Modrow became the 1st Secretary of the District Executive of the SED in Dresden. As Prime Minister, he accompanied the end of the GDR. four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the GDR - for around 150 days. n the Volkskammer elections on 18 March 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow took office a month later. He was the last Prime Minister of the GDR until the reunification of the CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
The parliamentary group leader of the Left, Dietmar Bartsch, described Modrow in a message on the short message service Twitter as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist". Bartsch added:
into old age he was an important advisor in our party, whose wisdom will be lacking."
The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was precisely a special merit of his. This will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. it goes on to say:
His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted in representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated".
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the German Press Agency (dpa), Modrow saw the new state "quite critically". too quickly German unity was achieved, too unconditionally the GDR was lost, and too unilaterally it was condemned as an "unjust state", according to dpa, Modrow criticized in many interviews.
What happened in the night
Ukraine's President Volodomyr Selenskyj condemns Russian missile attacks. ndes must carry out Kiew Notreparaturen on the power grid.
Kiev - The recent wave of Russian missile attacks is once again forcing Notreparaturen on the Ukrainian energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants were damaged, the head of the Ukrenerho energy supplier, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television on Friday evening. The power supply in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad. n view of the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor block had to be shut down at the Khmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant, and production was curtailed at the Rivne and southern Ukrainian nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. In a video message, however, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to let the small town of Bachmut down.
On February 24th there will be war for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger from Russian missile attacks continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kyiv, late Friday evening for the fifth time for this day, an air alarm was triggered. There is a threat of a drone attack," said the military administration of the Kyiv region. Iranian-designed combat drones were also spotted and shot down over the Mykolajiw and Odessa areas in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Bund selects consultant for network company
among others, the demands of the FDP and the Greens from the election campaign to split them off failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, it was agreed on the compromise of an infrastructure company, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. That is, it does not need to generate and withdraw profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms should help the federal government to accompany this process. The renovation backlog in the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very unpunctually. Minister of Transport Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this problem with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments necessary for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to more recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon-WM in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
the external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann-Wick at all. she would have slept badly, she said after the race, she was "totally excited", the pulse did not drop even when running in. such a race", and that at the home World Cup, "you can't describe it with words," she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to the booming pop music with German flags, supervisors and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", that was what she had planned to do.
For Herrmann-Wick the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Championships as Germany's biggest, if not only, medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she currently occupies fifth place. And even if the performance density among the women at the top is significantly higher than among the men, where currently only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate, they had others on the list for this sprint victory.
criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of left-leaning heads of state. Ortega accuses of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation had taken refuge in churches. n the protests in 2018 more than 350 people were killed. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the years that followed, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the US government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: The armaments industry is demanding more orders from special funds
The first armaments projects have therefore already been canceled, other projects are threatened with the same, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag". Which specific investments would be eliminated, but it is not yet possible to say. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time," says a response from the federal government to a request from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment sum is the rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which the Bundestag decided in June 2022, must bear the interest burden for the loans itself. If these increase, there is less money available for concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum is decreasing.
zell: Accident with 3 injured
n the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 1.40 a.m., a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to drive on the Autobahn at the Kupferzell Autobahn entrance to the left in the direction of Heilbronn. t this moment a 21-year-old VW driver drove the B 19 in the direction of Künzelsau, as the police announced. When the BMW driver turned, there was a collision between the two vehicles.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic light system installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system revealed no objections. Further investigations follow. In the accident, the 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured. They had to be admitted to a hospital. The two cars suffered property damage totaling approximately 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgarter commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster
On Friday evening, many Stuttgarters followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib-Moscheegemeinde
tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. is great - also in Stuttgart.
earthquake disaster in Turkey and in Syria is occupying the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people commemorated the victims and prayed for them on Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many parishioners had followed the call of the Feuerbacher Ditib-Moscheegemeinde, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's Bittgebet seriously and silently. n the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas so that they too could overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction with each other. The community also asks for assistance and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake".
Ditib stands with the people of Turkey and Syria. The spokesmen expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the commemoration event. The prayers were also translated into German on the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association of the Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has been collecting donations in kind on Glockenstraße for several days, which are to be brought by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should take a rest or a thousand steps".... The older ones know the proverb, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good, old digestive walk has undergone an unexpected renaissance. Because if, thanks to the home office, you are not sitting in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, you now use the lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as an alternative for a walk into the fresh air. t you could at least get this impression around the Egglburger See, where between 12 and 2 p.m. not only dog owners cavort.
One reason, of course, could also lie in the fact that modern man, in the course of an optimal use of the time slot, can combine the health-promoting fresh air supply with other things. Because why not on the occasion of a short march through nature from the neighbor who has not been seen for a long time learn news from the settlement? Or meet the girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evenings, not even to the old cinema? In this way, work and private life could also be combined - who says that the appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors? Unless there are foreign ears nearby, of course.
What you can also do amazingly is the acquisition of Naturalien. Fresh fruit, for example, which, along with cheese, stands on a table along the way. Or potatoes and meat. only if you have not already considered the purchase in advance and have taken appropriate precautions. An elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the farmer's wooden sales room empty-handed and with regret in their voices. "It's a shame, unfortunately we forgot the money".
The disappointment can be felt, since you yourself have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. What you also let the sympathetic random acquaintance know. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! You do have a bag with you!" He points to the hood of the jacket, which was quickly thrown over before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife has always packed everything in!"
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat and on this short midday excursion you have not only become richer by a lamb loin, but also by an extremely practical idea. t is quite possible that on this day a second walk is due - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
and seriously injured
around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and came off the road to the right in a left turn for reasons that have not yet been clarified, according to the police report. The Audi damaged a delineator post, crashed sideways into a tree and came to a stop a few meters away. As a result of the collision, the driver was trapped in his car. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The rescue service took the seriously injured to a hospital. Since there was a suspicion of being unfit to drive, a blood sample was taken. According to the Totalschaden police report, the Audi was built in the amount of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: a point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has ruled: The tax authority must turn over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
2018, Trump was still in the office of President of the United States at that time
The Treasury Department must direct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Taxation Committee, the department's decision said Friday.
Contrary to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as President. until before the Supreme Court against a surrender. A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a trial.
s to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There the circle of those entitled to access is somewhat larger and under certain conditions individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information is repeatedly leaked out of Parliament.
The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law". access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their undermining of our security as president," Pelosi declared.

British criminal after a long escape in Thailand gefasst
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug offender from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. As the British criminal police NCA announced on Saturday, the man was arrested on Friday by Thai police officers in a car repair shop in Bangkok. The 55-year-old was on the "Most Wanted" list of the NCA's most wanted criminals.

Kabarett - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The studied physicist from Lower Franconia, who has lived in Vienna for three years and, according to his own statements, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programs. fits the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again". Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic scientific skepticism here remains to be seen. n any case, his humor goes very well to Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian in New York for a year in 2019. but now he is back and tells his German-speaking audience not only about the experiences overseas, but he also explains what Wissenaft actually is and what it can do - and above all what it can't. Of course, Corona also occurs, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.

1. General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a vast valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which offer the player temporary protection, as these cannot be destroyed by enemy shots.
The opponent is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super-tankers, as well as nimble missiles, which, during the extended game sequences, are increasingly difficult to hit. additionally appear at periodic intervals UFO's. These cannot attack the player-tank. Conversely, the player can achieve a high score with a UFO hit. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction sequence, the game introduction sequence, the game abl on, the initial input for maximum results and the self-test sequence. The latter mode of operation represents a special procedure for checking the control elements and the computer function.
4. Game sequence
The game sequence is triggered when the pressure switch START is actuated. The LED switch remains illuminated and the playing noises become audible. If the last player-tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game begins with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by observing the displayed text in the upper left pointing display angle of his cockpit. can be e.g.: OBJECTORS OF RIGHTS. n addition, a point representing the enemy position becomes visible on the far-reaching radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone.
The upper, conical surface on the radar screen represents the field of view of the players on the underlying screen. If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to target on the screen. GNER IM FEUERBEREICH is also displayed in the upper left indication display at the same time.
momentarily UFO's become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless missiles that observe the battle and cannot eliminate either the opponent or the player tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are intended to round off the combat action and distract the player, as these usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or rockets. UFO's can be eliminated from both the Player-Panzer and the Enemy-Panzer. A shot by the player brings the player 5,000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are achieved: 1,000 points for a slow-moving tank, 2,000 points for a missile and 3,000 points for a super tank. A super tank drives and rotates twice as fast as the player tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several options give the exhibitor the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence. Furthermore, after reaching the specified points, a bonus tank can be released and the appearance of the rocket can be varied for a further more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector switch for this adjustment possibility can be found in the figure.
5. Initial input at Maximum results
f a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of highest scores, he or she can enter three (3) personal initials into the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. It should be noted that with the triggering of a self-test, the tapping of the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PCB or an interruption of the mains voltage, the table with the highest results is deleted. Upon deletion (RESET) the ten (10) highest scores with their initials are obtained and rewritten on the screen to challenge other players. Any score above 100,000 is additionally marked with a tank symbol, followed by the player's initials. f a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, strokes are automatically written by the computer. fter that, the device switches back into the Attraction game sequence. ASSEMBLY
1. New parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI shift lever. it was reinforced by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing parts, whereby this structural unit became more stable and a proper functioning of the switch contacts is ensured. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly brings the control lever into the center position. For easier replacement, the microschalters are now fastened with self-locking nuts. Two PC-Boards. ATARI'S X/Y-Play circuit has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator and the Auxiliary Platinum. With the help of these switching techniques k, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in a uniform and calm image. . The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply provided by the expansion of the circuit. . The Gerate housing. Due to the new design it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin-holding capacity. n the device there is also a console, which is intended for smaller players as a podium, in order to facilitate playing. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability on the stand.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1. f one of these new parts is mentioned in the handbook, you will find this sign. 2.Equipment Inspection
fter removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should do some checking to round off the quality control. n order to be sure that the device has been delivered to you in a proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: NOTE: The device is not yet connected to the 220 V network. . Examine the outside of the housing for damage. . Open the maintenance flap of the device and check the components inside the device as follows: (1) Check all wiring harness plugs for correct and fixed connection. Possible open or loose connectors to connect to each other.
: Plug connections are never made by force. The plugs are provided with a positive guide so that a correct connection is made. A 180 degree twisted plug connection destroys the PCB.
(2) Check the plug connections to the Game-PC-Platinum for the correct and fixed seat. Note the production number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check that the punched production number matches those of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC-Platine, Auxiliary PC-Platine, Regulator/Audio II-PC-Platine and TV-Monitors. n the back of the cover sheet of this manual is an illustration of the place where the production number is attached. This number should always be given when you call your specialist dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply unit, the control console and the TV monitor for proper assembly. Bend the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. With a look through the player's viewing glass, it is necessary to check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright, orange circled opening of the fairing. f the opening is not exactly centered, the covering, which is attached to the housing with an adhesive tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug on the mains unit 1 (see Fig. 3) corresponds to the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
HAVE YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? below are a number of tips that can help you solve most of the problems associated with current DirectX games. Check the system configuration
Please take the time and check that your system meets the requirements listed on the package. DirectX diagnostic program allows you to get an overview of your system if you are not sure whether your PC meets the requirements. Please proceed as follows to call the DirectX diagnostic program: Click on the “Start” button and select the “Execute” option. Type in the text field "dxdiag". The user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is now displayed. Here you have access to all relevant Systemdetails, including information about the graphics and sound card. You can, among other things, check if the graphics and sound work properly by clicking on the appropriate buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. : If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise against changing some of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before the start of the games
It may happen that other programs take over the system resources that the game needs to run flawlessly. not all of these Programs it is obvious that they are active, and many are automatically started when the System is started up. Such programs, which are constantly active on their system, are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. We therefore recommend that you end such background applications before you start the game. - If antivirus or Crash Guard programs are running on your System, you should close or disable them before you start the game. Look for the program icon in the Windows taskbar. Right click on the icon and select the appropriate option (“Deactivate” “Close”, or similar). - Once you have deactivated the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also terminate general background applications, as these sometimes lead to problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to end all unnecessary background applications". The system cleans up
Before you install Software, you must ensure that your hard drive is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need for this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, defragmentation and data carrier cleaning to make everything run smoothly. n the chances are high that current games on your PC will run largely without problems. A "clean" system also has the advantage that it works much more efficiently, and thus other applications that you otherwise use run faster and more stable. Consult the Windows help files to find out about the ScanDisk or error checking, defragmentation and data carrier cleaning tools. Use of Windows Help
1. Click on the ‘Start’ button and select the ‘Help’ (or ‘Help and Support’) option to call Windows Help. 2. Now click on the search field and enter the corresponding keyword, e.g. ‘ScanDisk’ (Win 98/ME), ‘Error check’ (Win 2000/XP), ‘Defragmentation’ and ‘Data carrier cleansing’. You will then receive a guide explaining how you can use these tools.
Does the game crash or hang?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, you should make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This way you can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First you should try to download the latest drivers from the website of the manufacturer of the graphics card. Below you will find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

INITIATING WORDS TO DRIVE
The desire to develop video games was ignited in me by the advent of 3D real-time technology, which suddenly opened up a lot of new possibilities and appeared to me as a new means of expression, with the help of which one could push the world to its limits. presented me with a way to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technique, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything still had to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. to be quite honest, the next ten years could not satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that the video games exploited only a tiny part of their amazing creative possibilities because they were too out for “action” and forgot about a fundamental element of the human world of experience: the sensations. n the meantime, the technology continued to make rapid progress. nheit represents my contribution to making video games a true, sensation-transmitting medium of expression. although this could of course have happened in a completely different form, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here and concrete answers are offered. is proof that you can definitely create an interactive gaming experience that is not only based on fighting vile monsters in dark corridors and shooting at boxes to get ammunition, but also has much more sophisticated and in-depth content. It is proof that you can both tell a story and offer game content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. f you are rather skeptical about video games, I can hope that Fahrenheit will help change your attitude in this regard. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. nteractivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything first. n the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and represented for the entire Quantic Dream team an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure in which we were repeatedly forced to question many of the principles previously considered irrefutable. I would consider myself lucky if Fahrenheit - similar to books, films and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also passes you by not completely without a trace. David Cage
THE README-DATEI
n the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM there is a ReadMe file in which the license agreement and updated information about the game can be viewed. We recommend that you look at this file so that you can take note of the changes that have still been made after printing this manual. n order to view the file, double-click on it in the Fahrenheit directory on your hard drive (usually C:\Programs\Atari\Fahrenheit). You can also call up the ReadMe file, however, by first clicking on the start button of the Windows® taskbar and then successively selecting “Programs”, “Atari”, “Fahrenheit” and finally the ReadMe file.
AND INSTALLATION
1. Start Windows® 2000/XP. 2. Insert the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM into the DVD-ROM drive. 3. When the “AutoPlay” option is enabled, the title screen should appear. f "AutoPlay" is not activated or the installation does not start automatically, click on the Start button of the Windows® taskbar and then on "Execute". D:\Setup, and then click "OK". : If your DVD-ROM drive is assigned a letter other than "D", use it accordingly. 4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation of the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM. 5. Once the installation is finished, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar and select Program/Atari/Fahrenheit/Fahrenheit to start the game. : The DVD-ROM drive must be in the DVD-ROM drive for you to play.

With the help of the "Sub-Test" switches, the languages can be set. f the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to switch to the next program display. -Programming. With this display, the difficulty factor for the game can be determined. Furthermore, a "maximum number of loans", which may be before the start of the game, can be set. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test-" switches (appears green), the value desired for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times, the factory or basic setting can be reached when the lowest line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the lines appearing green) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program display. " [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to transfer the High Score points to the next program display until "High Hit Rate so far". This value determines the required number of points/hits that a player needs in order for their own initials (names) and hits to be entered on the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. f the limit is exceeded, - if there is a coin lock - the coin acceptance is blocked. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin the credits cannot become zero when over 99 is added. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum Credit" to O. : "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": The amount of the % number that must be reached in order to switch to the next round
"Time limit": release for additional Sparx
difficulty": the degree of difficulty of the game sequences

The credits per coin are set on the "Insert Slot Programming" display. High-Score-Program-Display (Highest-Trefferquote so far"). The hit points and initials of the players appear, including the next 10 points. The values are used to set to Highscore which were selected on the previous display (set from "back"). By pressing the "Up" switches, the Initials QIX Standard are set. Pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "Overall Evaluation". By pressing the "Up"-switches can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total-Credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the counting starts all over again. The total number can only appear to 0 when the battery or plug connection W1 is removed, with the device switched off. Coins on the left side: Number of coins inserted in the coin insertion slot on the left. middle coins: (not present) Right-hand coins: number of coins inserted - in the right-hand coin insertion slot. Loans Paid: The number of loans that are given for coined (converted coins). Loans Granted: Number of loans given by the device. % Free Plays: Granted Loans (paid + granted loans per 100) Played Minutes: Number of minutes played. Minutes gained: Number of minutes, with extended or won games. % Free time: Minutes gained/minutes played per 100. Average playing time in Sek.: Played minutes/paid + Credits granted

slot-programming/normal money setting. With the help of this display, a standard coin setting can be selected by the display or another setting can be programmed.
If a default setting is provided, programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. The magnitude values change with the change of the digit. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is taken over. If a setting is desired that does not correspond to the standard setting, the values can be set by actuating the "Sub-Test" switch. After a single press, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and changing only the values that are not suitable. As soon as the setting has taken place, by actuating the "Sub-Test" switches, each new size to be set can be selected. n case of unwanted pressing, the default setting appears. With the "Up" and "Down" switches, the values can be increased or reduced. by pressing the "Test" switch, the process is finished. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") tells how many coin units are given for each coin - thrown in through an associated slot. Coin Units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" Coin Units shows the required units before a bonus credit is issued. "Min.-Coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. In the default setting, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY (MEMORY) FALL
f "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory standard settings. This condition probably indicates a failure or fault of the battery.

Beginning of the test method. the "Sub-Test" switch or the "Self-Test' button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" switches the next program is displayed. f a continuous test of the video board is desired, the Self-Test button must be pressed twice for the video test to start in the Auto-Test mode. With this program, the device will perform the hardware test continuously until it is switched off. f the "Open Coin Door to Test" display appears, the Program Plug J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. When the J 19 plug is removed, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware-Tests: These Tests are performed as follows: O = out / I = one / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it with the checksum stored for that ROM. f a difference is present, the device stops and the value of the ROM's with the wrong checksum appears on the LED's. If the checksum ROM is hopeless, U 10 is displayed first. f this test is not successful, the next ROM displayed on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM Memory in a given game can be introduced as Banks (Series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM-Type for each series is chosen by the decoding plug (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from the Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory, which is shared by two processors, by storing predetermined series of numbers in the RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED-Value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt with the o.a. Display holds, an error has been discovered. f the Communications RAM's fail during the Video Board Tests, the failure may have been caused by a faulty wiring (RAM) or a failure in the Data Board. To locate the error, remove the Data-Board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: a fault in U 3, U 4 or the circuits connected to it.
Video Board CMOS RAM
nce values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. f the test has been passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED-Value: 00 0011 If the device with the o.a. Display holds, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the circuits connected to them or the decoding.
Video-Board-Color-RAM test by storing predetermined number sequences in the color-RAM. These numbers are checked for correctness when reading back. LED-Value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, an error is present. Check U 56, U 57, the multiplexer and decoder connected to them.
Video-Board (RAM display). The display RAM is checked by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these enrollments are compared with the original sample. Any discrepancy causes the program to stop and the LED's indicate the faulty RAM. f a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. f this error diagnosis does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LED's), it is indicated that the next test is started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for Star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without any noticeable seam defects. BUT I guess I was looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. based on the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she's supposed to sit so tight and I didn't want to fight in an S or M with my bust.... In the end it would have fit in terms of length and hip...the rest I could swim. In addition, the feed material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and was distributed everywhere. Just damage.. It will be sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well from both sides. We ordered them for our daughter, she is totally enthusiastic. She usually wears the 158 and she fits the 36 quite well in this case and will certainly be worn for the next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I chose the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately I was presumptuous and the edition does not quite fit. But what is my fault. then slightly changed something so it's passt. The support looks very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the whole area. The hat worked without any problems. t nix plus. I would buy again immediately.
unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself is okay, but not less than a year. Since the area for chewing is much too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use him for size. t now at 12 months we have looked for him out again and he can use it. Hasn't been able to bite anything with his few existing teeth either. And when he was in the fridge, calm down it's him very much.
Insufficient quality / Unfortunately Geht back
I have let myself be dazzled here by the sometimes exuberant reviews. I would like to inform you that I already have 2 Lowepro backpacks in use. A very large one (for storing the equipment) and a fairly small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. as I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the little Lowepro has finally become too small and I need a replacement. Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, as I had read through many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came yesterday, disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for less than 30 EUR, you can't say that. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... People, that's just not true! had really hoped that it is so, but there really can be no talk of it. The upholstered walls are significantly thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more labrile. Overall, the feel of this rucksack is not comparable to that of my Lowepro. The zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small material are also not exactly of high quality. I have decided for myself that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment worth many thousands of euros, then unfortunately I also have to spend the money for a decent backpack. Quality seems to have its price here. For someone who doesn't want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like the decision was difficult for me either. When I unpacked the rucksack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked is the color inside. Here you will find your things much faster than with a gray inner life. For someone who has other claims to a rucksack, the rucksack is definitely a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
I had liked E. L. Todd's Elektrik series best so far, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and I was really looking forward to the third part. part is all about the feelings of Volt and Taylor and I found it unnecessarily lengthy. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally confesses everything to herself and then is like a small child in every argument and squirms?! there were also disagreements, my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt still tried to convince Taylor's Ex and didn't believe him when he said Taylor would stand on him and tried to convince the Ex that Taylor couldn't do it without him and he heard it himself. at the beginning of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. had hoped that this is the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that it will finally come out, that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. That would bring more tension back into the story.
man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn! First of all: The film is not so bad now, as many write. Sure, of course the Story is totally constructed, and again and again conceived according to the same Schema F. If you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like. And the message is always the same: man destroys everything, and appreciates nothing, and does not learn to do so! And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often have I only thought about the film (and this even though I know that it is only a film, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals often already shoot tears in your eyes . therefore Jurassic World The fallen kingdom is already really neat. It's just a shame that humans just don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film. We consistently destroy animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves. Out of greed and profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance! Empathy for the environment and living beings: Misrepresentation. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Nevertheless well done PopcornKino.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some are expecting a movie at 8 Mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and it doesn't want to be. This film is above all "French" - moreover it is calm, sensitive, sensitive, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and expect nothing from it that it does not want to be.
Problematic
Tastes like Quench from the 90s, because of Orange, but that doesn't matter. 5 days every morning a package: nothing has moved, but absolutely nothing. My belly circumference has grown by 12 cm! Inflation like never before! Diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Helpless, unfortunately despite immediate discontinuation, diarrhea has remained for 1 week. It should be noted that for the smaller packaging size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, for the larger full 5 ? This is very very strange!
terrible stench and low result! I dyed my blonde hair an intense shade into a chocolate brown in October, in February/March I used this hair dye remover. I have applied the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, there was an approximately chestnut brown (slightly darker) result. Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it one more time, as in the instructions, even if the result was not satisfactory. This evil was the queen of time-wasting! t made no difference, my hair looked like it did on the first try. worst of all, it still stunked weeks after use.. no matter how often I washed my hair, the smell just didn't go away.
Highly recommended
I now take the tablets for a longer period of time and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a longer additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by eating healthy but also by taking vitamins D3 and K2 a little. This also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also super since you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommended.
perfect function !!! After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following gross defects which I find very disturbing: 1) The case has problems "connecting" with the cell phone over time. means that it is no longer loaded even though the "Power On/Off" Button has been pressed for 3 seconds. If you remove the cell phone from the case and put it back in, you solve the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and reinstalling the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. t are not many gross defects, but I think that a case with a battery should work perfectly in its function and that is why, for the cost of 30 €, I am very disappointed with the product, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months .
too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I don't know how all these good reviews come to Stande. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you get from every optician in a slightly smaller form as a gift. The cleaning effect is as good as with a kitchen towel and no better. I promised myself a lot more of these Towels it is also really very very thin. I used it, unfortunately I can no longer exchange it I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these towels is far exaggerated more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a promotional gift, unfortunately broke. Basically the Onforu works great, it's waterproof (me shcon fell in the shower), it gives Bass like Bass again, Bluetooth works great... of course you have to water the suction cup, otherwise it comes loose.. it can reproduce sound very loudly... yes.. what I see critically is the frequency response of this small loudspeaker. As I said, Bass is played back as Bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. while some frequencies of the vocals are already almost in the ears wehtun, higher and lower frequencies grade are well enough audible. My old speaker didn't play bass as well as bass, but the frequencies were presented quite naturally in volume. Unfortunately, that's not really the case with Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. therefore I have to remove a star from it. I hardly expected the frequency response anymore.
very bad
In a few places the color had split off and if you just walked over it with your hand, the color went off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore, but unfortunately only at our expense. they would only replace the damaged parts but as if both chests of drawers were damaged. Service from the manufacturer Amazon took care of all this for us and transferred the money back to us. A LOB to Amazon
to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Individual parts are supplied which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packaged in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no other protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I didn't fault it, as I desperately needed this product. The supplied adhesive hardly lasts, but sticks well - like chewing gum, which does not harden. Just one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to glue everything together. The stencils are partially incompletely stamped. For single use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high quality product.
am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to set up, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic closure + Beautiful optics + Stable when set up + Shelf can be positioned as desired
- Doors slam through Magnete (you can perhaps compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean spots
- the dowels supplied are much too small and wobble (I didn't have any others and I didn't have a trophy in the house either, glued with handicraft glue) - the holders for the inlay wobble a bit (have wrapped with some paper and balanced) Conclusion: If it weren't so good looking and had such good measurements, I would give less stars, since you have to do everything right to be really satisfied. I also find it a bit too expensive for that.
The coffee tastes good to me....but
s there are only 3 Stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also significantly more expensive). ffern I would have forgiven 5*. unfortunately the coffee does not run evenly (if at all!). The additional plastic waste (packed individually, see photo) also means a star drawer for me. I hope the manufacturer changes this and collects the full score soon.
t me on the alarm clock
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds sound terrible, and extremely loud. I couldn't put them down either. Probably a defect, supposedly it is possible. The slightest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fell out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can cast shadows on the wall with your hands. I always woke up when I had turned my face to the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. f then, however, when the time came and the sunrise simulation began, it was immediately too bright for me. I found the colors and also the color change beautiful, unfortunately you can't dim the colored light. I also liked that it has a battery so that in the event of a power failure the clock and wake-up time do not have to be re-entered. But he went back for the reasons mentioned.
Super light, insufficient processing
I replaced four lights in the house with these lamps. unfortunately I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead I laugh at this point a board on... s also lag nothing in the box. "6 pay - 4 receive" is not a good deal. Amazon would certainly have settled this amicably and quickly, but I only found out after the return deadline. So I see it as my mistake and I live with it. nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these luminaries - so far the only reason for two-star deduction. The light itself is super. The rooms are now very brightly and evenly lit. The light color tends to go in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc. For living spaces, I would personally reach for warmer lights. comparable to a good old 100 Watt pear. However, other lamps can also do this and evtl I also get intact copies there according to the order. f my review is a help, I'm happy for a positive review. I try to answer questions quickly.
Tolle
I have received Gestures, and I would like to share my first look. Already positive. I considered for a long time whether to order this set, or not. ** The material is stable and It sits well in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole in the handle to hang them **The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on coated pans. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. **They also do not transmit the heat and can therefore be touched directly. **However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But shortly after wiping and they are gone. Finally I have to say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
-B-Ware as Neuware Sold
Amazon Prime shipping just top. Delivery within 24 hours. n the shock, unpack the faucet and check all the parts. Here we found that the part has already been used badly. On all assembly parts we have had to find significant scratches, abrasions. The screw connections/connections of the hoses were all damaged. nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now did we see that scratch marks / streaks can also be seen on the Verchromten faucet itself. This part has probably been delivered before and sent back again. We keep this faucet and build it into the sink in the basement because it doesn't matter what it looks like. r Conclusion; We never order such goods via Amazon again, but rather give a little more in the hardware store from where we get Neat Goods. it's just Traurig that customers are so scared!!!
The product itself is top, unfortunately the external sensor is already broken after 6 months
n principle I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very simple, and the radio range is also very good, although there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device that measures the values on the outside seems to be broken. The thermometer still seems to be intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably there, because completely astronomical values of outdoor humidity are always displayed. This is a great pity, since the device was attached to a protected place on the outside and also the reason why I only give this product two stars.
Strong mower with weak catch basket
aside from the fact that the first attempt at the delivery stand today still happily drives around the republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon's service with triggering a replacement delivery has been outstanding as always. The mower quickly arrived at me and made a good impression. The motor is strong and a nice sectional image results. The volume isn't exactly impressively low, but ok. Unfortunately, the big shortcoming is the catch basket. For one thing, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If it is only briefly set down, then it is naturally compressed and parts of the contents fall out. Worse, however, is that the actual practical level indicator shows red even when the catch basket is half full. t wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from now on. always emptying the basket on a large lawn when it is only half full cannot be the solution. So I cleaned the device as much as possible and sent it back. : Basically a very good mower, which due to the unfortunate construction of the catch basket becomes unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate via the app. The supplied plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but for battery protection only displayed once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. For the following reasons I give only 4 stars. - The soft back wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be re-closed quite fumbled. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you place it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and put them back in after a short break, then it connects again. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm tone could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D Printer, as I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to level the Hotbed properly to this day. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there and the front right screw almost falls out, since it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The poles that hold the cart are straight and so is the table. Maybe someone already knows what you can do, because that's how it's impossible to print something. About the construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to re-lay them several times, which is very exhausting. I have already written to Support but after a week of waiting I still haven't received an answer. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back. I expected a little more.
robust and precise bin positive surprised
Unfortunately, after many years, my old measuring slider gave up the spirit, so a new one was needed. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. There are two batteries with it, so that it can be placed directly. The packaging of the sliders is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give full marks for it and believe it lasts at least as long as the old measuring slider. there is a clear buy recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor
I bought the bracelet and for the time being I haven't worn it as it gives off a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell has not gone away, although it has been constantly "ventilated". After return was no longer possible, I disposed of it. Rate from purchase to
For the price ok
Personally, the stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me, so it looks quite massive. The larger spheres are freely movable, which again I find quite nice. However, the whole chain is very easy to process, so I have already torn the closure twice. So far I have been able to fix it again and again, but I think that this will not go well/last long. But for the low price you can simply not expect anything really high quality.
Very beautiful piece of jewelry
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through's Maul, it can't work out, amazing! I rubbed it in with some leather care, which makes it a little softer and more snug. : If you have something magnetic on your arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that they were used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after some gimmicks.... if you follow the instructions it doesn't work at all, only after I have removed a battery from the base station again and inserted a new one, the transmitters have finally connected. unfortunately my joy about it did not last long, because after just an hour the connection was gone again, and that although the transmitters were next to the base station. The display of the three stations was also very different! All in all for me so useless! The thing went back! f a purchase in any case, it only brings trouble!
schaden
Hello, I have had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the inner shaft was rusted off. I bought them again for just one reason, I needed them urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line as well as the drain would fit. hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production fault and the current pump performs its services a little longer. unfortunately the new pump had a transport damage, the plastic housing was torn and the ventilation slots were broken. The carton was also damaged from the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled carton. I kept the pump anyway, since as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pump performance.
You could have thought through it better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought that such an organizer is more pleasant than running around with a huge bunch of keys all the time. In the beginning everything went quite well. However, the paint then faded quite quickly and the screws always had to be tightened. It's nice that this is also possible with a cent coin, but also only with a cent coin. I couldn't find a suitable slotted screwdriver that wouldn't have ruined the whole screw right away. To get to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: attaching the keys. It is nice that you can set the screw to different sizes or lengths due to the different parts, but if you have screwed the whole thing first, you need pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. ng the keys itself is simply a game of patience, balance and dexterity. Ultimately, the screw broke off in the thread during the third time of mounting and thus the complete thing was unusable. : If at all then for just once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
do not quite correspond to the indicated measures
Lightweight zippers, the material looks robust and all in spring weight. Since I have no comparison (my first Organizer Set), I will only be able to actually assess the goods after the first use. I can say in advance that the height is lower than stated. m I can't really imagine packing everything there for a three-week vacation, for example. f necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before. t is also to be noted that not 8 but 10 parts were delivered, as the round cosmetic bag still contained two smaller pouches/bags. Not high quality processed, I wanted to mention that anyway. The fact that the cosmetic bag has a different shade and is made of a different material than the other bags does not bother me personally. I see the price-performance ratio as a trial price and that's ok.
lala
So, I ordered it before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas. Now that I wanted to use it again, he didn't anymore. Battery?. But it still doesn't work. So I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can.
is always good care! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound on my very high-quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. there were two black cables. The Akkus runtime is long enough. Definitively perfectly adequate Klang. I liked that the headphones don't hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Buy recommendation in this price range.
s chicks Dress
Very beautiful dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions.. Price-Leistung is in full agreement here, especially since I also bought it in the Blitzangebot. t in my size perfect, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller (it was already recommended). I just wished that the neckline wasn't so deep, and that the sleeves could also handle a little more fabric (if you don't have upper arms quite as narrow as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Finger away. It doesn't get any worse. I really and seriously wouldn't have expected such a scrap to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a High End Asus ROG Strix Scar II Gaming Laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD works normally, Blu-rays are maximum unreliable detected. The discs have to be inserted several times, after that it makes Rödel noises like you haven't heard them since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After a few minutes, you can either restart the computer because it is no longer working or the disc is finally barely recognized. But then you must not under any circumstances press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the film or even just anything. This immediately leads to an irreparable freeze. n addition, of course no Blu-ray Software is included. If you additionally purchase PowerDVD or similar for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
t what it's supposed to be, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only for charging any devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. actually needed a second port and had I only needed a sneaky extension, I certainly wouldn't have bought myself this shapeless lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgment, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick does not simply dangle around in the area, as with a normal extension cord. no real bad buy, but my Euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-).
but small oho! I bought this product so that I can have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) as well as connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters which I had to send back could not do this. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 Controller for BT on my tablet and the HDMI one on my TV. multaneous loading is not a problem. Tone is delivered via HDMI. What else do I use my PlayStation :P There is a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my case it doesn't fit with the adapter. Naja also keeps so safe and has contact from that... Although all of them are a bit expensive, they are justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole is very small and stably manufactured in an aluminum piece. Performance price passt.
Lots of performance
Top device. It has been running for months without any problems. It's not exactly light or quiet but delivers decent performance. I find the middle temperature setting (Tp setting) rather a bit too cool and I am therefore always on the road at level 2. It has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived well. And I also like the simple design. Competitors like to look bad like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but it does not make a favorable impression. The feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed in use. Overall I found these brushes very good and can be fully recommended.
Great product with weakness Akku
We have had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in the live mode is the location to feel exactly 0.5m. In offline mode, when the dog is in the house, however, he likes to jump a few meters at a time, but this is not disturbing. I would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. ll he lasts about 1.5h days. Here would be a super solution which would create 7-14 days. There is an XL version, but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not have to last with us and we also find it impractical to change daily. One should deal with the dog not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks of garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They pass well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the service life is decreasing more and more. ven though my son only wears the shoes in PE lessons, after just a few weeks the sole breaks and the shoes can no longer be used. In the last couple it was also the case in normal use that they did not last very long, but I thought for the lessons it will be enough. Unfortunately that was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Perfect pass - but Original? My last pair of Crocs unfortunately broke after 5 years, so I happily ordered new ones. Unfortunately, these are poorly processed at first glance. They are just as comfortable as the ones I had before. At first glance, no difference seems to be noticeable either, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly processed and the strap on the heel sits quite loosely and will very likely not last five years like my previous ones. I'm excited!
d well
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I am driving to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered them with good luck. Included in the scope of delivery were the mattress and a car air pump. About the mattress: I laid it out in the car (Citroen Berlingo) as a test. I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it away and I really hope that it doesn't reappear. In the inflated state, a lying test was carried out directly. It sits well on it and is a great fit for the Festival. Of course, this mattress cannot replace your own bed, but the one for days at the event is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully into my car. We took out the seats in the back. so passt is perfect. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is inserted into the cigarette lighter of the cars. However, the plug was defective (somewhat at the solder joint). s my friend is technically gifted, he was able to repair it and reassembled the good part worked excellently and pumped up the mattress in zero comma Nix. Overall I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm then really looking forward to the endurance test at the Festival. hope that it does not lose breath and also lasts a long time. Likewise, that he does not reappear mold. fter the test I can definitely recommend it. f I should have other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately my calendar only gets two stars. :( 1. For fast shipping. 2. For the idea of toys. Unfortunately, the calendar was torn open over several doors by the lappy processing directly on Day 1. 21. On the little door there were more garkeine little doors and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the remaining parts accordingly as they almost came to his liking. The parts often get messed up, which often means that you have to build the car apart again to get the parts on. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. Mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach.) I would no longer buy this calendar and would not recommend it to anyone else. The manufacturers may rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and do it better. :\
a real drone
I am enthusiastic about the drone. My 7-year-old daughter flies with it. Inside it flies very well and the 5 min. Flight time is usually completely sufficient. I didn't expect anything else at the price that the hair would get stuck in it and the drone would break very quickly, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are not a problem. If you have any questions, please contact us.
Game ok but only playable with Zwang to Steam. n the purchase I did not see that it is not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would still be fine so far, but you are forced to install Steam in order to be able to play it at all, which is an outrage. nce then the computer has been constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the games.
unfortunately it fails because of the battery life
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and Optics toll, messages etc. were displayed without any problems. the operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. Big catch: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evenings, overnight only on the drm cupboard and 11% less battery in the morning when not in use. a lot of news came during the day, the battery was already at the end at noon / early afternoon and then you can not even read the time anymore. therefore, not usable for me. It's a shame.
Noble case with limitations
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+ you should definitely buy a case. I recently liked cases in which you can also insert the credit card. This is what the shell offers here. If you insert cards into all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid is a little high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. She looks classy. In contrast to many other cases, the mobile phone is embedded in the ringherum, only the terminals have recesses. Otherwise, you can easily operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. t even on TORRO's leather QI charging station. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can therefore only be charged when the case is off. notherwise really chic and well made!
high quality shell with armored glass film
Robust case with a real armored glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material is comfortable in the hand and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and is firmly attached to the phone. Overall a good buy.

Still's disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease only begins in adulthood, then we speak of Still's disease starting in adulthood ("adult onset Still's disease").
The diagnostic criteria include a characteristic exanthema, joint complaints, fever and leukocytosis as well as liver dysfunction, sore throat without detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen and lack of titers for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two adult patients who have been ill for a long time, whose skin symptoms led us to the diagnosis of Morbus Still.

infections with a large number of pathogens come into question, in the foreground are, in addition to the usual bacterial pathogens Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), Cytomegaloviruses (CMV), fungi, Tuberculosis bacteria and respiratory viruses.
In 25-30% of cases, however, the respiratory symptoms are based on non-infectious causes.
Anamnesis, X-rays of the lungs and blood tests are often of little help in finding a diagnosis.
However, analysis of material from the respiratory tract often leads to the diagnosis of:
Nasopharyngeal secretion, Sputum (possibly induced by saline inhalation) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
The flexible bronchoscopy with a bronchoalveolar lavage results in a diagnostic clarification in 60-80%, the remaining cases must be diagnosed - with a corresponding clinic - by a mostly open lung biopsy.
Mostly young to middle-aged women are affected.

Overview of the existing literature shows that complicated and difficult-to-replace lower jaw fractures after compression osteosynthesis have a significantly lower complication rate, while simple and only slightly dislocated fractures in the distal portion of the mandible can also be successfully treated by means of monocortical miniplate osteosynthesis.
s for a suitable differential indication between the two therapy concepts seems to be the survey of pre- and intraoperative parameters, which describe the character of a lower jaw fracture and additively form a rank value for the classification of a trauma.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations to describe a lower jaw trauma that all the studies carried out so far with their low number of cases can at best allow a rough differential indication.
s long as there is no prospective multicenter study that could provide a decision-making aid in the choice of osteosynthesis procedure, preference should be given in the fluid range between "simpler" and "difficult" fractures of functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications.
Comparative genomic hybridization ("comparative genomic hybridization", CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method that enables the comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and under-representations of DNA segments.

The result is presented in the form of a CGH-sum karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these investigations is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of sum-karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Operative interventions can be precisely planned and simulated with the help of three-dimensional (3D-) reconstructions of the anatomical bone structures, created from a patient's tomography data.
Assistance in the intraoperative implementation of the previously planned as well as in the spatial orientation in the operating site can be provided by computer-aided navigation systems or robot systems.
After the successful centralization of laboratory analytics for more than 30 years, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in undiluted whole blood and the downsizing of laboratory analyses are now increasingly leading to a new re-decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-Of-Care-Testing (POCT) is performed near the patient outside of central or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT are faster Turn-Around-Times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and sample transport problems, and the need for only small sample quantities.
While these benefits are often highlighted, they are not accompanied by a clearly recognizable clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT such as improper handling and/or maintenance of the analyzers by the untrained station staff, lack or lack of calibration and/or quality control, costs due to the provision of several devices and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation and difficult comparability between the POCT results and the routine laboratory results, are also apparent.
In the opinion of the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should only be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians in order to ensure the usefulness and high quality of the analyses.
aking into account the local situation (24 h-Centrallabor, etc.) the parameter spectrum of POCTs should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The necessary Analytes should be:
or Hematocrit, Activated Whole Blood-Coagulation Time, Blood Gases, Sodium, Potassium, Ionized Calcium, Glucose, Ammonia and Lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive-diagnostic and minimally-invasive therapeutic procedures through MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
is adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety aspects.
Fast and ultrafast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast media and thermosensitive contrast media are discussed.
The spectrum of clinical applications ranges from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to the intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MR-Tomography is still at the very beginning of its development.
MR tomography can possibly gain considerable importance in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, characteristic skeletal changes occur.
The aim of the present investigations was to completely record the bone mass changes of the spinal column during long-term hemodialysis of C2 - L5.
Of 9 autopsies with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, the spine was completely examined.
With a newly developed preparation technique, the combined two- and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that in addition to the histological image, the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed directly.
Quantitatively evaluated were vertebral body heights (SDI), bone volume (BV/TV) and intertrabecular linkage (TBPf).
The "spine deformity index" (SDI) shows vertebral body fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite a normal trabecular bone volume (BV/TV).
V/TV shows a distribution across the spine known from the skeletally healthy control group.
However, the plateau-like curve course decreasing from the HWS to the LWS is 5% lower at the ROPs.
The BV/TV of the 2nd LWK is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding pelvic cavity biopsy.
Cases with prolonged hemodialysis have higher BV/TV values regardless of age and gender.
Normal BV/TV is not synonymous with physiological cross-linking of the spongiasa and functional statics.
Compared to the controls, the three-dimensional analysis at ROP results in a much stronger restructuring of the architecture than can be derived on the 2-D cut planes and the trabecular bone volumes.
The findings underscore the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and thus functional spongiosa architecture in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described for the first time a form of groin hernia, which, due to its course of the disease and the sectional findings made by Littré himself, did not correspond to what was previously known.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this bulging of the intestinal wall.
shortly before, Richter described the intestinal wall rupture in a scientific writing on "fractures" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of the "Richter-Littré-Hernie" in German-speaking countries.
Based on a case report, the historical processing of this hernia form takes place.
Asperger's Syndrome is an autistic disorder that was first described in 1944 by Hans Asperger but received little attention in the decades that followed.
n the 1980s, the clinical picture received increasing attention and was not included in the ICD-10 as a diagnosis until 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994.
The cause of the disturbance is unclear.
a patient is presented with the typical features of an Asperger's syndrome, in which at the same time there was an epilepsy and internal abnormalities.
Possible concomitant diseases of Asperger's syndrome such as epilepsy are discussed in addition to the diagnostic criteria and the therapeutic procedure.
Yersinia infections manifest themselves in childhood mostly as feverish gastroenteritis or pseudoappendicitis.
report a child in whom the Yersinia infection manifested itself as tumor-like lymphadenitis with long-lasting persistence located in the mesenteric root.
The position of the diagnosis was achieved by the repeated detection of specific antibodies against various external Yersinia membrane proteins.
n only after a therapy with ciprofloxacin over 16 weeks did all clinical findings normalize.
The application of pulse oximetry in the context of cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively investigated among 23 preclinical resuscitations.
questions were asked as to what conclusions the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation allow and what consequences result from these findings.
The investigation shows that pulse oximetry appears to be suitable for quality control of the resuscitation measures performed in a high percentage.
ximetry represents a useful monitoring measure under resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has been able to successfully contribute to a better understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
This also applies if an autopsy could not clarify the cause of death.
n this workshop, a wealth of scientific data was presented that made clear the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year-old patient, in the early postoperative phase after vaginal hysterectomy, the signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumption coagulopathy and fever developed, and in the further course the image of septic shock developed.
Staphylococcus epidermidis, in the second Propionibacterium acnes, could also be detected in this autologous blood preserve.
The source of contamination of the canned goods was not identifiable.
It turns out that autologous hemotherapy also carries a risk of infection that should not be underestimated and the retransfusion of autologous blood requires a strict medical indication.
s in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of a severe infection by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature newborn with VACTERL association who developed fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis after a candidasepsis, which led to hydronephrosis with incipient postrenal renal failure.
Antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosin as well as direct flushing with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy resulted in the normalization of the excretory function.
n increasing frequency of systemic candida infections, especially in neonatology, differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis should also consider the possibility of bezoar formation in order to be able to initiate an early and effective therapy.
The high dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method for the treatment of acute exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
t has been shown that some of the patients do not respond to this therapy or only respond insufficiently.
In the present retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 respondents and non-responders were compared.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the following Parameters:
Skin type, minimal Erythem dose, single dose and cumulative doses of UVA1, Eosinophile in peripheral blood.
On the other hand, it was shown that the non-responders have a significantly increased atopy score, increased titers of total IgE and of specific IgE compared to the respondents.
In addition, a strong microbial colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and of the intestine with Candida albicans was found comparatively more frequently in the non-responders.
These findings show that high-dose UVA-1-therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
-responders are characterized on the one hand by a particularly severe atopic syndrome and on the other hand by complicating superinfections.
The latter finding indicates that a combination of high-dose UVA-1 therapy with an antibiotic or antimycotic treatment could be beneficial for these patients.
Lupus erythematosus profundus represents a rare variant of lupus erythematosus.
typical case studies show the association of Lupus erythematosus profundus with features of the discoid Lupus erythematosus and systemic Lupus erythematosus.
clinically there are subcutaneous nodules and plate-like infiltrates, which can lead to ulcerations and scarred constrictions.
Histologically, there is a lobular panniculitis.
A positive direct immunofluorescence examination (lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components at the dermo-epidermal border and the vessels is also considered as a further diagnostic indication.
knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology is of particular importance, as lupus erythematosus profundus can precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old patient with long-term chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis existing for more than 45 years.
The patient died under the clinical signs of a cardiac low-output syndrome as a result of an autopsy and toxicologically confirmed vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy.
The pathogenesis as well as the morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
n the last 5-7 years there has been an intensive research interest regarding the mechanisms of the formation of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatment options for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapeutic methods is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
n this overview work, the results of experimental and clinical studies regarding the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse shapes for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion are summarized.
As a result of scientific advances in medicine, more and more patients with previous illnesses, in old age, with restricted cardiac pumping function, after previous heart operations and under emergency conditions are being operated on.
This requires a risk stratification, with which the operational risk is divided into "low", "medium" and "high".
-, intra- and postoperative patient-, structural- and treatment-related factors can be distinguished.
On the basis of this prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized through individually tailored, pre-, intra- and post-operative, multi-professional and interdisciplinary management.
Patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumors, v. a. Spinaliomas and Basaliomas.
We report on a 65-year-old patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, a spinal tumor and a lymph node metastasis of a malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of a Xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by the complementation analysis, which resulted in an assignment to complementation group D.
Occasionally, patients with malignancies in the breast, thoracic wall and/or abdominal wall that have not been treated for years and have been exulcerated in the meantime present the plastic surgeon with the need for large defect covers after tumor resection.
By the use of silver-containing activated carbon nonwoven (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer coatings (Allevyn), infection could be avoided after flank replacement by an omentum plastic within the framework of the resection of an extended basal cell.
After secondary mesh graft coverage, fibrosation and calcification of the omentum led to a stable hull wall even without the use of plastic nets.
The 2000 health reform in Germany does little to change the structural deficits of the German health care system.
The monopolies of hospitals for inpatient care and of resident contract doctors for outpatient care are not touched.
Hospital budgeting remains.
In the future, mandatory catalogs will be specified for outpatient operations that may not be performed as inpatients.
The obligation to quality assurance is specified and tightened.
A new DRG-based pricing system will be introduced for the hospitals.
The sepsis and its potential degradation to the failure of several organs represents a complex immunological process, which is influenced by local and systemic proinflammatory stimuli, occurs system-wide and whose activity is only minimally reflected in the amounts of proinflammatory and antiinflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis includes the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
nflammation is enhanced by activation of the intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces the synthesis of mRNA coding for many of the proinflammatory mediators, including TNF-, IL-8 and inducible NO-synthetase.
likewise, the same stimuli effect a parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibits the activation of NF-B and minimizes the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes seems to control the immune reactivity of the cells, both locally and system-wide.
If one characterizes this immunoreactivity, one will perhaps ultimately also better understand the determinants of the inflammatory response and of a potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumors are mostly unspecific.
ologically, often only brightenings in the bone are recognizable, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radioopacities.
Root tip resorptions can be another important finding.
After a brief historical demolition, based on the currently valid WHO classification, each individual type is briefly reported on the current state of knowledge.
From this, the therapy concept valid today is developed, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent and non-recurrent tumors.
generalized joy disorder (GHKS) is a mental illness that is often recognized only late, for which a uniformity of mental experience is characteristic in the face of circumstances that are usually the cause of depressive mood, despair, great anxiety, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.
early diagnosis and targeted treatment can decisively improve the quality of life of those affected and prevent disadvantageous long-term individual and social consequences.
To this day, acute purulent meningitis is a life-threatening disease that requires rapid diagnosis with immediate therapy.
spite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the last 20 years.
Only a therapy regimen that specifically intervenes in the pathogenesis of the inflammation is able to minimize neurological consequential damage and preserve the patient's life.
This article presents the current status of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy with special consideration of molecular pathophysiological processes in the inflammation of the CNS.
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (Dental-CT/ Dental-Scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of the mandible and maxilla.
It is particularly helpful in the demarcation of bone lesions from adjacent anatomical structures.
This technique therefore allows a precise evaluation of the complicated details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique enables an accurate characterization of pathologies, including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
gnorance of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC) is a causal treatment zzt. not possible.
Most of the currently available studies on oral IC therapy have not been conducted in a randomized, double-blind, or placebo-controlled manner and thus do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
To date, there is therefore no uniform standard for oral IC therapy.
We report on a 39-year-old Turk who, after a severe sunburn, developed multiple scaly papers on his back.
Clinic and Histopathology show the typical image of disseminated epidermolytic acanthome of the skin.
These are benign skin changes and are clinically similar to Darier's follicular dyskeratosis, seborrheic keratoses or Warzen's planus.
Ultrastructurally, the keratinocytes show premature and defective cornation.
dermolytic acanthomes are harmless, acquired skin changes and must be distinguished from severe, congenital cornification disorders, which show the same histological phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
n order to reduce intra- and post-operative blood loss, antifibrinolytically active substances are frequently used today in interventions with extracorporeal circulation (EKZ) in cardioanaesthesia.
n the same time, however, there are concerns about their potentials as a trigger for thrombotic complications.
n the present case, therefore, the effectiveness of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac operations under ECZ should be compared with each other.
Diagnostic imaging of manubrosternal joint arthritis in the context of psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient is described.
participation of the Manubriosteral Joint (Synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of Psoriasis arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional X-ray diagnostics and arthrosonography of manubro-sternal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
In the period from January 1994 to June 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy due to endophthalmitis at the Leipzig University Eye Clinic.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first patient group of the "Endophthalmitis vitrectomy study".
n this retrospective work, the functional results of the operative treatment should be examined.
Heinriche experienced in his childhood the episode of a fantastic pseudology.
The determining factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this work.
The effectiveness and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late forms of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis as well as the therapeutic effect depending on the HLA B27 feature are to be tested.
In the present study, the medical history of a patient with severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms since the age of 14 is presented.
It is not a separate obsessive-compulsive disorder, but a schizophrenia masked by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
Under the therapy of schizophrenic symptoms exacerbating at the age of 31 with clozapine, there are neither psychotic symptoms nor a significant compulsive symptom in the one-year catamnesis.
While the literature increasingly points to compulsive symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication, mostly in the indication area of chronic schizophrenic psychoses, here - as far as the author is aware - the rare case of compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia improved by clozapine is described.
The importance of differential diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorders for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed on a case-by-case basis.
The isomorphic irritation effect (Koebner phenomenon) is a disease-specific skin reaction to unspecific skin irritation.
t is reported about the triggering of such a Koebner phenomenon in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient by a UV-B light test with strengths above 0.055 J/cm2.
Furthermore, the case of a 28-year-old patient is described, in whom new psoriasis foci developed after a varicella infection in the viral florescences.
Since the person concerned planned to stay abroad in Africa for several months, a detailed anamnesis, clinical and laboratory chemical investigations were carried out.
The presentation was made to exclude an oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to ask about genetic risk factors to develop one, and to ask whether rheumatic factors can occur as a vaccination reaction;
experiences and results are reported with 13 early reconstructions of large complex defects in the head-neck area with 8 microvascular anastomosed forearm transplants and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major islet lobes.
Complete rag losses did not occur in any case.
more functional and aesthetic results were achieved with the free forearm transplant, but the operation times required for reconstruction were relatively long.
Disadvantages of the pectoralis major rag are primarily poor modelability and a limited radius of rotation.
was used in cases where due to local and general problems the use of a free microvascular graft would have been associated with a greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli that can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically results in an activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, which is characterized by an increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This enables the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
while until now the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was primarily considered as a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, there have recently been indications that exogenous factors can put endothelial cells into a state of readiness for inflammation even without the mediation of cytokines.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Endothelial cells are therefore not only subject to the control of tissue-generic mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.), but can also be directly influenced in their function by external skin changes.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, especially after combined cataract/glaucoma operations, are an indication for local administration of rTPA.
We report on our results.
a case of the benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node (Synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
their diagnostic criteria include, in addition to the structure of myofibroblastic cells arranged in palisade-like sections (with immunohistologic positivity for vimentin and actin), hemorrhage zones accentuated to the periphery as well as the occurrence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
knowledge of this tumor entity is important for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasms.
Obstruction and kinking could be reduced by the increased strength of 2 parallel inner rails and a re-formation of the dam of the proximal hollow system could be achieved.
n addition to the urine flow within the splints, this technique also enables an increased flow between the splints, which is considered to be a crucial mechanism of urine passage when the urethral splints are lying down.
n cases of extrinsic ureteral compression, in which the insertion of a singular internal splint cannot achieve a sufficient regression of the ecstasy of the preceding intra- and extrarenal cavity system, the simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral internal double-J ureteral splints should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication therapy alternative that can save some patients the insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive measures.
f the so-called minimally invasive methods (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/APLD/laser decompression/chemonucleolysis) available for the treatment of lumbar intervertebral disc events, the intradiscal application of Chymopapain represents the method with the longest clinical application duration and experience.
long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
careful attention to the indication and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis enables an efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
In a prospective study, the value of diuresesonography compared to the diuresenephrogram ("gold standard") in children with urinary transport disorders should be investigated.
Today, micrographic surgery is an indispensable therapeutic method in the treatment of basal tumors.
The method has been further developed and modified in the last 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three processes have the same objective:
radical tumor removal while protecting the non-infested tissue of the environment.
However, they have significant differences with regard to the technique of tumor excision, the fixation of the histological incisions and the histological evaluation of the preparation.
A methodological inventory is carried out and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency time between the primary trauma and the malignant transformation is about 30 years.
The "Marjolin Ulcus" is characterized by a more aggressive behavior towards other squamous cell carcinomas.
n a case of a 65-year-old patient with the lesion on the right back of the hand and regional lymph node metastases we report on the combined radiation and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after a correspondingly wide local excision was covered with a retrogradely styled A. radialis rag.
Spinal cord opioids cause good analgesia in a wide variety of surgical and non-surgical pain states.
There are fewer central and systemic side effects than in the epidural administration of local anesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
the effectiveness of this technique as well as the combination of opioids and local anesthetics in postoperative pain therapy is presented, also in the context of patient-controlled epidural on-demand analgesia (PCA, "patient controlled analgesia").
The intrathecal application mode is attributed various advantages over the epidural one.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
It seems that the neurotoxicity of opioids depends on different forms of administration.
regarding the quality of analgesia, the serious side effects, the amount of opioid administered or the postoperative lung function, there is no clinical advantage of a thoracic over a lumbar injection.
There are probably indications that the type of pain therapy has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and/or opioids is the method of first choice for patients with high preoperative risk and at the same time cost-effective.
Through the cooperation of the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) with the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardized epicutaneous tests at the participating centers are recorded centrally in Germany.
For the present study, the data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were retrospectively evaluated separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, Nickel, Perfume Mix, Perubalsam and Thiomersal showed the most frequent reactions;
For 1995, differentiated allergenists for defined patient groups (by gender, age, eczema localization, geographic region, occupation, sensitization) and special questions were also created.
For Nickel, fragrance mix and Perubalsam, the percentage of men showed significantly fewer positive reactions than for women.
Younger patients reacted more frequently to Thiomersal, older to medical External.
Medical allergens were also frequently positive in patients with leg eczema, while occupational allergens were increasingly found in hand eczema patients.
Nickel and fragrance mix allergy sufferers had higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens compared to the general population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not recognizable.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve the quality of the diagnosis and prophylaxis of contact allergies.
Approximately 95% of all people infected with M. leprae (who have come into contact) do not have an open outbreak of the disease.
Clinical appearance is determined not so much by the direct effects of the bacterial infection as by the T-cell mediated immune response.
This overview article takes into account current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment and diagnosis of leprosy.
Recently, a large number of studies have been presented for the quantitative study of the Tyndall phenomenon in the aqueous humor (KW) by means of laser tyndallometry.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BKS in comparison with the Tyndall intensity in the KW for uveitides of different localization, it should be investigated by way of example to what extent the Tyndall increase is actually caused by a BKS disturbance.
The present experimental study investigates the influence of acamprosate, a glutamatergen modulator, as well as the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E, on the neurological deficit after incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses has failed to this day.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglactides, kaprolactones and other polyglactine-containing substances has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The pronounced defense reaction against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units, which are absolutely necessary for the regeneration of neurites.
Positive animal experimental test results do not stand up to clinical scrutiny, as in animal experiments, poor regeneration performance can occur despite an impaired regeneration pathway.
Morbidity due to acute and chronic genital infections and their long-term consequences constitutes the greatest gynecological risk for HIV-infected women.
two-thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of urogenital infections, one-third cervical dysplasia.
In a quarter, chronic symptoms and long-term effects of ascending genital infections occurred in the course.
ven though the increased incidence of cervical carcinoma (up to 5%) has been incorporated into the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other AIDS-typical opportunistic infections, but it mostly occurs before the actual symptoms.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea (17%) or hypermenorrhea were increasingly observed.
Premature labor (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, premature birth are the main complications in pregnancy.
A progression of maternal HIV infection through pregnancy was not observed.
Risks for peripartum infection transmission to the fetus include advanced HIV infection of the mother with high HIV-RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with childbirth such as preterm birth, premature labor, amniotic infection, duration of bladder prolapse and labor, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of an increased maternal-fetal HIV-1 transmission rate can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8%), by primary low-contamination caesarean section binding (4-6%) and most successfully by primary section and simultaneous pre-, intra- and post-natal administration of AZT (<2%).
dendritic cells take a central position in the initialization of the immune response, because they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system, which can activate T lymphocytes via the MHC receptor.
Clinical studies in patients with therapy-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that in vitro dendritic cells sensitized with tumor antigen can be successfully used in vivo for immunotherapy.
Since hardly any basic data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in tumor tissue and their function are known for laryngeal carcinoma, in the present study the localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T- and B-lymphocytes and macrophages in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and the Glottis was studied immunohistologically.
The results show that dendritic cells, in contrast to T-lymphocytes, are primarily detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
Comparison with the clinical parameters shows that the patients in whom the number of dendritic cells in the carcinoma was low (<100/cells/mm2) had the lowest postoperative survival time (1 year).
This indicates that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma is a favorable prognostic factor for the disease.
n increased homocysteine is considered a significant factor in the increased incidence of arteriosclerosis in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
In the present study, in patients with renal insufficiency, in addition to homocysteine, the metabolites of its two degradation pathways, transsulfurization (formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remoethylation (formation of methionine, methylmalonate and 2-methylcitrate), were also determined.
We report 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The suspected diagnosis is based on cat scratch in the anamnesis and the typical findings of lymph node swelling in the area of the primary lesion.
n order to obtain an insight into the frequency and clinic of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of the patients cared for in the years 1984-94 in a university polyclinic or a dermatologist's practice was carried out on the basis of patient files and in some cases also by follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was then 0.05%.
Out of a total of 56 affected patients (31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The median lifespan was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years, the median duration of illness 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
46.4% of the patients had an atopy, 23.2% suffered from other forms of urticaria (cholingeric, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heme-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests were only positive in individual cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with mostly only moderate symptomatic improvement.
n treatment with antibiotics (penicillin 1-2 Mio IE/d over 2-4 weeks, n=18 or tetracycline 2 g/d over 2 weeks, n=10) a complete remission occurred in 13 patients and an improvement was achieved in 8.
In 20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%), spontaneous remission occurred over a 6.5-year follow-up period.
The surprisingly good treatment successes with antibiotic therapy underline the need for further clarification of the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
The case of a 56-year-old patient is reported, who primarily presented with lumbago.
Laboratory chemistry, radiologically as well as histopathologically, the finding primarily spoke for the presence of a spondylodiscytis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebral body, a dorsoventral stabilization was carried out.
n the repeatedly obtained sample excisions, the image of a nonspecific inflammation was found histologically.
n the biopsy carried out as part of the implant removal, a highly malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could be histologically detected.
Chemotherapy according to the CHOP scheme and radiation therapy treatment were performed.
Lymphomas of the spinal column should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodisitis, especially in advanced courses.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complexes (NEO-fractures) are associated in over 90% of cases with midfacial fractures and/or fractures of the frontal base.
naccompanying skull base fractures run in up to 70% of cases through the roof of the ethmoidal cells or the fibrous lamina.
Different concepts exist for the treatment of isolated NEO fractures as well as combined NEO and skull base fractures in midface fractures.
Between 1990-1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Clinic for Oral, Maxillofacial and Facial Surgery of the Cantonal Hospital of Lucerne.
n the remaining 25 patients with NEO and mid-facial fractures without involvement of the skull base were repositioned and cared for via a subcranial access route.
47 patients could be followed up for up to 4 years and their data evaluated.
The Lucerne Therapy Concept for the extra- and transcranial care of fractures of the ethmoidal bone with participation of the base of the skull and the middle face is presented.
however, she is at high risk of bleeding intraoperatively and postoperatively.
In an obese 50-year-old patient with familial hypophosphatasia and V. a. Phlebothrombosis, a femoral neck fracture should be surgically treated.
ntraoperatively there was a sudden drop in the endtidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in paCO2 and circulatory arrest.
Resuscitation measures with cardiac massage and intravenous administration of adrenaline and orciprenaline were initiated immediately.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was ended with a provisional wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
In case of V. a. fulminant pulmonary embolism, systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was performed with continued cardiac massage.
After 21/4 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11/2 hours after the onset of lysis, moderately stable hemodynamics could be achieved with continuous, highest-dose catecholamine administration and volume substitution.
As a result of lysis and loss of coagulation, a massive transfusion was required.
28. The day after resuscitation, the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of "pulmonary embolism" was made on the basis of the clinic, the Kapnometries, the blood gas analysis and the ECG.
n view of the emergency situation with continuous resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were dispensed with.
For anesthesia with the new inhalation anesthetic Sevofluran, approximately 5% of the total amount supplied is metabolized.
The extent of the resulting serum peak values of inorganic fluoride determine v. a. the hepatic defluoridation rate, the total amount of anesthetic administered and the solubility of the anesthetic gas, expressed by its blood-gas distribution coefficients.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies have investigated whether fluoride exposure from sevoflurane can lead to increased renal complications.
neither in animal experiments, nor in routine clinical use or in the case of prolonged anesthesia duration, nor when used in patients with insufficient kidneys, however, could an increased renal risk potential for fluoride exposure after Sevofluran be demonstrated.
The recently demonstrated low intrarenal metabolism of Sevofluran - in contrast to Enfluran and especially methoxyfluran - is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of Sevofluran.
The threshold value for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 μmol/l still used in the literature was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane, but has no validity in connection with the anesthetic gases sevoflurane, but also enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those encountered after narcosene with sevoflurane, among others, are therefore to be classified as clinically harmless.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence for direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
The choice of macroscopic preparation method is of fundamental importance for the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease.
The best results are provided by the base-parallel lamination of the heart ventricles to be performed after fixation and the transverse lamination of the possibly additionally decalcified coronary arteries, even if no postmortem coronary angiography can precede.
With this procedure, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, longitudinal, circumferential and transmural expansion of infarcts, their age and consequential states can be better detected and assigned to the respective coronary supply area than with the conventional opening of the unfixed hearts following the blood flow.
At the coronary arteries, the degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenosis, plaque hemorrhages, parietal and occlusive thromboses can be assessed just as unharmed as the therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in the case of acute cardiac death and territorial ischaemias that have only survived for a short time.
By systematically taking transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can also be detected in correlation with coronary morphology and the coronary supply area.
recent prospectively randomized studies show, however, that an adjuvant postoperative irradiation or chemotherapy after an R0 resection does not provide an additional survival advantage.
n contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for both squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, esophagogastric transition and stomach are so far inconclusive.
n patients with potentially resectable tumors, no convincing prognostic gain by preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combined radio-/chemotherapy could be demonstrated in several Phase-III studies compared to resection alone.
However, a survival advantage with this multimodal procedure is to be expected only in response to the pretreatment and subsequent complete tumor resection.
n comparison with preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radio/chemotherapy improves the response rate, at least in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and lethality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be carried out as part of prospective studies on strictly selected patients in specialized centers with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This disease, which is unusual for childhood, is usually only associated with certain metabolic diseases.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders, or "hysterical" symptom formations are coming to be understood as processing traumatic childhood and adolescent experiences such as abuse or maltreatment.
Association with induced depersonalization, derealization and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
assimilable memories of trauma have a re-traumatizing effect and must be repelled, for example, by eating disorders, substance abuse, self-harming behavior or social "acting".
Against this psychodynamic background, we present a trauma therapy that implements the experiences of hypnotherapy and catathym-imaginative psychotherapy:
n the preparation phase, a secure inner place and contact with inner helpers is created in the resource-oriented Imagination.
The actual trauma work consists of a dosed, stably confronting, but as little as possible re-traumatizing introduction to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner consolation and hiding.
In the final phase, it is again about the resource-oriented focus on creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record the developments at a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the last 20 years regarding diagnoses and the proportion of multiple disabilities.
A chronic, benign intracranial hypertension can have many causes.
n addition to the etiologically unclarified occurrence in obese young women ("pseudotumor of the brain"), a venous drainage obstruction is possible as a cause.
was investigated to what extent the visus remains stable in the long-term course after vitrectomy in diabetic retinopathy, and what causes and risk factors for a deterioration of the visus can be identified.
HIV is easy to inactivate due to the majority of disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the gateway.
After inoculation, HIV replication may have started after 24 hours, and HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody tests can be used to detect the emerging HIV infection within four to twelve weeks, under therapy the antibody response is attenuated;
with nucleic acid tests, the detection succeeds from about the eleventh day.
n nearly 100 years of development, countless endogenous, exogenous and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
f the currently favoured autologous tissues, the central patellar tendon third, a quadruple tendon transplant of Pes anserinus (M. semitendinosus/M. gracilis) and a central quadriceps tendon transplant have the greatest clinical importance.
With some limitations, the use of body transplants is also justified.
The individual transplants have specific differences in biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical studies, a clear superiority of one of the transplants mentioned could not be verified.
n transplant selection, the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments must be taken into account.
Care of complex ligament injuries and revision cases requires careful, preoperative planning with possibly modified transplant selection.
The rare course of the development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
n the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrent tumor developed malignantly in the area of the left corner of the mouth 2.
The histological work-up showed in each case a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands, parts of a pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be detected.
The clinic, diagnostics, therapy and histological features taking into account the literature are discussed.
Coronary lime is an indication of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately with electron beam tomography.
The clinical importance differs depending on whether the lime screening is carried out in patients with already known coronary heart disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically significant sub-aspect of coronary heart disease.
In this work, frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects, with regard to ergometry, are presented, as well as indications for prognostic evaluation and conclusions for practice.
We report 3 patients with a combination of chronic immunothrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes, respectively.
In the 3 patients, the two diseases occurred as part of an autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
n contrast, we observed no case of ITP among about 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
n patients with chronic immunothrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, further diseases should therefore be excluded from the form circle of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
nsuring the airway after upper airway surgery can be problematic in certain patients.
Care must therefore be taken to ensure safe reintubation if necessary.
Two patients are reported who, due to a recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma or inoperable hypopharyngeal carcinoma, had considerable intubation difficulties and thus high-grade risk factors for intubation and possibly re-intubation in general anesthesia.
A fiberoptically placed endotracheal guidewire served as a post- or preoperative retubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and stage classification of laryngeal tumors.
A very precise knowledge of the submucosal tumor propagation pathways, the diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their consequences for the stage division and therapy are indispensable for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
CT and MRI are both highly sensitive investigations for the detection of neoplastic infiltration of the preepiglottic space, the paraglottic space, the subglottis and the cartilage.
However, the specificity is less high with both methods than initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumor spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two tomography procedures is important from a clinical point of view, as it makes it possible to rule out neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
n the presence of submucosal tumors, both CT and MRI provide valuable indications of a possible etiology, the extent of submucosal growth and the appropriate biopsy site.
Implantation of cardioverters/defibrillators (ICD) reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with terminal renal insufficiency have an increased incidence of coronary heart disease.
There are only a small number of cases of myocardial vascularization by means of PTCA in patients requiring chronic dialysis, which together suggest a high rate of periinterventional complications and a high rate of restenosis.
We examined restenosis rates in 23 patients with terminal renal insufficiency (17 men, 6 women, middle age:
52.5 +/- 18.3 years).
fter a primarily successful PTCA, all patients underwent a coronary angiography within 6-12 months.
n angiographic control, 12 patients complained of the reappearance of pectanginous symptoms.
chemically, the patients had hypertriglyceridemia (265 +/- 160 mg/dl) and hypercholesterolemia (258 +/- 53 mg/dl) with a low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/dl) with a significant increase in fibrinogen concentration (481 +/- 114 mg/dl).
The case of a 64-year-old patient is described, in which, as a result of increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic rings, complete instability of the pelvis occurred within a year.
trospectively, a trivial trauma for the pelvic area was assumed to be the triggering event.
n view of the X-ray morphology of the multiple pseudoarthroses, the suspicion of a malignant event was initially in the foreground in the differential diagnosis.
For hip pain in childhood, a wide spectrum of a wide variety of clinical pictures comes into consideration.
The non-traumatic causes are mainly included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, history, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed in order, on the one hand, to avoid superfluous examinations and, on the other hand, not to miss necessary therapeutic steps.
Examples demonstrate some common, but also rarer, clinical pictures.
n the iatrogenic termination of the Trochanter major in the prosthetic care of the femoral neck fracture seems to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the legs during prosthesis implantation from the so-called "back access" could be predisposing.
In the few literature sources, the early functional conservative treatment is recommended for the isolated traumatic trochanter rupture used here for comparison, even in the case of considerable fragment dislocation.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care is still controversially debated.
The present work represents the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
fter an overview of various methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are examined in more detail on the basis of data from quality assurance.
F-8 is used to investigate relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, further patient utilization behavior, and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship.
This shows that the relationship between treatment results and satisfaction is not particularly large.
Dissatisfied patients differ from satisfied patients in further claiming behavior.
The relationship between satisfaction and the therapeutic working relationship is partly clear for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The effects found are relatively very large, but from an absolute point of view these effects are rather small.
This is due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction after their treatment.
Changes in the Alternation Process of Men are similar to changes in younger, hypogonadal men.
though testosterone levels on average decrease with age, correlations between middle-aged and older symptoms and testosterone levels are inconsistent and small.
. This is due, among other things, to methodological limitations of existing studies, the high variability of testosterone values in old age, unclear reference values for older men and diverse influences (health status and behavior) on testosterone values.
A 68-year-old patient with dyspnoea that had been present for five days underwent sonography prior to planned lysis therapy after nuclear medicine indicated a stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
found a right atrial, floating thrombus.
n the case of an existing acute vital hazard, an ultra-high-dose streptokinase short-term lysis (UHSK) with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely resolved and the thrombosis of the legs had largely resolved.
The treated patients were predominantly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in traffic accidents.
50% of the patients had a single fracture, the remaining patients had either concomitant injuries or polytrauma.
The duration of hospitalization averaged 17 days and the use of crutches averaged 21 weeks, which speaks for a relatively rapid healing process.
n the majority (85%) the treatment proceeded without complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in patients with open fractures in 9 (1.8%) and in patients with closed fractures in only 2 cases (0.4%), which is within the usual norms.
our results and experience, we believe that the treatment of fractures of the femur diaphysis with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared to other treatment methods.
The scope of remote metastasis diagnostics in head-neck tumors is still controversial.
n the present retrospective study, the courses of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract were used to investigate which factors influence the frequency and localization of distant metastasis.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 cases (1.6%) at the time of primary tumor diagnosis.
The distant metastasis rate correlated positively with the initial tumor stage (p<0.00001) as well as with the manifestation of a local and/or regional recurrence (p<0.00001) or a second tumor outside the HNO regions (p<0.0005).
The parameters 'Primary tumor localization' and 'histopathological tumor grading', on the other hand, did not have an independent predictive value, but reflected essentially different frequencies of the tumor stages.
t the time of the initial diagnosis, the search for distant metastases in tumors of categories T1-3 N0 can be limited to an X-ray examination of the thorax.
Further diagnostics, consisting of abdominal sonography, skeletal scintigraphy and/or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, are indicated in locoregionally advanced tumors, in recurrent and in secondary tumors outside the HNO regions.
However, one should always ask oneself the question of the therapeutic consequences in individual cases.
This article gives a brief overview of the history of spinal surgery from the late 19th century to the present day.
Simmel belonged to a small circle of former psychoanalysts who, with great enthusiasm and in "productive orthodoxy", sought the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine.
he is the founder of the first psychoanalytic polyclinic 1919 in Berlin and the first psychoanalytic hospital ("Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") 1927 in Germany.
rediscovering him as a pioneer can also be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of a wide variety of historical divisions in professional societies.
cross generations, he is a credible professional identification figure, especially for the new specialist in "Psychotherapeutic Medicine".
nevertheless, the emphasis on Simmels should not lead to the fact that the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine, who were forced to leave Germany due to their Jewish descent, are no longer properly thought of.
In principle, 4 post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be influenced by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip dislocations and subluxations, Femur head necrosis, Pseudoarthrosis, Deformities.
The clinical, overview radiographic and computed tomography/sonographic analysis of leg geometry is of central importance here.
Given the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfect tailor-made solution can be the answer to a very individual problem.
The aim of the study was the metaanalytic processing of all available randomized, controlled studies in which dexamethasone alone or in combination with other antiemetics was used for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative phase (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur in the context of numerous systemic diseases.
n certain cases, subjective symptoms and long-term vision-threatening complications can only be addressed by systemic immunosuppression.
Movement disturbances of the vertebral joints lead to unilateral compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since herniated disc occurs on the compression side in more than 80% of cases, a causal relationship must be assumed.
Since this disturbance also reduces the intervertebral foramen, the lack of space in the event of a herniated disc becomes even greater.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation developed for the malignant changes in the area of the pancreatic head is very extensive and burdened with a high perioperative morbidity as well as lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the organ-saving duodenum-containing pancreatic head resection also represents a sufficiently radical procedure in benign tumors of the pancreatic head.
This operation was able to be carried out in the patients in a blood-saving and almost complication-free manner.
n a median follow-up time of 3 years, 6 out of 7 patients were symptom-free, in a patient who underwent surgery due to a gastronome, even increased gastrin values were found in the late postoperative period.
n comparison with the preoperative function test, it was shown that the endocrine as well as exocrine function was only slightly impaired by the operation.
With strict indications, benign tumors in the area of the pancreatic head can thus be treated by a duodenum-containing pancreatic head resection adequately, sufficiently radically, with few complications and without permanent restriction of the exo- and endocrine functions.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable method in the treatment of symptomatic and/or prognostically significant bradycardia cardiac arrhythmias.
About every sixth patient dies in the subsequent period after pacemaker implantation from a sudden cardiac death, which is predominantly attributable to the progression of the pre-existing underlying cardiac disease.
n recent years, however, it has also become clear that a permanent electrostimulation of the heart can harbor the risk of triggering and/or aggravating life-threatening ventricular cardiac arrhythmias.
particularly in the case of advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-induced R-on-T-phenomena, "short-lang" sequences and cognitive defects, e.g. during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, can trigger stimulation-induced secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias, among others.
n view of the fact that such pacing-related events are an avoidable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding of the pathomechanisms involved and a corresponding awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable, but above all safer for the patient.
g, i.e. the determination of the extent of the disease, is used to select patients who are suitable for surgical therapy with curative objectives, or to define those carcinoma carriers who do not benefit from a surgical intervention and are given alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy).
computed tomography (CT) of the thorax (including liver and adrenal glands), sonography of the upper abdomen and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for the staging of bronchial carcinoma.
For specific questions, e.g. after a thoracic wall infiltration, and in patients with a contrast medium allergy, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed in addition to or as an alternative to a CT.
urological techniques such as, for example, positron emission tomography with [18F]2-Fluoro-2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (FDG-PET) to assess lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111-Octreotide/Somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma, as well as Thallium-201 SPECT, whose clinical importance is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly being used for staging lung tumors.
Methods that are currently still being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic-molecular MRI contrast agents or tumor receptor-based nuclear medicine methods, could play an important role in the staging of bronchial carcinoma in the future.
f tumor surgical interventions in the abdominal cavity, the retroperitoneum and the small pelvis, there may be damage to the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs.
Since it is often a question of patients of sexually active and also reproductive age, the prevention of such side effects in tumor therapy is given special importance.
pairment of the erection or disturbances of ejaculation can occur after surgical, radiation therapy or drug therapy of various tumors.
Through an in-depth understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now a high percentage avoidable.
f damage to the corresponding nerve pathways due to the necessary radicality of the surgical procedure in order to curatively treat the tumor disease cannot be avoided, sexual dysfunctions for these patients of sexually active and also reproductive age are a significant restriction of the quality of life.
However, both ejaculation disorders and erectile dysfunctions can be treated by a number of therapeutic modalities in almost all cases.
The subclavian artery is increasingly used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
little is known about the perfusion characteristics of the neck vessels at different cannulation locations.
there are reports of a truck driver after squeezing trauma of both legs who developed atypical hepar-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) under drug-induced thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin;
n addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with an increase in platelets with positive antibody detection against heparin:
n our first patient contact on the 6th day after the accident, a deep leg vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and an impending compartment syndrome was also surgically cleaved on the left lower leg.
fter excluding other possible causes for these reactions, antibodies against Heparin (Heparin-Platelet Factor-4-Complex-Detection) could be detected 2 days later.
s after flushing an intravenous access with less than 50 IU of an unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident the patient showed the full picture of an anaphylactic reaction which could be immediately interrupted by cortisone administration.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, otherwise referred to as characteristic of HIT, is only one of the possible forms of the allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction against heparin, which takes place on the cell surface of the thrombocytes.
accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the different forms of heparin allergy type I-IV.
Type I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without thrombocyte drop and type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
In 1991, basal cell adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the 2nd edition of the "Histological Typing of Salivary Gland Tumors" of the World Health Organization (WHO).
The first description goes back to Ellis u. Wiskovitch (1990) of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumoricity accounts for about 2.9% of all malignant salivary gland tumors.
In 90% of cases, parotis is the site of this tumor.
Oral Manifestations are described only as Kasuistiken;
The case presented here concerns a middle-aged woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists of an operative tumor extirpation with sufficient safety distance and histologically controlled tumor freedom of all resection margins.
According to the current state of knowledge, basal cell adenocarcinoma has a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenous metastasis rate of 10% occurring up to 10 years after first manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In the present work, a modified animal experimental model of kidney xenotransplantation was developed, within the framework of which the course of a hyperacute rejection reaction is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys as donor organs were transplanted into Wistar rats as recipient animals, with end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta, or V. cava and ureteral drainage by means of splinting being used for diuresis monitoring.
The objective of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation with soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on renal xenografts.
total 24 Xenotransplantations were performed and randomized with 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group), or 50 mg/kg sCR1 as 3-ml-Bolus (treatment group).
The soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in terms of extending graft survival time (from 10.5 +/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction of complement activity in the sCR1 group could be observed, which is due to a modulatory effect of sCR1.
10 min after the start of reperfusion, thrombocyte aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries and interstitial infiltrates were histologically found in the control group.
The kidney transplants treated with sCR1, on the other hand, showed a significantly reduced intravasal thrombus formation and less interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistologic study revealed an equally reduced deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and in the interstitium in the therapy group.
far in our house 52 laparoscopic interventions have been carried out on the gallbladder, stomach, colon and groin with the robotic arm controlled by the voice of the operator for the optical guidance.
The field of view is directly determined by operator commands.
n all interventions, the control of the robot arm was precise, the voice recognition was accurate and without technical problems.
29 procedures could be performed by one operator alone as a "solo surgery".
n another 20 procedures, only one assistant was used in addition to the operator.
The robot can be easily and successfully used by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
lation of vascular complications by the DSA in kidney and pancreas transplants requires an invasive intervention in mostly diabetic pre-damaged vessels, and the use of iodine-containing contrast agents can show nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis is to be included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated by a case of tuberculosis coxitis, which was treated in cooperation between the accident surgeon and the medical clinic of the Minden Clinic.
A differentiated diagnostic procedure with imaging and microbiological methods allows a targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy of operative endoprosthetic hip joint replacement and antituberculosis chemotherapy.
fter critical evaluation of the therapeutic results and discussion of the literature, the presented procedure is successful, both with regard to the local remediation of the Infection, as well as the functional result.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce the quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for the safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive investigations.
The internal electrical cardioversion represents an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying the method.
recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization that favor an interruption of the wavefronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion thus appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the cardioversion mechanisms in chronic atrial fibrillation differ from those in acute atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications in Klavikula fractures are rare.
They occur as primary, more frequently as secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with narrowing of the costoclavicular spaces.
Casuistically, the observation of a late lesion of the Plexus brachialis as a result of a fracture of the clavicle with pseudoarthrosis and excessive callus formation is reported.
Type I diabetes mellitus is one of the autoimmune diseases and often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases.
The subject of our investigations was the determination of the coincidence of celiac disease and type I diabetes in the hospital of the diabetes outpatient clinic of the children's clinic of the TU Dresden.
report a granulomatous inflammatory reaction following the use of resorbable interference screws to fix a patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament replacement plastic surgery, which led to a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
logically, osteolyses were found in the area of the inserted screws.
histologically there was a sterile inflammation with detection of foreign body giant cells.
r Plasmocytomes of the kidney represent a grofle Rarit‰t.
f So far, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
A 64-year-old patient is presented, in whom an operated kidney tumor proved histologically to be a Plasmocytoma.
On the basis of this case, the procedure for this disease is discussed.
In multiple myeloma with renal involvement, nephrectomy is only indicated for renal complications.
The prognostic significance of a primary renal involvement by the Plasmocytome is unclear.
As part of a multicentric, prospective, clinical study from 17 German clinics, a treatment indication corresponding to the fracture type or a suitable therapy method was chosen for 646 documented distal radius fractures in adults.
The success of the primary treatment was evaluated by creating a practice-related score.
known so far are numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases, which follow the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
In 1992 Moulin et al.
[40] 5 patients with an acquired stripe-like, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he singled out as a new entity.
We report on another patient with this dermatosis.
The essential criteria are a strip-shaped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without inflammatory pre-stage and without subsequent sclerosis or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of the Blaschko lines.
We propose the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this disease.
It includes rules of conduct and, to improve the muscular situation, a special exercise program, which can also be carried out safely as home training.
In a group instruction, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained by practicing simple movement sequences and basic knowledge of anatomy, arthrosis formation and knee-friendly and stress-relieving behaviors are taught.
The efficiency of the "knee school" as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonorrhea was demonstrated in a prospective randomized study.
Correct alignment and size of the implants is of outstanding importance for successful and durable knee joint replacement.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are shown.
f the Erlangen glaucoma study, the blue-on-yellow VEP has proven to be suitable for the safe separation of sick patients from safe controls.
As part of a retrospective analysis of the air rescue service, the out-of-clinic first aid of 274 acutely injured (58%) or sick (42%) children up to the age of 14 was first examined with regard to the temporal occurrence of the operations, compliance with the aid period, the age and gender distribution, the degrees of severity, the causes of trauma and injury patterns, the nature of the acute pediatric disease, the pre-hospital emergency diagnosis and therapy, as well as the means of transport and the target clinic on the basis of the emergency medical documentation.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Orthopedic University Clinic in Mainz has been examining which clinical pictures can be sensibly used with low-energy extracorporeal shockwave therapy.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with increasing age, but also with pathological processes.
As a basis for the interpretation of patient examinations in diseases of the hematopoietic system, the age- and gender-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow cavity were analyzed in the context of the present study on subjects.
Therapy control is currently not possible for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and post-cardioversion condition due to atrial fibrillation.
Patients without an actual tendency to relapse are therefore sometimes unnecessarily exposed to an antiarrhythmic therapy regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic side effects.
prerequisite of the P-wave analysis under sinus rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
P-wave triggering must take place, the filtering of the P-wave must be carried out bidirectionally or with an FIR filter.
Standardization of the method is urgently desirable.
n fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in P-wave duration from patients without this arrhythmia.
Sotalol as a class III antiarrhythmic does not influence the P-wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P-wave is significantly different.
summarizing, the signal averaging of the P-wave after optimization of the method enables an identification of patients with a high recurrence probability of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities to human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
for an efficient pain therapy is the knowledge of pain genesis.
n most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the nociceptive afflictions are routed through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is underpinned by injuries to the nervous system.
Central sensitization mechanisms at the level of the spinal cord and the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to a chronication of such pain.
The therapy of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is presented using treatment algorithms.
n addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, especially in the case of chronic pain, co-analgesics and opioid analgesics have a firm place.
When prescribing these substances, defined pain therapeutic standards must be observed.
s with local anesthetics as monotherapy for chronic pain are now obsolete.
n the case of post-traumatic pain, on the other hand, a defined series of peripheral nerve blockades or trigger point infiltrations can be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockades are of particular importance in the diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic pain (SMP).
The significance of irradiation of the pelvic lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node positive prostate carcinoma is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific issues are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
n T3/4 carcinomas, the additional irradiation of the paraaortic lymphatic drainage pathways compared to the irradiation of the pelvinal lymph nodes alone does not bring any improvement in overall survival or progression-free or tumor-specific survival and is obsolete.
Data on long-term side effects are only available from studies with outdated irradiation techniques.
he radiotherapy of the lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node positive prostate carcinoma is not a standard therapy but an individual decision and should be carried out as part of studies (e.g. ARO 95-3).
Because of the ambiguity of the clinical picture, however, only the pathomorphological examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as their special forms are presented and in particular the importance of neurogenic appendicitis in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by an accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be definitively supplied by a thin-caliber drainage.
n the case of a complicated pneumothorax, on the other hand, a large-caliber Bülau drainage is indicated.
The often acute life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinic, e.g. in ventilation patients, must be relieved immediately before further diagnosis.
A hematothorax due to a thoracic or abdominal trauma should be quickly treated with a Bülau drainage and, if necessary, surgically treated due to the risk of severe blood loss.
A spontaneous hematothorax also requires drainage and internal clarification.
The doctor in an internal intensive care unit must master the diagnosis and therapy of pneumothorax and hematothorax.
The question of this prospective case-by-case observational study in 12 intensive care patients was whether routine determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in intensive care patients provides additional information on clinical findings, routine laboratory investigations, microbiology and radiology.
Similarly, lethality, overall injury severity, the likelihood of bleeding complications and the proportion of pelvic concomitant injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, i.e. the pelvic injury with concomitant peripelvic soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femur fracture (floating hip) represent a special situation.
The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the care of organ lesions is the focus of interdisciplinary therapy.
Acetabulum fractures pose a particular challenge as joint fractures.
Surgical therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long-term results.
As the number of these additional pathologies increases, the long-term outcome deteriorates.
The primary accident-related cartilage damage appears to have a significant influence on the long-term outcome after acetabulum fractures.
n isolated calcifying atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused typical symptoms in a 56-year-old patient such as aortic muscular stenosis.
of note in the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta, as well as the extent of calcifications.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggested differential diagnosis of a calcifying aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection or a past aortis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of photoreceptors by catalysis of outer segments and is exposed to the regulation of blood lipids via percutaneous perfusion.
Since the uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids takes place via specific Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, the expression and regulation of these receptor types were investigated in the RPE.
Referring to the change of educational and social structures, medical habilitation as a proof of academic qualification has also been questioned recently.
n the discourse on the application and developments of reproductive techniques, the experience aspects of those affected take a back seat.
outside of medical treatment, many only seek help at a time when they are exhausted or very disappointed by the unsuccessful treatment attempts.
The skeleton is one of the most common metastasis localizations in metastatic mammary, prostate and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic therapy methods depends on the histology, the detection of extraskeletal metastases and the general condition of the patient.
For receptor-positive breast carcinomas and prostate carcinomas, hormone therapy is the therapy of first choice.
In the case of receptor-negative breast carcinoma, after failure of hormone therapy or when liver metastases are detected, chemotherapy is indicated.
In the case of small cell bronchial carcinomas, chemotherapy should always be performed.
Bone metastases of differentiated thyroid carcinomas are accessible to radioiodine therapy.
In the case of metastatic non-small cell bronchial carcinomas or renal cell carcinomas, the indication for systemic therapy is rather reserved and is limited to v. a. to younger patients and patients in sufficiently good general condition.
Difficulties exist in imaging a response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for the determination of bone degradation products in urine could prove valuable.
xamine the differential diagnosis and therapy of childhood back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve stretching pain.
The risk of becoming professionally infected with HIV is subjectively often considered high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
Hepatitis B is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
s are another important measure, there is e.g. B. a clear recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination of hospital workers.
n the case of injuries with HBV-containing material, a combined active and passive vaccination is carried out post-exposure.
There is no drug-based post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
n early therapy with interferon when HCV RNA is detected seems to have a high success rate.
a 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis in preparations of a lung biopsy obtained by videothoracoscopy.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothorax.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as an angiomyolipoma.
mmunohistochemical investigations with actin antibodies showed strong-positive reactions both in the muscle-differentiated tissue of the angiomyolipomas and in the smooth muscle proliferation rates of the lungs.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation, up to 5 cm in diameter, in the left frontal lobe.
Organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in the kidneys, lungs and probably also in the brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
nternational discussion of euthanasia issues as well as developments in Australia and Oregon point to an increasing tendency to give preference to medically assisted suicide over active killing - not least for reasons of societal acceptance.
The 1994 decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on assisted suicide by a psychiatrist provides an opportunity to examine this problem from a psychiatric point of view.
Nitrogen oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO-synthase (bNOS and ecNOS) in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate preparations were investigated histochemically and immunohistochemically.
By means of the NADPH-Diaphorase-(d-)reaction as well as immunohistochemically, a differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostate glands, the stroma and the vessels could be detected.
n the preparations with obstructive hyperplasia there seems to be a pronounced reduction of the nitrinergic innervation, whereby due to the small number of preparations no quantitative evaluation has yet been carried out.
n the area of the endothelium, a differentiated expression of the NOS depending on the vessel section could also be detected by means of the NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemically.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the area of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscle, regional blood circulation and secretion of the normal and hyperplastic prostate.
Because of heterogeneous patient groups and diverse ileus causes, the indication for surgery and the choice of surgical procedure in the small intestine is difficult to standardize.
A uniform procedure for the intraoperative handling of the intestine (strip, insertion of an intestinal splint) and the abdominal closure (technique, suture material) would be desirable.
hesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques of the small bowel fold continue to be used (in a relevant minority of clinics), with the Noble operation largely replaced by the Child-Phillips fold and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no reliable indications or contraindications for either Plicatures or for long probes and other operative measures.
n view of the frequency and socio-economic importance of the small intestine, it remains an important task for the future to change this.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive area of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
The reliable evaluation of the results achieved by reproductive medicine and their public discussion alone can make it possible to increase their social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment, while at the same time preventing misunderstandings.
In addition, such an analysis represents a valuable tool for reliable advice to the affected couples.
gait characteristics and reduced muscle strength of depressive individuals have often been described in clinical literature, but so far hardly empirically investigated.
We detected various gait and force parameters using simple and standardized methods within a theoretical framework that is essentially based on classical clinical observations of depression.
20 hospitalized, depressive persons were examined using standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses, which recorded step length, average gait tempo, maximum gait tempo and 3-min gait distance, and compared with 20 healthy subjects.
The examination course was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement in symptoms.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy could be demonstrated, inter alia, in knee and elbow extension and also in all examined gait parameters.
The procedures used for the first time for psychiatric questions within the framework of the present pilot study are suitable for the reliable and low-stress investigation of relationships between depression and motor skills and can therefore be used in broader studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
This can lead to an acute glaucoma in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or a chronic glaucoma.
YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely leads to pressure regulation.
We report on the results after cataract surgery for Subluxatio lentis and glaucoma.
n 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS), the influence of autogenous training (AT) on the plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptides was investigated.
Compared to healthy controls (N), the scleroderma patients had significantly increased substance-P-plasma levels (x +/- s:
PS-patients 7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol/l, N 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/l).
Apart from point deviations, the VIP plasma concentrations showed no significant differences from the standard values (x +/- s:
-Patients 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/l, N 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol/l).
We describe 2 unrelated, German, male patients with typical Symptoms.
s up to the age of 3.2 and 4 years, respectively, both showed progressive neurological degradation, severe mental retardation, signs of multiplex dysostosis and memory phenomena in lymphocytes.
-L-Fukosidase-activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was greatly reduced (<3% of the normal value).
So far, the G401X mutation has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombuses in the right atrium are a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculo-atrial shunt systems.
We report on a 4.6-year-old girl who came to the inpatient admission with the signs of a subacute valve dysfunction.
ase-negative staphylococci and an increased liquoprotein were detected in the liquor.
The thrombus had to be removed by cardiac surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
With this routinely carried out test, strongly positive results for ketones were obtained during the autopsy of three people who died clearly as a result of freezing or hypothermia, without the glucose in the urine being increased at the same time.
Headspace gas chromatography was able to detect excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/L in all three urine samples.
A strongly positive Keto-Diabur-Test 5000 with normal glucose findings in the urine can thus serve as a diagnostic aid for the detection of death due to hypothermia.
In a prospective study of 94 patients with a traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint, it is examined to what extent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can make statements about the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide indications for the therapeutic procedure.
The infantile acrolocalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti-Syndrome) is described in connection with various infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, eruptively symmetrical papers and papulovesicles appeared on the extremities.
Virus serology indicated a fresh Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection, whereas serology was negative for hepatitis B virus.
luxations of the jaw joint occur as a result of trauma, joint disorders and changes in the muscular balance of the camusculature.
classifications are primarily oriented to the anatomical positional relationships of the dislocated jaw joint surfaces such as Luxation, Subluxation and Discusluxation.
etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic luxations.
xation of the jaw joint has been described as a complication in a number of neurological diseases.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent jaw joint dislocations as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the concept of neurogenic jaw joint dislocation.
males can lead to significant psychosocial stress.
The present study examined a) the coping behavior, quality of life and body experience of patients with fire pains and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
n 70 patients with fire paints, as part of the therapy with the flashlamp-pulsed dye laser, a test psychological examination was carried out in the areas of disease management, quality of life and body experience.
The clinical target criterion was the degree of lightening of the fires in the course of therapy.
Patients with fire pits had comparable high stress levels in terms of social anxieties as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with the size and darkness of the fireplaces.
n terms of helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, the patients with fire pains were significantly less burdened.
mpairments were also found in areas of quality of life and bodily experience.
Physical experience is influenced differently by disease management.
Since the brightening in the course of laser therapy correlates significantly with reduced psychosocial stress, flashlamp-pulsed dye laser therapy in fire paintings can also be considered effective with regard to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
The primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) represents a separate clinical picture, since the biological behavior, prognosis and treatment differ from the nodal lymphomas.
imaging methods are important in the search and staging of PGIL.
The gastrointestinal lymphomas show a variety of pathohistologic manifestations and a wide spectrum in imaging.
The increase of PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and the therapeutic possibilities.
A 43-year-old man had a Naevus sebaceus in the area of his right temple since birth.
The histopathological examination revealed 2 lesion-associated adnexal neoplasms:
a syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined occurrence of these 3 Entities is described here.
Diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on the anamnesis (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T-wave changes, occurrence of Q-waves, newly occurring left leg block) and increased values of the "classic cardiac enzymes" creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of reversible dementia.
The present case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia within a few months in a patient over 80 years of age.
At present, the psychopathological cross-sectional picture, rather than the course of therapy of the disease, allows the differentiation between a primarily degenerative dementia with simultaneous presence of hypothyroidism and a dementia secondary to hypothyroidism.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal artery stenosis, a near-exhaust aneurysm of the left subclavian artery could be successfully eliminated by implantation of an expandable balloon JOSTENT©-Peripheral Stent-Grafts.
Observation of the course over a year showed a very good long-term result in the case of a freely perfused stent lumen and a completely eliminated aneurysm.
Control computed tomography found a completely thrombosed aneurysm sac.
ntravascular ultrasound found no evidence of neointimal hyperplasia within the stents.
The Pyoderma gangraenosum was first described in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary as a separate Entity.
Nevertheless, already in the first half of the 19th century there are illustrations in an Atlas by Marie Nicolas Devergie, which almost necessarily suggest a Pyoderma gangraenosum.
s "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" contains, in addition to casuistics of various forms of syphilitic skin conditions, also individual images of gangrenous ulcers, which occurred completely unexpectedly under the mercury therapy customary at the time.
The rapidly enlarging ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as side effects of this rampant therapy with mercury, since they healed spontaneously after their removal.
Thus, clinical descriptions and illustrations of the Pyoderma gangraenosum can be found more than 100 years before the first naming.
However, the etiology of this clinical picture has not been sufficiently clarified to date.
Thus, the theory of a primarily bacterial genesis of Pyoderma gangraenosum held in several publications until well into the 60s of our century.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the essential selection criteria of anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study deals with the question of whether the recovery of cognitive functions after a TIVA with remifentanil/ propofol (P/R) occurs more quickly than after a balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F).
Uniform oestradiol concentrations are achieved as in the early follicle phase.
In oral estrogen replacement therapy, oestradiol must be dosed 40 times higher than in TTS treatment in order to achieve effective but highly fluctuating levels of the active ingredient with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal lows.
The high estrogen doses in oral administration are necessary, since there is a pronounced estrogen metabolism in the liver passage.
What is the importance of ultrasound examination of the fetus and newborn in the diagnosis and therapy planning of mekonium peritonitis.
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital Vitium cordis, small intestine matresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia and psychomotor retardation, who has partial short arm monosomia of chromosome 8.
Measurement of the physical endurance of patients with cystic fibrosis and the detection of load-dependent changes in oxygen saturation were the objectives of the present study.
f updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions or tumors of the urinary bladder was to better do justice to the biology of the various lesions and to achieve a sharper separation between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The importance for diagnostics and clinic in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistochemical findings, is viewed critically.
Papillary urothelial Lesions include Papilloma, Papillary urothelial Neoplasm Low malignant Potentials and Papillary Carcinoma.
Flat urothelial Lesions include Flat Hyperplasia, Atypia (reactive or of unclear significance), Dysplasia and Carcinoma in situ (CIS).
long-term-follow-up-studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
In the present study, an attempt is made to show connections between selected metabolic parameters and the course of inflammation in patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by an intervention on the sympathetic nervous system.
One then speaks of a sympathetically entertaining pain.
typic diseases with a sympathetic pain component are the complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), the territorial neuropathic pain syndromes and the acute herpes zoster.
For people with chronic sleep and back problems, there is a significant relationship between sleep quality and mattress quality.
The diagnostic routine work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multiphase abdominal spiral CT and a thoracic X-ray.
n case of unclear spiral-CT findings in the question of intravenous tumor expansion, contrast-enhanced MRI can represent a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindications for nonionic X-ray contrast media, patients in the stage of compensated renal insufficiency (not yet requiring dialysis) and patients with symptomatic polycystic kidney generation.
Conventional Cavography is obsolete in the age of (Multi-Line) Spiral CT Venography and MR Venography.
The most common childhood eye injuries are burns, burns, eye damage, corneal erosions, corneal foreign bodies, eyeball bruises, blow-out fractures, perforating eye injuries, endophthalmitis and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 per 100,000 inhabitants/year.
They thus represent the most common cause of unilateral blindness in childhood.
Risk factors for eye injury in childhood include age (<5 years), gender (male > female) and parental care.
In addition to rapid and adequate therapy, the prognosis with regard to visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is also influenced by psychosocial factors (compliance with the use of visual aids or sticking the eyes to prevent amblyopia).
deficits and imbalances of the spine-stabilizing muscles are considered important somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back problems.
Therefore, maintaining and restoring the full performance of the muscles stabilizing the spine must be the goal of prevention and rehabilitation in addition to the training of coordination skills and the learning of a behavior appropriate to the spine.
n addition to the various pain therapy measures, the physiotherapeutic treatment techniques including the neurophysiological-based procedures, the physical-balneological measures and the supplementary behavioral training, medical training therapy represents an important procedure in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical training therapy includes the use of principles and methods of practice-oriented training doctrine and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
n their phase structure, different therapy goals are presented, but in particular the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular systems according to the rehabilitation course.
ndication and monitoring of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
n accordance with the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, therapy goals and treatment concept are adapted in cooperation between physiotherapists and treating physicians.
ndication of surgery during vertebral sliding results from pain, progressive sliding and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, from radicular dysfunction.
lateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but the deformity persists and in the case of spondyloptosis a plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodese mass can occur with further progress of sliding.
With the external fixator as a repositioning instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, the repositioning of severe sliding processes and the restoration of a normal spinal column and trunk shape with a justifiable neurological risk is also possible today.
therefore, a treatment concept is proposed that, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, in any case also aims at the anatomical repositioning of the sliding vertebra.
depending on the extent of the slips, Repositioning and Stabilization should take place in 1, 2 or 3 operational steps.
A single dorsal or ventral fusion is sufficient for Grad-1-dislocations.
For grade II and above, combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended.
The aim of the evaluation study, the selected results of which are reported in this paper, is to evaluate the effects of a gerontopsychiatric center (GZ:
a combination of outpatient service, day clinic and geriatric counseling) to the process of transformation from "intramural" (inpatient) to "extramural" (day clinic and clinical outpatient, i.e. home-based) regional care structures required by the Federal Government's Commission of Experts and explained in detail to undergo an empirical test for the first time.
On the basis of extensive transverse and longitudinal data, a comparison of the supply region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ) is used to analyze changes in the regional supply sub-structures of geriatric psychiatry (Subsystem A), general medicine (Subsystem B) and elderly care (Subsystem C).
With regard to Subsystem A, the investigation shows that a GZ has a considerable influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extramural care, without selecting its clientele according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
An effect of the GZ on the elderly care system (Subsystem C) may be expressed in the fact that in the Gütersloh supply region the home admission rate after clinical-inpatient treatment is significantly lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis on her right arm with systemic signs (fever, leukocytosis) and massive movement restriction in the right shoulder joint.
Sonographically and computer tomographically, in addition to an edema of skin and fatty tissue, extended fluid accumulations around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstitium and - less pronounced - in the shoulder joint were also detected.
Systemic corticosteroid therapy quickly led to the healing of the skin lesions, and in the further course also to the restoration of mobility in the shoulder joint.
In the case described, for the first time with modern imaging methods, a participation of structures close to the joints in the framework of an eosinophilic cellulitis was detected.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide enables breast-maintaining treatment in larger tumors that are not primarily suitable for breast-maintaining treatment.
Tumor regression can be tracked with mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
The good reproducibility and availability speaks for mammography.
Mammographically indefinable Tumors can usually be represented sonographically.
n MRI, tumor expansion is independent of the structure and density of the mammary parenchyma.
also allows the detection of functional parameters. - The determination of the extent of tumor residues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited with all available methods, since microscopically small invasive and in particular non-invasive tumor residues can hardly be detected.
These do not form again even when the invasive tumors return and typically show intraductal, non-invasive tumor residues.
Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents itself clinically with symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and pronounced vegetative disturbances.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for the transfer of a patient with GBS to the intensive care unit.
The present report discusses the treatment of pronounced GBS in the intensive care unit using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
long stent implantation appears in morphologically suitable stenosis to be able to immediately apply a resulting dissection and thus prevent it.
Neurosurgical therapeutic procedures for Parkinson's disease (PD) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, building on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a two-track functional model specifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei and thus makes them potential target sites for neurosurgical procedures.
its pathological disinhibition is caused, among other things, by the overactivity of the Nucleus subthalamicus (Nst).
Experimental lesions of these nuclei were successfully tested in MPTP-damaged patients. - In the clinic come z.Z. Both lesional as well as restorative and stimulatory methods are used.
earlier applied techniques of pallidotomy and thalamotomy have become more precise thanks to better neuroradiological and physiological targeting.
The former technique is used for the treatment of rigor, hypokinesia and drug-induced dyskinesia, the latter methods have proven themselves for the treatment of tremors.
only in the transplantation of fetal cells is a re-emergence of dopaminergic neurons and an increased striatal dopamine release documented;
However, the method raises ethical and immunological problems.
The high-frequency long-term stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the latest method and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
Most widespread is the stimulation of thalamus nuclei for the treatment of tremor;
n the animal experimental approach are Xenotransplantation and Implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells.
long-term comparative investigations between the individual procedures are, however, necessary in order to be able to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic alcoholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcoholic disorder in addition to more common diseases such as Delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal cramps, Wernicke-Korsakow syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures and periodic laterally-emphasizing steep potentials in EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted after several secondary generalized focal seizures of the right side of the body under the suspected diagnosis of encephalitis.
Laboratory tests showed increased values for Gamma-GT and MCV.
CCT and cerebral MRI showed microangiopathy and brain atrophy.
spite an intravenous treatment with Acyclovir and Vitamin B1 and a triple anticonvulsant therapy, epileptic seizures and a worsening of the general condition continued to be observed.
eer EEG-examinations revealed periodic steep links parietookzipital emphasized Wellen.
months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died of pneumonia.
The described clinical picture corresponds to the criteria of SESA-Syndromes.
Solitary basaliomas in childhood and adolescence without association with a basal cell naevus syndrome (BZNS), a Xeroderma pigmentosum, an organoid Naevus or following radiotherapy are very rare (so far 86 cases in the world literature).
etiologically it could be an abortive form of the BZNS or the consequence of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Investigations on repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage are not yet available in these patients.
a 10-year-old boy is reported with a solitary nodular basalium of the right infraorbital region.
Neither the anamnesis nor the clinical study gave any indication of a genetic disposition for basal formation.
In 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), an immunohistochemical and morphometric study was carried out using pelvic comb biopsies in order to compare morphological and clinical findings and to reduce the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
f the morphometric analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes in their progenitor cells and the fiber density could be calculated.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts with regard to the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis formation.
This was already observed in about 28% of the patients at the time of diagnosis.
In a similar way, the number of CD68+ macrophages correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleus-containing erythropoietic progenitor cells, which can be related to the binding of this cell line to iron metabolism, hemoglobin synthesis, and the degradation of the expanded normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-Galactosyl radical-expressing) pseudo-Gaucher cells are found in 30% of the biopsies before treatment.
Furthermore, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibrosis could be calculated with clinical parameters such as the hemoglobin level, the proportion of myelo- and erythro-normoblasts in peripheral blood and spleen count.
These variables obviously characterize more advanced stages of CML.
n accordance with our morphometric evaluation, a classification into three different histological subgroups was carried out:
This simplified histological classification was to be assigned to corresponding h‰matological data.
Sequence biopsies on 173 patients who received monotherapy with IFN, Hydroxyurea (HU) or Busulfan (BU) showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN as opposed to a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main cell lines during treatment were best illustrated by a calculation of indices.
These included the ratio of quantitative differences of the individual variables in the repeatedly taken samples and the associated time differences.
In patients with complete hematological remission after IFN administration, for example, the regeneration of erythropoiesis together with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages was evident only in their activated subpopulation.
n ongoing investigations, the histological subgroups revealed a 'transfer from both a (non-fibrous) granulocyte and megakaryocyte subtype to a myelofibrotic group in about 40% of the patients.
This phenomenon was in contrast to a number-dependent reduction in myelofibrotic type, especially in patients on HU therapy in 17 cases (36%).
The striking heterogeneity of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies using suitable methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain a better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 consecutively admitted patients in a medico-geriatric department should be diagnosed with a naturalistic design with regard to mental disorders.
On the basis of the clinical examination as well as the values in the mini-mental-state examination (2), 51 patients were assessed as non-examinable.
The remaining 74 patients were treated clinically and with Screening Scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
mental developments were possibly detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.
In 41 patients, mental disorders of disease value (mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found, in more than half of them the disorder was relevant for the overall treatment in the clinic.
The screening instruments used proved to be reliable, so that they can be recommended for further use.
t remains open, however, how the therapy of the mental disorder required according to this result for every 5. to 6. patients can be guaranteed in the setting of a medical-geriatric department.
nflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondylarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnostics of sacroilitis is considered problematic in the early stages, as the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low here.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes in all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method are the dependence on the investigator, the lack of standardization so far and the still relatively high costs.
The "Working Group on Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatology Center Berlin", which is made up of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal tradiologists and orthopedists, has therefore developed an overview of imaging diagnostics of sacroilitis, in which, in addition to the clinical background, technical details are also carried out and radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness are taken into account.
-E-Syndrome (Job's Syndrome, Hiob Syndrome, Buckley Syndrome) is a rare disease of the immune system that can show characteristic manifestations in the HNO region.
The clinical picture is characterized by recurrent urticarial exanthema, fever, lymphadenitis, lymphatic organ hyperplasia and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Diagnostically trend-setting are greatly increased IgE concentrations in the serum with the simultaneous absence of indications of allergic and parasitic diseases.
Therapeutically, a treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) proved to be excellently tolerated and effective.
More than a year after the one-time therapy, the symptoms are permanently improved.
The current state of knowledge and the available therapy options for Hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
n Hyper-IgE syndrome, a therapy trial with IVIG should be an option of first choice.
The present paper presents the results after laparoscopic "floppy niche" fundoplication in 70 patients using quality of life data 3 years after surgery.
The individual sub-dimensions of the GLQI record corresponding point scores.
over 98% of all patients rate the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo a new anti-reflux operation if necessary.
persistent side effects of the operation that did not affect the quality of life were reported by 4 patients.
No patient required renewed drug anti-reflux therapy.
A laparoscopic refundoplication was necessary due to persistent dysphagia in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months.
The effectiveness of the surgical therapy of gastro-esophageal reflux disease by means of laparoscopic "floppy niches" fundoplicatio can be documented not only by objective findings, but also by means of the subjective assessment of the patient and by the measurement of quality of life data and proven in the longer term.
is the clinical symptomatology with neuroglucopenia, proving the inadequately high insulin and C-peptide secretion in hypoglycemia in the hunger test.
Standard operation is the enucleation of the tumor or, depending on size and location, resection.
problematic is the treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia, which are burdened with a high recurrence rate.
Resection plus Enucleation seem to selectively override tumor removal.
In malignant insulinoma, mostly with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolisation and systemic chemotherapy are available.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable under § 216 StGB;
also from a medical point of view it is ethically unjustifiable.
The diverse tendencies to make "killing on demand" as in the Netherlands also in Germany unpunished under certain conditions do not change this.
Nutrient fractions as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both the proliferation and the differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be distinguished mentally from immunologically active cells of the intestinal-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and an essential supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine is particularly evident in the seriously ill.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are important, inter alia, as starting substances for NO and polyamine synthesis for the eutrophication of immunocompetent intestinal cells.
Fermentable carbohydrates are bacterially fermented in the lower intestinal sections to mainly the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
They exert a trophic effect on the colonic mucosa, inter alia, by improving blood flow.
among the food-independent substances are, among others, the hormones Gastrin and Enteroglucagon as well as different growth factors that contribute to the preservation of a eutrophic mucosa.
The following paper examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and psychological well-being.
n the use of a diary as a measuring instrument, it was possible, on the one hand, to identify individual evaluations of situational influencing factors of care and, on the other hand, stress-promoting active factors in the care process.
The results show both large individual differences in terms of the assessment of stress factors as well as their effects on physical and psychological well-being.
fractures of the talus are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis for acute and chronic pain in the ankle area.
early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus significantly influences the long-term outcome.
Computer tomography (CT) is essential for the definitive diagnosis and for the indication of the therapy to be used.
Dislocated fractures lead to pain and movement restriction, as far as presented in the literature and according to one's own experiences, and thus to arthrotic reconstruction of the subthalar joint in the long term.
n the indication for an operative procedure, however, it can be seen from the sparse literature that large fragments should be anatomically refixed in order to allow healing without consequences.
rubble fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, whereby the long-term course cannot be assessed due to possibly altered joint mechanics.
though the etiology of urticaria is still largely unclarified, there are a number of recent findings on the fundamental pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
an proliferation of dermal mast cells and a high regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines is also detectable in infested skin and increased P-selectin in the serum, which indicates a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
n dermal mast cells, we were also able to detect activating point mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional dermal mast cells in indolenter mastocytosis of adults, but not in childhood forms.
Contrary to the general assumption, acute urticaria is rarely based on IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
n the case of chronic urticaria, on the other hand, pseudoallergies to food (73%) and rare chronic inflammations of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) usually play a role, with long-lasting remissions in avoidance (diet) or elimination of the triggers.
On the other hand, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are mainly to be regarded as secondary and not as disease-causing.
Scapulothoracic Disassociation (SD) is a complex injury of the shoulder belt, mostly associated with a vitally threatening injury pattern in the context of polytrauma.
The 3 case reports should represent the variability of the possible injuries together with the scapulothoracal dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities and methods are described for this relatively rare injury, which is usually treated only in trauma centers.
The 3 cases are reproduced in the chronological course of polytrauma management, as well as the differentiated possibilities of care.
reports of previous working groups within the framework of multicenter studies with only a small patient collective show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus define it as standards, the currently valid guidelines for this are explained, with cross-references to the management together with the mostly polytraumatized and correspondingly vitally threatened patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed.
Of these 78 patients, the postoperative course over 2 months to 35.2 years is known (average 3.6 years;
Weak or negative e-Cadherin expression (<= 20%) was found at higher T-stages, there were increased synchronous lymph node and distant metastases.
n the statistical analysis, the e-cadherin expression (<= 20%/ > 20%), a synchronous long-distance metastasis (M0/pM1, cM1) as well as the radicality of the intervention (R0/R1, 2) proved to be prognostically relevant.
Our data speak for a prognostic significance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps and rubella are becoming more and more of a danger for adults due to the postponement of the age peak.
An effective method for the prevention of this disease and its sequelae is available with the MMR combination vaccination.
Through the 2-malignant consistent MMR vaccination, measles and mumps can be eliminated and rubella embryopathy can be made a disease of the past.
The goal of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adulthood (ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and satisfied aging in both middle and older adulthood.
A comparison of the age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness and tolerability.
Regional comparison revealed personality differences in the areas of neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness as well as in subjective well-being.
nsignificant interactions between age group and region resulted for openness and in some subtests of cognition measurement as well as in the doctor's judgment.
Over 80% of intra-abdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ and the majority occur after abdominal surgery.
They are classified with regard to the anatomy in intraperitoneal, visceral and abscesses concerning the anterior retroperitoneal space.
sonographic or CT-controlled percutaneous abscess drainage is today, with a defined indication, a low-complication and effective method with a success rate of about 80%.
Liver abscesses are predominantly treated interventionally, Pancreas-, Spleen- and Crohn's-Abscesses are almost always treated surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (Tuberculosis, Actinomycosis, Amoebiasis) are diagnosed late because of their rarity and offer pathological-anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic peculiarities.
From the mid to late 1980s, different groups of researchers tried to improve the prognosis for preterm birth with preterm birth by immunological diagnostics - in particular by cytokine detection.
However, it has proven to be a disadvantage that this prenatal diagnosis has so far only been able to convince from the amniotic fluid, i.e. by amniocentesis, but not from the serum of pregnant women.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier to cytokines is almost impermeable, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the high fluctuation range of the individual biomediators.
therefore, attempts were made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
Possibly, the detection of cytokines from the cervix of pregnant women using PCR technology is a viable path for the future.
The load of the internal fixator for the spinal column was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest stresses were found in walking and in lateral flexion while standing.
During the ventral flexion of the upper body, the implant load changed only slightly.
No higher Fixator loads were measured while sitting than while standing.
t speaks little against allowing patients, in whom the spinal column has been stabilized mono- or bi-segmentally, to sit as soon as they are allowed to get up.
n additional ventral stabilization with bone chips often significantly changed the loading of the bisegmental implants.
particularly in patients with degenerative instability, it was often significantly higher after ventricular stabilization than before.
The implant load was not reduced by a corset or bodice.
t is therefore not necessary to provide patients with a corset after mono- or bi-segmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningeomas are among the most common intracranial tumors in adulthood.
The so-called atypical meningeoma was additionally included in the revised version of the WHO classification for tumors of the central nervous system in 1993 and is intended to designate meningeomas with an increased tendency to relapse compared to common meningeomas.
Since the same qualitative-histologic criteria are given for this meningeoma as for the anaplastic meningeoma, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be fraught with certain uncertainties.
We searched for other prognostically relevant parameters:
Using the morphometrically determined core-area-related Ki-67-(MIB1-)Index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningeomas of all 3 grades (N=160), which proved to be valid in comparison with the "recidiv"-free intervals.
Histologically, the so-called atypical meningeomas are characterized by a slightly structured, "syncytial" growth pattern and large prominent nuclei.
Kernpleomorphie, Nekrosen and Mitosefiguren were optional.
genetically, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningeomas, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, in 50% of the cases showed a distal piece loss on the short arm of a chromosome 1 (1p-).
chemis, we were able to show that in meningiomas the tissue-unspecific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is 1p, can be used as a marker enzyme associated with progression and recurrence (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas).
t the term "atypical", which is ambiguous in everyday clinical practice and can give rise to misinterpretations in connection with tumor grading, we propose for this group of tumors located between the usual and the anaplastic meningeomas, which are relatively at risk of recurrence, the term meningeoma of the intermediate type.
Due to the special anatomical situation, the articular process fractures occupy a special position within the mandibular fractures.
Computer tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnostics.
The indication for operative treatment is for severely dislocated or dislocated fractures.
The preauricular, sub- or perimandibular, retromandibular and oral access are established as operative access.
For the fixation of the fragments, only functionally stable methods should be used, such as the miniplate or tension screw.
Analysis of the diagnostic validity of contrast-enhanced, biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with V.a. focal liver lesions prior to possible liver surgery.
We report on the manifestation of malignant pore carcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basaliomas as well as palmoplantar keratoses after treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic-containing Liquor Fowleri (Fowler's);
n addition, a Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was diagnosed as a secondary finding.
Background and questions.
spite the great importance of dermatoses in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely underrepresented in the basic health services established there.
xamine the long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the Primary Health Care system in relation to the prevalence of skin diseases.
The growth rate and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to determine the acute and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within and outside a single hospital of focus.
The PhotoDermVL enables a large selection of individually selectable treatment parameters due to the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential Teleangiectasia, Naevi flammei, Erythrosis interfollicularis colli, Spider Naevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disruptive hypertrichosis can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
mammary carcinoma metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumor in women.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, the identification of risk factors regarding the occurrence and the evaluation of the benefits of early therapy of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumor manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in the acute phase.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic forms are often difficult to control.
In addition, numerous therapy-induced side effects occur in the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants.
We report 2 cases of acute exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus, which were also difficult to control by administration of high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/azathioprine.
Both cases were treated with IgM-enriched high-dose intravenously administered immunoglobulins in addition to the performed immunosuppression.
In both cases, the immunosuppressants (Prednisolone, Cyclophosphamide and Azathioprine) originally used in high doses could be sneaked out to a minimal maintenance therapy.
fter each of 9 cycles of the therapy, the patients remained symptom-free in the follow-up period of 1 year under a minimal immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with prednisolone.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, which is one of the most common symptoms in childhood.
Nevertheless, our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp (340-450 nm, Max.
365 nm) is mainly used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with a typical fluorescence (Tinea capitis, erythrasma, Tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyria and pigment changes).
n addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under Wood-light by addition of fluorescent markers has been applied in the administration control of Topica.
ndocardial mapping is possible when hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms are induced as part of programmed ventricular stimulation.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the circular excitation by stimulation maneuvers ("Entrainment-Mapping") and analysis of the "Post-Pacing" intervals.
n the clinical occurrence and induction of only singular ventricular tachycardias, an acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in about 60-70% of cases by high frequency current catheter ablation.
This success rate is significantly lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases a recurrence must be expected.
ncessant ("incessant") ventricular tachycardias and frequent ventricular tachycardias after implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator are indicative of early catheter ablation.
m, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardias is currently a complementary therapeutic method for drug treatment and implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator.
expect that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
From 1. 1. 1985 to 31. 12. 1995, the influence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumor staging and local recurrence rate was retrospectively investigated in 386 patients with UICC stage I-III rectal carcinoma after conventional surgical procedures and R0 resection of the tumor.
n the univariate analysis we found a significant correlation between the number of dissected and the number of infected lymph nodes, and with it a significant increase in UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and pTxpN2-category (p = 0.000).
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate as a function of the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be demonstrated for UICC stages I and II.
n the total patient and in the multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no influence on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in local recurrence rates in UICC stages I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but to a stage shift in the context of more precise tumor staging.
This points to the influence of other factors that can be influenced surgically, in particular the total mesorectal excision for the development of a locoregional recurrence.
In echocardiography, there is a lack of uniform standards for the documentation of the findings.
However, these standards are necessary to allow for the comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings, so that the quality assurance requirements in echocardiography are met.
decreasing incidences of active tuberculosis in developed countries have pushed this disease out of the consciousness of many.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis continues to be the most common infectious disease leading to death worldwide.
n developed countries, factors such as immigration movements, increasing impoverishment and the increase in immunosuppressed patients, especially due to the HIV epidemic, contribute to maintaining a reservoir for tuberculosis.
scarring pemphigoid (Cicatricial pemphigoid, CP) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with subepidermal blistering and scarring that manifests itself on the skin and mucous membranes.
An eye participation is present in about 70% of patients.
ortic root abscesses have long been known in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
s detection of these abscesses by echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
f asymptomatic courses are also known in endocarditis as in other diseases (18, 19, 20, 21), but clinically asymptomatic abscesses have not yet been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since its initial description is increasingly affecting areas of dermatology as well.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 appears in particular in 2 areas of dermatology:
On the one hand, there is sufficient knowledge that makes IL-7 appear as an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, especially in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study with IL-7-gene-modified autologous tumor cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore z.Z. initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and seems to be able to significantly influence the presence and growth of normal T cells as well as lymphoma cells in the upper skin layers.
This overview is intended to outline molecular, immunological and preclinical properties as well as perspectives for possible uses of IL-7 in dermatology.
was examined whether the high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA (Gadodiamide, Omniscan) is suitable for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and whether dynamic studies at this dose allow an assessment of the response to preoperative chemotherapy.
The present work aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
After the introductory discussion of reasons for the increased attention to everyday competence in gerontology, six research trends with relevance to everyday competence are outlined in a first part:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative conception of everyday competence is presented, which interlinks aspects of the six research flows with essential elements of the two everyday competence models.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumor control with increasing total treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during therapy.
By a targeted inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic cells during a radiation treatment, therefore, significant advances in radio-oncology could possibly be achieved.
In a brief overview, the possibilities for minimizing the time factor are discussed.
f the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blocking proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways or by pharmacological inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis is scientifically interesting, but its effectiveness in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiation therapy has not yet been proven.
The only method currently secured is the implementation of radiation therapy in the shortest possible overall treatment time, e.g. by accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating for unplanned treatment interruptions.
The acute inflammatory response probably plays an important role in pathogenesis but also in the diagnosis and prognosis assessment of acute coronary syndrome.
We examined 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour of admission and in the interval of 4-24 hours with respect to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were observed up to 6 weeks after discharge with respect to the primary endpoints Death or recurrent acute coronary syndrome.Results:
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% in patients with positive CRP and TnT 42 days after discharge compared to 35.3% in patients with positive TnT and negative CRP.
The logistic regression with respect to the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (after 4-24h each), age, sex and diagnosis revealed an independent influence of TnT (Cutoff 0.1μg/L, p=0.048, Odds Ratio=7.5) and CRP (Cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, Odds Ratio=5.3).
Sensitivity/specificity for the diagnosis of AMI was 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP in the 4th-24th hour.Consequences:
Highly sensitive CRP- determinations are not very helpful besides Troponin T for acute infarct diagnostics.
However, the assessment of the prognosis of patients by TnT is significantly independently supplemented and thus significantly improved by means of CRP 4-24h after admission.
A 51/2-year-old girl with an opticus glioma and resulting hydrocephalus internus developed progressive ascites 7 months after implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content was found in the liquor and in the ascites fluid.
For the first time, a disorder of the blood-liquor barrier was found as the cause of the increased liquor protein by means of liquor protein electrophoresis.
ileum conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary drainage with a low rate of postoperative complications.
n the case of liver damage with portal hypertension, however, the risk of recurrent, peracute and transfusion-required ductal bleeding is increased.
while diagnosis is simple, different therapy options are available.
The source of bleeding usually lies in varicose veins in the stoma, so that local sclerosis with 3% ethoxysclerol or the inhibition of the bleeding vessels is an option.
Resection of the varicose vein portion of the conduit is an option for life-threatening bleeding or if the source of bleeding cannot be located.
In the case of frequently recurring bleeding, the removal of the conduit must also be considered.
A malignancy must be ruled out as the cause of any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumor cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes - the detection of which can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningeomas and gliomas are among the most genetically well-characterized solid tumors:
specifically, a number of specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known, which are associated with clinical parameters such as e.g. the recurrent tendency of meningiomas or the malignant progression of astrocytomas.
n particular for gliomas, the focal progression with the consequence of intratumoral heterogeneity is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumor cells, which are also co-determined iatrogenically by radiation or chemotherapies.
A 48-year-old woman presented with increasing dyspnoea due to a thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
6 years earlier, a mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) had been performed on the patient because of mitral stenosis III.
3 years later there was a valve thrombosis, which required a valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
n the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have been increasingly better understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of carcinoma cells from the epithelial ligament by loss of cell-cell adhesion, the invasion of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis and by entry into the blood or lymphatic system.
The intravasation of tumor cells is favored by angiogenic factors that can lead to a degradation of the basal membrane of blood vessels.
hesion to endothelial cells, leaving the vascular system and induction of angiogenesis form further important steps in the metastasis process.
n addition, a tumour cell on entry into circulation will only survive if it evades the immunological defence.
With the systematic identification of tumor antigens, new possibilities of immunotherapeutic measures have opened up.
The multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor disease of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and nonfunctional manifestations in the parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum and pituitary gland, rarely also in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1-gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosomes 11.
It is believed that this gene belongs to the tumor suppressor genes, the allelic loss of which triggers the development of neoplasms.
The tumors in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus can metastasize, but usually have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 manifests itself most frequently between the ages of 20 and 35, v. a. through hyperparathyroidism and/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies have dealt with the reduction of endothelial cell density after perforating keratoplasty using different preservation methods of donor tissues.
the interpretation of the results was usually problematic here, since despite the long-known dynamic cell loss, very variable post-examination intervals were combined.
The aim of this study was to carry out a long-term endothelial finding at the same dates, taking into account 2 different preservation techniques.
Patients undergoing long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have a different perioperative risk of thromboembolism, which requires continued prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of inhibition of coagulation (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In the case of elective interventions, coumarin administration is discontinued 2-3 days preoperatively, in the case of emergency interventions there is a need for Vitamin K or Fresh Frozen Plasma substitution.
Operations in patients under heparin therapy or prophylaxis are less problematic, as the heparin effect fades within a few hours upon discontinuation.
Results from various epidemiological studies are available on the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany.
n the transmission of the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies to the total population of Germany, there are estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies are possibly due to problems of patient identification, the epidemiological area and the structure of the respective population.
To avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was recorded by a representative survey of physician groups relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of possibility to clarify the diagnosis.
The extrapolation and subsequent combination of the results of the survey of the individual groups of doctors revealed a number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 inhabitants and is in the range of that of Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category "questionable MS" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
was examined here how the emergency medical care is carried out and whether relevant finding constellations can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which subsequently produce more growth factors in the area of the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be seen as a promising new technique of in situ tissue engineering, the clinical application of which can be expected in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by the family doctor.
For diagnosis and therapy, the quality of the doctor-patient conversation is of decisive importance.
n the 1970s, the conversational style of the doctor was considered as a personality variant, current empirical studies on the doctor-patient conversation suggest that the conversational behavior of the doctor should be understood as an interactive process, in that both communication partners (doctor-patient) coordinate their conversational behavior with each other.
Training programs to improve the basic psychosomatic competence of general practitioners often show little success, as they do not sufficiently take into account the importance of improving interactive competence.
is at the center of the Düsseldorf Training and Training Program on Psychosomatic Basic Care.
The training concept and experiences with it are finally presented and discussed.
Data on the prognosis of heart failure have so far been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies as well as clinical intervention studies.
All these sources can only be transferred to clinical everyday life to a limited extent.
g programming of the speech processor of a "cochlear implant" (CI) in young children, especially the determination of the stimulation intensity, which corresponds to the maximum acceptable volume (MAL), is often difficult.
Avoid overstimulation, as this can have a traumatizing effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds triggered via the CI and the MAL and hearing thresholds established in the postoperative speech processor setting in 27 carriers of three different implant types.
t was investigated whether the ESR threshold provides an applicable, objective tool for simplifying, refining and accelerating speech processor programming in practice.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants stimulated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as a percentage of the mean ESR threshold current level across all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of the intraoperatively registered stapedial reflex thresholds showed some large deviations from the thresholds effectively determined by behavioral audiometry.
It was therefore not possible to determine the MAL and the hearing threshold reliably and simply by calculation due to the intraoperative SR threshold.
ntraoperative determination of the ESR threshold can, however, in addition to an intraoperative functional check, contribute to a computational limitation of the area to be tested.
However, the exact MAL will have to be determined by another, provisional behavioral audiometric method.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swellings in the red parts of a multicolored jewelry tattoo.
histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction was imposed, which could be distinguished from a real lymphoma by electron microscopic, immunohistochemical and molecular biological investigations.
Detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate is possibly a consequence of a dermal-allergic inflammation in the nongranulomatous tattooing reaction.
Therapy of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Representation of new diagnostic possibilities in the area of the kidney by means of fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old patient, a chicken egg-sized, skin-bulging, bud- or wart-free excess mammary gland had developed in the left anterior armpit line for 8 years.
early diagnosis and correct excision are desired.
n connection with endoprosthetic operations, damage to arterial vessels adjacent to the joint can occur.
Using 4 case examples, both highly acute and masked complications and the applied therapy are described.
Before and after endoprosthetic operations, a vascular status of the extremities should be collected.

Imaginations, from which Wahn emerges, are dynamically loaded according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure to update, which weighs on the imaginations and is increased in psychotic states, is a precondition for madness.
n addition, there must be the failure of de-updating caused by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
s explained by a case study, which proceed from the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion, are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of the chronicling.
The inflammatory pseudotumor usually occurs singularly and is a benign tumor that was first described in the lung.
describes the case of a 24-year-old woman with a progressive nasal breathing disability due to a thickening of the anterior septum.
macroscopically, a cauliflower-like tumor was shown in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Differential diagnoses are discussed on the basis of an overview of the relevant literature.
The therapy of choice consists of a complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the presented study, we therefore present possibilities for examining finger and fingertip arteries in healthy subjects with color-coded duplex sonography.
The question was whether a standardized representation of such small vessels is technically possible with the color Doppler system we use.
As a result, we found that the representation was possible in all examined subjects (n=10).
Furthermore, in a patient with endangiitis obliterans, it is shown by way of example that pathological variations in vessels of this magnitude can be detected with the method - with appropriate equipment and examination technique.
The goal of this retrospective study is to assess the need for reimplantation of a cardioverter/defibrillator generator (ICD) in patients with pulse generator battery depletion and no clinical arrhythmia episodes during the life of the first implanted system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instrumentation, as well as the use of intrathoracic visualization systems makes it possible to perform operations on the mitral valve via a limited right-anterolateral thoracotomy.
-Abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses.
s are aggressive, locally infiltrating, but non-metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Trauma, endocrine and genetic factors play a role.
Preferred localizations are the trunk and the trunk-like extremity portions.
By combining different imaging methods, in addition to determining the size and extent of the tumor, the number of differential diagnoses can also be limited to a few.
In earlier years, surgical resection became a monopoly position, adjuvant therapy measures such as radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are increasingly given importance.
g interventions and interventions with subsequent functional losses are justified only in the event of repeated, uncontrollable Recidivism.
The treatment concept for atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological base therapy in combination with a time-limited exacerbation-directed anti-inflammatory therapy.
n the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, systemic therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response to topical therapy or to achieve remission in therapy-resistant courses.
n addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, antibiotics and acyclovir are used in oral microbial superinfections.
an exacerbation can often be successfully counteracted phototherapeutically, in particular by a UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutic agents such as glucocorticosteroids, cyclosporin or azathioprine can generally be dispensed with in the treatment of atopic eczema or represents a therapeutic alternative only in a few exceptional cases.
The present case study describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented himself with an aqueous nasal secretion, recurrent epistaxis and a slowly progressing, left-handed nasal breathing obstruction in the ENT department of BwK Ulm for clarification.
The clinical examination as well as the CT of the paranasal sinuses showed a tumor that filled the entire left main nasal cavity and apparently emanated from the middle nasal passage.
The tumor was resected via a midfacial degloving in toto.
The histological work-up revealed the diagnosis of a neuroma.
Based on these casuistics and an overview of the literature, the diagnosis and therapy of this rare nasal tumor are presented.
chemonucleolysis is a controversial method of treating lumbar disc prolapse.
Statistically, although complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than in surgical methods for the treatment of lumbar disc prolapse, they sometimes lead to considerable impairments.
f the most serious complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal hemorrhages and transverse myelitis.
This must be taken into account in the indication of chemonucleolysis and in the elucidation of the patients.
Six patients with Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated with cryosurgical treatment.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy represents an effective and low-burden treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as a therapeutic alternative to a systemic treatment with Dapson.
n the present study, the effectiveness of a psychosomatic-dermatological counseling activity was examined in more detail for the first time, based on the questions of need, use and effectiveness of psychosomatic counseling/connection services.
The extent of compliance with treatment recommendations was recorded and their relationship to possible influencing factors such as frequency of conversation contacts, preset and satisfaction with the consultation as well as clinical and demographic characteristics was checked.
Two years after the consultation, catamnesis questionnaires were sent for this purpose and the medical records were evaluated.
A sample of a total of n=69 patients with a recommendation for action resulted in a compliance rate of 78.3%, based on the subgroup with a psychotherapy recommendation a rate of 69%.
no significant association with clinical or demographic features was shown, nor did the frequency of conversational contacts have any influence.
In 70.5% of the cases, only one conversation was held.
Compliance was promoted by a positive attitude towards consultation and a pleasant conversation experience.
Overall, therefore, a high level of effectiveness could be achieved with relatively little time and effort.
There are reports of a 29-year-old patient with an unusual pigmentation on her face.
In the clinical aspect, the pigment lesion corresponded to a Naevus spilus, in the histological diagnosis it was possible to ensure the existence of multiple blue Naevi, in addition there was a slightly pronounced lentiginous component as well as a dermal melanocytosis.
histochemically, the melanocyte cell elements showed an expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change thus turns out to be the unusual combination of a Lentigo simplex with aggregated blue navi and a dermal melanocytosis.
Patients who have to undergo vascular surgery often require far more fluid intraoperatively than would be expected from preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid loss and ventilation.
Changes in starling forces - in particular vascular permeability - may play a role here, without these having been examined in more detail so far.
Discussion of the results of open-surgical procedures on the spine, in particular of operation-related complications, e.g. the so-called postdiscotomy syndrome, has in the past led to the search for and use of less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of lumbar intervertebral disc herniation.
percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are techniques that are based on different intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as, for example, discography, retroperitoneal disc windowing or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed since the 1970s to be clinically ready for use.
The results of patient treatment vary from about 30% good and very good to almost 100% good and very good results depending on the author and the study.
what is striking here is that the prospective randomized studies that have comparison groups - whether conservative or surgically treated patient groups - are very rare.
Here the results of the intradiscal treatment procedures are more often assessed critically and with lower success rates than the representations of individual techniques examined retrospectively, which often have very large case numbers, but cannot withstand the harsh scientific criteria of the study design well.
it can be stated that the percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only treat a partial area of lumbar intervertebral disc disease, since a limited indication is required for a successful therapy.
m the percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must remain rather limited to a lower number of cases compared to endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial closure systems have established themselves as an essential component of invasive cardiology.
The present overview paper compares the four closure systems available today VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their importance when applied after coronary interventions.
The published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC and DU are 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% respectively.
The hemostasis times are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19' and 4-14' with mobilization times of 6-9h, 6-8h, 4-7h and 2-6h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems were able to show a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all have documented a significant decrease in hemostasis time.
The increased well-being of the patients is essentially based on the removal of the lock immediately after the coronary intervention.
Arterial closure systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by shortening the length of stay.
for the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous body cortex and optionally epiretinal membranes from the retina during vitrectomy in order to relieve the macular from the suspected intravitreal tensile forces.
n addition to these structures, we have also been removing the internal limiting membrane (MLI) in the vicinity of the foramen from the retina for some time.
The clinical results and ultrastructural findings of the remote MLI are reported.
The randomized studies comparing thrombolysis and primary dilatation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left femoral block, non-diagnostic first electrocardiogram, a pre-hospital time of >= 12 h, or an unknown pre-hospital time.
n order to describe these patient groups and to compare the influence of lysis and primary dilatation, we examined the data from the "Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction" (MITRA) study.
drug addict who died 5 days after the first symptoms appeared from a fulminant viral hepatitis in a hepatoma.
The serological diagnosis revealed a cured hepatitis A, a persistent hepatitis B, a hepatitis C as well as a superinfection with the Delta virus (Delta hepatitis was only detected postmortem).
This has led to a protracted fat embolism (over days) into the pulmonary flow path with consequent extravasation and deposition of fat in alveolar macrophages.
In 40 Alzheimer's patients, 5 patients with dementias of other causes and 36 cognitively unremarkable control subjects, the Tau protein in cerebrospinal fluid was determined.
Of the Alzheimer's patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease (total value in the mini-mental state test 25 to 28 points).
A significant increase in Tau was also measured in these compared to the control subjects.
A less pronounced increase in Tau was seen in patients with other dementias.
n Alzheimer's patients, no quantitative relationship was found between the increase in Tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficit, as determined by SPECT.
The results are an indication that tau could also be elevated in the predemential stage of Alzheimer's disease and is suitable as a biological indicator for early detection.
n the last decade, an unusual amicrobial intertriginous dermatosis was described in a total of 16 female patients suffering from an autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was a sterile pustulous dermatitis v.a. in intertriginous regions, which could be ameliorated by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically imposed subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophilic Pustulationen.
The present paper describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
nosation remains a significant problem after reconstructive vascular procedures.
The proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation and remodeling processes are accepted as underlying pathogenesis mechanisms.
duced programmed cell death (apoptosis) could also contribute to restenosis by extending the survival time of intimate cells with the consequence of cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy samples of 25 primary and 14 restenotic lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were obtained by means of TUNEL-Test (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimate hyperplasia correlated more with Re- than with primary stenosis origin and was due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells (mean cell densities:
As an essential finding of this study, hypercellular restenosis tissue showed fewer TUNEL+-cells than hypocellular Plaques (14% vs. 27%);
Interestingly, ultrastructural investigations showed here a significantly lower proportion of intimate plaque cells, in particular smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological features for apoptosis from (3% vs. 13%;
n the incidence of necrosis, on the other hand, there was no discernible difference between the two plaque types (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/cell;
Our data thus point to apoptosis and not necrosis as the underlying cell death form with differences between the two lesion types with significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich restenoses.
The present findings suggest that reduced apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism that leads to intimate hyperplasia, as is commonly detected in human restenoses after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas that can manifest themselves either primarily or secondary in the skin.
cytotoxic lymphocytes follows a detailed description of the clinical, histological, immunohistochemical and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphomas.
The current incidence of microbially caused (infectious) endocarditis (IE) can be assumed at seven cases per 100,000 population per year and has been increasing continuously for years.
The prognosis is essentially dependent on a rapid diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy.
If endocarditis is unconfirmed, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the mostly diagnostically groundbreaking clinical examination.
Culture-negative endocarditis requires either the termination of an untargeted antibiotic therapy and a review of the blood culture techniques used or the use of serological/molecular biological techniques to identify the causative pathogen.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with a potentiating toxic effect are used.
Large (> 10 mm) vegetations on the mitral valve are associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, so that they usually represent an independent indication for surgery, especially when the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favorable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 μg/ml.
n the first three weeks after the manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolisms are associated with a high risk of recurrence.
cerebral embolisms do not represent a contraindication to a heart-lung machine operation if a primary cerebral hemorrhage has been ruled out by means of a cranial computed tomography and the operation is performed early before the formation of a post-poplectic blood-brain barrier disorder (< 72 hours).
n addition, a significant improvement in prognosis through early surgical intervention is demonstrated for disease progression complicated by myocardial insufficiency (particularly in the wake of acute valve insufficiency), by the occurrence of acute renal failure, by a smear infection of primary aortic valve vegetation on the anterior mitral sail or by sepsis persisting for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
The embryonic brain can be examined particularly well with transvaginal ultrasound, since the large, "cystic" cerebral ventricles can be imaged relatively easily.
Sonoembryology, however, describes not only the normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of malformations.
2. Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain sections in which one finds either an increased or a decreased amount of fluid.
4. Irregularity of the contours of the back.
With the Infection Protection Act, the system of notifiable diseases in Germany is put on a new basis.
Certain clinical pictures in case of suspicion, illness or death are subject to reporting (essentially by doctors) as well as laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates what information must be provided by those who are required to report with the report.
It also determines which information may be transmitted further by the health department.
n particular in the case of suspected reports or in the case of the report of evidence of pathogens, not all the information that must be transmitted will always already be available through the report, therefore the health department must carry out investigations itself in these cases in order to be able to transmit the corresponding information.
The health authorities also have the task of bringing together the incoming reports from doctors and laboratories and forwarding them as individual reports.
Case definitions have been developed for this purpose. The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which facilitates the compilation of the information that must be transmitted for the health department.
The transmission to the RKI then takes place via the responsible state authority designated by the state.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there is an increase in the number of tumor diseases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, almost 213,000 people died in 1998 as a result of a malignant disease.
Cancer sufferers usually suffer from a variety of physical and mental dysfunctions, which, in the case of inadequate or missing treatment, lead to a significant loss of quality of life.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly serious effects on the patient and his relatives.
There are therapeutic concepts for sufficient pain therapy from various organizations, but these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
This contribution therefore comprehensively represents pain therapy as a crucial cornerstone in palliative medicine.
Due to the central importance of the liver as a site of synthesis of essential hemostasis components and its functional role in the reticoendothelial system, liver diseases lead laboratory to reduced values of hepatically synthesized hemostasis factors and signs of increased conversion of plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolysis.
In the case of compensated hemostasis disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic therapy of the hemostasis disorder.
f this unstable state is further disturbed by various noxen, clinically bleeding with more or less consumption coagulopathy- or hyperfibrinolysis-like background constellation and only exceptionally thromboembolisms occur.
avoidance of astigmatism induction after seamless corneal cataract surgery.
n the context of fall prevention, among other things, a routine review of the medication is required.
n a random sample of 276 hospital patients over 75 years of age, it was investigated how often drugs are prescribed that can increase the risk of falls through the possible triggering of dizziness.
between the individual heart centers the amount of bleeding differs up to 8 times from the same mediastinal drainage after heart surgery in adults.
Excessive post-bleeding leads to an increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed in detail.
Avoidance of preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin, use of autologous blood, and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol reduces the use of allogeneic transfusions.
perioperative maintenance and rapid restoration of normothermia significantly improves hemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent discipline at European level depends on its inclusion in the medical directives of the European Union.
With perseverance and with great effort, the oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989.
forum for the discussion of the factual problems among the representatives of the member states and with the services of the European Commission was the UEMS Section for Stomatology and Oral-Jaw-Facial Surgery.
Thanks to its work, MKG surgery is now, at the end of the 20th century, recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with around 3800 specialists.
The development of otomycosis, especially after local antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
gation of fungi into the middle ear, however, can result in serious complications.
In particular, preoperative rehabilitation of the external auditory canal is therefore absolutely necessary.
All antimycotic ear drops currently available on the market, however, contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative we recommend a 0.5% aqueous Miconazole solution.
Three comparison solutions, "E 153" (3), a full electrolyte solution for i. v. infusion, as well as Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), 2 balanced solutions developed for surgical interventions on the eye, were examined with regard to their possible influence on the postoperative course of inflammation after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients had a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implanted.
The median age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 female.
60% had coronary heart disease and 31% dilated cardiomyopathy as the underlying cardiac disease.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
ndication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57%, and survival resuscitation in ventricular fibrillation in 43%.
A single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients, and an AV sequential or two-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
25 patients had a subcutaneous patch or array system implanted and 2 patients had an epicardial patch system, 92 patients had an abdominal implantation site and 248 had a pectoral implantation site.
In 33 patients (9.7%), a total of 34 probe-related complications occurred in the course.
18 of the patients with a probe-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
n patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of probe-induced complications was three times higher in the two-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators at 12% than in the single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators at 4% (p = 0.05).
More than half of the patients (55%) were diagnosed primarily on the basis of a routine X-ray examination, a quarter (24%) clinically (inadequate therapy delivery, pain) and a fifth (21%) on the basis of the electrical parameters.
The effectiveness of radiosynoviorthesis in the therapy of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, in particular chronic polyarthritis, was investigated.
n contrast to conventional computed tomography (CT), in electron beam tomography (EBT) no X-ray tube rotates mechanically around the patient, but an electron beam is deflected onto targets arranged semicircularly around the patient, at which the actual X-ray radiation is then produced.
With this ultrafast technique, it has become possible to generate axial sectional images of the heart in 50 and 100 ms, respectively, and to precisely image all structures of the heart with a spatial resolution <0.5 mm2.
f the acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered sectional images (layer thicknesses 2-3 mm) in short respiratory arrest allows the complete, three-dimensional imaging of a patient's heart.
Detection of coronary calculus with EBT must be regarded as the currently most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for assessing the course after angioplasty and aortocoronary bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method can be seen under the condition of a stable sinus rhythm in respiratory and movement artifacts as well as superimposition of the coronary arteries by veins and by pronounced coronary calcifications.
Nevertheless, clinically assessable, non-invasive representations of coronary arteries have already become possible with EBT, which may still be optimized by further technical progress.
n the past 25 years, the use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has established itself as the vessel of choice.
n addition to the established method of angiography, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging method for the examination of this vessel.
n the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, it was possible to establish a consistent examination result compared to angiography in a high proportion of patients.
While in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile corresponding to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle is dominated by a high systolic fraction, there is a postoperative adaptation to the coronary artery current bed in the form of an increased diastolic flow fraction.
These non-invasive findings of transthoracic duplex sonography could be confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
Just as in the preoperative comparison, there is also a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography in the postoperative assessment of the revascularization result.
n view of the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should gain increasing importance.
Dissections of peripheral arteries are particularly affected by male, hypertonic patients over the age of 60, who characteristically have cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are a pronounced rarity.
Here, young patients with or without immediate trauma in the history predominate.
f a case of traumatic dissection of the A. cerebri media in a 7-year-old girl, the aetiology, pathogenesis, symptoms and morphological findings of aneurysmatic dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed, taking into account the cases described in the literature.
The paper shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adaptation of old people's and nursing homes.
The adaptation is intended to strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, profile their core competencies and force the management of the core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposed ideal models, rather it is the task of the management bodies to develop and implement home-specific solutions taking into account the respective framework conditions.
t is reported about a phenotypically female newborn of 37. SSW, who died under the image of renal insufficiency on the 14th day of life.
The child showed a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and an unusually pronounced, diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic studies confirmed the diagnosis of a Drash syndrome.
since the late 1960s, accidents in the western industrialized nations have been among the most common causes of childhood morbidity and mortality.
while accidents in older children and young people mostly occur on the road and are consistently recorded or documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infants and young children, which preferably occur during domestic activities.
n the framework of a study on the effectiveness of an acellular pertussis vaccine, between 1991 and 1994 we were able to prospectively record and analyze the frequency of accident-related hospitalizations in 10,271 infants and small children in Germany.
2 cases (female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts are reported, which had caused a long-standing lumbar-form complaint.
n both cases there was a urination disorder in the sense of a pollakiuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the passage of contrast-enriched blood through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical use of this method is delayed on the one hand by the difficulty of image evaluation, and on the other hand by the fact that with conventional techniques only one layer per heartbeat can be imaged.
New developments in both nuclear spin tomography and accelerated imaging strategies make it possible to assess perfusion over the entire heart muscle with a resolution in the range of 2 mm.
As an example of such an imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per image) segmented gradient echoplanar sequence with a preceding saturation pulse is discussed and results are presented in an infarct patient.
The clinical utility of MRI-assisted determination of perfusion for the diagnosis of coronary diseases is enhanced by the diversity of MRI methods for the determination of cardiac function parameters.
Since the blood circulation conditions in the case of ligament ruptures represent an essential parameter, in particular with regard to the chances of success of surgical care, the vascularization of the inner knee ligament should be presented in the present work.
The specific blood circulation situation was investigated by means of microangiography on 21 cadaver preparations.
was shown to be supplied proximally by 1 or 2 main vascular trunks, which preferably ran in the ventral band portions.
The vessel density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
n view of the lower vascularization of the distal ligament portions, we would recommend ligament reconstruction by means of fibrin adhesion, which allows an atraumatic restoration without the risk of suture-induced vascular strangulation.
Every year in Germany approx. 75000 patients with coronary heart disease (approximately 75% of all heart operations) are operated on.
arterial grafts and autologous veins, mainly the saphena magna vein, are available as bypass material.
n recent years minimally invasive vein removal techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, yet today saphenectomy is mostly performed by means of continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin for open preparation of the vena saphena magna.
Disorders of wound healing after open saphenectomy are repeatedly discussed and are the subject of every cardiac surgical follow-up after coronary surgery procedures and the reason for the upgrading of new, minimally invasive removal techniques.
The presented technique (modified "Bridge" technique) shows desired results, in particular a very high patient satisfaction with regard to the cosmetic result and the only slight restriction by the saphenectomy wound(s).
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation in the area of the ventral thoracic wall with aplasia of the sternocostal portion of the M. pectoralis major, an ipsilateral Symbrachydaktylia and occasionally associated further defects of the thoracic wall, mammary gland and mammary gland.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of the co-occurrence of a dextrocardia with a Poland syndrome have been described so far.
We report on another patient with this rare combined malformation.
This study should investigate whether sICAM-1 and sE-Selectin levels can predict early onset of impending sepsis and the severity of the course of sepsis.
The range of ophthalmological journals on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very extensive.
However, the online offers of the different magazines and publishers are qualitatively and quantitatively very different.
In contrast to conventional publications, online publications offer many advantages, including, for example, low production costs and fast, location- and time-independent availability of information.
It can be assumed that the online publications will not replace the print versions, but represent a useful addition to the previous information offerings.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who had developed the rare form of purely lateral elbow dislocation after a "police grab."
The present case study describes the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a secondary type 2 aortoenteral fistula to the duodenum 33 months after implantation of an aortic canal prosthesis.
The preoperative diagnosis was made by an upper endoscopy and an abdominal computed tomography.
discussed are the value of preoperative diagnostics and the 2 alternative operative therapy methods, in-situ reconstruction and extra-anatomical revascularization.
sdiagnostics (preimplantation genetic diagnosis, PGD) is performed in Germany zzt. not performed.
According to opponents of the PGD in Germany, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics.
s are of the opinion that under certain legal perspectives the Embryo Protection Act would not stand in the way of a PGD.
n the background of this situation, a PGD has not been carried out in Germany so far.
The discussion that has been fiercely conducted in Germany for a long time is difficult to convey in scientific circles abroad.
Based on casuistics, it was to be assumed that the muscle-relaxing potency of Atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracic fallopian tube.
In a prospective, clinical investigation, this hypothesis should be tested.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fuzzy genesis fever (FUO) as a disease that develops over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C for at least three days, which remains etiologically unclear even after a week of inpatient clarification.
A quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most often by hidden abscesses, slow endocarditis and tuberculosis.
In the present work, profilometry, a modern method for determining the skin surface structure, is presented.
mprints of the skin corresponding to its negative image are produced with the aid of a rapidly curing plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measuring area.
n the subsequent measurement technique, the "roughness" of the skin impression is measured with the "Profilometer" and the result is recorded as a diagram.
By means of a statistical program, the measurement data can be analyzed, stored and compared.
We tested this method in order to demonstrate possible improvements in the skin surface condition after the use of oestrogen-containing creams on the face.
The distribution ratio of water between serum and whole blood has been set at 1.2 in the guidelines for the determination of blood alcohol for forensic purposes for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol.
n an extensive multicentric study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the group of persons in which blood samples are taken in connection with crimes under the influence of alcohol, an average distribution factor of 1.16 was measured with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of the cases the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19. Based on the mean value, the deviation of the quotient in 96% of the cases is less than 3%.
Paradoxes Embolisms are well known in theory, but quite rare in practice.
pathophysiologically, the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure and consequent right-left shunt via an open oval foramen or an atrial septal defect is typically underlying.
Polymorphic clinical pictures of children that change during growth through reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement surgery are difficult to classify.
A significant comparison of the different forms of therapy is possible only through the use of generally recognized evaluation standards.
njury to the vessels was diagnosed after admission to the clinic by palpation of the wrist pulses, clinical assessment of vascularity and by derivation of the Doppler signal via the wrist arteries.
n emergency operations included fragment repositioning and fixation with crossed K-wires via a stretch-side access in all 10 children in the first step.
n assessment of blood circulation revealed a return of pulse in 2 of the 10 children (passengers, dislocation-related vascular occlusion).
n 8 of the 10 children, the pulse stayed away, which is why the vessel had to be explored in an emergency.
operatively we saw in 1 of these 8 children a vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion.
In the case of adventitious strangulations (2 of these 5 children), the transmission of the pulse to the hand occurred immediately after severing the connective tissue, strangulating tissue.
n the case of intimate damage (3 of these 5 children), the affected vessel section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with vein patch plastic.
We saw a combined vascular closure (mechanical-functional closure) in 2 of these 8 children.
n the post-examination, the wrist pulses could be felt in 9 children, color duplex sonographically 9 children had a physiological signal, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal over the A. brachialis, A. radialis and A. ulnaris.
mic late damage (cold intolerance, Klaudikatio, Volkmann-Kontraktur) was not observed in any of the children.
s assessment of elbow joint mobility revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees), and an even-sided, normal pro- and supination.
The supporting joint axis was normal in all children in a side comparison.
The cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is of little help to paediatricians, since pathogen culture is only successful in 30-60% of whooping cough patients and the result is available after 3-5 days at the earliest.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-lying tumors.
n a randomized, double-blind parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400mg RRR--tocopherol acetate/d) against diclofenac sodium (3x50mg/d) in inpatients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis was tested.
After a three-week treatment, a significant improvement in all clinical parameters investigated was observed both under vitamin E therapy (n=42) and under treatment with diclofenac (n=43).
morning stiffness duration decreased from 90min to 68min under vitamin E therapy, and from 68min to 30min under diclofenac administration.
The joint index according to Ritchie fell from 56 to 46 (Vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (Diclofenac).
The grip strength increased both in the Vitamin E group and in the Diclofenac group.
in both groups there was also a significant reduction in the severity of pain, assessed on a 10cm visual analogue scale.
The overall judgment of the doctor and patient on the success of the therapy was similarly positive for the two drugs.
particularly against the background of the risk profile of NSAR in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the intake of high-dose vitamin E represents a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be filled with air or even overblown if there is a fistula to the esophagus or stomach.
Such an observation in the newborn is presented.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary foregut anomaly.
t must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic lung processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by an esophageal smear and by Doppler sonography.
Within a few weeks, a 24-year-old Type I diabetic repeatedly became severely diabetic Ketoazidosene (Serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol/l, respectively) as part of intoxications with synthetic drugs ("Ecstasy" and "Speed").
In the case of decompensated diabetic metabolic status (initial HbA1c 11.7%), insulin injections were absent under the influence of drugs.
In addition, the patient had danced for hours at a techno-party without adequate fluid intake during the manifestation of the first ketoacidosis.
The clinical picture showed peritoneal symptoms in addition to exsiccosis and tachycardia;
Disorders of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and persecution are essentially related to drug intoxication.
The therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte and insulin substitution.
The courses were uncomplicated.
A case of ball variance of a Smeloff-Cutter prosthesis in the aortic position 24 years after implantation is reported.
fter previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiogenic shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed pronounced degeneration with yellowish discoloration, ridge and crack formation with swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in a terminal prosthetic dysfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
As part of a prospective study, 36 patients with osteochondrosis dissecans of the thalamus roll were treated ambulant arthroscopically and monitored according to a standardized protocol after 4 and 12 months.
It was shown that the conventional radiological preliminary examination allows a statement about the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
ven though more than half of the herd lay in the dorsal sections of the talus roll, these could be reached without ankle osteotomy, tibial perforation or distraction.
Arthroscopy also enables a partial synovectomy for concomitant synovitis and the removal of osteophytes at the anterior edge of the tibia.
The low rate of complications, the short rehabilitation duration and the objectively and subjectively good surgical outcome make arthroscopy a serious alternative to upper ankle arthrotomy.
n addition to decompensated chronic cardiac insufficiency, acute cardiac pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock are included in acute cardiac insufficiency.
The former is to be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, while the latter is already greater in pulmonary edema.
Therapeutically, in addition to positively inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used.
nevertheless, the mortality of a cardiogenic shock, the cause of which cannot be treated, is >85%.
In a double-blind study with 31 subjects, cognitive performance disorders after a single oral intake of a therapeutic dose of 15 mg midazolam were quantitatively detected by using a standardized and validated test method (SKT).
The disorders partially corresponded to the clinical picture of a moderate to severe transit syndrome or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, all subjects had complete anterograde amnesia without a tendency to brighten.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident by the detection of a coarse-grained rotary nystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the period of the first 3 to 6 hours after taking midazolam.
Presentation of the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for image and findings distribution and for video conferencing applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows a qualitatively very good representation of the extracranial carotid current path in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and is used in clinical routine.
With the preferred time-of-flight (TOF) technique, vessels without contrast media can be imaged.
n intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium, the use of ultrafast gradient echo sequences (GES) enables a first-pass representation of the carotids from the aortic arch to the base of the skull in less than 30 s.
In the present work, the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA), the correct timing of the amount and flow rate of contrast agent (KM) injection and the tuning of the sequence parameters to the relatively rapid blood flow back from the venous sinuses into the Vv. jugulares must be taken into account.
n a model and in a computer simulation, the optimal time of data acquisition regarding the presence of KM in the arteries was first determined.
It was shown that 90% of the contrasts in the average 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space lines are defined.
By stepwise variation of local resolution, measurement time and KM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed on subjects and some patients, which enables the clinical use of CE-MRA in the area of the extracranial carotid current path.
The best qualitative results were achieved with a double-dose technique at an injection rate of 2 ml/s.
The time reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving resolution.
Further investigations on the optimal KM application in the still very early state of the art are still pending.
To prevent this complication, various pre-, intra- and postoperative measures are used.
preoperative measures are the delay of the operation appointment until the end of the inflammatory phase after the initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program as well as a suitable patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include the exact placement of the drill channels including an arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of a transplant impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension at the time of tibial graft fixation must be avoided.
The postoperative measures include immediate passive stretching of the knee joints, early initiation of a movement program and regular clinical checks.
From the experience of our own clinic, taking into account the measures mentioned, the development of arthrofibrosis after operations on the anterior cruciate ligament can be largely avoided.
n the framework of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for the palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasms, the surgical therapy options face essential tasks.
Restoring the passage, ensuring secretion drainage and reducing pain are in the foreground.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic methods are used in isolation or in combination with the integration of all conservative therapeutic options.
In many cases, an unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization can be avoided.
The present paper describes and discusses the current surgical-surgical and endoscopic techniques for palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in the sick elderly is one of the most common and least noticed diseases in hospitals, nursing homes or in home care.
Depending on the type and composition of the patient group studied, a prevalence of malnutrition of up to 60% is reported.
This leads, especially in times of increased energy requirements, such as in acute or chronic illness, to a lack of energy and thus combined to general malnutrition.
n order to accurately diagnose malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical nutritional parameters.
These enable a tailor-made nutrition therapy.
The most important deficiencies in sick elderly people relate to proteins, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospital stays, causes enormous costs in healthcare and is accompanied by a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase of the elderly, the problem of malnutrition will worsen.
Malnutrition should therefore be given more attention by being taken seriously as a disease in its own right and integrated into the training curriculum of doctors and nursing staff.
The multivariate hazard analysis according to Cox shows the ELND in addition to tumor thickness (Breslow) (alternative pT category), tumor localization and sex of the tumor carrier as independent prognostic factors.
n the stratification according to the forecast parameters mentioned, the "observed survival curves" according to Kaplan Meier "with" and "without ELND" differ significantly from each other in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
Women with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on the head, neck, chest and acne;
Men with >1.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the same localization and with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the arms, legs and abdomen (except acral and genitoanal localization).
The limits of the risk area with prognostic benefit can be further specified by testing specific risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Driver's license applicants are not only required to have adequate eyesight, but also legally required to "reliably use" it.
The Nystagmus patient strives for this by, for example, adopting a head-gaze posture or using other compensation mechanisms.
However, according to the applicable investigation guidelines (Appendix XVII, §§ 9 a ff. StVZO), he is not allowed to do these.
Vellushaarcysts are rare epidermal cysts with retinated Vellushaars in children and young adults.
A 23-year-old patient with asymptomatic comedone-like papers on the face, neck and chest is reported.
histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle Korium with the resulting Stratum granulosum, centrally retinated Keratin and numerous Vellushaare.
spite of some common clinical features, eruptive Vellushaarcysts and Steatocystoma multiplexes differ histopathologically and therefore represent independent clinical pictures.
Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs predominantly in HIV-infected patients.
Molecular biological methods were used to identify both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be represented histologically by means of Warthin-Starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous, z. T. ulcerated nodes.
n addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bone, liver or spleen can also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with BA who had multiple cutaneous nodules as well as bone changes.
Treatment with erythromycin resulted in a regression of all disease symptoms.
In 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries, stabilization and spondylodesis of the ventral column were performed by thoracoscopic technique.
By increasing experience, the operation times could be significantly reduced.
At the beginning of the series, 2 patients were converted to the open procedure.
Our own experience proves the fundamental feasibility of a minimally invasive care.
great advantages over the open method are reduced access morbidity, reduced need for painkillers, early functional recovery, and shortened hospital stay.
Operation Objective Stable practice Osteosynthesis of the Humerus with solid, intramedullary locking marknagel in non-drilled technique.
Mechanical irritation of the Supraspinatus tendon due to a narrowing of the subchromial space is considered a possible cause of Supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The objective of the present study was to develop a method for the improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and for the assessment of acromion shape in three-dimensionally reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal sections and compared on the healthy and diseased sides.
The acromion form was compared to the Bigliani classification in the conventional X-ray image.
The term primary chronic osteomyelitis combines various clinical pictures that should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often bacterial, no pathogen can be detected in the 2nd group.
n particular the multifocal forms (chronic recurring multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to relapse, long course and can additionally show a skin involvement (SAPHO-Syndrome).
The biopsy is primarily used to exclude tumors and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
There are no histological distinctions between these chronic forms of osteomyelitis.
Social work for the elderly is not justified per se in a demographically aging society, but must prove its social usefulness under the changing conditions of age structure change.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding need for professional orientation and has triggered the search for a more consensual and attractive performance profile in the fields of action of social work for the elderly.
n the method of direct immunofluorescence we succeeded in the detection in the patient of linear deposits of IgG-lambda-L-chains, an early component of complement C1q and discrete C3 deposits along the elastic fibers obtained in the dermis, especially in the papillary stratum, at the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands and in the walls of the small vessels.
n this respect our case can be regarded as unique in the literature.
The hand is extraordinarily exposed in daily use and thus also exposed to a high degree of injury.
In addition to vitality and sensitivity, the diverse functions of the hand also require undisturbed motor skills and stability.
n the case of the most serious injuries, very often only residual or substitute functions can be gained.
The complex trauma of the hand leads to a combined, extensive damage of the soft tissues and the bony skeleton with an acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
In principle, comprehensive first aid is sought.
Due to the multiple damage, extensive debridement is in the foreground.
The destroyed tissue portions are, as far as possible, primarily reconstructed.
This is followed by the microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
n exposed bones or tendons, the skin mantle is replaced by a pointed or free microsurgical skin flap.
In the case of a long ischemic period, this concept is departed from insofar as the blood circulation is first restored.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are presented in an overview.
n the healing outcome of a complex hand injury, every function of the hand recovered or created counts.
t is therefore irresponsible to provide a special department with such a serious injury without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local requirements.
Treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease with balloon dilatation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible according to the results of 5 large, randomized studies with comparable clinical success and risk.
After PTCA, however, the number of reinterventions is significantly higher.
In the long term, according to the BARI study, the lethality in the operated group was lower in diabetic patients.
The individual therapy recommendation by the treating physician has also proven to be an important factor in the prognosis of the patient.
The influence of the newer techniques (Stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomized studies.
A 34-year-old patient is reported with the rare clinical picture of parakeratosis variegata, which occurred after a period of 4 years following pityriasis lichenoides and varioliformis acuta.
n order to investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship of these diseases from the group of parapsoriasis changes with each other and with respect to their relationship to the low-malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T-cell type, we carried out histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses.
while both diseases had characteristic histological changes as well as a predominant lymphocytic epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor within both changes could not be ensured.
We therefore interpret both diseases as separate Entities and in this case without reference to the low malignancy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T-cell type.
A histological statement on the location of a tumor-suspecting lesion in the biopsat and its relationship to the resectate margin (R 0 or R 1) must be as accurate and unambiguous as possible.
We report on 2 technical aids that, in our experience, are particularly useful for mammary excisates:
1) Radiopaque filaments, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsat.
n contact of sevoflurane with the CO2-absorbers of the anesthesia circuit parts produces Compound A, which could have a nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been carried out in volunteer subjects with the aim of analyzing the effects of Compound A on kidney function.
A total of three studies in subjects explored the effects of 8-hour anesthesia with a sevoflurane concentration of 3% by volume, using fresh gas flows of approximately 2 L/min each.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose and enzymes from the renal tubular cells in the urine of the subjects after Sevofluran.
n the subsequent investigations then found either no relevance or even no changes at all in the renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined in subjects 3% by volume of sevoflurane which had been administered over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
n the transfer of these results into clinical practice, in any case, the experimental nature of the anesthesia carried out in these studies must be taken into account.
f the topic of low-flow anesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, the studies in the volunteer subjects, as well as the results of new clinical studies, indicate that the kidney function after surgical procedures under low-flow conditions behaves in a similar way as after isoflurane.
there is no published experience in the therapy of paraphilias (pedophiles, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse actions with LHRH- (Lutein-Releasing-Hormone-) agonists in the German-speaking world.
n this study we describe 11 patients who were treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate in a study period of 12 months.
n the treatment period, there were no further sexually aggressive actions and, according to the patients, a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges and fantasies.
A patient died by suicide.
ll, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic methods appear to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its possible carcinogenic effects.
We therefore examined five different intraoperative heat measures for their effectiveness.
Baker and coworkers first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the ultrapulse CO2 laser, a further developed device is available that enables other possible uses in ophthalmology.
Today, the diagnosis of thrombosis in the peripheral veins is possible with almost 100% certainty both by phlebography and by duplex sonography.
It is linked to the high qualification of the investigators.
In Germany, both methods are available nationwide.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnostics, but duplex sonography has gained outstanding importance due to its lack of invasiveness.
When it comes to specific questions, phlebography is indispensable.
s between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the application of the two methods is practiced as a "golden partnership" when it comes to comprehensive documentation.
Today, the chronic rejection reaction is the most important unsolved problem of kidney transplantation.
The objective of the present study was to clarify whether reendothelialization or reepithelialization by extrarenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the transplant remains allogeneic.
n this background, we examined 9 explanted transplants of antisexual donors with the help of non-radioactive in-situ hybridization (NISH).
We used biotinylated centromere-specific DNA probes for the human chromosome Y and X. In a further step, mono- and polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, Factor VIII and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in graft vasculopathy.
Our study was able to show that even several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were the inflammatory cells, which are composed primarily of T lymphocytes and macrophages.
n 1991 the Doppler sonographic determination of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the German Medical Association as one of the methods shortening the waiting time until the final diagnosis of brain death.
A survey should clarify the extent to which Doppler sonography has been used in this context since then and what experiences have been made.
400 questionnaires were sent to all Neurological (272) and Neurosurgical (128) Departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used in the sense of decision-making aids for the determination of brain death, mostly in connection with other methods.
When asked whether false positive findings had occurred, "yes" was ticked 5 times.
The meeting revealed that the investigators deliberately communicated border situations in which, in some cases, the prerequisites were not fully met.
n neither of these cases was the ultrasound examination used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a not inconsiderable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision-making aid in the diagnosis of brain death, essentially to further secure the diagnosis, less often than the sole method that shortens the waiting time.
t the endogenous formation of CO is exclusively responsible for the microsomal haemoxygenase (HO), which is present as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) and in a stress-inducible isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32).
n the present work, therefore, the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducible isoform of the enzyme after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy was investigated.
glycerol leads to a conversion of crystalline lipid structures in the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.
particularly when used in O/W emulsion, it improves the horny layer hydration to a considerable extent and significantly above the urea effect.
It also promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the horny layer and thus the correction of the horny layer.
particularly in long-term use, the deformation of the skin in the suction test can be intensified by glycerol.
The roughness of the skin surface is also influenced by glycerol-containing preparations in the sense of smoothing.
When used in O/W emulsions, glycerol also leads to a protective effect against the action of surfactants and against lipophilic pollutants.
This is probably due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerol leads to a flux from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, glycerol, like urea, can lead to an improvement in the penetration of the active ingredient.
Surgical goalSurgical goal Stabilization of posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by a posterior bone block and a capsular plastic.
Complications of the long-term course resulting from the degeneration of venous grafts can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to prolonged operation times and increased surgical trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have so far only been used in exceptional cases.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (Arterial Conduit Skeleton/T-Graft Configuration).
Materials and Methods:
3/96 bis 7/99, 405 patients with coronary multivascular disease were completely arterially revascularized in our clinic.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletal grafts, in 105 patients (25.9%) bilateral arteries thoracicae internae, in 299 patients (73.8%) internal thoracic arteries and radial arteries and in 1 patient (0.3%) 1 radial artery.
In 346 patients (85.4%) the implantation of the two arterial grafts in T-configuration took place.
On average, 4.1 +/- 0.9 coronary vessels per patient were anastomosed.
Hospital lethality was 2%.
asteroidal wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
Complications after removal of the radial artery were not recorded except for temporary paresthesia.
n the angiographic control 1 week postoperatively 96.7% of coronary anastomoses were free of stenoses >50%.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletal arteries and the T-graft technique is a safe method for the therapy of coronary multivascular disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow their routine use.
The different treatment methods for periprosthetic thigh fracture after endoprosthetic replacement of the knee joints are discussed.
A new method of supplying such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS-Sytem (LISS, Synthes) is described and the first clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has been given a key position within neuromonitoring, although due to the brain pressure the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron cannot be registered directly and only with a time delay.
for a reliable measurement of brain pressure are the specific properties of brain pressure probes, which are to be investigated below.
These should be analyzed and categorized from a measurement technical point of view in order to obtain a better understanding of their different functioning and measurement properties.
The partial sphincterectomy is practiced here as part of cataract surgery with a very narrow pupil (< 3 mm).
We assume that the narrow pupil is mainly caused by a fibrosis ring of the M. sphincter pupillae.
While the health-related quality of life of adults is increasingly being researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
In the present work, works published in the literature on the health-related quality of life of children are evaluated with regard to the focal points and methods of research.
The overview shows that empirical work is so far rare, the existing measuring instruments for the quality of life of children are described.
ncreased research activities are necessary in order to be able to use the recording of children's quality of life in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were recorded during the last 5 days before the onset of acute renal failure and compared with a control group.
Andy Warhol underwent a Dermabrasio in 1957 because of skin changes that, on the basis of the available biographical material, must be evaluated as incipient Rhinophym.
cross his entire artistic creative phase, the artist's preoccupation with aspects of plastic surgery, especially in the nasal area, can be demonstrated.
As a founder of pop art, Warhol's overall work has had a significant impact on modern society and has also influenced our demands for aesthetic forms.
n an interdisciplinary approach, the HepaVision program (MEVIS, Bremen), specially developed for the 3D visualization of the liver, was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extended liver resections and liver life donations.
Experience with the program is available for >50 volume datasets of biphasic spiral CT scans.
fter the active nonspecific immunotherapy adjuvant and palliative has favorably influenced the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of an active specific immunotherapy.
It involves a gene transfer that can be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma there are:
tion with tumor-specific, HLA-associated antigens by means of peptides or "naked DNA", vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with a cytokine gene or with B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T cells propagated in vitro, transfected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of the tumor cells in vivo with a tumor suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of falsification tendencies ("defense") of some patients on the evaluation of therapy results has not been precisely assessed so far.
309 inpatients treated with talk psychotherapy and followed up a year later are shown to what extent raters on the CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES scales can be influenced by the patients' defensive attitudes, which are measured with the validity scales of the personality tests MMPI-K, FPI-R and Gießen -Test were measured:
the tendency to put oneself in a favorable light ("social desirability"), and the tendency to appear unobtrusive-normal.
Their relative improvements (effect strengths rating scales) are less as their openness increases (validity scales). - Stationary talk psychotherapy strengthened the defense in aggravating patients and reduced it in concealing patients.
Despite early conservative and then timely, operative therapy adapted to the severity of the deformity, about 25% of recurrences and residual deformities requiring treatment are reported.
The main cause seems to be the lack of concentric repositioning and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complexes.
The most common deformity is forefoot adduction and supination.
From the experience of 94 operated recurrent/residual cruciate feet (patients < 10 years), the age-dependent surgical procedure is presented.
beyond 8 to 10 years of age come metatarsal osteotomies, the correction according to Ilizarov with the external fixator and as a last resort the triple arthrodesis is used.
uscellnävi show a pronounced variability of their clinical morphs.
We report on a 77-year-old patient with a stylized, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus in her torso.
for this grape-like appearance we propose the expression "Nävus corymbiformis".
for ethical and socio-economic reasons (cost explosion in the transfusion system, fate of individual patients) the further development and consistent application of foreign blood-saving measures in medicine poses a challenge to anesthesiologists, surgeons and transfusion physicians.
The combination of various methods, such as e.g. preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative hemodilution, choice of anesthesia method, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics and mechanical autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, make it possible to save the transfusion of allogeneic blood even for patients with large intraoperative blood losses.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), Director of the Kiel Gynecology and Midwifery Institute, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetrics.
He directed research and teaching on the empirically feasible.
His main work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
of the pelvic dimensions and inspection of the Michaelis-Raute named after him provided him with a reliable prognosis about the risks of the birth process.
ity and conscientiousness characterized his research:
self-critically published er medical failures, critically examined er new theories.
He was the first in Germany to confirm the teaching of Semmelweis for the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
n desperation over the death of many patients in the kindergarten, which he was partly to blame for, he chose Freitod in 1848.
In one case, the tumor may be responsible for a long-known arousal conduction disorder (AV block) and for the sudden onset of death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can trigger temporary stimulus effects in humans in circumscribed areas of the cortex.
New applications for functional-anatomical questions on language lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and previous experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptic effects is discussed and recommendations for application safety are given.
neurinomes of the N. facialis are rare, benign tumors that mostly occur in the course of the distal intratemporal section of the nerves, after extratemporal adulthood and then are noticed extracranially as a spatial requirement.
The most common symptom is a progressive peripheral facial paresis.
The patient complained of diffuse vertigo, a progressive sound perception disorder on the left and a mild peripheral facial paresis without a deficit of tear secretion.
The neuronome was detected by computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
via an extradural "middle fossa approach" the tumor was removed without injury to the motor N. facialis.
This is the first report of an isolated neuroma of N. petrosus major without Motor Nervus facialis Affection.
Status epilepticus (SE) is present when there is a continuous seizure or several seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, the current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
The initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients. If unsuccessful, Phenytoin and Phenobarbital are used.
The therapy refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialized intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
In this phase of the disease, the most suitable procedure is not yet known;
Barbiturate, Midazolam and Propofol are alternatively applicable active substances.
For the therapy of an outdated rupture of the tendon of the anterior M. tibialis, either a tendon transposition or a tendon transplant is recommended.
Using a case example, the operative care with an increased reverse plastic is described;
3 years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively symptom-free with good functional results.
versal plastic has the advantage that there is no functional loss compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance conveys valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment strategies in many clinical pictures.
To detect this parameter in intensive care patients, the analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well-defined and proven in large prospective studies, are used above all.
The ventilatoric and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities, on the other hand, as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and the prognosis in chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the validity of these clinical pictures.
Sepsis and MODS, as diseases that are particularly relevant for intensive care medicine, are also associated with an impairment of autonomous function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
n the restriction of heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ("Uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems to be becoming increasingly attractive in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report 3 patients with an acquired green discoloration of the head hair.
The anamnesis showed that all 3 patients regularly bathed in the private Swimmingpool.
xamination of the hair by means of atomic emission spectroscopy revealed an excessively high copper content as the cause of the green discoloration.
n our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic link between this exogenous hair discoloration and the absorption of copper by the swimming water of in-house swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different times after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint sheet, global quality of life assessment, Munich Quality of Life-Dimensions-List (MLDL), Expected or experienced changes according to HTx.
n the evaluation, individual measured values were represented by median (Me), mean (M) and standard deviation (SD).
operatively, 84% of terminal heart failure patients rated their quality of life as very poor;
6 weeks postoperatively this parameter improved, and 74% of transplant recipients found their quality of life to be very good to excellent.
The preoperative patients were also very dissatisfied with the physical performance (87%) and the health condition (80%).
six weeks after the transplant these areas improved significantly, 76% of the patients showed a high level of satisfaction with the health condition and 51% with the physical performance.
f the patients already assessed their mental state as good before HTx, this parameter still improved postoperatively and reached significantly higher values after one year (preop.
Range (R)=3.78 vs. 12 Mon. postop.
HTx quality of life correlated best with health status (r=0.61, p<0.01), 6 months after transplantation best with health status satisfaction (r=0.76, p<0.01).
According to HTx, the areas of sexuality, professional situation and leisure activities only improved in about 28% of patients.
fter the transplant, 90% suffered from one or more symptoms, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal heart failure already 6 weeks after HTx, all areas of quality of life with the exception of mental state are significantly improved.
spite too high expectations and postoperative complaints, heart transplant recipients are significantly happier with their postoperative living situation.
A 36-year-old man suffered an isolated craniocerebral trauma (SHT) with skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma and a contusion hemorrhage after a bicycle fall [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The space-demanding hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP values made a barbiturate coma over 10 days necessary.
aggravating, the patient developed septic lung failure on the 8th day after trauma.
The patient showed a protracted course and could only be transferred to neurorehabilitation 57 days after the accident.
In the following time, the patient developed a massive limitation of mobility in both hip joints (Extension/Flexion:
0 Grad/10 Grad/20 Grad, links:
Abduction/ Adduction:
10 Grad/0 Grad/25 Grad, links:
ncyclosing heterotopic ossifications (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker Type IV) were shown in the pelvic overview and computed tomography.
2 years after the accident, the HOs were removed in two stages, each via a Smith-Petersen access road.
HO-recidivprophylaxis was carried out by means of a single preoperative irradiation (8 Gy) and a postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg/day) over 3 months.
The range of motion at the hip joints is 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection as follows:
20 Grad/0 Grad/30 Grad, links:
Abduction/Adduction:
30 Grad/0 Grad/40 Grad, links:
radiologically, no recurrence of HO has been shown so far.
3 years after the accident, the patient can pursue light activities as a farmer.
A detection system for Dermatophytes by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been developed.
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene that codes for the small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA) of fungi.
PCR made it possible to amplify the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes, in addition to those of some yeast and molds.
by hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides it was possible to identify Dermatophytes and Candida albicans.
Restriction fragment analysis allowed the dermatophytes to be distinguished from yeasts and moulds.
The specificity of the PCR for fungi was checked on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermis samples as well as on selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were examined with PCR and culture.
Dermatophytes were detected with the PCR in 35 and with the culture in 28 of the 38 positively evaluated patient samples.
The sensitivity of the PCR (92%) was higher than that of the culture (73%).
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture in the detection of dermatophytes.
arthroscopy of the wrist has helped to develop a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the assessment of kinematic stability.
n addition to functional radiological procedures, wrist arthroscopy is of crucial importance here.
njuries to the ulnar disc and the scapholunary ligament are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
Over the last decade, mitochondrial DNA analysis has increasingly found application in forensic practice, archaeology, and in evolutionary and population genetic studies.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA is described with special consideration of the non-coding hypervariable regions.
The importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biological investigations is also discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases as well as requirements for their scope and structure are explained.
The results of experimental work with the aim of obtaining mitochondrial DNA from soiled teeth, hair shafts and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases are presented, which could be clarified with the help of mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the presented work is to present the findings reported in the literature as well as one's own observations.
microperimetric investigations after operative extraction of chorioidal neovascularization membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep skotome is formed in the region of the resulting pigment epithelial loss.
The operational effort must be weighed against the possible functional results of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with its high soft tissue contrast is the imaging method of choice for imaging the intra-articular structures and the surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labrum lesions of the hip joint.
MR-Arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows the direct representation of labrum lesions through the distension of the joint space and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D-) sequences enable assessment in the crucial cranio-central sections.
The labrum lesions can be divided into different, clinically relevant stages with MRA.
n addition, the presentation of concomitant lesions (intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress edema) is also possible.
n a study conducted by us with operatively verified cases, the MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
So far, there have been no complications in the more than 100 arthrographies performed.
Based on these experiences, MRA is the method of choice for imaging diagnostics of labrum lesions.
n this overview paper we present the technique and results of the MRA method we used.
t was shown that the varicose vein wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, which also affected the vein wall below a still intact venous valve.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength was in the vein wall and here in particular in the components of the extracellular matrix.
n the summary of the mechanical tests and the immunohistochemical results, the theory of the primary destruction of the valve and the subsequent varicose transformation of the vein cannot be confirmed, rather a change in the vein wall first occurs and thus also a valve insufficiency.
Arterial injuries as a direct consequence of trauma usually lead to bleeding or ischemia.
In the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries, acute ischemia may be absent.
Hypothenar-Hammer syndrome is a closure of the distal A. ulnaris as a result of trauma.
ndepending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually gradual and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to a diagnosis.
There are no proven therapy recommendations.
Diagnosis of ulnar artery occlusion as a consequence of an accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible in the first place.
In this study, the medium-term eye pressure regulation after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery is to be reviewed.
The direct antiemetic effect of Propofol is already known.
n the combinations of anesthesia induction and anesthesia maintenance with propofol result in a reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) compared to other anesthesia drugs or techniques.
This article shows how the advantage of the antiemetic effect of Propofol can be best exploited.
The possible effect of propofol on the cerebral cortex and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems are discussed by means of results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol in terms of reducing the incidence of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
The prediction of postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined jaw surgery-prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic toothless upper jaw by a conversion osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of enossal implants is rarely included in the preoperative planning.
n a prospective study since 1993 in 23 patients, the treatment concept was defined on the basis of the production of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging, with special consideration of the aesthetics of the front teeth.
In 8 patients, the operative and/or prosthetic treatment concept was modified due to the preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic result achieved.
Profile prognosis with video-imaging means a meaningful decision aid in the planning of the rehabilitation of the atrophic upper jaw, in order to take into account the mutually influencing factors - the extent of the anterior displacement of the upper jaw, the direction of insertion of enossal implants and the type of supraconstruction.
there are reports of a large-noduled multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma, the unusual clinical and histological aspects of which initially did not allow diagnosis.
n the spontaneous regression with the change of the primarily monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells as well as the lack of detection of specific cell organelles for more than 2 years was able to secure the nature of the disease.
For the treatment of diseases of the rheumatic group of forms, among other things, Thymus-Preparations are offered on the German drug market.
The published findings on Thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with an inadequate and sometimes ethically questionable study design, as well as studies that do not allow a scientifically justified statement due to the short study duration and small number of patients.
A medically justifiable therapy recommendation for thymus preparations in rheumatic diseases (e.g. in rheumatoid arthritis) can be made on this basis with sufficient, according to the state of knowledge, positive benefit-risk assessment, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment currently not derive.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the A. hepatica dextra in a 64-year-old patient.
fter initially a characteristic upper abdominal symptom, there had been repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding up to the shock symptom, the cause of which was difficult to find in the condition after Billroth-II-Magenresection.
Superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising therapeutic option.
xperiments on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic insults have shown that optimal conditions exist if the early symptoms of the stroke are quickly recognized and treatment is initiated within 3 hours after the onset of the first symptoms.
n between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy, valuable time is often lost.
The symptoms are not noticed or trivialized by patients, relatives or witnesses.
The increase in this number is to be achieved through intensified training measures that take into account both the public and emergency medical personnel.
The valid treatment standard in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure management, as well as the therapy of hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.
n the context of maintenance therapy with synthetic opioids, the effectiveness of sublingually administered buprenorphine in tablet form was compared with orally administered methadone in 40 opiate-dependent patients over a study period of 24 weeks.
n the randomized study, the retention rate (=percentage of patients who remained in the study program for the entire duration of the study and completed it as planned), additional consumption and duration of stay were defined as target parameters.
n an average daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and an average dose of 63 mg methadone resulted in a retention rate trend (p=0.06) in favor of the methadone treated group.
The failure rate in the buprenorphine-treated group (n=20) tended to be higher with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated group (n=20).
With regard to the additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine, no significant difference could be observed between the two during the course of treatment.
As far as the duration of stay in the study is concerned, methadone turned out to be the more successful substance (p=0.04).
How important and how meaningful are clinical parameters and locoregional therapy failure after radical radiotherapy of Oropharynx carcinomas for the probability of the occurrence of hematogenic metastases?
1.8.1990 und 1.10.1998 139 consecutive patients with Oropharynx carcinomas were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and examined for clinical parameters, reflexotalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T-category, lymph node infestation and pleasure habits.
29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In 25/139 patients, a radical neck dissection was performed according to the therapy concept after completing radiotherapy.
10/139 patients were later treated with a "make-up operation".
The median follow-up was 24 months (Rank 4 to 74).
At 77/139 (55%) the condition could be controlled locoregionally.
The tumor was not controlled in 62/139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local therapy failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumor diseases, were comparable in terms of Karnofsky index, age, sex, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pretherapeutic diagnostics, total dose (Gy) and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.
Tumor control was significantly co-determined by the parameters Reflexotalgia (p < 0.0078), Growth Structure (p < 0.012), T-Category (p < 0.03) and Smoking (p < 0.0285).
The median survival time of patients with locoregional therapy failure was 17 months.
t this time 81% of the locally controlled patients were still alive.
In 23% (14/62) of the patients not locoregionally controlled, distant metastases were detected, whereas in only 4/77 (5%) of the locoregionally healed patients (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most commonly lung metastases, reached a plateau after 24 months.
The locoregional tumour control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a decisive indication for the probability of the development of distant metastases.
Failure of therapy has its cause in the biological aggressiveness of tumors.
With the introduction of multi-line detector CT (MDCT) in clinical practice, a new dimension in volume acquisition and spatial and temporal resolution in CT is achieved.
However, the new technical possibilities of MDCT require a redefinition of investigation strategies in order to improve existing CT applications and open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated according to Symptoms and Current Therapy of Adductor Viper (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect consists in the development of partly threatening edema;
f more than 2-3 hours after the event there are still no signs of poisoning, the probability of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II reports on the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixer in 67 patients with a broad spectrum of reparative and reconstructive interventions on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint.
In 44 patients, the MPT fixer was applied in assembly form A and in 23 patients in assembly form B.
In 4 patients there was a deep infection, which in 2 cases was caused by the fixator.
The 63 patients treated with the MPT fixer carried the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
were 5 patients with partial patellectomy and transosseous refixation of the Lig. patellae in caudal debris fractures as well as 12 patients with transosseous suture refixation of the Lig. patellae in tears and tears at the lower Patellapol or suture adaptation of the Lig. patellae in intraligamentary ruptures, in which no other care was provided at the knee joint besides the extensor surgery.
In 2 patients, the result was classified as normal according to the IKDC-Score, in 10 as almost normal and in 4 as abnormal.
Isokinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients had a strength deficit of the extensor muscles on the operated leg of 10-20% compared to the opposite side.
nsummarizing, it can be stated that the EPTT with the MPT fixer has proven itself in continuity-restoring interventions on the distal extension apparatus of the knee joint and represents a powerful alternative to the patellotibial crushing with wire or synthetic tape material.
mbolic diseases of the venous systems are often difficult to diagnose.
Modern diagnostic possibilities as well as the development of diagnostic algorithms make it possible today to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolisms.
This article presents the methods currently used for the diagnosis of acute and chronic pulmonary embolisms and describes diagnostic strategies whose benefits have been investigated in clinical studies.
Based on the case study of a 6-year-old boy, Hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis caused by UVA exposure with possible eye involvement in children, is presented.
n light-exposed areas, numerous hemorrhagic vesicles appear at the beginning of the light-rich season, recurring until adulthood, and heal scarred.
n the framework of a field test, we gained experience in the use of the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiological department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynecology.
The central type of imaging in the X-ray diagnostics of oral, jaw and facial surgery is the panoramic layer imaging.
The reduction of the dose requirement has also become possible through further developments in equipment technology, X-ray films and through new detection systems such as sensors or storage films.
Diagnostic inadequacies of the conventional types of imaging make imaging by means of computed tomography and nuclear spin tomography unavoidable in numerous clinical questions of oral, jaw and facial surgery.
although nuclear spin tomography v. a. is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now also allows, due to the shortening of the measurement times, to map changes in the corticalis.
n certain questions, such as e.g. changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine methods enable an image-assisted functional analysis.
Today, body-oriented psychotherapy is used inpatient and outpatient, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are of particular importance in patients whose body sensation is reduced, whose emotionality is limited or, due to character resistances, difficult to achieve in verbal psychotherapy.
The most frequently used methods today are given with short examples, other methods are pointed out.
Factors mentioned as effective include the connection of the affections to the vegetative and arbitrary nervous system as well as the close connection between psychic and physical processes, which exists especially at the beginning of life, which is connected with the form of interaction experienced in each case and has psychobiological effects.
n the further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire a symbolic and important importance for the therapy.
The relationship of body-oriented methods to verbal psychotherapy, especially to psychoanalysis, is discussed.
s to empirical research are pointed out.
Psychotherapists live in a field of tension between family ideal and reality, which have been shaped by various current and past experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence career choices and personal life plans.
although the psychotherapeutic activity gives the individual a lot of leeway to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy, especially for psychotherapists, to realize a family model that corresponds to them and their partners.
Three models are presented and described in their effects.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic activity on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
Psychotherapists should pay the same attention to their personal relationships in their training and further education as they do to their therapeutic relationships with patients.
With a prevalence of 0.1%, advanced cardiac insufficiency is gaining increasing importance within the patient collective with cardiovascular diseases.
The 6- to 12-month survival probability is significantly limited at 50-75%.
nce the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the therapy of choice for drug therapy of refractory heart failure.
However, the growing mismatch between supply and demand for suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive listing for heart transplantation.
n recent years, promising new conservative and alternative approaches to surgical therapy have developed.
Conventional drug therapy has been improved by the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive beta-blockers.
Surgical therapy of advanced heart failure has been expanded by the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk flap surgery, mechanical assisted hearts, implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, ventricular reduction plastic surgery, cardiomyoplasty and multisite pacing.
These therapy options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The success of treatment depends crucially on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
This requires the creation of risk scores based on national and international patient registers.
In the example of a 30-bed ward of the Orthopedic University Hospital Bochum, the occurrence of TLA procedures is compared to manual therapeutic procedures over a period of one year.
In contrast, there were 122 manual therapeutic manipulations, carried out at HWS, BWS and LWS by the respective ward physicians with completed further training.
While the TLA focused on the main predilection site of the respective clinical picture (pseudoradicular HWS and LWS syndromes), the manual therapy primarily referred to secondary findings in other spinal layers in patients with the aforementioned diagnoses or with postdiscotomy syndrome.
The migration of a retinated lower jaw tooth from the site of its attachment to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report we present the documented case of the migration of a retinated lower premolar into the muscularis process over a period of 14 years.
The migration along the ascending lower jaw branches to the muscular process took place after the end of the root growth, after the 20th year of the patient's life.
Neither radiologically nor clinically were there any concrete causes for such an extensive migration in this patient.
The incidence of prostate carcinoma and cases that can be treated curatively by means of radical prostate vesiclectomy is increasing.
The precise pathological examination of the surgical preparations determines the stage classification and thus the assessment of the prognosis as well as the further clinical procedure.
Since there is no standardized method for the processing of the preparations internationally, the comparability of different scientific studies is made more difficult.
The precisely defined, rational observation of the preparations proposed by us is intended to solve these problems and help improve the interdisciplinary dialogue.
The rapid increase in the requirements for documentation, performance recording, cost-effectiveness and quality control, requires the use of IT tools in the clinic.
n the Orthopaedic Clinic of Justus-Liebig-University, Gießen, a client-server-based OP-planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been in use since 1992, which has been continuously developed.
n addition to the legal ones, the clinical-scientific requirements of clinically active doctors have been taken into account in particular.
The application contains the basic functions of patient stem data management, surgical planning (termination of procedures, resource planning), surgical documentation (coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, clinic communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical text processing.
By the simultaneous integration of the WEB-Servers in MedXS, content and functions can be simultaneously retrieved from the Intranet or the Internet via each Web-Browser (NetscapeTM, Internet-ExplorerTM).
With the use of the application, important simplifications of clinical processes have been achieved and far better conditions have been created for budget negotiations with health insurance companies.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is characterized by unspecific neurological symptoms as well as v.a. facial dysmorphic signs.
However, the presence of congenital leukodermas (Piebaldism, Partial Albinism) is considered relatively typical and mostly trend-setting.
rrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that should not be underestimated, especially in young patients.
of the therapy is the treatment of ventricular tachycardias and the prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death.
n individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM there is a manifest cardiac insufficiency, which is treated with medication according to the usual therapy guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method by which a tumor can be examined for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and yield a genetic pattern that captures alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal levels.
The question of a necessary patella replacement in the context of total knee prosthetics is generally still very controversial.
n this context is our need to obtain more information about the spontaneous development of a non-replaced patella in the prosthetic environment than only in comparison to the prosthetically supplied patella.
The fact that for almost 5 years we have only carried out patella replacement in special cases has made available to us a patient pool on which this question can be studied.
s of 30 total prosthetically treated knees documented with 2-year follow-up, we have carried out a targeted survey of the patella shift and tilt, first directed to the natural and then to the prosthetic femoral patella slide bearing, and the results on the range of motion achieved after 2 years and to persistent pain symptoms related.
Adjustment of the osseous patella silhouette to the prosthesis sliding bearing was regularly observed with compaction of the marginal bone contact zone with or without a fibrous spacer layer;
On the basis of their clinical follow-up, 7 patients were assigned to a "residual problem group" because they had residual symptoms (n = 3) or a mobility of only 90/0/0 degrees Flexion/Extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were there cases with postoperative Shift above 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with postoperative Tilt above 15 degrees (n = 3).
Within this group, symptoms with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility with a severe preoperative shift were also correlated, also with a significant difference to the problem-free collective.
A special case is a patient with a severe secondary deterioration of the kneecap course (16 mm/39 degrees) due to an aseptic tibial prosthesis loosening.
fter the axis-correcting change of the tibial components, this patient also became symptom-free again and was able to move well, without any surgical measures having been taken on the patella and although a considerable residual tilt remained.
It is therefore obvious that a greater effort seems justified for the refocusing to reach a residual shift below 5 mm:
n addition to common surgical steps during implantation that favorably influence the course of the kneecap, e.g. a high displacement of the quadriceps or a medially displaced refixation of the detached tuberosities may become necessary.
In contrast, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, since the non-prosthetically supplied patella has an amazing adaptability to the prosthetic sliding bearing by remodeling the bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative malposition, in which we had not made a replacement due to good peroperative bone quality, we had to accept more late problems even with normalized kneecap progression.
Whether in such cases there is an extended indication for patella replacement remains open.
The quality assurance program of the VDR and the publications on quality assurance of the DGRh provide the framework for the external quality assurance measures.
By introducing comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic, the quality could be measurably increased.
Improvements were achieved through the implementation of targeted measures and changes in clinic structures.
, measures related to patient needs and the processing of internal treatment processes have been in the foreground.
To increase employee satisfaction and qualification, rehabilitation-specific training series were carried out.
New forward-looking perspectives could be developed together with other partners.
The goal of surgery is to avoid or eliminate compression on the nerve structures.
The present paper provides an overview of oncocytic metastases and neoplasms.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that in oncocytic cells of the parathyroid gland as well as the liver, defects of the respiratory chain occur more frequently in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear.
t is to be assumed that oncocytic Metaplasias differ pathogenetically from oncocytic Neoplasias.
In addition, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasms.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas occur preferentially in the thyroid gland, whereas they are comparatively rare in other organs.
Which molecular genetic mechanisms are responsible for this is still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis-enteropathica-like skin changes in a patient on a longer-term parenteral diet.
similar to the autosomal recessive enteropathic acrodermatitis, the skin changes of this patient are also based on a zinc deficiency of the organism.
Zinc substitution leads to an impressive improvement.
53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with neurodermatitis and a highly healthy sample of 52 people are compared with each other regarding their sexual behavior.
As test procedures, questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used.
The examined skin diseases differ significantly from skin diseases in the sense of an impaired sexual life.
The exchange of tenderness is in both sexes, the ability to orgasm is highly significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatics feel more impaired compared to patients with neurodermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with neurodermatitis have never been asked about their sex life by their treating physician.
n all problems of addressing this intimate area, however, the doctor for skin and venereal diseases should be a competent interlocutor for questions concerning the skin disease and its consequences for sexual life.
Even today, the conventional X-ray image must be regarded as a basic examination in the case of a clinical question about inflammatory-rheumatic disease.
t its information potential includes not only inflammatory destructions but also their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image of the collateral phenomena can indicate a clinical thrust situation and represent the inflammatory volume increase of the joints and tendon sheaths directly and indirectly.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, in particular through the detailed representation of cortical bone structures - complementary to MR -, offers highly specific information on some specific issues, especially on the trunk skeleton and on individual large joints, partly for the definitive diagnosis position, partly also for the planning of operations.
This applies, inter alia, to the cruciate artery joints, the asteroclavicular joints and the upper HWS.
care of open fractures of the lower leg, II degree and III degree, with simultaneous soft tissue damage includes nowadays a wide range of operative possibilities of primary osteosynthesis.
via the external fixator, the undrilled medullary nail to the primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this is done under the primacy of soft tissue coverage.
n recent decades, it has been possible to significantly reduce the hitherto high rate of invalidating amputations and infections only through the associated successes.
s it was only individual case observations, but the signs increased that frequently these patients had soft tissue problems in the lower leg from the recurrent tendency to swell up to the ulcer cruris.
Based on a clinical study using venous occlusion plethysmography on 80 patients from the years of injury 1985-1994 and compared with 50 healthy subjects, it was shown that more than 50% of all patients suffer clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
The severity of this damage ranges from a simple tendency to swell to ulcer cruris, which becomes more important in its clinical relevance with increasing time distance from the accident event.
To avoid further damage, including iatrogenic damage, strict observance of the surgical guidelines in primary care is required, and postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Correction of bone meta-epiphyseal misalignment of the tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of the shape and function of the limbs.
s are highly glycosylated glycoproteins that have a multiplicity of antigenic determinants consisting of carbohydrates and/or peptide sequences.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry yielded extensive insights into their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, it was possible to describe typical changes in antigen profiles during the neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues.
A number of recent results further indicate that mucin-associated antigens play a significant role in tumor biology, for example in metastasis and as prognostic markers.
n the present paper, including its own findings, provides an overview of the gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology.
By setting up rheumatology centers in Germany, it has been possible in recent years to achieve a networking of outpatient and inpatient areas with the resident general practitioners, internists and orthopedic rheumatologists, nurse gymnasts, occupational therapists and psychologists working in them, as well as the acute and rehabilitation clinics.
Rheumatological control centers can contribute in the long run to further improving the cooperation between all doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatological patients and to ensure continuous and long-term treatment and care for chronic rheumatological patients in the sense of comprehensive rheumatological quality management, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
spite the increasing frequency of medicolegal problems, the knowledge about the type and frequency of treatment errors after thyroid operations is low.
Analysis of a collective of 21,515 complaints from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg Medical Chambers revealed 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the observation period.
n 36 cases (16%) the expert commissions found treatment errors.
95% of the complaints concerned the surgeon, 2% the anesthesiologist, 3% both disciplines and once an ENT doctor.
% of the complaints related to complications after routine thyroid interventions.
typic surgical complications such as recurrence spares (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), hemorrhage (3%) and late relapse (1%) together accounted for 63% of treatment error allegations, but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits (10%), infections (5%), left nodules (4%), scar problems (5%) accounted for 37% of the allegations, but 70% of the treatment errors.
defects in clarification were present in only 11% of the treatment errors identified.
f detection of a treatment error was particularly common when a new operation became necessary (p < 0.001), when the operation goal was not achieved (p < 0.001) or when a complication was followed by an error in the post-treatment (p < 0.001).
The field "Environment and Health" is characterized by an interdisciplinary character and a resulting high need for communication.
to make matters worse, there are sometimes considerable problems in obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this area has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform for this area.
Indications are bilateral renal tumors, renal tumors in patients with functional and anatomical individual kidneys as well as in patients with impaired renal function who are threatened with renal insufficiency requiring dialysis after tumor nephrectomy (imperative indications).
>95% of patients with multiple and advanced kidney tumors can also be saved from nephrectomy with subsequent dialysis through surgical strategic improvements - such as perfusion in hypothermia and workbench surgery.
ffected by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-sustaining kidney tumor surgery in imperative indications, an increasing number of centers are recommending the extension of parenchymal sparing kidney tumor surgery to a selected group of patients with contralateral healthy kidneys (selective indications).
f an incidence of bilateral renal carcinoma of only 2%, however, the benefit of elective resection appears small.
The prognosis after local recurrence is in most cases infaust.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has so far been most commonly described in small cell bronchial carcinomas.
We report on 3 patients with CAR in the presence of a breast carcinoma or a carcinomoid of the cervix uteri.
Background and questions.
To develop rational treatment guidelines, the pathogenic and resistance situation of skin diseases potentially caused by bacteria was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognized standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regime is not only effective, but v. a. low side effects.
The following is a report on a patient in whom, as part of this combination treatment, pronounced, long-lasting hyperpigmentations were observed in the healed psoriasis sites.
extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard therapy for urolithiasis.
Different lithotriptors have been developed with largely the same technical principles.
n the current discussion are the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the probability of a recurrence, which further make a corresponding metaphylaxis useful.
while the side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL in addition to other forms of therapy are still pending.
fter treatment of a fibrin reaction in the anterior segment of the eye by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), clinically isolated acute corneal calcifications were observed.
The previously unknown pathomechanism prompted some to the following investigations.
The co-occurrence of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF-ET) and active tuberculosis can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case study, we present the symptoms, diagnosis and therapy of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF pregnancy.
various possibilities are discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, first described in 1901 by Karl Landsteiner, can be genotyped using the polymerase chain reaction using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6].
By using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after restriction digestion, represented on a polyacrylamide gel by means of silver staining.
The following allele frequencies could be determined in a southwest German population group:
Allele A = 0.2704, Allele B = 0.0741 and Allele 0 = 0.6556.
In 10 out of 280 examined persons (3.57%), a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype was shown with the examination method chosen here, which only takes into account the nucleotide positions 261 and 703, since a differentiation between the A and 02 allele is not possible.
Chondropathia patellae usually does not require arthroscopic clarification.
That exceptions must apply, the following Kasuistik should prove.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral patella facette after a football game.
arthroscopically it was a solid, nodular, connective tissue-converted hematoma that effortlessly with a fetus:
n the football game there had obviously been a haemorrhage due to bruising or Patella subluxation.
The boy was symptom-free after the arthroscopy, the muscular atrophy rapidly regressed.
thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions in the course of their disease.
In the short and medium term, glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and lasting effect on the symptoms of inflammation.
data are presented that suggest a longer-term effect (longer than one year).
recent studies clearly show a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
by distinguishing the short-term effects of inflammation inhibition from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these more recent studies additionally provide insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical studies support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes that are only loosely connected by the underlying causes of RA, but develop to some extent independently of each other.
t is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids could relate to different mechanisms, shown elsewhere in this Symposium.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenesis cells express - and -chains of 1-, 3- and 4-integrins as well as their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules (AM) show a pronounced intra- and inter-individual variation as well as different localizations on the sperm surface.
The "nested" polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
to this day it is unclear whether the AMs have functional relevance for the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells or represent only "biological redundancy" or only the very last binding protection (final insurance).
The labeling of sperm-AM was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of the sperm plasma membrane in the seminal plasma, and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone with a diverse spectrum of action produced and secreted by the Glandula pinealis under the influence of -adrenergic receptors.
The release of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, uniform levels during the day and an evening rise and nocturnal peak between 2.00 and 4.00 a.m.
In addition, Melatonin has the ability to diffuse freely through cell membranes and to act as a radical scavenger in extra- and intracellular space, independently of a receptor system, due to its strong lipophilic properties.
The affinity to the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly great.
In dermatology, there are prospects for melatonin in some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The effect of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
In topical application, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of a UV-erythema.
There are some findings about the penetration properties through the skin and oral availability, which can be supplemented by further investigations of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
he importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics in chronic inflammation lies, on the one hand, in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals, which make it possible to locate a focus of inflammation when the focus is unclear, since the possibility of whole-body scintigraphy and the SPECT technique is given, and, on the other hand, in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals, which, for example, B. allow the proof of leukocyte infiltration.
Both method approaches are complementary to X-ray morphological methods, which can specify a found focus in more detail or which entail inflammation scintigraphy in the case of unclear findings.
Background and questions.
Cryosurgery has long been established as a method for the treatment of capillary hemangiomas in infants.
Surprisingly, however, there is a lack of detailed studies that prove their effectiveness in tumors that are regularly subject to spontaneous regression.
The prognosis of the patient depends on both the primary, mechanical brain damage and the development of secondary brain damage.
n addition to the intracranial space requirement due to post-traumatic hemorrhages and edema formations, as well as the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as causes of secondary brain damage.
n both isolated SHT and polytrauma with and without brain damage, an inflammatory "systemic response" (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single or multi-organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and functional disorders are usually survivable, but can be fatal in their combination and accumulation.
Hypermetabolic states after an SHT are also considered as interactions of the CNS with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
these effects of an SHT on the rest of the organism is the influence of multiple injuries of a polytraumatized injured person on brain function, whereby shock-induced perfusion disorders can cause prognosis-limiting hypoxia of the brain.
n addition, the generalized "whole-body inflammatory response" influences blood clotting, metabolism and fracture healing.
The knowledge of the trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the whole organism, as well as the influence of the currently applied therapeutic measures are still insufficient and require further clarification.
From this point of view, the choice of the right time for secondary interventions that do not directly serve life support and lead to an additional burden on the patient due to the trauma of the operation must also be reconsidered.
This work attempts to summarize important aspects in this field.
n order to better differentiate between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate carcinoma, but also for the early detection of prostate carcinoma, the molecular forms of PSA and more recently also human kallikrein 2 (hK2) have proven to be valuable decision-making aids.
Children with preformative cleavage have an increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems can be affected.
The literature on the incidence of heart defects varies considerably.
46 psychotherapy dropouts were compared with 599 completers and examined for conspicuous personality traits.
They were also asked by questionnaire about their personal reasons for the demolitions.
Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema or Oudtshoorn skin was described as an early childhood manifest, dominant hereditary dermatosis with partially circus reeding erythemas especially in families from the South African district of Oudtshoorn.
The seasonal association with the winter months and the characteristic histologically multiform finding distinguishes this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate the clinical, histological and first immunohistological findings of a 4-year-old female patient, which go well with erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area could not be traced.
17 studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondarthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), localized and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed in terms of their results and their scientific quality.
The vast majority of the work seen through reveals clear deficiencies.
This study should examine whether the visual acuity decreases as a function of the performance time, and whether normal people and Nystagmus patients are disadvantaged by these regulations in the driving assessment.
Sudeck Syndrome affects an extremity after microtrauma or surgery.
There is currently no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck Syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck syndrome were caused by an excessively strong inflammatory response to an injury or operation on an extremity.
His theory found no followers, as most of the medical profession holds the view that Sudeck syndrome is triggered by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We conducted various clinical and experimental investigations and also detected the effects of an antiphlogistic therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
This paper presents methods for the application of fast multi-layer spiral CT for cardiac imaging by means of ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition.
n addition to the radiological examination methods commonly used in dentistry, computer tomography enables a superimposed representation of the upper and lower jaws.
n addition to the already established use of CT in malignant diseases, its use has proven itself in other questions.
f the examination is carried out with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of retinated teeth in the jawbone and the damage to permanent teeth caused by the retinated teeth can be assessed, so that early therapy is possible.
f the periodontal gap of the retinated tooth can be delimited, orthodontic classification is possible.
In the case of inflammatory dental diseases, the horizontal and vertical bone degradation must be precisely determined.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic spatial demands can be determined with CT.
f an intended implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by accurately taking into account the remaining bone substance and the position of nerves and foramina.
If an implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants can be determined.
Up to 70% of all patients with sepsis develop septic encephalopathy (SE).
Case examples are used to describe the symptoms of SE.
symptom is a clouding of consciousness up to coma.
cranial computed tomography is usually also normal, a generalized brain edema can occur.
ncephalogram shows a general change, the extent of which correlates with the degree of SE.
-mediated defense reactions of the organism to bacterial products as well as the bacteremia itself are essential etiological factors.
Due to a disturbance in the amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors such as electrolyte shifts, hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, shock and ischemia, as well as liver and kidney failure may be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
Since an early adequate therapy of sepsis is of decisive prognostic importance, SE as a possible initial symptom of sepsis is of particular diagnostic importance.
ndogenous endophthalmitis in severe general disorders and reduced general condition has an extremely poor prognosis despite modern antibacterial, antimycotic and surgical therapy.
tell stories.
are particularly tense those scenes in which people are put before decision-making conflicts.
Medical-ethical conflicts appear not only in medical series or disease representations, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedies, Westerns, Love Films, Gangster- and Crime Films.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films draw on moral values and at the same time are seismographs for the social relevance of medical-ethical topics.
However, in the film, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical-ethical case review and is a helpful supplement to the teaching of analytical and communicative skills.
Reduction of restenosis rate compared to conventional PTCA has resulted in stent implantation becoming the most commonly performed initial intervention.
therefore, in-stent restenosis - especially the long-term form - represents a significant clinical and economic problem nowadays.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty with respect to these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The preclinical management of amputation injuries places great demands on the emergency services.
t the first aid of the amputee in the case of amputation injuries, in addition to the first aid of the injured, often decides on the success of the recovery measures.
The primary goal of laryngeal imaging diagnostics is the analysis of submucosal structures that are not accessible to laryngoscopic assessment.
t is therefore a general rule to carry out the imaging diagnostics of the Larynx with knowledge of the findings of the endoscopic diagnostics.
The topographical-anatomical relationships of the skeletons, the internal structures and the surroundings of the Larynx will be presented synoptically.
nstability was eliminated by a transpedicular stabilization with a screw-ring belt system while maintaining segmental function.
n recent years, new knowledge has been gained about the post-traumatic changes after craniocerebral trauma (SHT) and the associated pathophysiological connections.
n addition to corresponding changes in neurotraumatology-intensive care management, this has led to the development of drugs intended to reduce the occurrence of secondary damage in brain-injured patients.
n the framework of this work, the recent findings of the pathophysiological changes after SHT and the fundamental pharmacological intervention possibilities will be discussed.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are in differently advanced experimental and clinical trial stages.
Background and questions.
Melanoma patients in stage IV with advanced course of the disease represent a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of the present work was to examine the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the course of the disease in melanoma patients who had been treated.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been taking prophylactic minocycline for over 3 years due to pulmonary silicosis before symptomless black spots appeared on his face.
In the other patient, after only 6 months of taking minocycline due to folliculitis, gray-black spots appeared on both lower legs.
A sample treatment with the ruby laser led to a re-formation of the pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The various clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed using the case examples.
Operation goal Elimination of the deformity of a Digitus quintus superductus and varus.
n recent years, microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area.
An essential factor here is the regaining of neuronal abilities.
n the framework of this study, the sensitive regeneration ability of the lower alveolaris N. after tumor surgical partial resection and reconstruction with the vascularized N. thoracicus longus was post-examined.
- and pain sensation could already be felt 3 months, touch and vibration at the earliest 5 months and thermal stimuli at the earliest 7 months postoperatively.
The vascularly styled N. thoracicus longus thus represents a suitable nerve transplant for bridging resection-related defects of the lower N. alveolaris in tumor patients.
taking paracetamol (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) has been shown to be the most common cause of intentional overdose of the drug in the United States and the United Kingdom, yet a large number of overdoses only lead to serious complications in a relatively small number.
Severe liver toxicity must be expected in any patient for whom the standard dosage has been exceeded and the minimum hepatotoxic dose is 125 mg/kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
n addition, a complete treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be carried out in every patient for whom the strength or timing of the overdose is unknown, regardless of their serum levels.
n all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine must be continued if liver function deteriorates.
n the incipient signs of severe hepatotoxicity, a specialist should be called in to ensure optimal therapy or immediate transfer in case of acute liver failure.
n the most difficult cases, the liver transplant has considerably improved the fate of a hitherto incurable group of patients, but a further improvement can only be made through closer cooperation between the referring hospitals and the special facilities for liver diseases.
Background and questions.
Itching is a difficult-to-treat side effect of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases.
n recent years Capsaicin, an alkaloid from the pepper plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
n on topical application after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation, capsaicin blocks unmyelinated, polymodal C and A nerve fibers and thereby selectively suppresses itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a urological syndrome that is both diagnostically and therapeutically problematic.
The success rates of conservative and operative treatment options are low at 55-73% and 10-40% respectively.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as an operative alternative in refractory testalgia therapy.
12 patients were surgically treated by spermatic cord neurolysis after adequate environmental diagnostics:
The M. cremastericus is severed by means of bipolar diathermy, the Adventitia of the A. testicularis is detached under microsurgical conditions over a distance of 2-3 cm.
With an average follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) are symptom-free.
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic cord neurolysis should be included in therapeutic considerations in patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our operative procedure can only be maintained with an exact indication, so that an accurate environmental diagnosis to exclude a specific genesis of testalgia is an indispensable prerequisite.
n neurosurgery, too, the trend is towards less and less invasive surgical techniques in order to avoid large trepanations, to minimize the preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord and nerves and thus to keep the risk of neurological and psychological disorders as low as possible.
Hospitalization and incapacity for work can thus often be shortened.
The essential "minimal invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
With its preformed cavities, the cerebral chambers and the subarachnoid space, the brain offers good conditions for the use of endoscopes.
The most common indication for a neuroendoscopic procedure is the occlusion hydrocephalus.
But arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors and smaller intraventricular space requirements can also be effectively treated endoscopically via a small borehole.
Through the use of special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, e.g. Kavernome, can be completely removed.
n addition, endoscopes are also used in a number of spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as an adjuvant in microsurgical surgery.
The aim of the work was the measurement of diffusion coefficients (ADC) by means of diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in vertebrate metastases and in MR-morphologically inconspicuous vertebrates.
DW-MRT measures the tissue-specific ADC, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
In cell-rich tumor tissue with numerous intracellular and intercellular membranes (i.e. diffusion barriers), a low ADC is to be expected, in low-cell or necrotic tissue, a high ADC is to be expected.
A 53-year-old man had a melanotic lung tumor that had completely closed the left main bronchus and whose base was located in the bronchus of the left lower lobe.
After laser therapy, a cuff resection of the left lower lobe of the lung was performed.
Based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma.
n the anamnesis there was no indication of an earlier removal of a skin, mucous membrane or eye change.
xams of the skin and eye also did not reveal any indication of a primary tumor located there.
The new formation is therefore to be regarded as a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases are considered confirmed so far.
The patient is tumor-free after the relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
So far there is no experience about twilight vision according to LASIK.
We therefore investigated twilight vision before and after LASIK to correct myopia.
n recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has established itself as a standard method for non-invasive ischemia diagnostics.
Using ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging, identical pharmacological stress protocols, as currently used in echocardiography, can be performed.
HLA-DR antigens of the cornea are lost as part of organ culture storage.
This work investigated whether this is a down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen or a loss of the HLA-DR-positive Langerhans corneal cells (LZ).
DNA cytometry has developed into a routine diagnostic technique that is preferably used in breast carcinoma to assess ploidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
Static cytometry (microcytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry for reasons of less meaningfulness.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodologically sound technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The parameters obtained, in 1. line the S-phase and the proliferation index, in 2. line also the ploidy, represent prognostic and important factors for therapy planning.
xact knowledge of the method and the error possibilities is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistologic techniques for determining proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information must be regarded as unclear at the present time.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric investigations and the improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measured values.
Injection therapy plays an important role in cervical syndromes.
This article deals with the general prerequisites on the one hand and the various practical procedures for injection on the other.
The assumption of the costs of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV by the statutory health insurance is unclear, whereby the question of the assumption of costs by private health insurance companies should not be considered.
The regulations on disease prevention (§ 20 SGB V), medical preventive care (§ 23 SGB V) and on health examinations (§ 25 SGB V) will not be considered as legal bases for the assumption of costs.
is medical treatment within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the standard financing of health insurance, since there are no corresponding recommendations from the federal committees.
t would be desirable if appropriate recommendations were adopted soon in order to eliminate legal uncertainty in this area.
Under certain circumstances, an obligation to assume costs according to the principles of the legal figure of the so-called new examination and treatment methods comes into consideration.
In themselves, however, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP must be specified with regard to indication and application and freed from ambiguities.
f a doctor does not apply PEP to an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a treatment error, since from a scientific point of view there are still too many ambiguities.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplant immunology.
Organ culture storage leads to the loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The previous work investigates the importance of extended corneal storage time for the success of perforating keratoplasty.
ng from our own experiences with 3D echocardiography, attempts have been made to reconstruct 3D ultrasonographic transfontal studies and to examine their information content.
-Uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent side effect in AIDS patients treated systemically with Rifabutin due to a Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report on a 37-year-old patient who, after a total of 105 days of intensive therapy with 72 days of ventilation, developed heterotopic ossifications at 5 major body joints with almost complete stiffening.
of the intensive therapy was a double lung transplantation in severe pulmonary hypertension.
s resection of the ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and the equilateral elbow as well as both hip joints was able to achieve a restoration of mobility.
Heterotopes Ossifications are common and occur especially post-traumatic, after spinal cord injuries, after SHT, in intoxications and in long-term coma.
though the exact pathomechanism is not yet known, a transformation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then cause bone re-formation.
The diagnosis is made with the help of the imaging methods.
prophylactically, a drug treatment by means of non-steroidal antiphlogistics (NSAIDs), radiation or a combination of both methods can be carried out.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE), in whom we first used the argon laser for local therapy.
The patient suffered from long-term skin changes that could not be influenced or only slightly influenced by established treatment strategies.
After the application of the argon laser, a complete and permanent healing took place in the area of the treated lesions.
histological and immunohistological findings suggest that vessel-mediated effects of argon lasers are important for the observed effect in LE-induced discoid lesions.
n the framework of these case descriptions, the effectiveness of argon lasers in the treatment of therapy-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is shown for the first time.
Complications of viral hepatitis are overall the most common indication for liver transplantation.
For the affected patient, it is often the only life-saving option.
The prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analogue Lamivudine is effective, but expensive.
Reinfection with Hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favorable prognosis compared to HBV reinfection.
Effective reinfection prophylaxis for Hepatitis C has not yet been established and requires extensive studies.
n hepatitis C, the prognosis for the transplant is less favorable after reinfection, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable to other benign non-viral indications.
testicular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity based on a case study as well as the existing literature.
The therapy of these tumors consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiation therapy.
An exception are the rhabdomyosarcomas, which also respond well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation in pre-excitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with curative claims.
accessory pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodrome or antidrome reentry tachycardias of different incidence, duration and frequency.
Understanding the tachycardia mechanism and the role of the accessory pathway in tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of the other structures of the excitation conduction system and the detection of further paraspecific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Abnormalities of the tricuspid valve or the coronary sinus and coincidental diseases of the heart should be examined before the intervention by means of echocardiography and, if necessary, at the beginning of the intervention with contrast imaging.
300 patients with various variants of pre-excitation syndromes have their own catheter ablation outcomes dargestelite.
In order to achieve a qualitatively better recording of the occurrence of complications in orthopedics and to have comparable statistics over the years, it is necessary to standardize the nomenclature and classification of complications diagnoses.
The Heidelberg Orthopaedic University Hospital Foundation has maintained since January 1, 1997 a complete registered register of all early complications of all inpatients.
The complications are recorded according to a standardized nomenclature by the medical profession prospectively in a complication program and the information is checked, corrected and supplemented as well as classified by the quality management department of the clinic.
The guide is intended to contribute to the discussion of a standard in the recording and evaluation of complications in orthopedics with the aim of building consensus.
The acrobulous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the occurrence of blisters in the area of the acres in the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, it is likely to be based on an impairment of the dermoepidermal coherence that necessarily occurs during the course of treatment, which becomes clinically manifested by mechanical stress in the form of bulging blisters.
The acrobulous photodermatosis is to differentiate differentially diagnostically from phototoxic reactions that occur as a result of too high UVA radiation or too high psoralen concentrations.
On the basis of two cases, the clinic, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this syndrome are presented.
n addition to autopsy-confirmed findings of a fibrolipomatous right ventricular myocardial replacement, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia-cardiomyopathy (ARVD).
n 1994, criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD were developed by members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological peculiarities, which have been divided into main and secondary criteria.
n the basis of the subsequent examination of a collective of 24 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of an ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, the validity of the criteria developed should be checked.
Global or segmental dilatations of the right ventricle in the sense of the main criteria could be detected in 20 patients (83%) by means of angiography, or echocardiography.
4 patients (16%) had only secondary criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental right ventricular kinetic disorders.
n all patients, the typical fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium could be histologically discovered.
-Inversions in right-precordial derivatives as secondary criteria were present in 17 patients (71%).
A localized QRS broadening of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 could be found in 8 patients (33%), an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) as the main criteria.
A late potential analysis by means of signal averaging-EKG lagged only in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in the sense of secondary criteria.
Left femoral block-like ventricular tachycardias, which were classified as secondary criteria, could be detected in 23 patients (96%);
only one patient died without proven arrhythmias from progressive right heart failure.
A history of an unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as a secondary criterion could be collected in 3 out of 19 patients (15%).
The task force criteria developed for the diagnosis of ARVD led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, although the importance of a reliable histological diagnosis was of particular value.
Without adding histological data, the clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains whether a purely clinical diagnosis is more likely to be possible through a more favorable division of findings into main and secondary criteria.
unequivocal data show that severe hypoglycemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
n contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycemia in cerebral ischaemia is controversially assessed.
The contradictory results of the clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained when different types of stroke are considered separately and the time course of blood sugar levels during acute events is taken into account.
Hyperglycemia appears to increase neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia if there is insufficient collateral supply.
Furthermore, the risk of a hemorrhagic transformation during this period is increased.
n contrast, an acute hyperglycemia by improving the substrate supply can protect nerve tissue from structural damage if there is only a moderate drop in cerebral blood flow.
This situation is in the area of the Penumbra and with a good collateral supply.
We therefore hypothesize that both the negative and the positive effects of acute hyperglycemia depend on local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgical diagnostics, according to which a resective epilepsy surgical procedure was performed in 50 out of 173 patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy.
localization agreement of findings from non-invasive EEG-Video-Monitoring, Magnetic Resonance Tomography (MRI), Interictal Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Ictal SPECT (Single-Photon Emission Computer Tomography) formed the basis of the focus localization.
8% (n=39) of all 50 patients became seizure-free or only very rarely had seizures.
mpratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations if circumscribed MRI lesions were present and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with drug-resistant focal, in particular temporal epilepsies, non-invasive EEG derivations are sufficient in pre-surgical diagnostics and thus the risk of invasive EEG examinations can be avoided.
and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented to a foreign clinic with a new onset of absolute tachyarrhythmia.
Echocardiographically, the suspicion of an intracardiac space requirement was first expressed, which should be further clarified by means of transesophageal echocardiography.
g found an absolute tachyarrhythmia with frequencies up to 146/min, intermittently a sinus rhythm was also documented.
In the X-ray examination of the thorax, this could also be confirmed as a large spatial requirement in projection onto the posterior mediastinum, the right mediastinal margin protruding laterally.
growth of the cyst with the triggering of atrial arrhythmias and the safe exclusion of malignant degeneration, the cyst was surgically removed by means of anterolateral thoracotomy.
t the patient has been in sinus rhythm since then and only complains about isolated "dropouts" most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
mally harmless atrial arrhythmias can also be due to rare causes such as thoracic, extra- or intracardiac spatial demands that require specific therapy.
An overview of the formation of intrathoracic cysts is given.
cute cerebral nerve palsy can have a variety of causes.
A rare trigger for a paresis of one or more brain nerves is a dissection of the internal A. carotis.
early detection of a carotid dissection even in atypical symptoms is important, since anticoagulant therapy started in time can prevent a stroke as a result of a dissection-related embolism.
We report 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous brain nerves (Raeder syndrome) as well as of the caudal brain nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) as a result of a dissection of the internal A. carotis.
n addition to the cranial and caudal brain nerves involved in our cases, failures of the median brain nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so that any painful sudden brain nerve failure must also be reminiscent of a carotid dissection.
mistake of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remains asymptomatic into old age, but can also become clinically manifest in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnostics and surgical therapy in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child, as well as the need for surgical correction.
The suspected diagnosis arose by chance within the framework of echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis by coronary angiography.
The operation consisted of transplantation of the coronary artery defect without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was uncomplicated.
ndication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases, because of coronary steal phenomena and associated coronary risks.
The operative treatment of tibial head fractures with joint involvement (AO-Classification 41 A1, B1-3 and C1-3) places high demands on traumatological management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the care of fractures near the joint offers, among other things, the possibility of achieving a good functional result through a minor, surgically caused soft tissue trauma.
, also in comparison with the standard methods, the aim is to achieve at least a practice stability.
, in addition to the low operative soft tissue trauma, the exact intraoperative assessment of the joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intra-articular concomitant injuries are of particular advantage compared to conventional methods due to arthroscopy.
Out of a total of 54 patients with tibial head fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis could be performed in our clinic in the period from September 1993 to January 1998 in 34 patients.
The follow-up examination of a total of 17 patients showed overall good results according to the Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
n a selected patient, we consider the arthroscopically supported minimally invasive osteosynthesis also suitable for fractures of AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report on a 72-year-old patient who developed bilateral hypoglossusparesis without other neurological deficits after a moderate craniocerebral trauma, which clinically completely regressed within 3 months.
Since no skull base fracture in the area of the posterior cranial fossa could be detected by computer tomography, we discuss a bilateral strain of the N. hypoglossus as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a pathological situation in which the blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins to a sufficient extent under the conditions of daily life.
The backwater propagates from the large vascular veins through the smallest veins to the area of the microcirculation and finally affects the metabolism of the tissues.
Typical clinical features are the best basis for classification principles, which can be confirmed secondarily with a simple objective measurement method.
Stewart-Bluefarb Syndrome is defined as an angiodermatitis that develops on the floor of arteriovenous short circuits.
n the area of the lower extremities, mostly unilateral skin changes occur, reminiscent of a Kaposi sarcoma (Pseudo-Kaposi sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain and rarely a hypertrophy of the limb in question.
The clinical picture has often progressed rapidly and leads to ulcerating nodules with a tendency to bleeding and infection.
The causal therapy consists in the elimination of the arteriovenous shunts.
Due to the large number and often small calibers of the arteriovenous fistulae, an operative procedure can rarely be performed.
Superselective embolization is better suited, albeit with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
t is reported on the successful embolization treatment, performed a total of 8 times so far, in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome.
, the exact diagnosis of the very rare primary histiocytoses of the skin in addition to the clinic and histology at the H&E section was based on electron microscopy (Birbeck granula) and immunohistology at the freeze section (CD1a).
s in the development and analysis of paraffin-permeable markers now also allow a (also retrospective) work-up and precise division of these diseases on formalin-fixed material.
Using antibodies against the S-100 protein and by means of the lectins peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the classic cells of the Langerhanscell histiocytosis (LZH) can be differentiated from other histiocytic cell systems.
In the case of the so-called non-Langerhanszell-Histiocytoses (non-LZH) there have so far been no uniform electron-optical and immunohistologic characteristics.
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are of great importance for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells).
The frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and their reactions with the corresponding paraffin-permeable immunohistologic markers can be very different within the different clinical entities.
Diagnostic significance with regard to the demarcation from the Langerhanszell-Histiocytoses seem to have antibodies against Factor XIIIa (shown in the example of Xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (shown in the juvenile Xanthogranuloma).
Both markers show a positive reaction pattern with the epitheloid cells typical for the disease process.
We present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of administration of allopurinol and after re-exposure to this drug.
ous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old patient who had been suffering from chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner's ulcer for 10 years.
So far, 7 case reports of non-bilharzia-associated verrucous carcinomas of the urinary bladder have been published in the world literature.
though the development of a vesicular carcinoma of the urinary bladder as a complication of an IC has not been described so far, the pathomechanism of the development of the vesicular carcinoma seems to lie in the chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
fter the conservative therapy options were exhausted, the radical cystectomy and supravesical urinary drainage were carried out.
"NoToX Histological Fixative" is offered as a substitute for formalin/formaldehyde for the fixation of tissue samples for histological investigations.
ntraoperative tissue and autopsy-derived organ samples were used to test NoToX.
Conventional histological colorations and accepted immunohistologic colorations, in particular for tumor diagnostics, were used.
As a result of these investigations carried out independently at 3 different facilities, it was found that tissue samples fixed with NoToX show no differences with respect to the reproducibility of conventional colorations or the visualization of immunohistochemical reactions compared to tissue samples fixed with formalin.
NoToX has proven itself as a usable substitute for formalin.
To describe the radiation exposure of the patient in computed tomography, dose sizes such as the computed tomography dose index (CTDI), the "multiple scan average dose" (MSAD) and the axial dose freely in air are usually used.
The CTDI and the MSAD derivable from it are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but say little about the doses relevant from the point of view of the doctor and the patient according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs and about the risks.
The axial dose alone is not a good measure of the effective dose, which allows an estimate of risk.
ndication of an upper guideline value for the axial dose should take into account the dose requirement of the examination region in order to ensure acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other.
As physical quantities, all 3 quantities can be used for the characterization and differentiation of different examination programs and devices with regard to radiation exposure.
According to a report by the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathy, the definition of inflammatory heart muscle diseases was expanded in 1995.
diopathic, autoimmune and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been newly included in this definition.
s, a number of infectious pathogens, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses as well as herpesviruses, appear to be involved as important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory heart muscle disease and ventricular dilatation.
It seems sensible to assign a separate place to shame as a general human emotion in demarcation from guilt.
n addition to the defensive character, the "self"-maintaining function of shame should also be taken into account.
The appearance of shame always indicates the protection of feelings of worth, even if it should not currently be recognizable in the patient.
the signalling character of shame is discussed and the question of whether shame symptoms have a disease value is considered.
ng attention to psychogenesis and unconscious shame dynamics broadens the view of potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This overview work provides a literary overview of the very heterogeneous treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, both in terms of crisis understanding and therapy methods as well as in terms of professional responsibility.
In detail, general treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disorder- and event-specific concepts and work for crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents from the last 10 years are described.
n addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, as far as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
n recent years, the definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammatory response as well as the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune systems in their pathogenesis has been the subject of research.
teriosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show increased inflammatory cells and a lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
ter programmar Zelltod (Apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronary atherectomy samples from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined immunohistochemically (TUNEL test for the detection of fragmented DNA) as well as by electron microscopy.
The objectives of this study were the evaluation of possible group differences in the cellular composition of plaques, the detection and quantification of cell death events and the demarcation of apoptosis and necrosis.
n an in vivo study and on - according to the techniques developed by Thiel 1992 - specially fixed corpses, it was investigated in what positional relationship to the balloon the fascia transversalis is located and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated.
n the TEP, the fascia can at best be used laterally of the artery as a reinforcement of the rear wall of the groin canal or as an abutment for fixing the foreign material (net).
We present 2 patients aged 50 and 84 years who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczema skin changes.
detection of numerous mites in the scale crusts led to the diagnosis of a Norwegian scabies;
an underlying disease could be ruled out in both cases.
t is presumed that the therapy of eczema lasting for months in the sense of an immunosuppression has led to the exacerbation of the clinical picture.
hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The effectiveness of hemoglobin solutions with respect to O2 transport and in particular the effective O2 delivery to the tissue is demonstrated in a variety of situations such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.
The hemoglobin molecule can be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.
This results in a clinically useful intravascular half-life of approximately 8-24 h, adequate O2 affinity and a lack of nephrotoxicity.
As a remaining side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated today, a certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned.
Nevertheless, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This was demonstrated under extreme Hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation and also under Reanimation.
, the most important representative from the group of fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been successfully used in humans and is well tolerated.
ntrofusion medicine and also the acute care of the injured will be significantly changed by the introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice.
An introduction can be expected in the next few years.
It is strictly based on clear physical laws and defined physiological laws.
n accordance with international recommendations, there are a number of generally recognized indications for HBO therapy, in which it is either the only causal, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often decisive, therapeutic component of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive therapy.
mong the potential side effects, in addition to barotrauma of the lungs, above all the possibility of a central-nervous oxygen intoxication should be taken into particular account.
The clinical use of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a targeted and critical indication as well as the skills and abilities to safely manage complications with intensive or emergency medical measures.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive therapeutic character should therefore be able to be an additional, extremely interesting field of action for the anesthesiologist.
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues with a view to oncological therapy.
In this work, the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound, because of its good depth focusability, could be used as an additional therapeutic technique in acoustically accessible tumors.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasound parameters.
New results show that nuclear spin tomography is suitable for "online" monitoring of ultrasound-induced high-temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive nuclear spin tomographic temperature measurement can become an important instrument for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumors be reviewed in carefully planned clinical trials.
n a group of extremely small premature babies, the long-term effects of premature birth on the ophthalmic and ENT medical status should be demonstrated.
An EDP system for surgical and ambulance documentation as well as for supporting the general clinic organization has been used at the orthopedic university clinic in Homburg/Saar since 1993.
Hardware is a Novell network with DOS or Windows-based PC's as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnoses and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its introduction, the data of 31,500 patients have been recorded in the system and 8,500 operations have been documented.
With the appropriate flexibility of the software, both the requirements of the medical field and those of the administration can be taken into account.
n addition, through a further, clinic-wide networking, there is the possibility at the University Hospital Homburg for cross-departmental data exchange and for the use of scientific networks as well as the Internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centers on the usual pre- and post-operative drug treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The aim of the study was to examine whether Dorzolamide influences accommodation or the pupillary response.
also refers to non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of the (mostly innocent) accident victims with the current compensation practice.
n this study in sheep, it should be clarified whether the intraarticular concentration of free sulfated and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycans shows a correlation with the extent of experimentally induced arthrotic damage, whether a temporal association is obtained and whether the results can be used as a guide for the use of GAG as a prognostic criterion or arthrosis marker.
21 sheep are randomized into 3 groups of 7 animals divided into:
s are the knee joints of the contralateral side and the knee joints of animals from other approved projects (n = 54).
The radiological score values between the groups TD vs. ME and MV are statistically significant (p < 0.01) different.
Compared to the control group, HA in the ME and MV groups shows a significantly increased value.
In the case of CS, a significantly increased level (p < 0.01) results both for the measurement 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial incision.
Clinical consequences:
The HA-Spiegel allows - at least experimentally - possible, to a certain extent, a description of the degree of osteoarthritis.
The concentration increases with greater postoperative interval and increasing degree of damage.
idiopathic Long-QT syndrome can present itself in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope and seizures.
-Blocker therapy is considered standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
pathy failure, a pacemaker implantation or an operative sympathetic blockade are considered as options.
We report on the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12 year old patient.
s and uses of an epidiascope are described, which after minor modifications is suitable for the presentation of organ or organ discs in the courses of general and special pathology and saves expensive video installations with additional lighting etc.
Narcissistic problems are common in old age and of far-reaching importance.
These problems are related here to the instance of the I-ideal and examined from the point of view of the increasing discrepancy between the I and the I-ideal in old age.
three aspects are shown pathological exacerbations of the aging process, as often present in older patients.
narcissistic forms of transmission in these patients are then described and possibilities and goals in the treatment of older patients are discussed.
The treatment results of the muscle energy technique according to Mitchel for spinal problems are presented.
morbidities of joint mobility in the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed with the Muscle Energy Technique.
The therapy has been highly successful.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
is an alternative to chirotherapeutic techniques with impulse.
We report on a 26-year-old patient with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, known since the age of 10, who complains of arthritic knee joint complaints, recurrent diarrhea and sicca symptoms.
Clinical picture, serological findings and the histologies of duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy result in a diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjögren's syndrome.
According to our findings, a common occurrence of these different clinical pictures has not yet been described.
nduction of a gluten-free diet leads to a rapid improvement of the clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be considered as the actual disorder in the structure of the individual immunological syndromes.
n industrialized countries, it is medical conditions rather than food shortages that contribute to the development of malnutrition.
malnutrition is particularly common in the older population and occurs in 5-12% of those living independently, in 30-61% of those hospitalized and in 40-85% of older people in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
heightened awareness of the doctor for nutritional problems and a prompt risk assessment are essential prerequisites to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important for the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
n microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junctions-/Compoundnävi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 structural features.
radial digitiform Foothills, reticular blue-grey Patterns, opaque alabaster-gypsum-like Lakunen, brown/black dots against a blue/grey background, pseudopodian-like marginal zones and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
nevertheless, specific incident-light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
diagnostic assessment of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumor is therefore based on several individual features that occur in combination and are suspected of malignancy.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy procedures in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Frequently related vector transport systems and strategies for integrating therapeutic genes into the respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, the gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists provides new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
The first clinical applicability studies in which such a gene (IRAP) has been transferred are an important step forward on the path to clinical gene therapy for osteoarthritis.
n recent years, distraction osteogenesis has developed into an established treatment method for the correction of hypoplastic lower jaw.
We report on our experience with uni- and bi-directional distractors in both intra- and extraoral administration in 4 selected patients with lower jaw hypoplasia as part of syndromic clinical picture.
These were 1 boy with Pierre-Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral hypojaw hypoplasia in Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with rodent syndrome and 1 rare case of a centerline defect in 18p syndrome.
The distraction duration ranged from 6-30 days, with a bone gain of 6-28 mm being achieved.
Older people interested in further education are increasingly recognizing the many possibilities that the Internet offers them in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Further training institutions and institutions of old people's education are required to facilitate older people's access to the world of digital media through target group-specific offers, to support them in acquiring media competence and to design interesting virtual learning offers for them.
on the basis of experiences from the information campaign "Senior-Info-Mobil" possibilities are described for people over 50 to gain access to the new communication technologies.
The example of the European network "Learning in Later Life" (LiLL) and other projects will further show how spatially and temporally decoupled 'research learning' of older adults in the sense of virtual working groups and networks could become the engine of a "new learning culture", which also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or further education institution or who for health and other personal reasons cannot participate in on-site offers.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
n the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by non-invasive MR angiography.
The rapid technical further development of MR tomography has additionally opened up the possibility of new functional examination procedures in recent years.
MR tomography of the heart is characterized by the combination of the simultaneous acquisition of morphological and functional parameters by a non-invasive method without radiation exposure.
Due to the high spatial resolution and reproducibility, Cine-MRT is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the further development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to clarify many heart diseases in one examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only method that offers an insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification round off the overall concept of MR cardiac diagnostics.
MR tomography offers as the only diagnostic method the complete clarification of heart diseases in an examination course both as an initial examination and for course control.
Due to the rapidly progressing development, existing limitations v. a. in the field of MR coronary angiography will be solved in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development of documentation and EDP at the Orthopedic University Hospital Heidelberg is given.
Since its foundation in 1967, 4 development phases can be distinguished:
first medical initiatives, establishment of a basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, realization of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus control of performance events.
Planning and implementation were carried out in compliance with the framework plans and concepts of the University Hospital of the State of Baden-Württemberg.
We report on the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of an extracorporeal cardiac massage.
This is the first published case.
We report bacterial arteritis following PTA and stent implantation into an iliac artery with consequent septic embolization, ipsilateral knee joint embolism and formation of an infected aneurysm spurium.
Contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus must be assumed as the cause.
The treatment consisted of resection of the inflamed vessel section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem Six-year-old boy with unilateral split foot type II with Oligodaktylia and Clinodaktylia of the second toe.
This overview article deals with the current status of the controversy surrounding the indication for the replacement of the back of the Patella.
The current state of knowledge in the experimental and biomechanical field is described as well as the design features of the different implant types and the special features of the patella preparation.
In addition, the author deals with the main clinical studies on the subject of patellar back replacement and tries to give the reader criteria for classifying the study results.
why the indication for the back surface replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for the replacement of the patella back surface could be formulated is discussed.
The biomechanical causes of the migration and relaxation behavior of hip joint endoprostheses are still unclear.
n particular, a chronic mechanical overload of the boundary layers due to changed stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be ruled out.
Arterial hypertension is frequently observed after organ transplants in adults as a result of treatment with the hypertensive drugs Cyclosporin A, Tacrolimus (FK 506) or Prednisolone.
So far, there are hardly any studies on the behavior of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" characterizes the absence of visible fracture marks in the conventional radiography performed for the initial diagnosis in the presence of a fracture.
The diagnosis is made only in the course or by means of further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (computer tomography) examinations carried out for this purpose have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a method that allows both the early diagnosis of "occult fractures" and the diagnosis of any concomitant chondral and ligament injuries.
n the present study we report on 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomical regions, in whom the diagnosis could be made with MRI in the case of a negative X-ray finding.
The athero-arterial embolism is a phenomenon already described early on.
The histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small end-stream arteries shaped the concept of cholesterol embolism.
Because of the very variable clinical picture and the only invasive or post-mortem diagnosis to be secured, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe aortic atherosclerosis.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was more than 10% per patient year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolisms.
n addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of the proximal aorta is the cause of embolic complications in surgical interventions or catheterizations of the aorta.
n anticoagulants have been shown to be effective in patients with a particular variant of atherosclerosis in the aorta with stylized and mobile thrombi emanating from circumscribed plaques.
necrosis could be prevented and a regression of the thrombi could be observed.
There is a report about a 62-year-old patient with a pronounced valgus malposition and stretch inhibition of the right knee joint as a result of a supracondylar thigh fragment fracture, which had been treated osteosynthetically by means of a dynamic condyle screw 2 years ago.
Here the indication was made for a varying and extending corrective osteotomy and osteosynthesis by means of retrograde femur nail.
Within the 1st postoperative week, the patient was able to fully load the right lower extremity with axle compensation.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable method to achieve good and stress-stable osteosynthesis even during correction operations.
tear duct operations at the University Eye Clinic Münster of 296 children from the years 1987 - 1992 were examined.
The histological diagnosis of prostate carcinoma is based on a combination of histoarchitectonic and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions (eosinophilic secretions, crystalloid, luminal, basophilic mucus formation) are always suspicious, but even not proving a carcinoma.
Cytological criteria (core size, hyperchromasia, nucleoles, cytoplasmic changes) must always be evaluated in comparison with pre-existing benign glands.
The immunohistochemical finding with basal cell-specific cytokeratins must in any case be critically evaluated and can at best confirm a cancer diagnosis or (if basal cells are positively detected) safely exclude it.
In the present overview work, the various diagnostic criteria are compiled and their value for routine diagnostics is evaluated.
n another German study, a maintenance therapy of 14 active 20mg TNFR55-IgG1 i.v. was compared with a monthly dose of 50mg.
The 60 patients in this study had previously received an initial dose of 100mg.
n all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed a rapid and deductive improvement in all measured parameters as early as one day after the first dose.
despite the further administration of the test substance, there was subsequently an increase in the inflammation parameters.
n parallel, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies could be detected, which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
A 13-month-old patient is reported to have developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal hemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested the suspicion of a vascular process.
The healthy newborn is also entitled to optimal care so that any disturbance of postnatal adaptation is recognized in good time.
The introduction of painless simple yet reliable methods such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has greatly simplified the situation for all responsible persons.
Background and questions.
n view of increasing reports of resistance increases in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in gonococcal strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aquajogging is a technique that has been used for years in sports and rehabilitation, in which in deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid (vest or belt), jogging - similar movements are carried out.
In sport, aquajogging is used as regeneration training and as "low-impact-alternative training" in strength endurance and endurance.
n rehabilitation, aquajogging is excellent for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and post-operative phase for diseases of the musculoskeletal system, as well as endurance and light strength training for internal diseases.
Operative therapy options for erectile dysfunction are vascular surgical or prosthetic in nature.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery has its place as the only causal therapy in a selected patient group.
The most important criteria are age under 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
Against initial short-term successes, the long-term results had to be corrected from over 80% to approx. 53-55%.
venous surgery has lost its importance due to a drastic loss of long-term success (average less than 40%).
nile prosthetic surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term implant survival rates and 89% patient satisfaction.
nevertheless, the irreversibility of the interventions often forces this therapy option to the last place of the therapeutic cascade.
-depending on the device type, complications can occur such as cylinder defects and perforations with 5-year survival rates of the implants between 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by a perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbus transplants, which, however, have a highly immunogenic effect.
We report on our now 3-year experience with the method of homologous central limbokeratoplasty developed by us.
n polysulfate is used relatively frequently for bladder instillation and significantly lowers the frequency of urination, while the frequency of urination during the day remained unchanged in a controlled study.
also lowered the frequency of nycturia in an open-label prospective study.
Both Heparin and Pentosan polysulfate are practically free of side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, this also applies to applications in radiology.
Thousands of websites with radiological information have emerged and are now available online, with competition with commercial offerings.
According to the first experiences, the task today is to critically assess the possibilities and risks of using the Internet as a distribution medium for radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndrome are among the normal reactions of parents after a sudden infant death ("sudden infant death", SID).
We report below from a psychiatric and forensic point of view about 2 cases in which the mothers after SID reacted with exceptionally severe depression and accused themselves of having killed their child.
Finally, some recommendations for the care of affected parents are communicated.
Review of the cases of 110 children admitted within a period of 7 years with Burkitt lymphoma at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, showed an overweight of male versus female patients (1.9:
1) and an age peak of 5 years.
The areas first affected by the tumor were, in order of frequency, the face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen and lungs were less affected.
t is assumed that an interrelationship between infections by malaria and Epstein-Barr viruses as well as malnutrition could play a role in the aetiology of the tumor.
The most important drug is Cyclophosphamide.
tion of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in initiating disease regression, but is better than the single active ingredient in preventing systemic regression.
nquiries of the patients revealed a good survival rate.
nce its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anaesthesia, the Zwickau Clinic has formed a well-known surgical center.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer have preserved, continued and supplemented Braun's life's work.
Zwickau Surgery provided important impulses for general and local anesthesia, for hospital construction and clinic organization, as well as for surgical teaching in words and images.
After a brief overview of the literature, the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania that have so far been little described in an adolescent patient are to be presented.
n the background of earlier abandonment fears, within the framework of the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness, there is a renewed threat of being dropped.
The symptom, which previously served to regulate diffuse internal tensions and fears, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unresolved erythematosquamous skin disease with a prevalence of about 2.5%.
The often difficult-to-treat skin changes occasionally respond well to the topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance which, however, as an undesirable effect, depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity, can trigger pustulous dermatitis.
We report the occurrence of pustulous dermatitis following the use of a falsely 50-fold overconcentrated dithranol preparation of the masterful formulation in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renewal hypertension is of particular importance, since as a secondary form of hypertension, it can be successfully treated and sometimes cured in many cases by interventional-radiological or gef‰fl surgical procedures.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications after LASIK should be investigated.
t is reported about an andrological patient in whom the initial examination led to the detection of a high-grade oligoasthenotratozoospermia and a ureaplasmic infection.
The increased FSH value and the testicular size significantly below the standard range spoke for a pronounced testicular parenchyma damage.
Detection of macrophages in the ejaculate smear can be understood as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
antibiotic pair therapy with doxycycline and subsequent 3 months recovery phase under a combination treatment with vitamins C and E as well as the trace element zinc resulted in a significant spermogram improvement.
After a further 2 months, a pregnancy with the subsequent birth of a healthy daughter could be achieved by intrauterine insemination.
t this time, only a mild teratozoospermia was found in the patient.
m part of a quality control, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of operative procedures and two different, established standard anesthesia procedures.
Changes of the retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of a central serous chorioretinopathy in systemic therapy with corticosteroids are to be described.
The X-ray of the pelvic overview still has its indication today in the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in infancy in addition to sonography.
The legs of the toddlers should be held in the middle position.
lateral rotations and increased inclination of the pelvis should be avoided.
look back at 150 years, including 50 years of personally experienced development of septorhinoplasty, which most recently took a retrograde development into the 19th century in the "open approach" with opening the tip of the nose.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
sublabial access to septorhinoplasty in the sense of minimally traumatizing surgery is recommended.
In the imaging diagnosis of thoracic pathologies in mature and in particular immature newborns, the thorax x-ray is the first priority.
deep knowledge of normal thoracic images and possible physiological peripartal changes is a prerequisite for the interpretation of the neonatologic thoracic image.
Pathologien Kindliche:
A variety of congenital and acquired changes that the radiologist is confronted with in neonatology are unknown in the radiodiagnostics of adult patients.
Many of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or can affect the quality of life in their later life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the pediatrician is therefore essential.
Here is an overview of the most important pathologies that the radiologist may be confronted with in the daily routine.
The primary tumors were mammary carcinoma (n = 34), leiomyosarcoma (n = 20), pancreatic carcinoma (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinoma (n = 13), melanoma (n = 9), gastric carcinoma (n = 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinoma (n = 6) and 14 other tumors.
hepatic tumour attacks (including synchronous primary tumours) were present in 69 out of 140 (49%) cases, of the 120 first resections an extrahepatic tumour was present in 51% (n = 61).
Of the 120 first resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0-, 13 (11%) as R1- and 25 (21%) as R2-Resections.
The median survival lag after first resection totaled 20 months, after R0 resections at 28 months and after R1/2 resections at 8 months.
resection (n = 14) resulted in a median survival of 28 months for all patients and of 41 months after R0 resection.
n patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of first liver resection, the median survival after R0 resection was 32 months (5-year prognosis 25%) and after R1/2 resection was 7 months.
The present results show that the resection of non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases also promises a prognostic gain.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrences can even benefit from second or third liver resections.
In some cases, impressive long-term courses could be observed even in the rather unfavorable initial situation.
Therefore, the indication for operative therapy should be checked in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself was at a loss as to the impersonal act, for which he had no explanation.
months later he suffers a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a major aneurysm of the anterior A. communicans during his detention.
n assessing the criminal responsibility, this course in connection with the behavioral abnormalities witnessed shortly before the crime therefore allows the possibility of a pathological mental disorder at the time of the crime to be taken into account.
it could have been an epileptic twilight state as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also proven itself, among other things, for the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) dislocated into the vitreous body.
owing to the high specific gravity of PFCL, the IOL is washed up and can be reattached to the anterior segment of the eye, where it can be reattached, for example, in the ciliary sulcus.
What kind of contact PFCL makes with the IOL is unclear.
Since a biotoxicity of PFCL is likely with prolonged intraocular stay, it is removed as completely as possible at the OP end.
The rare case of a solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of a chondrosarcoma is reported.
The metastasis occurred after a seven-year non-appearing postoperative interval.
n the scope of further investigations, no clinically-apparatus detectable metastases were found.
Taking into account the cases described so far, the prognosis is nevertheless very poor.
nomalities in the development of the pancreas are due to the embryonic development of the organ and are caused by a malfusion (pancreas divisum) or a malrotation (annular pancreas) of the two systems.
The pancreas divisum and the pancreas annulus can ultimately only be secured by a representation of the ganglion of the pancreas.
n congenital diseases there are genetic defects, in which other organ systems are usually affected and in which the extrapancreatic damage is usually in the foreground of the clinical pictures.
Both the developmental anomalies of the pancreas and the congenital diseases lead to a wide variety of morphological changes in the organ, which can be detected with modern imaging methods.
Books often contain not only the material written by the author.
der Tafelwerke von Bärensprung und Hebra it is explained that at second glance they also reveal some other medical-historically relevant facts.
5% of all patients with congenital herniated disc/defect are asymptomatic at the time of birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report on unusual findings in late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary funnel breast and a lethal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The validity of sonography in bacterial coxitis was checked.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial Coxitis (n = 14), Coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes disease (n = 92) and Epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) were sonographically investigated.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, the hip surface and the periarticular structures can be assessed in the standard sectional planes of DEGUM.
ntra-articular spatial demand (Synovialitis, Effusion) can be recorded sonographically as joint capsule distension.
This capsule withdrawal was sonographically detected in bacterial Coxitis, Coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid Coxitis and in the early stage of Perthes' disease.
Since the joint capsule distension does not show any significant differences in the individual diseases, a differentiation of these diseases is not possible due to the sonogram in the presence of a capsule distension without osseous changes.
A bacterial Coxitis can thus not be sonographically reliably distinguished from Coxitides of other Genesis;
capsule distension is considered an unspecific sonographic sign.
f a clinical suspicion of bacterial coxitis, an immediate diagnostic puncture, possibly under sonographic control, is necessary.
due to additional osseous changes in addition to capsule distension, epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes disease in the condensation and fragmentation stage can be sonographically distinguished from both bacterial coxitis and coxitides of other genesis.
The diagnosis of rare cerebral gliomatosis can only be made in conjunction with clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Since in both cases unusually highly dedifferentiated tumor cells were present for cerebral gliomatosis, the diagnosis was made more difficult by atypical findings such as contrast medium uptake on MRI and clinical signs of intracranial pressure increase.
Clinical course, Differential diagnoses and Literature are briefly presented.
various trial designs such as cohort study, case-control study and randomized clinical trial are presented, explained, and problems are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized studies are discussed in detail and presented as the only way to arrive at conclusions about causal relationships in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements for clinical research cannot be met by the use of complex statistical methods, but that in this sense good clinical research depends first and foremost on careful study planning.
A possible influence on anticoagulant therapy by tricyclic antidepressants has so far been evaluated differently.
Above all, the anticoagulant Phenprocoumon, used therapeutically in Germany, remains almost unconsidered in studies.
The present retrospective study was conducted under the question of a potential drug interaction between Phenprocoumon and Tricyclica.
From April 1, 1996 to June 30, 1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with arteriosclerotic-related, symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenosis were treated with transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
Simultaneously, in one case, a thrombus arterectomy of the external A. iliaca was performed with profound plastic surgery, in another case, an angioplasty with stent implantation of the A. iliaca communis was performed.
The technical and clinical success was given in all cases.
n an observation period of median 23 (7-33) months there was no closure or clinical restenosis.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation in segmental abdominal aortic stenosis represents a slightly invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
It is reported about a patient who underwent perennial sterility treatment and became pregnant, although she did not actually want a child.
The various species of Aspergillus occur as ubiquitous pathogens.
Aspergillus flavus has in the past been classified as rather apathogenic to humans.
describes the case of a 72-year-old patient in whom Aspergillus flavus was culturally detected in the tracheal secretion after an aortocoronary bypass operation in the intensive care unit.
The serological test methods carried out, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and (Author:
s "monoclonal-antibody" correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) Latex particles covered with monoclonal-antibodies, were negative several times.
A postmortem Aspergillus test using a newer method, antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
In clinical and radiological findings there was no indication of a systemic infection.
The patient died before the use of antimycotic therapy, the autopsy showed a disseminated mycosis of both lungs by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of a more sensitive antigen detection by means of enzyme immunoassay can facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
correct assessment of the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus should initiate intravenous antimycotic therapy with amphotericin B even in the case of a single cultural detection of Aspergillus flavus in the trachea.
epidemiological data show a decline in incidences of appendicitis and appendectomy in developed countries.
age is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforation is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without the histological evidence of acute inflammation - especially in young women - as well as the high perforation rate in young children and the elderly shows the low diagnostic safety.
Analysis of the epidemiological data does not allow a clear conclusion to be drawn on the etiopathogenesis of acute appendicitis.
fter refractive corneal procedures and after cataract operations, ocular image errors (aberrations) can occur that cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why the maximum retinal-conditioned vision is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
ng these aberrations under clinical conditions would be an important first step in documenting and correcting these aberrations using modern photorefractive methods.
xperimentally, only static unidirectional tensile load tests had been carried out for both methods.
and Hofmann came to the conclusion that a comparable stability can be achieved with flexible fixations compared to rigid methods and that this should be preferred because of the maintenance of mobility in the symphysis for the prophylaxis of its ankylosis.
-multidirectional dynamic experimental investigation under Gang simulation conditions was used to comparatively test symphysis stabilizations using DC-plates, reconstruction plates, wire harnesses and PDS-Bandings.
The symphysis preparations were loaded synchronously in the Sagittal and Vertical directions with a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55 500 load changes (steps during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither the wire tension belting nor the PDS-banding were sufficiently stable, whereby these methods already allowed a symphysis mobility extending beyond the physiological limits immediately after the start of the experiment.
n the further course of the experiment, the instability was intensified by incision of the circlages and bandings in the bones or fracture of the wire circlages generally to the point of complete failure.
n the DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, on the other hand, the stabilization success was dependent on the primary stability of the screw anchoring.
n the primary tendency of the screws to overturn, the plate stabilization under dynamic loading became increasingly unstable.
With a primarily stable anchoring of the plate screws, the fixation remained stable to the full extent over 55,500 load changes with a load corresponding to an average of half the body weight.
For clinical use, it can be deduced from these results that neither the bridging traction belting with wire straps nor the PDS-banding stabilizes the ruptured symphysis sufficiently for an early postoperative mobilization under partial stress.
If with the DC plate or the reconstruction plate a reliable stabilization of the ruptured symphysis can be achieved primarily by good anchoring of the screws in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person with an "open book injury" can be mobilized with a partial load corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal Intraocular Lenses (MIOL) have been successfully implanted for years.
Due to the division of light into several focal points, a smaller amount of light is available for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or scattered light effects by a capsular fibrosis may lead to visual impairment at an early stage.
In a 69-year-old patient, a 5 cm large, moderately pleomorphic spindle cell thyroid tumor was initially mistaken for primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
n the framework of an anemia clarification carried out 17 months later, a duodenal leiomyosarcoma measuring 7 cm was discovered and resected by means of duodenopancreatectomy.
The re-evaluation of the primary histology led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of the thyroid tumor as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died another 6 months later from an apoplectic insult.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of the tumor disease as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by thyroid metastasis.
The drug therapy of erectile dysfunction includes the oral as well as the local application of pharmaceuticals.
At the present time, the only approved oral substance with proven effectiveness is Yohimbine, a centrally effective alpha receptor blocker.
Other oral medications with a central point of attack are Trazodon and Apomorphin, with Apomorphin working significantly better than Placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both intraurethral (MUSE) and intracavernous applications are available for local application.
As the substance used, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely displaced other pharmaceuticals at this point in time.
There are currently several promising substances with a wide variety of active ingredients and different dosage forms in development as a therapeutic for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They change the patient's state of consciousness, contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, which is particularly important for severely disturbed patients who cannot be adequately reached by words alone.
perinatal, transpersonal and death experiences are within their natural range.
ne of the main long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is a lack of growth hormone.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemotherapy, radiation and hormone therapies led to the establishment of a variety of different strategies combined under the term immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates are generally between 20 and 40%.
In addition, in 30-40% of patients there is a time-limited stabilization of the disease, which in individual cases also lasts for years.
these are predominantly the results of uncontrolled Phase-II studies.
Cures are usually not to be expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%) and high remission rates can only be achieved in selected patient populations.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotherapy patients over non- or chemotherapy patients.
is a survival advantage for patients with objective remissions.
A standard therapy cannot be defined at present.
ven assuming a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of common therapy protocols as well as their high costs must be taken into account.
n view immunotherapy as an essential component in the therapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in currently achievable remission rates, and the survival benefit reported by some authors for immunotherapy patients [15, 16, 26, 30, 31].
The use should usually be within the framework of clinical trials.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, namely 262 men (about half each 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 63.0 +/- 0.9 years old) and 239 women (half each 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 62.8 +/- 0.8 years old), laboratory indices are calculated from the measured values of 12 clinical-chemical parameters and checked for correlations with the biological age according to Ries.
The calculation of the Index includes alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL-cholesterol, creatinine, LDL-cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides.
significant correlations between the laboratory indices and biological age are found only in the group of younger women.
n the same group, several individual parameters also correlate significantly with preaging.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL quotient, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
describes a 2 cm large cystadenofibrom of the epiploic appendix of the distal sigmoid, which was discovered as a random finding in a hysterectomy with adnexectomy for endometrial carcinoma in a 72-year-old patient.
It showed the same histology as analogous ovarian tumors and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the appendages epiploicae and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypias in the peritoneal lavage fluid.
These findings are likely to go back to occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis.
The histogenesis, histology and localizations of the primary peritoneal neoplasms of the Müller type are discussed.
n addition to an optimized position of the patellar tendon transplant, it was initially hoped that this method would have advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction and restoration of proprioception, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique has not yet been demonstrated.
15 endoscopically and 14 openly operated patients were examined, each preoperatively and after 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
The score systems according to Lysholm and Tegner, the ligament stability (KT-1000), the duration of the operation and the proprioception were raised using the angle reproduction tests.
The energy dose of the spiral computed tomography as well as the orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head region with the help of thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube power recommended by the manufacturer of the computer tomograph for a dental CT has been gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured energy dose of computer tomography was 0.30 mGy (thyroid gland) to 29 mGy (skin surface in the beam path) at 187.5 mAs and 1-mm layers (25 mm scan distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw).
n reduction to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (Schyroid gland) to 6.9 mGy (Skin surface) were measured.
length measurements on sawn jaw preparations were compared with corresponding CT measurements at a workstation.
The average measurement inaccuracy was 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of the CT by about 76% had no influence on the length measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the CT scans with a dose reduction of 76% are still on average a factor of 10 above the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The importance of an enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectified through the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in-situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histological and, above all, immunohistologic techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium, in patients with the clinically suspected diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, allows a subdivision into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (no detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the WHO classification of 1995 (31).
nflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory reaction, which can be detected with histological and, above all, immunohistologic techniques.
t it was only through the combination of histological, immunohistologic and molecular biological techniques that it was possible to carry out a subgroup analysis with regard to the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilative cardiomyopathy.
n addition to the bacterial exogenous (post-traumatic/postoperative), the bacterial endogenous (hematogenic) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of the bacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis can be distinguished, which in contrast to the others manifests itself preferentially on the collarbone.
From the group of 17 patients with Claviculaosteomyelitis, which we treated from 1978-1996, 3 patients with primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as casuistics.
Differential diagnosis must take into account the primary chronic-sclerosing osteomyelitis of the Clavicula despite its rare occurrence, since it is - according to biooptical diagnostic assurance - a domain of conservative, drug therapy.
ffective-induced exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
Despite modern drug and surgical treatment methods, it is often difficult to treat.
The treatment of malignant tumors rests on the four pillars of Surgery, Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and Immunotherapy.
In the work, based on a literature analysis, the role of the total duration of treatment and the dose intensity in the optimization of chemotherapeutic protocols is investigated using the example of three important oncological diseases.
Both tumor models and the resulting hypotheses as well as, above all, well-designed clinical studies can enable advances in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases.
Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined clinical picture from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
x, a very potent antiproliferative substance, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules and thereby alters cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration and signal transduction.
In this paper, the in-vitro and in-vivo results from our research work on Paclitaxel are presented.
After comparing 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was favored for in vivo use.
Using staining of the cytoskeleton as well as electronoptically, it was possible to detect the paclitaxel effect in the smooth muscle cells of the vascular wall.
n rabbits, locally administered paclitaxel led to a significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and enlargement of vessel diameters compared to balloon-dilated control animals.
n additional experiments it was possible to show a drastic reduction in the vascular contractile force after paclitaxel administration.
n addition to an age-dependent intercalation of waste products between the cytoplasmic and basal membranes of the RPE cells ("basal laminar deposits"), a splitting of the Bruch's membrane between the basal membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer can be seen in various manifestations of early and late AMD such as Drusen, chorioidal neovascularizations and pigment pith elevations.
Since the different membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether an age-dependent regression of the adhesion apparatus is detectable.
recent investigations make it clear that vertebral arch dysplasia and spondylolysis occur as a result of disturbed spinal growth.
The symptoms of rheumatic hand flexor tendon disease depend on the location of the lesion and the type of visual impairment in order to enable early surgical therapy with preservation of hand function through improved clinical diagnosis.
Suitable, naturally occurring animal models are also lacking for the majority of common dermatoses.
The transgenic technology founded in the 80s closes this gap.
It was initially an Instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also found its way into clinically oriented specific dermatological basic research.
With it it became possible to imitate HIV-associated diseases as well as Genodermatoses on the Murine Model and to gain insights into their pathogenesis.
Through targeted epidermally localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities to psoriatic epidermis.
mice produced in this way can be used for investigations of the wound healing process.
The transgenic technology also enables the induction of cutaneous tumors.
The presence of animal models of human dermatoses also allows the targeted research of experimental forms of therapy, such as somatic gene therapy.
ndications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in wearers of artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication against MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic issues such as processes in the posterior cranial fossa, spinal abscesses and in the case of complaints inside the knees can be better investigated by MRI than with other radiological procedures.
MRI can directly affect the wearer of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) movement and dislocation of the valve prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electric currents, and indirectly by a distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
he current literature on safety aspects of MRI in wearers of artificial heart valves does not appear to be sufficient.
n 1998, a survey was conducted among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of MRI of their respective valve prostheses.
Some companies based their statements on investigations that could not be seen, or transferred the responsibility to the doctor who performs the MRI.
Two flap manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prostheses.
ng on our survey, an overview of the technical aspects, the clinical circumstances and the prerequisites for MRI safety standards in wearers of artificial heart valves is given.
In an experimental study, an intravenous CO2- or argon embolism with 10, 20 and 30 ml of gas was performed in 10 pigs with a mean body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg.
In the Argon group (n = 5), two animals died after 20 and 30 ml bolus administration, respectively.
Another animal could be successfully resuscitated after Gabe of 30 ml Bolus.
n the CO2 group (n = 5) neither of the animals died nor was resuscitation required.
Less soluble gases such as Argon should not be used in situations with an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report on a 56-year-old patient with disseminated Granuloma annulare with a known diabetic metabolic status.
In addition, there was renal insufficiency, which made us refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We carried out a balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoralen whole body baths according to the film method, which after 30 treatments led to a complete regression of the lesions on the trunk and neck and to a significant improvement in the skin condition on the extremities.
Side effects did not appear.
Through balneophotochemotherapy, not only epidermal, but also dermal localized processes can be therapeutically influenced.
Cat scratch disease (KKK) is an infectious disease that is little known in Germany.
Only a few years ago, the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, could be isolated.
n the majority of cases there is a typical clinical picture with skin changes in the area of cat bites or scratches and a benign lymphadenopathy.
Less often there are other organ demonstration stations.
We report on a 47-year-old patient who, after a cat bite, developed reactive spondylitis with synovialitides of the finger joints, polyarthralgias of the middle and large joints, and inflammatory lumbargia.
The rheumatic symptoms were time-limited and spoke well to NSAR.
far only a few cases of joint participation within the framework of a KKK have been described.
Since the infection of cats with Bartonella henselae is high in Europe, however, it could be a more common cause of joint problems than previously thought.
Diagnostics of the KKK has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We give an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Continuous therapy optimization in recent years has significantly improved the prognosis of Hodgkin's disease.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a large number of possible long-term complications, of which the attending physician must be aware.
Due to often long-lasting fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism and damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the mostly young patients are permanently impaired in their quality of life.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasms after primarily successful therapy poses a significant problem.
ng from attachment styles as prescribed patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in situations relevant to attachment (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990) was aimed at making these patterns appropriate in the sense of their original definition, i.e. to operationalize as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three binding styles "safe", "avoidant" and "ambivalent" were translated into self-descriptions of clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
Based on the factor analysis results, three scales were formed:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) filled out the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
Cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as binding styles:
, two variants of "unsafe-ambivalent" ("locked" and "clinging") and two variants of "unsafe-avoiding" ("locked" and "cooperatively ready").
Discrimination analysis of these clusters yielded discrimination functions that correspond to those of Collins u. Read (1990) as well as Ainsworth et al.
The presence of the clinical symptoms of advanced inner ear hearing loss, dizziness and the simultaneous radiological detection of a contrast medium-absorbing spatial requirement of the inner auditory canal confirm the suspicion of the presence of an acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old patient with anamnestically known Sharp syndrome and the initially typical constellation of findings.
The presented case study shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the bridge angle of the cerebellum, which manifested itself with a peripheral brain nerve failure in the HNO area and initially a lack of central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the failure of exclusively peripheral brain nerves suggested the presence of a lymphoma preoperatively.
The facial paresis that occurred within a few weeks and the typical occipital cephalgias with radiation into the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings as in the case described by us must, despite the presence of leading symptoms, challenge to bring about a differential diagnostic clarification.
The manifestation of solitary lymphoma in the Kleinhirnbrückenwinkel is considered a rarity.
Other therapy options available to the gynecologist in practice, clinic and in rehabilitation are balneotherapy and physiotherapy as primary or supplementary treatment measures.
In gynecology, balneogynecology as a naturopathic procedure has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies.
gynecological and physiotherapeutic measures are indication-related and are mainly used as supplementary measures.
ly in chronic conditions as well as acute muscular tension, they are suitable primarily for pain reduction and positive tissue influence as primary measures.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnostics currently require an average of four weeks until a positive tuberculosis culture is present and a subsequent sensitivity test.
It takes seven to eight weeks for a negative culture result to be reported.
Faster results can be achieved in individual diagnostic steps by new methods such as e.g. nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these currently do not have the desired high sensitivity.
The worldwide worrying epidemiological situation of the risk of infection for tuberculosis leaves no doubt that the further development of methods is necessary that allow in the shortest possible time to detect, differentiate and test mycobacteria with high sensitivity and specificity for their sensitivity to antibiotics.
As part of a prospectively randomized study, a non-joint-bridging assembly of the small external fixator of the AO for the therapy of distal radius fracture (A2/A3 according to AO classification) is compared with the supply of percutaneous Kirschner-Draht osteosynthesis with plaster.
The collection of donated women's milk has a long tradition in Germany.
With modern screening methods the transmission of infections is ruled out.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favorable composition, milk from donors who have children born too early is preferred for very immature premature babies.
n the last 20 years in Germany a large number of day care centers (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counseling centers (KBSn) have been created as complementary day care centers.
The wide spread of these institutions contrasts with the large absence of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and their working methods.
In the present work, 100 visitors of TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
Features of the social situation, the psychopathological symptoms and the point of view of the visitors were collected.
almost all visitors had previously been in inpatient psychiatric treatment.
The current psychopathological symptoms varied considerably with an average moderate intensity.
of the visitors were retired, most lived alone and had few or no friends.
As positive aspects of the facilities, the visitors mentioned v. a. the contact with other people and the daily structure.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the disruption by other visitors.
Visitors to TSn were on average younger and had higher values in the BPRS Anergie subscale.
n addition, the visitors of the two facilities hardly differed in the characteristics examined.
The results indicate that both facilities actually care for the chronically mentally ill with poor social integration, for whose care they are also designed.
For these patients, they partially compensate for deficits in the social network.
The limits and consequences of the results are addressed.
For a long time, functional examinations of the brain were only possible with nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
Through the use of fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast agent applications and special post-processing methods, it became possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Information on tissue perfusion, microcirculation and permeability of the blood-brain barrier can be acquired with T1- and T2*-weighted contrast media-assisted imaging sequences using special models, e.g. from nuclear medicine.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in the tissue can be represented with diffusion-weighted MRI, the marrow vascularity, time-resolved, with MR-angiographic techniques.
With MR-spectroscopic investigations, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissue can be multidimensionally recorded and metabolic processes can be observed in the course.
Advantages of MRI are the low invasiveness, the possibility of a three-dimensional representation of the data and any repeatability of the examination in the absence of radiation exposure.
The functional methods that can already be used clinically are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in relation to the value compared to nuclear medicine methods.
In tumor diagnostics, the functional MR techniques provide important additional information for therapy finding, therapy planning and therapy monitoring.
Investigations were able to show that the methods are able to sensitively record pathophysiological changes in dementia and psychoses.
t is the declared goal of the World Health Organization (WHO), in the countries of the European region, also in view of the constant political and economic changes, to establish health protection in the awareness of all as high as possible.
hazardous environmental factors should be combated or better prevented through concrete international measures.
necessary prerequisite here is the agreement on international standards in the field of environment and health as well as mutually coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
t is to ensure that governments and the respective populations develop a common perception of the important environmental medical problem areas.
n order to ensure the smoothest possible flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts necessary for this purpose, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a "WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health" (WHO-Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health) in the summer of 1997 with financial support from the Federal Ministry of Health in Bonn at the Robert Koch Institute.
t is reported about a 30-year-old patient who had a right-sided amaurosis fugax with simultaneous frontal-basal fracture after a fall event.
By means of CT and MR angiography, a closure of the A. ophthalmica as a result of a dissection of the internal A. carotis with ascending thrombosis could be proven as the cause.
Further neurological deficits did not exist, since sufficient circulation of the cerebral arteries via the Cerebral Circulus arteriosus was guaranteed.
n the etiological diversity of post-traumatic amauroses, such a rare cause should be considered etiologically, diagnostically and therapeutically.
The suspicion of an acute aortic dissection requires immediate clarification with suitable imaging methods, such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, nuclear spin tomography or aortography.
n the case presented here, the suspicion of an aortic dissection was expressed echocardiographically in an asymptomatic patient.
wing to the discrepancy with the clinical image, angiography was also used in addition to other tomography methods in order to diagnose the detection of an internalization of the aneurysmically dilated thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out an aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital because of acute thoracic pain, increasing dyspnoea and with the image of a right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
n the further clarification by means of echocardiography, a ruptured sinus-valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary sail with left-right shunt into the right atrium could be determined as the cause by non-invasive means.
The heart surgery proceeded without complications while maintaining the aortic valve.
n six months later, the right heart sections were normally wide echocardiographically, and no shunt was detectable in the color Doppler.
Acute cardiac insufficiency can also be the result of a congenital heart defect in middle age.
Through echocardiography and especially through transesophageal echocardiography, a precise diagnosis could be made by non-invasive means.
s of Nager Syndromes are mandibulofacial and limb malformations.
hypoplasia of the lower jaw can lead to airway obstructions due to the application of the tongue to the back of the throat, especially in infancy.
We present a patient with rodent syndrome who received nasal CPAP and sedation for more than 5 months due to persistent dyspnoea.
fter the soft tissues had been pre-stretched by an extension treatment, a lower jaw distraction osteogenesis was already carried out at a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and the cosmetic result are good.
Respiratory tract obstructions and dyspnoea were no longer observed after completion of therapy.
Successful thrombus arteriectomies (TEA) of the internal A. carotis lead to improved perfusion in the flow area of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular blood circulation during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors about the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the treatment of a specific case of illness using modern telematics.
The practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (initially ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in everyday clinical practice has been largely defined, and it is still unclear whether this independent medical service will be adequately rewarded.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on vision.
There is no longer any doubt today that a Psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to a reversible effluvium.
Whether a scarring alopecia can be a direct consequence of psoriasis is debatable.
we present a 38-year-old patient who has been suffering for years from a progressive effluvium in Psoriatic Herds at the Capillitium.
histologically imposed strand-shaped fibrosations instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis, which occasionally overlapped the epithelium of hair follicles obtained and characteristics of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical course and lack of evidence for another cause of scarring suggest a causal-pathogenic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
knowledge of this possible relationship is important insofar as a consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and thus presumably the formation of scarring.
Reduced production of growth hormone (GH) is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treatment of these Fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves various clinical symptoms including the number of main pain points.
The reduced GH secretion is likely due to an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
t the hypothesis is presented that this disturbed GH secretion is caused by intermittent phases of increased cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of -adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in the -adrenergic Tonus stimulates the release of somatostatin with the result of reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research points to the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-harm behaviors (SVV).
nevertheless, the efficiency of classical neuroleptics is questionable.
In open and controlled studies, even long-term effective SVV was reduced under the Serotonin 2A-Dopamine D2-Antagonist Risperidone.
With the present study, an osteoporotic animal model should be created by means of ovarectomy.
Before and after the ovarectomy, osteodensitometric measurements were performed from the upper and lower jaw using DXA.
A significant decrease in bone density after the ovarectomy was seen in both the upper and lower jaws.
10 patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic hemarthros of the knee joints were arthroscopically clarified and treated.
The causes of bleeding were diverse:
n addition to vascular anomalies such as hemangiomas and meniscus lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from corroded subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
Surgical, mostly arthroscopic therapy brought good results.
Toxic snakebite injuries in children in Germany are almost exclusively caused by vipers (Vipera berus).
The adder injects a poison from various enzymes and hemorrhagic as well as neurotoxic factors.
trbisis in children can be mild symptoms, but also cause the most severe symptoms of poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings in their surroundings can be presented on a large scale.
The transmission of the sonographic findings to the therapists not present during the examination and the control of a finding, e.g. a tumor, under therapy, are thereby significantly improved.
Viruses have also become mobile due to increasing human cruising speed and activity worldwide.
At the same time, due to the rapid development of electronic communication technologies, more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world is received in an ever shorter time.
In this work, four case studies are used to examine the factors that can influence an early or late point in the initial diagnosis of dementia.
In all our cases, we have provided the indication for the operation.
The perforation site was primarily sewn over and extensively rinsed and drained.
In 2 cases, the suture was additionally secured by fibrin adhesion or with an omentum plastic.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate consequences.
Based on these own results and after evaluating the current literature, the following conclusions seem justified to us:
If a perforation is secured in the early stage, a definitive surgical procedure is indicated.
Even in the case of delayed diagnosis with advanced mediastinitis, a suture closure of the perforation site should be attempted.
An additional fuse is recommended in these cases.
resecting procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high operational risks.
The standards and regulations valid in the MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
n children with horseshoe crabs Wilms tumors 2 to 8 are rarely observed.
Wilms tumors are malignant mixed-tissue tumors that rarely have larger fat-tissue-containing fractions.
We report on a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, which could also have been a teratom due to a large lipomatous proportion with internal calcifications according to radiological criteria.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in different sectional imaging methods are presented.
Both differential diagnostic considerations found their correlation in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumor.
Thoracic Actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often mistaken for malignancy.
n view of the high lethality of untreated Actinomycosis, this disease must be included in the differential diagnostic considerations at an early stage.
A 58-year-old patient with a 6-month history, bloody-vomited expectoration and significant body weight reduction is reported, who was assigned to us under the suspicion of thoracic sarcoma.
The diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis could only be made via a diagnostic detour.
for this was an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
n antibiotic treatment, the symptoms rapidly regressed and ultimately led to the healing of the patient.
Bronchoscopy is also an important part of diagnostics in the differential diagnostic clarification of thoracic spatial requirements, which includes inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatic tumors as well as germ cell tumors.
n hereditary hemorrhagic teleangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease) arteriovenous malformations of the liver represent a rare malformation.
n addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, the systemic consequences, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old patient is described, in which the percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavorable vascular anatomy.
Instead, the justifiable "banding" of the hepatic artery was tested as a new treatment concept.
fter minilaparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the hepatic artery and an adapted throttling of the hepatic artery was performed via the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output were successfully reduced and heart failure was treated.
The described technique thus represents an alternative to ligation of the hepatic artery if percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis has been made in 3% of biopsies of benign diseases in our own examination material in 20 years.
While puerperal mastitis in relation to the number of births is present today in about 1%, the different forms of non-puerperal mastitis have come to the fore both clinically and histopathologically.
n addition to inflammatory reactions as concomitant phenomena, the majority of mastitises currently to be diagnosed are chronic-granulomatous forms with a broad spectrum of causes.
Only a small part is an expression of a pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, a sarcoidosis or pannicularitis.
The autoimmune mastitis is a B-lymphocytic mastitis with tumorous fibrosis that occurs in type I diabetes mellitus (diabetic mastopathy), endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases without signs of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and in case of suspicion of pathogen-induced mastitis, bacterioscopic and microbiological investigations should always be carried out on the fresh material.
nfectious colitis with the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs preferably in patients with weakened defenses or treated with antibiotics.
We report on 25 or 14 year old boys with a Clostridium Difficulty-related colitis, without the mentioned preconditions or a certain underlying condition.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, extends the duration of mechanical ventilation.
recent prospective studies show that the application of a corresponding protocol leads to an earlier start of weaning and a significant shortening of the mechanical ventilation time.
daily screening of respiratory function, as well as spontaneous breathing tests are valuable aids that should be included in a weaning protocol.
Once the condition and ability of spontaneous respiration is documented, extubation of ventilated patients should be encouraged, as sufficient evidence shows that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be successfully extubated after a spontaneous respiration attempt.
delay of mechanical ventilation can be undertaken in patients in whom spontaneous ventilation attempts have not been successful.
Two randomized studies show that the strategy used to set aside mechanical ventilation influences the speed and extent of weaning success, and that SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with lip-jaw-palate clefts should lead to an improvement in the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare the initial findings and the surgical outcome in 30 patients with unilateral LKG cleavages.
To correct the nasal deformity, an open rhinoplasty was used.
The soft tissue analysis of the nose was carried out by measuring standardized nasal raster photographs and lateral far-X-ray imaging.
Deviations of the nose symmetry, the nose width and the nose wing attachment line from the ideal shape were determined.
nasal profile was assessed by measurements of the nasofacial, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurter Horizontal and the angle between the Columella and the Frankfurter Horizontal.
The previous rhinomanometry was used to evaluate the air permeability.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined, and the flow of the split and non-split sides were compared.
The examinations were carried out immediately before and 6 months after the surgical procedure.
In the frontal plane, there is a significant correction of the nasal symmetry and an equalization of the nasal wing inclination.
significant improvement in acute nasofacial angles and deep nasal wings was not achieved.
Through the intervention, the total flow could be increased and a correction of the quotient of the flows of the split and non-split sides could be achieved.
n the applied examination methods, the aesthetically and functionally relevant findings can be objectified and thus serve a quality control.
studies and reports of incidents following manual spinal therapy from 1989-1996 were examined.
There are no correctly conducted prospective or retrospective studies in the literature on complications that have occurred in connection with a manipulative treatment of the spine.
n view of the excellent soft tissue contrasts, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in the assessment of ankle joint diseases.
Conventional MRI can reliably represent normal and acutely injured ligaments.
n the subacute and chronic stage of the injury, however, the joint fluid necessary for an exact demarcation of the injured ligaments is often missing.
MR-Arthrography should be performed in these cases, as the intra-articular KM application distends the joint space with improved distinguishability of intra-articular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the assessment of the stage of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions a KM-surrounding of the dissect can be more easily visualized.
Finally, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intraarticular free articular bodies, which often require surgical treatment, due to the high contrast and joint distension.
MR-Arthrography, although invasive, provides essential additional information in the examination of the post-traumatic ankle joint as well as various ankle joint diseases.
The therapeutic goal of resuscitation after acute treatment must be the social reintegration of the person, ideally the condition before the onset of the emergency.
The present study investigated the long-term outcome of patients who were resuscitated due to an out-of-clinic cardiovascular arrest of cardiac genesis in a rural area.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of a stem varicose vein of the V.-saphena-magna and/or -parva-type.
sion can result in a migration of the thrombus into the deep vein system via the orifices of the trunk veins in the groin and larynx or via insufficient Vv. perforators, which threatens the complication of a pulmonary embolism.
Type I comprises varicoplebitis of the veins without involvement of the orifices of V. saphena magna and/or parva and of the deep vein system.
In type IV, the transfascial thrombus migrates via insufficiently perforating veins into the deep veins.
In these cases, varicose veins are surgically remedied only after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation includes the crossectomy, the extirpation of the stem veins via separate incisions, the exharyngeal removal of all varicose branches and the ligature of insufficient Vv. perforators.
In type III, thromboectomy via the V.-saphena-magna and/or -parva orifice takes precedence over all other measures.
achydermodaktylia is an acquired, symptomless thickening of the lateral fingers and occurs almost exclusively in young men.
formalpathogenetically, the disease is based on a benign fibromatosis.
Based on our own observations and a literature review, exogenous factors in the form of coercive actions seem to be the main cause of the lesions.
angiopathic hemolytic anemias (thrombotic-thrombocytopenic Purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, hemolytic-uremic syndrome = HUS) are often associated with involvement of the central nervous system.
Typical Symptoms are irritability, restlessness, confusional states, conscious disturbances, seizures or focal neurological failures.
We report a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute organocerebral psychosyndrome with progressive disturbance of consciousness leading to coma.
nal computed tomography showed a discreet, general brain swelling that regressed independently of the clinical deterioration.
The cranial nuclear spin tomography was inconspicuous.
Generalized increases in flow velocity (A. cerebri media, anterior and posterior both sides and A. basilaris) were found in transcranial Doppler sonography.
The causal relationship between flow velocity increases and disturbances of consciousness is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement was analogous to the regression of the flow velocity increases.
Pathophysiologically, a disturbed prostacyclin metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV and a leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
ncessive follow-up of anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted procedure.
ven though the gold standard for the care of cruciate ligament injuries is the replacement plastic, reintegration with autologous reinforcement in young people represents an excellent possibility.
We report on the rare case of a post-traumatic aneurysm of Truncus brachiocephalicus.
was a blunt thoracic trauma as part of a traffic accident.
The vascular injury could not be diagnosed by a computed tomography (CT).
n patients with fractures of the cranial ribs after blunt thoracic trauma, angiography should be required if possible to rule out a life-threatening vascular injury.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now the Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are then categorized in terms of their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and sometimes have considerable differences from them.
With this brief presentation of the American guidelines, the clinician should be provided with a well-founded decision-making aid for his own practical work regarding many everyday, but by no means minor problems.
A 57-year-old patient with progressive systemic scleroderma underwent prolonged therapy with Iloprost for 21 days.
The dosage was 2 ng/kgKGxmin over a creep phase of 6 days.
The therapy led to an improvement in the inflammation parameters, the lung function, in particular the diffusion capacity and the pronounced acral circulatory disturbance.
Due to its central position, the elbow joint can be regarded from functional points of view as the most important joint of the upper extremity.
Bone and ligament injuries in the area of the proximal forearm confront the attending physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions at the elbow joint, which are accompanied by chronic pain symptoms and movement restrictions, inevitably reduce the usability of the entire arm.
Today there is hardly any doubt that in the majority of cases a primary definitive osteosynthetic care with an exact reconstruction of the joint surface is just as indispensable for a satisfactory result as an early start of physiotherapeutic exercise measures.
With the increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical peculiarities of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in the therapeutic principles has taken place in recent decades, the current status of which is presented in the present work, taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrode complications can have fatal consequences.
Manipulations by the patient on subcutaneous electrode sections that can be felt through the skin can lead to damage to the probe.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode progression and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This drug is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was already successfully used in patients with psoriasis in the 1970s.
In the present overview, the mechanism of action and the pharmacology of Mycophenolatmofetil are presented, as well as the current experiences with this drug in dermatology are summarized.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology today offers the possibility to precisely analyze structures tomographically in individual steps.
Image planes that cannot be represented with conventional technology can be reconstructed from the electronic memory without any problems.
Surface and transparency modes additionally allow a plastic representation of stored structures.
With these different display possibilities and the loss-free long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D sonography sets new standards in the fine diagnosis of early pregnancy.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of a 7.45% potassium chloride solution were accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 hours on the first postoperative day.
After temporary paresthesia, burning pain in the legs developed as a result of the accidental infusion, associated with a motor and sensory innervation failure up to the TH 11 segment. The clinical picture was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications such as those described are usually based on errors, the occurrence of which, although not impossible, can be made less likely by appropriate measures.
such measures include the color marking of lines, filters and infusion solutions as well as the use of syringe pumps with a larger drug reservoir in order to reduce the frequency of syringe exchange.
viewing alveolar comb profiles and clinical experiences show that the transverse dimension has so far been neglected in dental implantology.
n view of a fundamental evaluation of the influence of jaw crest height and width, the analysis of 95 toothless bony upper jaws from collections that were sawn, measured and classified in a standardized way was first carried out.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length), 1076 implants were simulated at 269 cross-sections and evaluated differentiated according to implant type, cross-sectional position and atrophy class.
The procedure was similar in the clinical part of the study in 24 consecutive implant patients with toothless upper jaw.
nplantation on the corpse jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross-sections, but with sufficient jaw height in another 4.5% was actually to be expected.
length reductions were additionally necessary in 6%.
There were dependencies v. a. to the atrophy class.
reverse cross-sections of boats are much more favorable conditions than posterior ones.
n contrast, implantability was not given in any of the 24 patients.
Primary insufficient height was present in 22 cases, 2 times with sufficient height a transverse to narrow alveolar crest only emerged during the operation.
The results allow the quantification of the significance of vertical and transverse upper jaw alveolar comb dimension.
This importance lies primarily in the bone height, although reductions in implant length are often necessary even with sufficient height.
However, alveolar crest profiles remain both on the corpse jaw (12% of the incisions with expected implantation) and on the patient (8%), for which the sole height measurement simulates incorrect conditions and an exactly planned surgical intervention may have to be aborted.
The complexity and cost of implantological rehabilitation and the scope of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even therefore require fundamentally extended cross-sectional diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) represents a new imaging method with which metabolic processes and non-morphological changes can be investigated.
Since tumors have increased glycolysis, they can be detected by means of radioactively labeled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven itself in different tumorentities.
n this study, PET was investigated in the lymph node staging of bladder carcinoma.
n 64 patients, a PET of the pelvis was performed preoperatively after i. v. injection of Fluorine-Deoxy-Glucose (FDG), so that the PET finding could be compared with the histological finding of the surgical preparation after classical operative lymph node staging.
nymph node staging, positive lymph nodes were correctly recognized in 14 patients;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 80% are calculated.
The PET results are therefore encouraging and seem to be better than the classic staging methods, such as CT and MRI.
Of 220 patients with chronic-recurrent rhinosinusitis, serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were determined to reveal an immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had subnormal immunoglobulin whole level, but 21 patients had Immune subclass defect.
It influences the decision whether antibiotic therapy and/or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
f chronic infections of the paranasal sinuses persist despite conservative therapy, a mucosal-protective operation of the paranasal sinuses is indicated, which, however, cannot bring the desired success in this clinical picture alone.
Immune subclass deficiency is to be evaluated as an indicator of a disturbed immune system.
Transitions into a severe immune deficiency with the development of malignancies are observed.
We report on a 64-year-old patient who had extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the torso as well as on the right leg along the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
Treatment with acitretin resulted in a significant reduction of the lesions.
The lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses - in particular the "adult blaschkitis" first described in 1990 - are discussed.
preservation of potency and urinary incontinence after rectal resections has increased after nerve-sparing preparation and complete excision of the mesorectum have become widespread.
Nevertheless, there are postoperative rates of potency disorders and urinary incontinence between 25 and 67% in the literature.
Materials and Methods:
The autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were displayed on 10 corpses and 2 isolated pelvic preparations fixed with formalin.
Their positional relationship and possible locations of damage were presented and photodocumented in the course of the surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically clearly defined structures with only low interindividual variability.
The lower P. mesentericus forms a dense fiber network around the lower A. mesenterica (AMI) strain over a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral rectum wall and P. pelvicus is only 2-3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by the Denonvillier's fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated via standard surgical access.
1. The nomenclature of the fasciae and the course of the autonomic nerves in the small pelvis are not clearly clarified in the literature.
2. A high deposition of AMI inevitably leads to damage to sympathetic nerve fibers.
3. The close positional relationship between the rectum and autonomic nerve fibers makes a sharp preparation under direct vision unavoidable.
4. Fasciae and nerves can be used as guiding structures in the preparation.
5. The selective preservation of parasympathetic roots in the small pelvis is not feasible via standard surgical access.
early detection of secondary carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinomas is important for prognosis and groundbreaking for therapy planning.
In a prospective study from 1993-1998, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, the Oropharynx and the lip were panendoscopically examined as part of the staging to examine whether this method is possible for early diagnosis of simultaneous secondary carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.
The panendoscopy was initiated with a rigid tracheobronchoscopy, followed by the rigid esophagoscopy.
ensued the endoscopic examination of the Naso-, Oro- and Hypopharynx.
was the microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspected areas.
The proportion of simultaneous second carcinoma was 8.4%.
cancers could also be diagnosed with the help of panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the clinic and polyclinic for oral, jaw, facial surgery as well as the Regensburg Tumor Center (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of second carcinomas in a Primarius in the "head-neck area".
Due to the good experiences so far and the uncomplicated course, this examination obviously does not pose any additional risk to the patients, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for staging in tumors in the head-neck area.
The diagnosis of Huntington's chorea can cause significant problems due to the high variability of the clinical picture, especially at the beginning of the disease.
We present a 21-year-old patient with a confirmed Huntington's Chorea, in whom over 7 years the psychopathological changes formed the main symptoms and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
The very early onset of the disease and the significant advance of the onset of the disease compared to other sick family members were exceptional and thus largely responsible for the misdiagnosis.
However, the phenomenon of the early onset of the disease is well documented in the literature in the case of the transmission of the mutated gene from the father.
gnalistic differentially, the attention to the initially subtle abnormalities of the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed survey of the family history were groundbreaking.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can take place with a different focus:
as climate therapy, as (Balneo-)phototherapy or in a psychosomatic setting.
Since certain patient groups benefit differently from this, indications for psychosomatic treatment are worked out:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological disease and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such a therapy is indicated for dermatoses of psychic genesis or with psychic involvement, if there is depression, functional complaints, previous emotional stress or psychotherapy motivation.
n the case of problems in the processing of the disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant neoplasms of the skin, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
, the importance of orthopaedic aids such as bandages and orthoses in the event of functional disorders in the area of the lateral ligaments of the ankle joints is to be shown.
t will be explained the mechanisms of action of orthoses described in the literature with regard to joint stabilization, injury prevention and influencing athletic performance as well as proprioceptive abilities.
This paper deals with long-term changes in cemented polyethylene pans of the Müller type.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to varying degrees of shape changes on the polyethylene.
The amount of abrasion is detectable by the displacement of the hip head in the socket.
Within the first years postoperatively there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
After about 5 years, it commutes to values around 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Head displacement values exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavorable with regard to prosthesis loosening.
In this study, for a total of 369 hip prostheses, the center of the hip head was determined in relation to the marker wire of the socket and the head displacement was calculated.
fter an average running time of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads (n = 109) had an abrasion rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
n the metal heads used (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10) this value was only reached in 71% (n = 260) (runtime 61.5 months).
Polyethylene-ceramic sliding pairing reduces abrasion by half compared to polyethylene-metal pairing.
In younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is to be preferred.
f the indication for the performance of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) exists in patients who are unable to consent, the approval of the supervisor is required to carry out the curative treatment.
n reference to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, the Hamburg Regional Court had assumed the justified risk of long-term health damage and had affirmed the obligation of approval.
Electroconvulsive therapy is, however, a safe and effective therapeutic measure for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychoses, taking into account the contraindications.
The use of unilateral short-pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive side effects.
Retrograde amnesia, in particular, occurs only very rarely and in a form that is negligible in view of the risks posed by the underlying disease.
In the opinion of the authors, a guardianship court approval obligation within the framework of the Care Act is to be denied.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is triggered in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal-dominant inheritance, among others, by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine.
The in vitro contracture test (IVKT) according to the protocol of the European MH group represents, due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) as well as the genetic variability of the disease, the "gold standard" of phenotypic diagnostics for MH-prediction.
On the other hand, there is a high coupling between mutations on the Ryanodin receptor gene (RYR1) and the MH disposition.
nce the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) on the RYR1 gene could be detected in an individual of an extended family, the presence of this mutation in the remaining family members and the match with the IVKT was of interest.
Ultrasound diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described.
Children's Lymphatic System Diseases are sonographically relatively uniform:
there are initial lymph node and organ enlargements, as well as disturbance of the normal echotexture, mostly in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
On the parenchymal organs, sonographically essentially 4 infiltration patterns are observed:
diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular and the "Bulcky-Type".
A therapeutic success is recognizable in ultrasound by the normalization of the lymph node and organ size, the return of normal organogenicity and the regression of tumor or inflammation-related complications.
Differential diagnostic indications result from the topographical distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, as well as, with certain reservations, from the echogenicity and the blood circulation conditions that can be analyzed by Doppler sonography.
The primary diagnosis must always be histologically confirmed.
Background and questions.
n the transient akantholytic dermatosis first described by Grover in 1970, there are clinically mostly itchy, edematous or hyperkeratotic papers or papulovesicles mainly on the trunk, which heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
histologically typical is an acantholysis.
With an etiology that is still unclear today, light, sweat and heat are discussed as provocation factors.
