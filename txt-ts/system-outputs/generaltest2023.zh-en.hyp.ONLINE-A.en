5 General structure
In the text, where a number is preceded by 0x, hexadecimal is used, and non-marked 0x is decimal.
All codes in the appendix are represented in hexadecimal, and other numbers are represented in decimal.
The single-byte part adopts the coding structure of GB/T 11383 to 1989, and uses 0x00~0x7F code points.
The double-character tribute part uses two eight-bit binary bits to represent a character, with the first byte code points from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the last byte code points from 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte portion uses GB/11383-1989 0x30-0x39, which is not used in 1989, as a suffix for double-byte encoding encoding, which ranges from 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39.
The first word of a four-byte character encodes in the range of 0x81 to 0xFE; The second word encoding range is 0x30 to 0x39; The third byte encodes in the range of 0x81 to 0xFE; The fourth character city code ranges from 0x30 to 0x39. i.e. : 0x81308130 a 0x81308139; 0x81308230 0x81308239 0x8130FEFE30 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 a 0x81318139 ; Oo2douolag0c "0URo23061393 0xFE39FE30 a 0xFE39FE39.

DESCRIPTION C AND C++ COMPILERS ARE INTEGRATED. They all process the input file in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, Hii(compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The source file suffix identifies the language of the source file, but to the compiler, the suffix controls the default setting:
GCC considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C file and sets the connection in the form of C.
G++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file and sets the connection in C++.
The source file post-level name indicates the language type and later operations:
.c C source program; Preprocessing, compiling, assembling
. C++ source program; Preprocessing, compiling, assembling
.cc C++ source program; Preprocessing, compiling, assembling
. CXX C++ source program; Preprocessing, compiling, assembling
.m Objective-C source program; Preprocessing, compiling, assembling
.i preprocessed c file; Compile, assemble
.ii Preprocessed C++ files; Compile, assemble
.s assembly language source program; compilation
Assembly language source program; Preprocessing, assembly
.h preprocessor file; Files with other post-level names that do not normally appear on the command line are passed to the Linker.
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), the connection is always the last step.
During the connection phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, unrecognized file names (including the specified .o H standard file and .a library file) are passed to the connector options (OPTIONS) in the order in the command line
The options must be given discretely : de ' is completely different from '-d -r '.
Most ' -=E : and '-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno- name).
Only formats that are not default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, explained in later chapters.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly state that the language of the input file follows is language (not the default choice obtained from the filename).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option .language is available
Turn off any explicit description of the language, so process subsequent files according to the filename post-RE AS E '-x' option).
If you are only operating some of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, joining), you can use the '-x' option (or Ah after the filename) to tell geo where to start and '~-c', '-s', or '-E' to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g. ,'-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c to compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC is replaced by '.o' for the source filename followed by the '.ec filename.' You can use the -o option to select a different name. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option -S F Whatever.
of the object file.
Stop after compilation, no assembly is made.
Work using pipes instead of temporary files between different stages of the compilation process, because the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from the pipes, GNU's assemblers do not have this problem, and the assembler can accept C "dialects": support for ANSI-compliant C programs.
This would turn off some of the GNU Cc incompatible ANSI Cc feature keywords, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, which indicate that they are rarely used, and forbidden despite their use. The corresponding independent environment (f£reestanding environment) does not have a standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. Please refer to the latest information on the GCC website for details)
For function declarations with no arguments, such as 'int foo(); ', treated in C style --- i.e. do not specify the number or type of parameters. (C++ only) .
Normally, such a function foo means that the argument is empty in C++.
The list of sections is removed from here to attempts to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.
See the NUC manual for details, we've removed the details, so that when the content becomes outdated, people won't HERI.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option brings an additional effect that allows assignment to this.
It has the same effect as the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of legacy CC preprocessors.
In particular, the above mentioned content about preprocessors, but does not include other effects of the '-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the '$' character in identifiers (C++ only).
You can specify the '''-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the '$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the '$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types (MEF c++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal-—templates produces smaller code (C++ only) for template declarations by generating only one copy of each template function where they are defined.
To use this option successfully, you must mark '#pragma implementatio' or '#Pragma interface' in all files that use templates.
When the program is compiled with '-fexternal-templates', template instantiation is all external types. You must have the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved through typedef, which references each instance needed.
Correspondingly, if the default option '-fno-exteznal-templates' is used when compiling, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except constructors and the mnew or delete member operators) are treated as virtual functions of the class.
This does not indicate that each call to a member function will pass through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; At this point, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the type of the second and third arguments of the conditional expression to not match.
The value of such an expression is void.-fthis--is-variable allows assignment to this (C++ only).
Incorporating user-defined free storage management mechanisms into C++ makes the assignable 'this' seem out of place.
Therefore, by default, assigning a value to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this work via the '-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
Each machine has its own default char type. It could be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the symbolism of data.
But many programs have been written with only simple char, and this is a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine on which the program is written).
This option, and its antisense option, makes such a program work on the corresponding defaults.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier is not explicitly declared, these options are used to define either a signed bitfield or an unsigned bitfield.
By default, bitfields are signed, because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed numbers, however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, the bitfields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings store string constants in writable data segments without special treatment.
This is a very bad idea for compatibility with some older programs that change string constants, and the '-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
The impact of coronavirus on the drug market
The impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global coronavirus pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health services and nearly collapsed, and restrictions imposed by Governments have caused serious disruptions in the global economy.
For drug markets, the impact of the pandemic is unclear and difficult to predict, but it has the potential to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers are unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions and may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and provision may change, and governments' ability to respond may be hampered.
The transformation brought about by COVID is unprecedented, but there are some lessons to be learned from previous crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began looking for cheaper synthetic substances, and their use patterns shifted to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.
If governments respond in the same way to the current economic downturn, interventions such as drug use prevention and related risk behaviours and treatment services could be hit hard.
In addition, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be given less priority, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Drug trafficking is expected to be most directly affected by large quantities of drugs smuggled through commercial flights in some countries.
Messengers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. With restrictions on air passenger transport imposed almost everywhere, the use of commercial air travel to supply drugs could be completely disrupted.
While international postal supply chains have also been disrupted, the use of the dark web and the mailing of goods for trafficking is likely to increase.
In the long run, the economic downturn and related lockdowns could disrupt the drug market.
As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunity, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, suffer from drug use disorders, and turn to illegal drug-related activities, whether produced or transported.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable populations and recruit new members to grow their ranks.
As governments become less able to respond, these shifts could quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities.
Expansion and complexity
Market growth
The population growth pattern partly explains the market expansion
Drug abuse has been increasing around the world, both in terms of overall figures and the proportion of drug abusers in the world's population.
An estimated 210 million drug users were in 2009, representing 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018 there were an estimated 269 million drug users, or 5.3% of this population.
Over the past two decades, drug abuse in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
To some extent, this reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, which was 7% in developed countries and 28% in developing countries, but also reflects the relatively rapid growth of young populations in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group grew by 16 per cent in developing countries, while it decreased by 10 per cent in developed countries.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets
Drug abuse is higher in urban areas than in rural areas, in both developed and developing countries.
The overall increase in drug abuse is partly due to large-scale rural-urban migrations—more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, up from 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization could be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends were more pronounced.
Increases in wealth were associated with increased drug abuse, but the poorest people who bear the greatest burden of disease worldwide were more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly linked to wealthier parts of the world.
Similarly, within countries, drug abuse prevalence is higher among the wealthier segments of society.
However, the higher rates of conversion to drug use disorders are among people of lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a few countries indicate a link between harmful patterns of drug abuse and conditions and low income.
These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints caused by the global coronavirus crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked to an increase in drug use in the past, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.
The pandemic may lead to more farmers growing illicit crops, either because the national authorities have less control over them, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities during the economic crisis.
Coronavirus-related restrictions have reduced air and land traffic, and maritime trafficking may have increased as a result, with a low risk of interdiction at sea and more than smuggling by air or land.
There have recently been reports of cocaine shipments travelling directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but potentially harmful new opioids are increasing and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of pharmaceuticals is also increasing rapidly.
The domestic market of Member States is about 500 new active substances per year.
Most of these are currently stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and small amounts of opioids.
While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
In 2014, opioids accounted for only 2% of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified, but by 2018 this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in opioids are analogues of fentanyl, and their efficacy and harmfulness have been demonstrated, leading to overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as a dopant for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or in the manufacture of counterfeit medicinal opioids.
There is some evidence that new psychoactive stimulants are also injected in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that excitate their effects"
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly present among vulnerable groups
A single class of new psychoactive substances almost never forms a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported on the use of novel psychoactive substances in prisons, with most identifying synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
The control of precursor chemicals had forced drug producers to innovate, and many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors for the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and "ecstasy" had been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and producers have been looking for alternatives — not only loosely regulated substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, so-called "purpose-built precursors".
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus are likely to further squeeze producers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico shows that this is already a reality: in March 2020, a reported shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia drove higher methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate markets in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appear to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation had decreased by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use had dropped significantly.
But the doping market seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methoxyephedrone and a-pyrrolidinylvalerone, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported a sharp rise in the number of recently seized clandestine laboratories for the manufacture of various illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years, to 152 in 2018.
The methamphetamine market is growing in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become a major cause for concern in addition to fenataline and tramadol.
These findings were further confirmed by a 2015 study in which drug users said marijuana was harder to obtain than "fenataline" or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities had discovered a number of methamphetamine processing sites, and the Board had expressed concern about the large import of pseudoephedrine preparations by one methamphetamine processing site as a precursor.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacturing appears to have begun in 2014.
Since then, methamphetamine seizures have been steadily increasing.
However, seizures in the first half of 2019 amounted to one^657 kg – a significant increase compared to the previous year.
The large seizures of methamphetamine, believed to originate in Afghanistan, in other countries also indicate that production in that country is rising rapidly.

Most jurisdictions where non-medical cannabis use has been legalized have a trend towards increased cannabis use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.
In Colorado and Washington, the first two U.S. states to pass legislation, non-medical marijuana use by adults has increased, particularly in the past month and on a daily or near-daily basis, exceeding the national average since 2012.
All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, with almost doubling last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of cannabis.
Canada's short-term data also shows that the legal market expanded in 2018-2019 as well as usage increased.
However, 40% of cannabis users still obtained certain products from illegal sources in 2019.
The reason behind the collapse in global cannabis herb seizures is the legalization of cannabis?
In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a decline in seizures in North America, which has fallen by 84% over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect, and the effect of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances is still difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence of new psychoactive substance use.
In other countries, the adoption of domestic legislation has led to a decrease in the use of new psychoactive substances.
Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illicit drug markets, and pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care are widely available in high-income countries and are unevenly distributed across regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88% of the global population but consume less than 10% of medicinal opioids.
Barriers to access to medicinal opioids are linked to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug use disorders, with some 35.6 million people living with drug use disorders in 2018.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization can increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is confirmed by studies in high-income countries, where individuals' adverse socioeconomic trajectories are not only associated with their status at a certain point in time, but also with drug use risk disorders.
Drug abuse also exacerbates socio-economic disadvantage and further increases the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus contributing to a vicious circle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to humiliating attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexually diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disasters and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug abuse or have problems accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of years of healthy life lost due to disability and premature death, harmful drug use has exacerbated its wider social impact over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, the number of years of disability-adjusted life (DALYs) attributed to drug use increased by 17% globally.
The increase in disability-adjusted life expectancy for liver cancer, which is common among injecting drug users, from untreated hepatitis C to liver cancer was particularly high – 40 per cent.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex, and it is difficult to establish all causal links between psychoactive substance use and violence.
Limited data worldwide suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But alcohol appears to play a greater role than drugs in violent incidents.
While drug use can lead to crime, in some cases this link can be attributed in part to a variety of mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is manifold.
If stable criminal structures exist, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, are likely to be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not so much on the volume of trafficking as on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
Latest trends
Drug marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful
An estimated 192 million people used cannabis in 2018, making it the most used drug globally.
By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
But the harms associated with opioids are overlooked by the fact that they are fewer users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66 percent were caused by these substances, and 50 percent of the 21 million life years believed to be lost for disability, or premature death from drug use.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that exacerbates the opioid crisis; In North America, it's fentanyl. The two regions have little in common economically, demographically, or general drug use patterns, but both struggle with the opioid crisis fuelled by readily available and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, albeit at lower numbers.
Part of the reason for overdose deaths is the unpredictable efficacy of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.
In West, Central and North Africa, the market for tramadol for non-medical uses has grown substantially.
In this region, an increasing number of patients are receiving treatment for tramadol use conditions.
In 2017, the amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tonnes.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.
The crisis has contributed to the simplicity and low cost of production, as well as the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
The crises in both regions are exacerbated by the availability of these substances on both drug and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
Doping use is increasing
The stimulants sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their use in their major markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is prevalent in North America and Western Europe.
Some 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most available indicators, the use of methamphetamine has been expanding in both regions over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes as substitutes for each other, so that the use of one drug increases and the use of the other decreases, sometimes increasing and decreasing at the same time to meet demand in the same market.
The coronavirus increases the risk of injecting drug users
An estimated 11.3 million people injected drug use in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV and 5.5 million people suffer from hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of them from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most people who injected drugs remained untreated.
5 Opioid shortages caused by COVID restrictions may result in users replacing them with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or mixing opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful ways of using them may occur.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU officials: step-by-step bottleneck in the reception process - Chinanews.com
EU summit squabbles over refugee policy, EU officials: there are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process
According to Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The EU's move is reportedly a response to Europe's growing concerns about illegal immigration, which today has a central problem of the small number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be repatriated.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders with means such as infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU has squabbled with member states over issues such as the payment of fencing fees.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not pay for them.
But diplomats in some member states say that if the EU can share the installation of cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along external borders, it will free up national budgets to speed up the construction process.
EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, that limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting "myriad" asylum claims across the EU, and that the EU's refugee reception system is in a near-"permanent crisis".
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries can repatriate illegal immigrants based on a court decision of another member state.
In addition, EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a safe state," which would open the way for the EU to develop a common list.

The United States upgraded the "chip war" to hit the global semiconductor industry hard-Chinanews.com
Recently, the United States' "chip war" against China has greatly escalated - first, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to start the control of the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China under pressure from the United States; Later, foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting off all contact between US suppliers and Huawei, and prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; The Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese tech sectors... Soon after the beginning of 2023, the United States has continued to make vicious moves to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped cracking down on the development of China's "core", while accurately suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain in China, while building a "de-Chinese" semiconductor industry chain alliance, in an attempt to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to win over South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or to establish a chip "quadripartite alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a "small circle" of the semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework" of the United States, Japan, India and Australia, the United States introduces politicization, camp and weaponization into the semiconductor industry in an attempt to build a closed production and supply chain cycle led by the United States, thereby making up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintaining its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the "core tactics" of the United States against China with great fanfare are also "wounded by a thousand enemies and self-inflicted damage by eight hundred."
Recently, Lam Research, a well-known US chip manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that it will lay off 1,300 full-time employees due to the latest round of the ban on the export of chip manufacturing equipment to China, and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
Global lithography giant ASML Holding in the Netherlands recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
US media analysis, after the US government carried out a brutal suppression of China's chip and semiconductor industries, many American companies suffered from it, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a closely connected global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, based on the professional division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process reaches 100 days.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, its manufacturing capabilities, especially advanced process technology, are relatively weak and rely heavily on East Asia.
Even if the United States strives to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the regionalization of the "small circle" led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.
The United States has strongly "reshaped" the "de-Chinese" semiconductor industry chain and severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of all countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the Innovation and Competition Act, the American COMPETES Act of 2022, and the Chip and Science Act, using scientific and technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership; To the allies, "Enwei and Shi", induce Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturing companies to set up factories in the United States, and strive to ensure the global leadership of the United States in the field of chips.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and reaped practical benefits.
However, in the long run, the United States' hysterical suppression has forced China's chip industry to continue to break through, making itself lose the huge Chinese market, which will eventually greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The remaining new product is "Postage Wealth Tianyi Hongjin Shortest Holding 1095 Days No. 1", which is also a fixed income product, which began to be raised on February 10 and ended on February 19, with a risk level of Level 2.
Among the two existing products, one is the 360-day scientific and technological innovation RMB wealth management product of ABC Wealth Management, which is hybrid in nature and has a risk level of 3.
Another surviving product is "Postal Bank Wealth Tianyi Hongjin Shortest Holding 365 Days No. 1", fixed income type, which began to be raised on December 30 last year, officially operated on January 4 this year, and the cumulative net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Individual Pensions", the financial products that can be invested in personal pension fund accounts include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public funds, etc.
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products was launched, marking that individual pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Individual Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies."
The Measures stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, individual pension insurance products, individual pension public fund products and other personal pension products through individual pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice clarifying that the individual pension system will be implemented in 36 pilot cities and regions, including Beijing and Tianjin, as well as Shijiazhuang, Xiong'an New Area and Jincheng City in Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, there were 19.54 million individual pension participants, 6.13 million contributors, and a total contribution amount of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only listed three types of products: personal pension savings, individual pension insurance products and individual pension public funds.
Nowadays, after personal pension financial products are also gathered, how should investors choose?
Experts from the R&D Department of BOCOM Wealth Management Products said that compared with other personal pension products, the pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products in the pilot stage have three characteristics.
The first is robustness, the risk management mechanism is more sound, the investment strategy and concept are more stable, and the implementation of third-party independent custody of the non-parent bank.
The second is long-term, the term of pension financial products in the pilot stage is 5 years and above, and the shortest holding period of personal pension financial products issued in the next step is 1 year in principle, and it is encouraged to hold for more than 3 years.
The third is inclusiveness, the product purchase threshold is low, the starting point is generally 1 yuan, some as low as 0.01 yuan, the product custody fee, management fee and other rates are more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long term, higher interest rate and high security, which is suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; Individual pension insurance products focus on protection, which is more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable income; Personal pension financial products and public fund products do not guarantee capital or income, there are certain investment risks, but the expected returns are high, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk-bearing ability.

The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust - Chinanews.com
Another big gym "Thunderstorm"?
Recently, the issue of protecting the rights of members of Zhongjian Fitness in well-known fitness institutions has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally, and subsequently, rumors about the collapse of the institution caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of public security and human resources and social security departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the institution responded and promised to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the turmoil was calmed down.
Some stores of some fitness institutions have business problems and are temporarily closed, consumers can be calm and wait for the problem to be solved, why is the first reaction of many members is "something is not good"?
Behind the storm of health club members' rights protection is the deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and "making money that users do not come" is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and constantly opening new stores seems to be able to repeat itself, but in fact, it is impossible to form a stable profit model.
Negative information in industries such as gym runs is frequently reported, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of market prospects, gyms are certainly a good business with "money".
The fitness track, despite its ups and downs, has always received capital attention.
A number of data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to recover.
Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards, the concept of healthy life is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and the development of the fitness industry is promising.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption, just came out of the crisis, and sounded the clarion call to open up territory, and invested financing funds in the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that in recent years, affected by the epidemic, many institutions have withdrawn, the industry has been reshuffled, and powerful enterprises have selectively increased their acquisition efforts and rearranged at this time, which is not a new opportunity.
However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle and move up the road of stability and long-term prosperity, the industry must change the traditional model and change the business strategy.
Only by steadily and steadily re-establishing consumers' trust and sense of security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared with building new stores to seize the market, the fitness industry currently needs to sink down to optimize services and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, rely on service to retain users.
Gym belongs to the service industry, its essence is to adhere to "user orientation", to closely focus on user needs, to focus on service quality upgrade.
Second, digital transformation is needed to improve user experience.
For example, the popular Internet gym model realizes user pay-per-use and venue selection.
At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively used, and social needs can be met to achieve a complete service closed loop from online to offline.
Without personal training sales, no huge annual passes, users' worries about the "running away" of fitness institutions are reduced, and trust is improved.
In addition, we must actively explore diversified business formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scene consumption, fitness clubs are expected to become a new entrance to consumption, and peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment required for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with richer choices.

Buy expensive and return the difference!
Nanjing property market reproduces "price difference compensation"-Chinanews.com
Yangtze Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangtze Evening News/Purple Cow News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the "price insurance agreement" that has not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing property market, and a real estate project located in Jiangbei New District claims that the "price difference compensation", before the handover of other listings, the discount is greater than the previous discount, and the developer is willing to change houses for buyers and refund the difference.
There are quite a few conditions for a "price insurance agreement"
The property in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai, and Mr. Sun, a house watcher, told reporters that he found a "statement" while visiting the property last weekend.
The picture he sent to reporters shows that the developer of the real estate promises that if the property is purchased between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the sales contract between the two parties to the delivery of the corresponding listing, if the discount of other listings in the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous purchase (limited to other unsold commercial houses belonging to the same type, the same building, the same unit, and the same property type as the commercial house), the developer can exchange houses for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the property consultant said that this is actually a "price insurance agreement", the purpose of which is to let buyers feel at ease, do not have to worry about the development company's price reduction promotion, "now I am afraid that after buying it, I will reduce the price, go to the sales office to make trouble, there is no time, if you do not make trouble, it is indeed comfortable."
There are also many buyers who believe that although the "price insurance agreement" is giving buyers a "reassuring pill", the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a just-needed house in Jiangbei, said that the insured housing must first be the same type, but also in the same building and the same unit, and there are few houses that buyers can compare prices with, so the "threshold" is still quite high.
Some buyers believe that due to information asymmetry, additional concessions are not ruled out when selling, and it is not easy for buyers to "protect their rights".
It remains to be seen whether it will be possible to retain buyers
The reporter inquired on Nanjing online real estate and learned that the property was sold in November last year for a total of 252 houses in the two buildings, with a unit area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average price of full decoration sales was 39,843 yuan / ㎡.
However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the property is currently 157 units, accounting for 62.3%, of which Building 8 has a total of 128 units, the number of unsold units reaches 113 sets, and 44 sets of 124 units in Building 7 are also unsold, and the total number of completed units of the project is only 33 sets, accounting for only 13%.
According to market sources, the "price insurance agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate project on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched the "Price Insurance Plan" in order to attract the attention of buyers, the specific content of which was "the company solemnly promises that if the preferential range of the project is expanded within one year, the company will refund the difference to the old owner according to the difference".
Since then, in April 2011, 9 real estate projects in Nanjing have taken out some listings and promised to "pay the difference".
"The property market is picking up, and at this time, a 'booster' is needed.
Mr. Shen, a senior trader in Nanjing's real estate industry, said that the "price insurance agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate enterprises.
He believes that developers need confidence more than buyers, and the introduction of "price insurance agreements" is actually encouraging them.
As for whether it can retain buyers, he said that it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, and it remains to be seen for now.
A number of data recession Taiwan's economy began the year with poor performance-Chinanews.com
Taipei, Feb. 11 (Xinhua) -- Export trade volume is "five blacks", the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) has tightened for seven consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has seen "three characters"... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
According to expert analysis, Taiwan's economy began the year with poor performance and growth pressure was not small.
According to the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year amounted to $31.51 billion, down 21.2 percent year-on-year, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
Exports of 11 major export categories declined compared to the same period last year.
Plastic rubber and its products and optical equipment fell the most, down 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components fell by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits decreased by 18.3% year-on-year, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, director of the department's statistics department, said that this shows that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry has spread, and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports fell in January, with an excess of only US$2.34 billion, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the global terminal demand has decreased, the industrial adjustment of inventories has inhibited manufacturers' willingness to buy materials, and it is difficult to see an improvement in the short-term export decline, and Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.
According to Taiwan's Chung Hua Institute of Economic Research, Taiwan's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) in January this year was 40.4% seasonally adjusted, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, tightening for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring index system, the PMI is 50% as the glory and dry line, and the index is greater than 50%, which represents economic expansion, and vice versa.
Among the five components of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and labor employment tightened, supplier delivery times declined, and inventories tightened.
All six major industries reported PMI contraction, with the power and machinery and equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optical industry (35.2%), chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation industry (42.6%) and food and textile industry (45.7%) in order of tightening rate.
In terms of prices, the "Comptroller's Office" of the Taiwan authorities announced that the annual growth rate of Taiwan's CPI in January this year was 3.04%, and it has broken through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special member of Taiwan's "General Accounting Office", said frankly that the price increase in vegetable prices did exceed expectations, excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, and inflationary pressure still exists and is still at a high point.
Looking forward to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism based on media reports on the island such as Lianhe Pao and Yahoo Finance.
Wu Daren, a professor at the Department of Economics of Taiwan's "Central University", analyzed that the export recession may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing manufacturers, and the risk of debt default will increase.
At the same time, the reduction in orders has led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn affects consumption capacity.
Chiu Tat-seng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that this year's inflation situation in Europe and the United States is unresolved, demand continues to shrink, and it is expected that Taiwan's export recession will continue to the first half of the year.
As Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, due to the impact of sluggish exports, the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.
"An important engine of global recovery" - Chinanews.com
"In response to the impact of the new crown epidemic, China's economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations show that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
Julio Ríos, a well-known Spanish expert on China and honorary advisor of China Policy Observation Network, said in an interview with this reporter a few days ago that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has calmly responded with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China unswervingly expands its opening up, the endogenous driving force of economic development continues to increase, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises develop in a coordinated manner.
Every year, the National People's Congress of China and the National People's Congress are held, and the deputies and members discuss the country's development plans and hot issues of people's livelihood, extensively condensing consensus, people's hearts and wisdom, and adding strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and has now entered a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to China's wisdom and solutions, and that China's development will bring new opportunities to the world.
At present, China is fully promoting scientific and technological innovation to inject new impetus into economic and social development, "capital investment, talent training, policy incentives, which make China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan."
In Ríos' view, economic restructuring is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has brought into play not only the advantages of the market economy but also the superiority of the socialist system, and adopted proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic base point of expanding domestic demand, increase financial support for the real economy, support the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing, adhere to innovative development, promote employment, improve the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meet the multi-level and diversified consumption needs of the people... China's complete, accurate and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, focusing on promoting high-quality development and building a new development pattern will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"Economic stabilization and recovery after the epidemic is the common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
Rios said that he expects the cooperation to jointly build the "Belt and Road" to continue to play its important role in improving the infrastructure level of various countries and strengthening the connectivity of various fields, and continue to release greater momentum.

China's e-commerce industry has emerged "new variables", how to achieve "content is king" with goods?
- Chinanews.com
Chinanews.com, February 11 Question: China's e-commerce industry has emerged "new variables", how to bring goods to achieve "content is king"?
Zhongxin financial reporter Xia Bin
"We were late to e-commerce, but we realized from the beginning that content was important if we wanted to stand out from thousands of stores.
Fangfang, a "post-90s" girl from Guangdong, now runs a nourishing ingredient store on Douyin e-commerce, allowing an offline store with a history of more than 30 years to "bloom" online.
Imitate the tune of the old Hong Kong film, accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, open the @Fangfang One Food Douyin account, and the beautiful video is refreshing.
At the recently held Douyin e-commerce "Find Companions - High-quality Content Sharing Session", Fang Fang, as a representative of high-quality creators, spoke at the scene and introduced her daily creation experience and experience.
She said at the scene: "The carefully polished video has attracted the attention of many netizens, and many people are interested in my family's ingredients and want to make food together, and the sales channel suddenly opened."
”
Fang Fang relied on the soup video to make more people fall in love with the "taste of Lao Guang", selling up to 300,000 nutritious ingredients in a live broadcast, saving the old store that was on the verge of bankruptcy.
"No content, no e-commerce", with the continuous development of short video and live broadcast e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early days of the development of live streaming goods, live broadcast rooms often attracted users with low-price discounts, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at that time.
In recent years, there are not only phenomenal big Vs such as Liu Genghong and Oriental Selection, but also many unknown experts and merchants in vertical segments, who continue to create high-quality content in line with their own brand tonality to improve long-term business efficiency.
Gao Yaxuan, head of Douyin e-commerce star author operations, said that 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Douyin e-commerce in the past year, and their content creation has increased by 252%, and the total turnover has more than doubled.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving and vigorous author ecology.
Gao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecological Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of high-quality content, the "new variable" in the current e-commerce industry, from the data dimension, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the content ecological health index ranking of the e-commerce industry in the above report, Douyin e-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com ranked in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, is to integrate e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce, good PGC (professionally produced content) and UGC (user-generated content) is a high-quality carrier for integration with e-commerce, the higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, the stronger the commercial value. The proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption that is gradually integrated and distributed between the public and private sectors will be higher.
At the scene, Yu Guoming, professor of the School of Journalism and Communication of Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, analyzed and interpreted the Report.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumption accessibility" to "consumption quality" stage, and high-quality, professional and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and starting point for the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payment, professional knowledge, and KOLs (key opinion leaders) have begun to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of e-commerce content ecology from the perspective of content structure improvement, create positive content creation and management standards, and achieve the content ecological health system index and dynamic balance of the e-commerce industry.
The other is from the perspective of the external ecology, to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
"In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more data and artificial intelligence support to form a prediction of future development stability; In addition, it provides merchants with more standardized and healthy growth space, realizes the value synergy of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and creates a healthy content ecology.

Beijing, 11 Feb (Xinhua) -- Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project -- the four theses profoundly understand General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress
Xinhua News Agency commentator
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project, which requires overall planning, systematic planning, and overall promotion, and correctly handles a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and strategy, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up.
"At the opening ceremony of the seminar for new members and alternate members of the Central Committee and major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to study and implement Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era and the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the law of modernization, deeply and systematically elaborated a series of major relationships that need to be handled well in practice, and provided us with a scientific methodology for vigorously promoting Chinese-style modernization."
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves economic, political, cultural, social, ecological civilization and other fields, and is related to the management of the party, the country, the military, internal affairs, foreign affairs, national defense and other aspects.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to have a deep insight into the general trend of world development, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, deeply explore the law of economic and social development, and make the formulated planning and policy system reflect the times, grasp the regularity, be creative, and achieve the integration of far and near, the top and bottom are connected, and the content is coordinated.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are still many unknown areas, which need to be boldly explored in practice, and promote the development of the cause through reform and innovation.
The strategic issue is a fundamental issue for a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to enhance the forward-looking strategy, foresee and lead the future with a scientific strategy; It is necessary to enhance the overall nature of the strategy, focusing on solving major issues related to the success or failure of the cause of the party and the country, and affecting the whole body; It is necessary to enhance the stability of the strategy, and once the strategy is formed, it must be persisted in for a long time, grasped to the end, and done well.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical unity relationship between strategy and tactics, organically combine the principles of strategy with the flexibility of strategy, be flexible and flexible, adapt to changes, make decisions at the moment, and grasp the strategic initiative in adapting measures to local conditions, moving according to the situation, and acting according to the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation that abides by integrity and innovation.
To properly handle the relationship between integrity and innovation, we must not only guard the origin and source, root and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, and ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, but also put innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, conform to the development requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively identify and adapt to changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, constantly shape new momentum and new advantages for development, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation for fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only create higher efficiency than capitalism, but also more effectively safeguard social fairness, and better realize the balance, promotion and unity of efficiency and fairness.
We should properly handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness, continuously realize that development is for the people, development depends on the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization will benefit all the people more and more fairly.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both dynamic and stable and orderly.
It is necessary to make overall plans for the two major affairs of development and security, implement the overall concept of national security, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to maintain national security, and firmly safeguard the security of state power, system, ideology and key areas.
It not only gives more consideration to security factors in development, enhances national security strength through development, and uses development achievements to consolidate the foundation of national security, but also is good at creating a security environment conducive to economic and social development, constantly stimulating development vitality, and achieving a benign interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only adhere to our own path, but also expand the world's vision, adhere to opening up to the outside world, and constantly expand the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must persist in independence, self-reliance and self-improvement, persist in placing the development of the country and the nation on the basis of our own strength, and persist in firmly grasping the destiny of China's development and progress in our own hands.
It is necessary to continuously expand high-level opening up, deeply participate in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit and win-win results.
Only by following the path can we go far.
Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and under the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, let us grasp the law, act resolutely, give full play to our enthusiasm, initiative and creativity, correctly handle a series of major relationships, work the new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way, and constantly open up a new realm of Chinese-style modernization.
The Biden administration blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of being involved in Chinese the spy balloon program this Friday (February 10).
The Commerce Department said the five Chinese companies and one research institute helped modernize China's military, especially aerospace programs, including airships and aircraft.
Blacklisted companies have difficulty accessing U.S. technology exports.
The list is called an "entity list," and companies on the list will not be able to buy technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they have a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., the 48th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
That comes after the White House said it was considering broader measures to "expose and handle" China's larger surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident sparked further tensions between China and the United States, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken canceling a trip to China.
When the United States shot down the balloon on February 4, the Chinese government lodged solemn representations with the US Embassy in China, criticizing the United States for seriously impacting and damaging the efforts and process of stabilizing Sino-US relations.
From the available evidence of wreckage and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon was "directly related to the People's Liberation Army" and was an approved supplier by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a news conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and stated its position on the accidental incident of a Chinese unmanned civilian airship mistakenly entering US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, she added that the relevant resolutions of the US Congress are pure political manipulation and hype.
China is strongly dissatisfied with and resolutely opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce, said: "Today's action demonstrates our joint efforts to identify and deter China's use of spy balloons that violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
”
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co. said he was not aware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not commented on this information.

Days after earthquakes struck parts of Turkey and Syria Chinese, there is little hope of finding survivors, but the rescue of a family of five rescued on Saturday is a source of great relief.
In the hardest-hit town of Nurdayi in Gaziantep province, the family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under rubble for more than five days, according to the Associated Press.
Search and rescue crews first pulled the mother and daughter from a pile of rubble and then found the father, but he insisted that his son and another daughter be saved first.
When they were all rescued, cheers rang out from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued under harsh cold weather conditions.
"What day is it?
The teenager, who had been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours, asked the search and rescue workers who rescued him after being brought back to the ground.

The miraculous rescue success has brought a glimmer of hope to the already hopeless search and rescue effort, but at the same time, the number of victims is rising.
Monday's quake has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey and is estimated at more than 3,500 in neighboring Syria, according to official statistics.
While experts say people can survive more than a week after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imagers to look for signs of life beneath the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of relief efforts has shifted to helping survivors in desperate need.
UN official: A disaster "unseen in a century" in the region
Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, told a news conference in Turkey that the quake was "the worst disaster in a century" in the region.
He also praised Turkey's post-disaster response as "extraordinary."
He also told Reuters that he hoped to provide aid to areas controlled by the Syrian government and opposition, but added that the matter was "not yet clear."
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief donations to people affected by the earthquake in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations had announced $25 million for disaster relief in Turkey and Syria.

South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Ju-ae first appeared in public on November 18 last year, the probability of exposure has been increasing in the past three months, and it has appeared on an official occasion for the fifth time.
North Korean state media used extremely high honorific titles such as dearest children and honorable children when referring to Kim Ju Ai, and also broadcast clips of Kim Ju Ai repeatedly shouting to the death to support the bald blood as he overlooked the parade march from the stands.
These signs have made the outside world wonder whether Kim Ju-ae has been internally designated as the heir to the Kim regime, and the Washington Post analysis believes that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un will push his middle-school-aged daughter to the position of successor", but there are also views that such a judgment is still premature, and there are still various possibilities in the case of Kim Jong-un having a son under his knees.
Chongyang Q&A—How to view the US non-farm payrolls data in January exceeded expectations and future trends - Economic Observer Network - Professional financial news website
Q: How do you view the US non-farm payrolls data in January exceeding expectations and future trends?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released non-farm payrolls data for January 2023, adding 517,000 non-farm payrolls, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; Hourly earnings grew 4.4% year-over-year and 0.3% month-on-month, slowing slightly.
From the total point of view, there are many one-time and technical factors in this data, such as the return of teachers and staff from strike, the revision of the survey statistical caliber, and the update of the seasonal adjustment factor, which may be revised in the future (referring to the new non-farm payrolls revised down from 504,000 to 364,000 in January 2022), and non-farm payrolls may not be as strong as the data reflects.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low; New jobs in high-touch service industries such as leisure and hospitality, education and health care have rebounded sharply, and the data shows that the labor gap in the service industry still exists.
Combined with the recovery in the same better-than-expected services PMI, job openings and labor gap data and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US services sector has ushered in a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
In our view, the tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market is unlikely to improve without a recession.
At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million yuan in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is slowly rising, especially the labor force participation rate for 25-54 years old is close to the pre-epidemic high.
In addition, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit in the United States, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of tightening on the job market.
The continued tight supply and demand in the US job market will be the background color of the US economy in 2023.
Coupled with the fact that the end of the interest rate hike is nearing and inflation expectations are constantly repeating, we are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before the release of this data, the US stock and bond exchange market was too optimistic about the Fed's interest rate hike path.
As inflation data continues to improve, the Fed has shortened the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining a fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statements, not only expecting to stop raising interest rates early, but also expecting two rate cuts at the end of the year.
In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance for interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some harm to the market.
Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-leading indicators, since October the US CPI data has turned to a rapid decline stage, the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a foundation for future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.
Shanshan founder Zheng Yonggang passed away due to sudden heart disease and led the transformation of China's first garment stock - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website
Economic Observation Network Reporter Zheng Huixin On February 11, the WeChat public account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") released an obituary that Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment of sudden heart disease.
In the 80s of last century, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of the state-owned cotton spinning factory, and with the transfer, in 1989 Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment General Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Future Stars of Chinese Enterprises, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 90s of last century, the market share of the Shanshan brand was as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan shares (600884. SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's garment industry.
Just when the clothing business was in full swing, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market, and Shanshan Suit wants to always lead the way, and it is unlikely that it will become the national uniform of Chinese people for a long time".
In 1999, Shanshan began to study enterprise transformation, and Zheng Yonggang recalled, "We came to Shanghai, looking for what the transformation did, and specially found many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and retreat seminars.
In the end, we set two broad strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that great health has a future."
After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation, at that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute for Angang supporting the carbon research institute was doing the national 863 project, scientific research funds were not enough, so Shanshan and Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "mesophase carbon microspheres" project, engaged in the research and development, production and sales of anode materials, and realize the commercial promotion of anode materials in China.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. realized the large-scale production of mesophase carbon microspheres and began to replace it locally, replacing Japan as the main supplier of mesophase carbon microspheres in China.
This is the first lithium-ion battery anode material manufacturer in China, and has realized the localization of lithium-ion battery anode materials.
With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. began to develop gradually, in 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into the main business of Shanshan Co., Ltd., and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year, until 2013, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s lithium battery material business income fully exceeded the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer enterprise Shanjin Optoelectronics, which has a relatively high technical content in this field, and Shanshan's main competitors are the world's top 500, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, "China's private enterprises acquire some international high-tech enterprises, the probability of success is relatively low, why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will think about it, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, right, this is an act that is usually done", but Zheng Yonggang is different, the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan Zheng, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanjin Optoelectronics to announce in public that Shanshan as the major shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise and two systems, except for Zheng Yonggang as the chairman, the people of Shanshan enterprise are not sent to Shanjin, and the original distribution system, corporate culture, various management and other models remain unchanged.
ICC Xinlu Information released 2022 negative electrode data shows that the shipment volume of Shanshan anode in 2022 will exceed 200,000 tons, a year-on-year increase of 100%, the market share will reach 16%, and the shipment of artificial graphite anode materials will continue to rank first.
In terms of polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the company's Shanjin Optoelectronics has a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, and its net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, and on February 10, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s share price was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan Co., Ltd. said on the interactive platform that at the end of 2022, the effective graphitization capacity of the company will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphitization capacity of the Meishan project is still climbing.
Wande shows that Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan Shares.
Tianyan investigation shows that Zheng Yonggang's total equity interest in Shanshan Holdings Limited is 40.1%.
The general manager of Shanshan Co., Ltd. is Li Zhihua, born in 1968, and has successively served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.
Shanshan said on the investor interactive platform on February 10 that the company's senior management has no kinship with the company's actual controller.
"Fund E Account" is coming: China Securities Regulatory Commission authorizes the development of all funds under the investor's name to achieve aggregation and inquiry - Economic Observation Network - Professional financial news website
Economic Observation Network Reporter Chen Shan Fund purchase channels are complicated, resulting in account information aggregation is not easy?
Always forget about the "little vault"?
These problems of the Christian people are about to be resolved.
On February 10, the China Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the "Fund E Account" APP was launched on various mobile app stores and carried out public trial operation.
According to reports, the "Fund E Account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" inquiry service for public fund account and share information, aiming to solve the pain points of industry services such as forgetting accounts and cumbersome inquiries for the majority of small and medium-sized investors.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, with a fund size of about 26 trillion yuan; There are 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
The account systems of each share registration institution are independent of each other, and there is no unified inquiry channel for the industry.
Some industry insiders said that at the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China, that is, half of the country's people invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to inquire about purchases through different sales institutions, but through the "Fund E Account" they could inquire about the purchase of all sales channels, and the holding of funds was clear at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" app?
According to relevant documents, the "Fund E Account" APP is a mobile application for the public fund industry portal developed and constructed by China Clearing with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which can provide investors with one-stop inquiry of the over-the-counter share holdings of public fund products in the whole market.
Through the "Fund E Account", investors can conveniently and quickly grasp the holdings of the over-the-counter shares of each fund manager's public fund products purchased through various sales channels in the whole market, and comprehensively improve the efficiency of inquiry.
Specifically, the information that investors can inquire through the "Fund E Account" includes: fund account information opened with public fund managers in the whole market, trading account information opened with public fund sales institutions, and over-the-counter share holdings of products including publicly offered securities investment funds and collective asset management plans with a number of investors established and managed by securities companies that are not limited to 200.
Liu Yiqian, head of business of Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation and Research Center, told the Economic Observation Network reporter that investors can get all their over-the-counter public fund holdings through the "Fund E Account" App in one stop, help them recover "forgotten assets", and more importantly, realize the collection of comprehensive fund investment information for customers, help customers grasp their own investment situation more timely, accurately and completely, so as to better optimize their fund portfolio allocation and better plan their financial arrangements.
How do I register to use it?
The reporter noted that at present, the "Fund E Account" APP has been listed on the shelves of Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo and other mobile phone app stores, but the APP is still in the public trial operation stage, registration needs to fill in the invitation code, investors can contact the fund manager of the fund held to obtain.
The customer service staff of a medium and large public fund in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to the Economic Observation Network reporter, and told the reporter, "During the trial operation of the APP, China Clearing provided each fund manager with a certain number of invitation codes, and investors will provide them by phone."
After the trial operation is over, open users will not need an invitation code when registering.
”
The reporter registered the account and completed the inquiry according to the relevant documents of the "Fund E Account" download and use instructions published on the official website of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the whole process took only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After passing the real-name authentication step, click the "Asset" fund binding button, and all fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are presented in the binding option list (bindable accounts), and after completing the binding, you can intuitively see the total assets of the invested funds and start using the query function.
It is worth noting that "Fund E Account" only provides inquiry services for investors and cannot be redeemed for trading.
The data date displayed in "Fund E Account" is generally the date of the user's inquiry (T day), which is pushed forward by three trading days.
For example, if you open the "Fund E Account" on February 10, the corresponding date of the total assets, fund shares, and net value of the fund displayed on the asset page is pushed forward three trading days from that date, that is, February 7.

The United States, Japan, and the Philippines reached a defensive consensus with the Anti-Chinese Communists
ASIA – Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan on February 9 for talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's encroachment on the South China Sea and the East China Sea, and the Philippine and Japanese leaders issued a joint statement after the meeting saying that they would sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States to conduct substantive defense exchanges and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishida hopes to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies against the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos Jr. visited China in early January and won a deal worth $20 billion.
But after that, Sino-Philippine relations not only did not improve, but declined.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the US military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
One of the new bases, 300 kilometers from Taiwan, is also the closest to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Macao and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States to build an "arc against the CCP" in the western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, conveyed Song Tao's words during his visit: Under the consensus of '92, the Green Camp is welcome to visit the mainland
Xia Liyan, vice chairman of Taiwan's Chinese Kuomintang, met with Song Tao, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
Zhao Chunshan, senior adviser to the National Affairs Foundation, an official organ of the Kuomintang, was interviewed by Taiwan's Central News Agency yesterday evening and spoke positively of what Song Tao said to Xia Liyan that as long as he agrees with the "consensus of '92" and opposes Taiwan independence, China welcomes green camp figures to visit the mainland.
The Kuomintang side commented that it was a new thing.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao earlier, and the news on the day did not mention this statement.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has clarified for days that it refuses to accept the "consensus of '92."
According to the Central News Agency today, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, led a delegation to visit Lu, and during his stay in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal CPC Committee.
Xia Liyan and Song Tao met and talked about the KMT's political foundation being the "consensus of '92" and opposition to Taiwan independence, and Zhao Chunshan, senior adviser to the KMT's National Affairs Foundation, said at the meeting that the KMT's "consensus of '92" is the original "consensus of '92."
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this is different from the previous meetings.
In recent video discussions with mainland academic circles, as well as this forum, no Taiwan-related scholars were heard talking about military unification and the "anti-separatist law," but instead exchanges and dialogues were resumed.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the soldiers on both sides of the strait are fighting fiercely and Chinese mainland hope to convey their intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the KMT and the CPC, the other side is still willing to do a good job in dealing with the Taiwanese, and the deputies do not want cross-strait relations to be damaged.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao that "you must implement the demands put forward by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen)."
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang visited the mainland and mentioned in person whether Chinese military planes and warships were harassing Taiwan on a daily basis, the agricultural and fishing problems in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, or whether the Central News Agency reporters asked such questions in interviews.
French unions once again mobilized anti-government retirement reform programs
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets and express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action against the draft reform of the government's pension system.
And how many people respond to the rally call could influence the trade union's next course of action.
This is the fourth time in a month that France's eight major trade union groups have jointly launched a national mobilization, and the first time this protest has scheduled a rally for Saturday.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people, they do not have to choose between participating in a protest or a wage strike, so trade unions hope that today's rally will attract more people.
Neither the unions of the bus system, the subway nor the public railway company called for a strike today, and the bus system should be functional, with citizens able to travel to the meeting place, and in areas where schools begin winter break, people can start their holidays normally.
Union groups hope more than a million people will attend the rally today, while police expect national attendance to be between 600,000 and 800,000, and Paris for 90,000 to 120,000.
Since the start of the protests against the government's pension reform plan, polls have shown that most French do not support measures to postpone the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, but the number of people who actually took to the streets to participate in the march has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstrations on January 31 gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people across the country.
The crowd on Tuesday (February 7) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million across the country.
This pension reform package is currently under discussion in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially the opposition caucus led by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendments that have led to the slow pace of the review process.
The debate between the government and the opposition has become increasingly fierce and sharp.
A lawmaker from the radical leftist French Unyielding Party recently posted a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the head of the labor minister on social media, prompting protests by the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly eventually banned the member from parliamentary activities for 15 days as punishment for such acts.
Although the reform package has triggered the largest social upsurge in France in more than 20 years, the government has so far made minor adjustments to the draft without making any major concessions.
The unions are already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, on the 16th, and on March 7, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion, the union also plans to organize demonstrations.
China encourages raising the fertility rate to colleges and universities to urge sperm donations and high quality standards
The Human Sperm Bank in Yunnan Province, China, issued a publicity on the 9th, soliciting people with college degree or above or students to donate sperm, and successful donations 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of RMB 4,500.
According to Taiwan media reports today, the message rushed to Weibo hot search on the same day, and triggered many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing to follow up initiatives.
According to a signed report by the Liberty Times, China encourages college students to donate sperm.
In addition to academic qualifications, it is also required to be more than 170 cm tall, have correct facial features, no obvious hair loss, and the degree of myopia cannot be higher than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Province Human Sperm Bank pointed out that sperm donors can obtain a full set of andrological physical examinations worth 1,000 yuan, "especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never done, which is of great significance to understanding their fertility status."
The conditions for sperm donors include those who are 165 cm tall or above, have a college degree or above, or are studying, and have no genetic and infectious diseases such as color blindness, color weakness, and hepatitis B.
The report quoted China's Tianmu News as saying that the Shaanxi Province Human Sperm Bank was printed with a propaganda poster of "paid sperm donation, infinite glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages to "let love be transmitted".
Shaanxi Province price code is higher than Yunnan, qualified people can receive RMB 300 cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of sperm donations can receive RMB 5,000 subsidy.
The highest known price tag is Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last communist chancellor of East Germany died today
The successor of the Communist Party of East Germany reported in a statement that "last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
As a result, our party lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modero had said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At that time, Communist leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After coming to power in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev called for changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modro announced the first and only free elections for the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
As a result of the election, he was no longer prime minister.
Despite Modero's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reinvent, rather than abolish, the secret police.
In 1993, Modero was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections but was not jailed.
The allegations were said to be politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modro continued to serve in the German Parliament and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modro sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said East Germany's achievements should be acknowledged.
Modero was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader for the youth fire brigade and, towards the end of the conflict, became part of the Nazi militia Volkssturm, which recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final struggles of war.
At the age of 17, Modeso was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the USSR as a prisoner of war, where he took anti-fascist courses and became a staunch communist.
In 1949, the year East Germany was founded, he returned home and found a job as a mechanic and continued to study social sciences and economics, where he received a doctorate.
Modero was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young people in East Germany joined and rose to chair of the Dresden Regional Party between 1973 and 1989 through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED).
He also served as the parliament of East Germany for more than 30 years.
In 1990 Modero became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran Commemorates Revolutionary Anniversary Hackers who supported the protests hacked the president's televised address
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of Iran's revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Raisi's televised address.
The president's live televised speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, with a group of anti-Iranian government hackers with the name "Edalat Ali" on the screen.
A voice also appeared shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic".
According to Reuters reported today, Iran commemorated the anniversary of the revolution, and hackers interrupted state television reports.
Iran's official commemoration of the 44th anniversary of Iran's revolution, Raisi's hardline government faces the boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Raisi still calls on "deceived youth" to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
Nationwide protests swept Iran after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iran's security forces have carried out a deadly crackdown on the protests, one of the strongest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution toppled the 2500-year monarchy.
As part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities on Friday released imprisoned dissidents Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha who were on hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
As of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors, according to human rights group HRANA.
Another 70 government security personnel were killed, the report said.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iran's leaders and state media have called for a vote at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On Friday night's anniversary of the Iranian revolution, state media displayed fireworks as part of a government-sponsored celebration with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!) ）”。
However, many people can also be heard shouting "Death to the dictator!" at the rally!
and "Death of the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in states across the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, domestic anti-ballistic missiles, UAVs, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were presented.
President Lacey's speeches were often punctuated by the slogan "Death to America" — the iconic slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel".
Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, Reuters said, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah denied the allegations.
Mesami's release comes a week after supporters warned he was at risk of death as a result of a hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting the mandatory wearing of a headscarf.
The French Foreign Ministry, in response to Adelkhah's release on Friday, called for her freedom to be restored, "including allowing her to return to France if she wishes."

Balloon incident brightens America's eyes more?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a report by the Wall Street Journal today, the United States is ready to further tighten technology exports to China after the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and would garner more political support for strengthening U.S. technological protection.
The U.S. says the balloon carries antennas and sensors used for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now works for the Center for a New American Security, a Washington-based think tank.
"This is undoubtedly adding fuel to the fire and supporting the views of China hardliners."
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Thursday that "we will also consider broader action to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities that pose a threat to our national security and our allies and partners."
U.S. officials say they have informed governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident and that international coordination is critical to responding to the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the new U.S. House of Representatives Ad Hoc Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party may also pressure the United States to take tougher measures to slow China's development.
She said members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force the White House to adopt tougher policies.
The Wall Street Journal said many advocates of stricter export controls are also pushing for expanded controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also already developing an outbound investment review program to examine U.S. investments abroad for potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House could face calls to roll out the plan sooner.
The Tuxu earthquake relief work day and night
Since the earthquake struck Turkey, which borders Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have worked around the clock in the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings to rescue survivors buried under the rubble.
In icy temperatures, they often call for silence as they desperately try to hear any sounds of life from the dilapidated pile of concrete.
According to Reuters today, two more women were rescued after surviving the rubble of the earthquake for several days.
However, the death toll from the earthquake climbed to 24,150.
Turkey has 20,665 deaths and Syria more than 3,500.
Monday's 7.8-magnitude quake, which continues with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh-deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 31,000 deaths from the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similarly powerful earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years, and rescuers rescued the two women from the rubble of a collapsed building in Turkey.
Another injured, 55-year-old man identified as Masallah Cicek, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, Turkey's largest city.
In the icy temperatures, rescuers often call for silence as they desperately try to hear any life from the dilapidated pile of concrete.
In Turkey's Samandag district, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs and whispered "Inshallah" — "God forbid" — and they carefully put their hands into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old newborn.
His eyes were wide open, and the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a thermal blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video images show that first responders also took away his mother, who was dizzy on a stretcher and pale but sane.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, using a total of 31,000 rescuers in the affected areas.
About 80,000 people are being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people have been left homeless by the earthquake and are crammed into makeshift shelters, he said.
With many people lacking food in cold winter conditions, questions about the response of the leaders of both countries to the disaster relief are growing.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad traveled with his wife Asma to a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly his first trip to the affected area since the quake, according to Syrian state media.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said its stockpile in rebel-held northwestern Syria was running out as the state of war complicated relief efforts.
Erdogan, who visited Turkey's Adyaman province on Friday, acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a vote to be held on May 14 but could be postponed by disaster.
Reuters said anger over delays in providing aid and launching relief efforts could affect the election.
Even before the quake, voting was seen as Erdogan's toughest challenge in his two decades in power.
Erdogan called for solidarity and condemned what he called a "negative campaign for political gain."
Turkey's main opposition leader Kemal Kilidaroglu criticized the government's response.
"Earthquakes are big, but more serious than earthquakes are lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence."

What exactly is the downed "object" over Alaska?
Confused, speculative
On Friday (February 10) afternoon, the U.S. military again used the U.S. most advanced stealth jet F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska, USA.
The shot down site was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the U.S. military has shot down an airborne object.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted over U.S. airspace for days before being destroyed off the coast of South Carolina.
The Pentagon said the second downed object, which first entered U.S. airspace Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeast Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet) about the size of a small car and much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that had been shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no indication that the object is manipulable.
John Bryant, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said Friday that while the exact appearance of the high-altitude object is unclear, it "poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
Bryant said the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
"We call it an 'object' the best we can describe it right now," Bryant said.
President Biden, who listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the shooting down of the object, was "very cautious" in making the decision, Bryant added.
The official description of this object in the United States can be roughly summarized as: the size of a small car, no joystick, no suspension device, and the flight altitude is about 10,000 meters.
But this information doesn't yet answer basic questions, such as what the object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is performing.
At present, many analysis and speculation on the Internet believe that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It may have originated from China like the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that fluttered over Latin America, performing some kind of mission in different locations.
Others associate this "object" in Alaska with a "UFO."
The U.S. Newsweek report quoted former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer as tweeting on Friday as saying, "I wish this UFO was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO."
"The irony of confusing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar conflict," Major said.
Major tweeted shortly after Bryant confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said Major wasn't the only one who suspected the object was a UFO.
Dennessee-Republican Rep. Tim Burchett criticized the administration's cover-up last month, asking the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on "UFOs."
Amazon's customer service attitude made it hard for me to believe
It is estimated that few people have seen this, but I will also say a little bit.
This dress was a zippered hoody when we bought it, and it ended up giving me a short-sleeved one.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service, and at that time it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock, I asked for a replacement, the customer service said to solve it, and then immediately saw that the name of the product changed to short sleeves, and the link I bought was taken off the shelf.
The customer service then informs you to either keep the goods for a certain amount of compensation or return them.
This is how Amazon handles?
It's really unbelievable, the wrong clothes themselves are not my problem, as a consumer I asked for the goods I deserved, and did not make any exaggerated demands, but Amazon changed its name and said that there was no inventory.
This is my first long review, hopefully it's not my last.
Incomprehensible sleeves
Said to be cowhide, it is indeed harder, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the part, it is not clear whether it is genuine leather, in addition, the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible, usually the sleeves of the jacket are longer than the hem, but usually it is 1-2 cm, this dress is 5 cm long, the arms naturally droop should be in the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress are covered by the fingers.
It's easy to buy clothes and easy to return.
But I don't know when to get your money back?
The clothes are good workmanship, because the shape is too small, I have to return it, but after returning the goods, more than a week has passed so far, and I haven't received a refund?
And to the purchaser himself to contact the integrity of the full peak express, this is the worst shopping since buying Amazon items!
But the store is still good, actively cooperate with urging the express to refund in time, but this full peak express real work is quite infuriating, dragging on for about half a month to refund, this kind of partner is to drag Amazon's hind legs, poor work efficiency, no sense of service!
More suitable for young people
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the sweater are good, soft/thin and moderate, and there is no smell of kerosene.
Unfortunately, the fit belongs to the thin type, which is more suitable for young people.
3XL, tiled waist 2'5, stretched max size 4', 1.79/80kg wearing waist a little tight.
It seems that there is no elastic band around the waist, so it is quite difficult to loosen the waistline.
In addition, it is uncomfortable to wear closely.
Very good, the colors are not very vivid
Just bought it and it rose by more than two hundred, what is the situation.
The first time Amazon used the cooperation daily rotten express, the first delivery was not at home, and then took the initiative to make an appointment with the courier twice for delivery, the courier did not deliver, and then directly returned it to me, this damn courier has no integrity at all, it is strongly recommended not to use that daily rotten express again.
This time, there was also a T-shirt that was returned to me, and the price of the auction increased by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon Retail should not have such products
When the product is on sale, the price is not low, and it is also a very good product to read the reviews.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned, the surface of the product was worn in a large area, and there was wear in many other places, either inferior or old, pictured above later.
I apply for a return, and the manufacturer's people say that it was caused by transportation after seeing the picture, isn't this nonsense?
How can the inside of the product wear out?
There are only two possibilities, either the inferior used product, or I deliberately damaged the item and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I have not damaged the goods, but in terms of my credit history of Amazon shopping, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon self-operated goods, customers choose Amazon self-operated is trust, customer win, we win, the victory of customers is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope everyone works together to improve, thank you.
I have been using the product for less than a year and two E2s appear, I don't know how to deal with it?
I bought the product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often appeared red E2, it should be a problem with the transmitter module, which is not very consistent with the Amazon website that the transmitter module can last for 7 years, and I can't find after-sales on Amazon's website, I don't know how to do it now?
It's okay
The first purchase is bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the fuselage was broken.
And it's always a white screen.
It's good after changing.
The exchange is quite fast, a little blurry at night, the viewing angle is not very wide, but the ordinary household is enough.
The disadvantage is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I have bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened, not this time, there is a sticker-like stamp when buying a mobile phone, which can be attached to the warranty card, this time it does not.
I don't know if it's something cheap and no, I'm confused.
Wait for a reply from the supplier
The packaging does not have any logo, call the supplier directly, answer that no logo is genuine, such as suspect that scraps can be mailed to Johnson & Johnson for inspection, but also leave the license plate number and phone number, promise to send a text message notification to enter my information into the Johnson & Johnson official website warranty card, so far have not received a text message?
I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon-operated products are still very reassuring.
The master who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and indeed a good oil.
Because it was purchased for the second time.
So it's still very reassuring.
The courier is fast, there is no fussy place in the packaging, with this oil, the engine sound drops significantly.
The cost performance is good, it is difficult to find synthetic engine oil below 200.
Support Star Crown, support Valvoline, effective car protection.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service problems (8C caterpillars are shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8C=14cm, 8cm=2C)
Admit mistakes, but always prevaricate, always emphasizing that the goods are third parties and cannot bind third parties.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
The page size options I originally purchased were 7c, 8, 9c, and I felt that this was a trap, called Nichia Chinese customer service, and clearly told that 8 is 8c, but when the product returned to China, I found that it was only 8cm, I think this is a deliberate trap to pit Chinese (according to Amazon's after-sales), and now the page has no such option.
Chinese customer service: Sorry for the loss, we will give you two ways:
1. You return the goods, and the buyer bears all the shipping costs.
2. If you do not return, we will compensate you 1000 yen.
(I calculated the account, shoes more than 4,000 yen, counted as 200RMB, choose 1, I don't have shoes, the loss is 200 yuan.)
Option 2, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2000 yen, and finally lost 150RMB Customer service: We have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously, and the next day I sent back an email, saying that I do not accept the Chinese customer service mediation, and that's it.
I proposed: When the purchase page is 7c, 8, 9c such a confusing option, the Chinese customer service helped me say that the Japanese common code will not have a c, similar to 140, but do you go to other caterpillar pages to see?
There are US codes, and the situation of mixed Japanese codes appears.
Besides, why did you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, obviously the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese services, but we don't know that you are going to ship back to China, so we will not claim your freight.
I don't understand this logic, I'm Japanese, I still have to Chinese customer service, living in Japan in China does not need Chinese customer service, tourists to Japan, without that effort to play international calls, then the question is, who needs to call Amazon overseas purchase Chinese phone, nothing more than like me.
Isn't Amazon Chinese customer service convenient for these people in our Haitao?
This purchase is not very satisfactory
This is the second time to buy Pampers diapers from Amazon, once bought a box when the baby was 2 months old, chose European imported paper diapers, the first purchase experience is still relatively satisfactory, the baby uses a diaper all night, indeed can meet 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time to buy L diapers, there are 2 packs of separate packaging in a box, after opening it I feel that the paper is relatively loose, and there is a clear difference from imported Pampers, after using it for the baby, it is okay, there is no urine leakage and no rash and other signs.
But by the second pack of diapers, after starting to use the baby's inner thighs, a red rash immediately appeared, which has not faded to this day.
I suspect that the quality of the 2 packs in 1 box is not the same.
I should not continue to buy in the future!
Want to value the shipping protection of your package
This is the worst packaging and shipping I have seen in so long since I have been shopping online, there is no protection at all, cushioning foam, wrapping cushioning layer material, etc., nothing.
Just a press-deformed box.
And the soft rubber box inside is packed, and the card box is pressed open and pressed to deformation.
I hope it is genuine and the quality is guaranteed, and I will not dare to buy anything in the Amazon in the future.
I would rather be half as expensive as the country, with guaranteed points.
And the problem of commodity product packaging, I read the comment in 2016, someone commented, to now 19 years, it is still the same.
It shows that Amazon does not pay attention to service feedback at all, and the difference between domestic JD.com and Tmall is too far.
Good-looking, but a little bit of a pity
The color of the whole cup is my favorite color, orange red, although my family is a male treasure, but I still think orange red with yellow is very eye-catching.
It's smaller than I thought, but it's meant to be taken out, so it's acceptable.
I took it home last night and tried it, and after the cap was pushed open, the distance between the straw and the lid was too close, because the position of the straw was vertical, so the son always had to hold the bulge above the lid to drink water, thinking that this place could be improved.
It seems that it makes sense for other brands of straw cups to tilt the straw, children's things, really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large capacity
I like that it is light, the opening is large, that is, the two separate divider bags are a bit redundant for me, and I feel like I don't know what to put in it.
After buying, I found that there was another brand very similar to Meiya purchased overseas, only less than two hundred pieces.
Fakes, especially fakes
Amazon sells fakes, and I also served.
The customer service said that it could not be returned because it was used, and I didn't use how to know that it was a fake.
Because of trust, so sad, after all, it is a face-wiping product, really go to the physical store to buy, recognize a little more expensive.
Because it is a flash sale, I didn't read the comments, I have submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, let's defend our rights together.
Broken?
Fake?
In short, tragedy.
The pores selected when using the second tablet are fine, but as soon as I opened it, I smelled strange, thinking it was normal, because I hadn't used this, and then when I pasted it on my face, I couldn't stand it completely, very punchy taste, indescribable, smoked to immediately cough out, eyes were also very painful, tears, immediately took off to wash my face.
Unbelief evil opened another piece of the same style, which did not have such a heavy taste, and now it is being applied.
Recall is a bit like the smell of low-quality perm in a hair salon.
Is it really unimaginable that Amazon's own skin care products have to be avoided from now on?
Profiteers
At that time, when buying, the activity page said that the full 99 yuan to give away the "three-body complete collection", received the goods without this gift, called the customer service and said to show them the screenshot of the event at that time, the problem is who bought things and saved the screenshot of the web page, you have done your own activities, you also need customers to help you provide ah, buyers next time to keep an eye and save evidence.
Feel after use
The first time to buy something on Amazon, respectively feel a few points, first talk about the feeling of using up the goods, the first is indeed painless, there is no stimulating taste of things, overall very good, wait for about 8 minutes to wipe off, but there will be a small amount of sweat residue on it, do not look closely can not see, so the overall is good, as for the use of once to continue to observe, continue to use will know.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second order is placed from the 27th, and the goods are received on the 12th, a total of 15 days is half a month, and Amazon's delivery man service attitude is also very good.
Third, Amazon's what Black Friday don't believe, Friday order, wait 2 days cheaper close to 12 yuan, that is, I bought more than 170 (plus shipping or something), there is a feeling of engaging in activities to raise the price.
The customer service said what the price fluctuated, I paid attention to the price for more than 10 days, it is like this, and the fluctuation is not large.
Affordable, Japanese origin, with Chinese label, with pellets, absolute repurchase!
The paste with particles, the refreshing feeling is just right, the teeth are smooth after use, and it is much stronger than a second-hand Dong, where it is said to be imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels, and I don't know where to wholesale them.
In the future, as long as Amazon has it, it will never go to the second-hand east again.
Give a suggestion, how can Amazon's app post orders sometimes can't be posted, I hope to improve some applications, will do better and better!
Excellence over the years, getting worse and worse, there is no service quality at all!
Garbage excellence does not take into account customer needs Special delivery time 19:00-22:00 when placing an order.
Because there are elderly people who are inconvenient to stay in bed after surgery, it is only convenient to receive documents at night.
As a result, it was delivered directly to the door at 12 noon, and it was not told by phone in advance.
If the delivery time is your courier can deliver at what time he wants, why bother to make a time for the customer to choose?
If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then simply don't do e-commerce!
Let an old man with 3 wounds on his body get out of bed, open the door, collect the courier, and pay for change!
Obviously there is a contact number on the order!
From the beginning to the end, no one came to call to give an explanation!
The so-called complaint customer service of Excellence.com is a group of outsiders pretending to be there, perfunctory your complaint and then giving you a so-called answer.
There will be no change or compensation!
I also encountered such a problem before, and I endured the problem that the delivery time was wrong, but this time I couldn't bear it, it was too much!
After the pre-sale of the new book arrived, the cover and back cover were reversed, so that the quality problem was obvious, so the book was sent to the customer with his eyes closed?
Leave a bad review and no one will contact you.
Excellence over the years, getting worse and worse, there is no service quality at all!
No more spending a dime on excellence.
The image quality is simply unacceptable
As a title like "Ancient Atlas", the selection, typesetting, and printing of pictures in this book are really unacceptable, and some pictures even have mosaics, which are blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small format illustration, it should be worthy of the medieval documents left by the ancestors in the catalog!
(Moreover, many pictures can be obtained from relevant industry resources), what is the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using pictures?
！ I regret this academic spirit.
The text is not evaluated, and the Fang family has their own distinction.
Overall 2 stars.
The book I read in my second year of high school was just bored to watch and play, and I felt that such a book should not be addicted, after all, the starting point of the web novel was still not very attractive to me in the past.
And then... Just fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively relaxed and pleasant, and when Ye Xiu was still in the online game in the first part, even if it was intrigue between guilds, it was not heavy at all because it was often blooded by Ye Shen.
As for the part of the competition, I wrote a little bit of sadness about the change of times and the alternation of old and new (probably my sentimentality).
Reading the whole book took me a lot of study time in my sophomore year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very amazing, some characters are only occasionally bring, but also leave a deep impact, such as the more focused characters Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian Su Mucheng have a large number of fans, and the characters who are not in the writing center such as Jiang Botao Chu Yunxiu and so on are also very popular, in an e-sports cool article people can't find a very annoying character, which is the success of full-time in character description.
And on the emotional line, full-time does not have the general web literature criticized harem beauty 30 million either beautiful women or rotten problems, the feelings of all the people in the whole text, there is a common place is that they like the game of glory, and most of them want to win dignifiedly.
There is no big conspiracy in small meters, and everyone looks so innocent and cute.
That's probably why there's nothing annoying about full-time roles.
The full-time IP is big and thanks to that.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online literature, full-time is a good book.
How much he will really provide people with some blood and a little touch.
In April this year, full-time will be animated.
In fact, I want to buy this set of books for a long time, because the wallet is never thick enough and did not start hard, and then when I wanted to buy, I found that TB is simply rampant with fakes, in fact, full-time recently released another version, the cover picture I myself quite like, but still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked at it on Amazon and bought a set at one time.
Next, let's briefly talk about the situation of the goods.
●The fourth book does not have a plastic seal, but the book is new.
●The seventeenth plastic cover is in but has been opened, and the texture of the book is also very strange, and it feels like there is no other hardness.
The 23rd book is in the same situation as the seventeenth book, but it is also harder than the seventeenth book, but it is very old.
● The publishers of individual books are different, as if the 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, and the others are different.
●On the whole, I am quite satisfied, 24 books are a large box, very satisfied.
Lonely little lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but it turned out to be a lot of text!
I read it three times before I finished reading this book to children, a little lion who shoots, and a little lion who loves to eat juice gummies.
When I saw the plot of a lion eating a hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable, and modern urbanites are a little unacceptable to be eaten by animals.
Seeing in the end, this little lion who has succeeded in human society has lost himself, he is no longer a complete lion, nor is he a complete person.
In the end, there was only the back of the little lion, and I don't know where he went.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the impression of the grown up child, and it will be remembered inadvertently one day, which may touch or inspire her.
A portfolio of great value for money
1. I didn't know TASCHEN before, but I recently bought a lot of their books, and the reason is that they are too tough, whether it is the topic selection or the production itself.
There have been 3 versions of this work, the largest version, like the complete Michelangelo book, is close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; The middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; This edition is the smallest two-volume edition with a book box.
Personally, I think it's acceptable, firstly, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two, and it is better to read as a paperback; Second, unlike Michelangelo's complete works, paintings account for the main body, Leonardo da Vinci's black-and-white manuscript accounts for the majority, and for non-art readers with limited budgets, this edition is the most cost-effective for viewing paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanation of the painting part is great, there is composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it is printing or book size issues, some shadows are too deep in the county, can't see the details, a little regretful.
3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.
The former is already a genius, and the latter is too broad and accomplished to describe it as a genius.
If you used to only look at the painting and only experience half of Leonardo da Vinci, you would be completely speechless after reading the manuscript.
Garbage, who buys who regrets!
Never give a bad review, this really heartfelt garbage, bought a waste of money Shenma, give a reason!
1. The time is not accurate, suddenly it becomes January 1st, and the time goes to zero.
2. Inferior belts, none of which are silicone, bring wrist allergy blistering.
3. Often unable to connect to the mobile phone.
4. Only five days of battery life.
5. Sleep detection does not display, time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Miscellaneous.
Logistics are too slow
It shows that October 16th arrived, and the result was received on the 21st, bad review!
The delivery is too poor, buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be so slow!
Overall satisfied
Before I was worried about the packaging of the camera, this time it was okay, there was an inflatable bag inside, the camera was three yards consistent, and it could also be registered on the official website, the shutter number was 0, and the rest could only wait for time to be inspected.
The delivery speed is quite fast, here to complain about the courier brother, the valuables are placed in the concierge, walking fast, I can't open the box in front of him for inspection, I am really speechless about this.
The merchant did it for the sake of the customer before shipping :)
The merchant is more responsible, specifically calling to ask the screen size of the camera used, and indeed thinking about the customer.
Shipping is also fast.
It is also quite suitable and effective to stick the diamond film.
The battery is not fully charged
The machine is really good, I want to ask how to charge it from the first time it is not charged, the charging indicator is always red
At present, I can't find Amazon's official feedback channel, so I can only feedback in the product evaluation
1. On March 29, the book was purchased for 31 yuan through pre-order, showing that it would be pushed to the device on March 31, and the book could not be previewed on Amazon's official website at this time (because it had not yet been released);
2. The book pushed to the device on March 31, the content is blank, only stay tuned, and the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to 18 yuan;
3. In the past two days, I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and synchronize it again, but I can't get the electronic version of "The Nature of Business" that contains the actual content, but I see that Amazon's official website can already preview the book.
At the moment, I have a few thoughts
1. The issue of price is not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank book on the Kindle with a book with actual content, instead of downloading it forever is "stay tuned"
2. The pre-ordered book should not be bought again in the future, after all, in case of skipping the ticket, and then downloading a book with empty content, the procedure looks very complicated;
3. I hope that Amazon will give a normal channel that can feedback such problems, and when there are doubts about the download or use of e-books, there can be local feedback (work orders, online customer service can be, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does)
Not very recommended reading
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it from memory to write some feelings after reading.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as a collection of fragments about love in life.
The tone of this book is extremely bland, it is as bland as boiled water, the pursuit of simplicity is extreme, and the plot is like the street on a summer afternoon, silent and dull.
Each short story is a silhouette of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no ending.
Finally, collected together, titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love".
I think that this collection of novels, and its title, is like a kind of performance art, the author wants to express that love is not only the joy and sorrow on the stage, the sea dry stone rotten in urban legends, not only you non my non like glue, love is not only the above and should not be represented by the above, love is also a dull life, boring day after day, there is also a helplessness of life, escape from reality, and the dazedness of the future.
When reading this book, you may recall the arguing couples around you, the boring marriages of people you know, and unsatisfactory relationships.
That's why I don't recommend reading, aesthetically speaking, the writing and plot of this book are boring, unless your life is stormy or sweet as living in a candy castle, you have to read it with the feeling of being strange and boring.
And in terms of depth of thought, the daily plot does not make people shine or expand a person's thinking and vision (this is different from Márquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short fragments do not explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes caused the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense to read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than through the storyline, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.
Suitable for rough reading, not close reading.
The logic of this book is good, but the content is not fleshed out.
Many sales theories explain what and why, but are weak in how to do it, only pointing the direction but not giving specific practices.
Plus, the book feels like a patchwork.
Examples include both domestic and foreign ones; There are both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and obscure people.
I don't know if the story was compiled for example, but it would be more convincing to cite some cases experienced by the author.
Change in terms of customer or customer title.
If you still have a customer in the title, you will become a customer in the text.
There were also typos, missing punctuation, and misnumbering in the eBook.
In short, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but it is not suitable for people who are already working in sales and want to improve their sales level.
A quick guide to Internet finance
This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is only an introductory course, which can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, you still have to dig deep according to the diagram.
And the book was written earlier, and the content of the later Alipay WeChat subsidy war to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned, and today's third-party payment share is only afraid that the proportion is not so small as stated in the book.
Now many people go out to eat with a mobile phone, and merchants have abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank flow.
But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this primer book, it can be seen that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience, and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write tall and empty, but it's hard to write in an easy-to-understand way.
Appreciate you and want you to know!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they are valued and appreciated enough at work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, after the basic survival needs of people have been satisfied, the most urgent thing is the satisfaction of psychological needs—the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are "love you can't open in your heart", even if you have love, gratitude and appreciation, you will silently put it in your heart and will not say it.
In this book, the author expounds five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, careful moments, acts of service, heartfelt gifts, and physical contact.
I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from the bottom of your heart to appreciate and be grateful to the people around you, whether it is family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer people are, the more they need to appreciate and be grateful, so that our lives will become better.
Learn to appreciate, enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent, reduce the resignation rate.
Thank you translators for bringing us wonderful ideas and worlds abroad.
Due to Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds and other reasons, there will be more or less differences between languages, and if you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.
Thank you again to the authors and translators and editors for their hard work!
If it is suspected to be counterfeit, please review it strictly by Amazon
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, even inferior to roadside stall products, no grammage, no barcode, ten bags of packaging is also loose, not at all the characteristics of qualified products; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon and has requested a return; It's all a matter of quality; Merchants are advised to keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; Supplement: I bought Xinxiangyin, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 volumes, added a few comparative photos, further verified the falsification of the product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic losses and further unhappiness!
Once again, Amazon is expected to be meticulous and strict with the source of goods.
So-so products, and expectations are different
Merit:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
ADVANTAGE 2: THE MOTOR AND BLADE ARE GUARANTEED BY PANASONIC, AND THEY ARE OK TO USE, BUT THERE IS A GAP BETWEEN WHAT I EXPECTED.
Shortcoming:
1. Charging without indicator lights, this most basic your power indication is saved, it is estimated that customers who buy 300 yuan products, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, are also handouts, no respect.
2. There is a strong odor When charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of plastic burning.
The office tried it for 1 day, and the whole house was filled with this plastic smell.
Compared with the Philips Philips Philips at the same price I used before, although there is an extra knife head, the quality of Panasonic's product is really sorry for consumers.
Small packages
When I received the express delivery, I saw that it said that the e-commerce version was written on it, and I knew that it fell into the pit again, which is smaller than the supermarket bought, it should be M, which is different from the picture packaging on the product introduction, the so-called new version.
Three stars is to blame yourself for not seeing the product specifications clearly, you sell the M code e-commerce version I have no opinion, how many meanings do you mean if the goods are not right?
The e-commerce routine is deep, and I still go to the supermarket to buy it when I have time.
Just sauce purple.
I don't like the taste
Children don't like the taste of toothpaste very much, every time they say spicy, maybe it is more appropriate to describe it with other words, and the child's thesaurus is only this word for the time being.
I bought it when I was doing activities, it was very cheap, so I was embarrassed to give a bad review, four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Genuine yo Packaged
The packaging is complete, with an inflatable bag added inside, and there are no online reviews only the appearance of a bare product.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle as described in the picture, and the delivery is also very fast, and the next day it will come.
It's genuine, but it's out of stock, and I don't know when it will be on the shelves again.
A terrible shopping experience
The order placed on the black five, the result was not received for a long time, the latter inquiry, the package has already been signed, asked the colleagues around me said that there was no help to sign, quickly contacted the express company, but said that the sender can initiate an inquiry, contacted Amazon customer service, waited for more than ten days, finally figured out that the express was mistakenly voted to others, and several turnovers finally took back the express, the outer packaging has been unpacked, the goods are still complete, and I don't know if it has been used, in short, it's quite bad
Wrong picture
I thought I could receive headphones like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to receive headphones like Figure 2, even if the picture is inconsistent, what does it mean that the sound size on the left and right of the headphones is different?
Although the names are the same, I still hope that everyone can pay careful attention, and also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time, thank you very much.
The operating system is so-so
After a while, the overall picture is okay, I don't feel any difference, that is, this system makes people look tangled, the boot time is obviously a little slow, and it is not possible to set it well, and then the software does not need to comment, the response speed is more general, and the colleague's is not an order of magnitude compared to it.
Look at the comments that the design is very humane, I didn't find where to be humanized, the remote control this commonly used up and down, left and right, the position of the return key design is really not flattering.
So, let's use it as a TV, plus a TV box or something.
The price reduction is too powerful
The price reduction is too powerful, more than a hundred into now 99!
I have accumulated a lot of unevaluated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the evaluation content.
If I use this paragraph to rate, it means that this product has at least 85 points or more.
For relatively poor products, I will definitely not be lazy to copy and paste the evaluation, so that other consumers will use it as a reference when buying, and the merchant will improve the quality of the product.
Low price good line, no fever is enough!
Such a cheap line, but it should have reached the HDMI certification standard, personally compare these shit things in the second kill domestic Akihabara (the price is twice as expensive), the line body is thick, but also relatively soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, in the future low-price line to look for Base!
Stuff is okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites
After placing an order, it was found that it was wrong, but the cancellation of the order could not be canceled, and the webpage contact online customer service kept showing the wrong link, and could not be contacted.
After the arrival of the goods, the delivery man called me, I said I don't want it, I wanted to cancel the order but the cancellation was not successful, the delivery man took it back, said to sign for me first, let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, it is told that the food cannot be returned once it is signed, and there is no way to call Amazon customer service, and the same is true, the signature cannot be returned.
I have previously bought items that cannot be returned on the policy in Jingdong and Suning, including milk, diapers, etc., and the contact customer service has been refunded, and the taste of Jingdong's diapers after opening is too big to contact customer service to return, and it will not work when you Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it?
Tell me that either I will accept it myself, or let the delivery man buy it himself, it is not easy for the delivery man to be in the first place, why should I let the family pay for something that is not purchased by myself?
Okay, I won't return either, I took it myself, but I have to give you a score of 1 for your service
Advise everyone not to spend money in vain
First of all, I look forward to buying, I think the Dole brand should not be bad to where it is, after receiving it, I think the packaging is okay, the size is not bad, but there is a box is basically soft, the appearance is not visible, to feel, eat to the mouth completely tasteless, tasteless, bite open the flesh is dark yellow is bad kind, good and bad ginseng sold, can eat less than one-third, advise everyone not to buy, not cheap, the quality is too poor!
Eat a long and wise, and never buy fruit in e-commerce again!
Where is the product security mark
The bottom corner of the bottle is dented, should have experienced a strong impact to cause, from the outer packaging bag, feel the degree of ravage is heart-wrenching, after all, is the food packaging is too simple, but also belongs to the international purchase, and did not see any obvious anti-counterfeiting logo, opening the bottle is very easy, the key is that a layer of honey in the lid comes out directly from the inside, there is an opening almost no adhesion, foreign products are like this?
Born in China, I don't understand a little.
It should be genuine, right?
There is also a reminder when I took a picture of the twenties, this was received on the 14th, I bought overseas for the first time here, just wrote down my doubts, maybe this is normal?
The pick-up service needs to be improved
I bought a total of 5 pickup coupons, at the time of pickup, the first appointment to withdraw 3 copies, the result was only sent 2 copies, after multiple communication to confirm that it was missed, after agreeing to reissue; The second appointment, just in time for the rest day, the website and WeChat did not prompt the need to make an appointment on weekdays, causing unnecessary panic, and it is recommended to improve it later.
Nice shopping
Stuff praised!
Still believe in Amazon's own things, now overseas purchase is very convenient, buy from abroad logistics time is a few days longer than domestic, I have to say that Amazon's overseas purchase to domestic customs clearance ability is still very strong, much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought overseas.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to go out and buy back than in China, and I hope to improve.
litter
Seeing such a package, I would like to ask everyone: Do you think it is garbage on the side of the road?
Is a plastic fragile package sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag?
I see that such packaging is the same as garbage, buying this product, the packaging and its simplicity, without any measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after hand, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.
If I just come across one of these, I recognize it, buy a few of them are like this, go to Amazon customer service, the customer service says that it can be refunded, but the freight is paid in advance, and then the freight is returned to me in the form of gift cards.
Let me ask, I pay for the shipping with cash, you give me back the gift card, this is to buy your gift card by myself, just say ah, but also mail the product to the German warehouse by myself, this is not to buy a product to suffer ah!
And I have always told customer service, whose responsibility is it for such a problem, but the customer service does not say that it is their responsibility, and even dare not bear half a responsibility, what is the guarantee for such after-sales service? In a word: recognize the plant! But I estimate that my evaluation, Amazon will not give the opportunity to publish, directly delete it!
Good quality 5 stars, poor logistics
1, good quality, second deal, moderate price, excellent value for money.
2, strong, sufficient material, strong solder joint, proper surface treatment, good color.
3, the logistics is a hard injury, the order placed on the 3rd, the 11th arrived.
4. If Amazon does not indicate that the expected arrival time is February 7th, I may be very satisfied.
5, but marking the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise, and when the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user is very uncomfortable.
6. If you are not sure of giving a promise, please do not make a commitment.
7. Actually, I care a lot about the promises made by merchants.
8, so, I scored low.
The gold thread will fade
The effect is still there, but whether it feels obvious depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.
One thing that is not very good is that the golden thread, originally designed to look good, but in fact, this gold thread will fade, put it on the car, if you take it a few times, on the hand, and on the car, there will be some gold dust.
Hope the product can be improved.
This kind of square one, there is no decorative effect, don't engage in gold wire, fall down on the car to dirty the car is still troublesome.
The thing is intact, the speed is OK, it is packed in 2 packages and different packages
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously a shockproof is too much, thick cardboard is attached, sealed with a layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also easy to remove, one is like a domestic express box, put a few buffer air bags even if it is a thing, it feels a little perfunctory.
The Yalan mattress is really nice
The 34CM mattress is not generally thick, and you can sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is good, both the front and the back, it is quite soft, it is very comfortable to sleep, and I fall asleep quickly when lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were two stains because of the violent transportation of express delivery, and Yalan's customer service was very responsible and efficient to contact and solve the problem.
It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless
The page clearly marks self-operated, in fact, it is delivered by the supplier, and the supplier is responsible for after-sales, and contact the supplier by yourself if there is a problem.
I want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier and cannot be canceled; Want to return and exchange, successfully applied for a return and exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one paid attention to you, you need to contact the supplier to return.
This Nima which door self-operated goods.
The product is not Amazon delivered, after-sales Amazon does not bear, customer service actually said "I help you contact the supplier", but also claimed that it is self-operated, too shameless, naked faceless, naked fraud to consumers!
Depressing experience
The filter element purchased online before has a good filtration effect, and there is no scale after 28 days for another day or two.
Since the quality of the things purchased in Amazon has always been available, this time I want to buy here, the first time to buy a filter element on Amazon, I don't feel very good, not only did I start to have scale early, but the filter element has been used until the 28th day, there will be suspended small black toner, I really don't know whether to continue to use, or throw it directly, very depressed ~
Not as good as expected
Compared with the power strip I have used in the past, the external workmanship is average, how the inside is not disassembled, but as described by the store, from the perspective of ease of use, whether each independent unit is powered on lacks display
The package is damaged, wait for time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is more seriously damaged, the inside of the packaging box seems to be new, but the manual does not seem to be new, only decorated in September, stockpiling, I hope it will not be bad by then, please Amazon explain why several customers mentioned that the packaging is damaged, but you can handle it safely, thank you!
Overall good, a bit of a minor issue
The first time I bought a water filter bottle, I read a few evaluation articles, I felt that LAICA's cost performance was higher and I chose this, received the goods according to the instruction manual to install the filter element, tried it, and felt generally good, but when pouring water, it seems that the raw water will be mixed with the treated water from the spout (the original water tank is not tightly sealed).
When using it, be sure to wait until all the water is filtered before pouring it out!
The picture is incomplete
The picture does not capture the details on the side, and the details on the side are not consistent with the style of the subject, which is very different, which is one of them; This bead is made in Thailand and does not indicate the place of origin, which is the second; The texture is not indicated, this is the third; When I bought it in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box, there was only a simple plastic bag, and there was no product logo on the beads, where could I tell if it was real or not.
Be cautious when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service sucks
The order placed two days ago, received it today and found that it was reduced by 40 yuan, and it took a lot of time to find customer service, and the customer service said that there was no way to make up the difference, and it could be repurchased and returned.
This kind of customer experience and service is 10,000 times worse than that of a certain treasure.
Ok, as a newbie, it's worth buying
The quality is passable, and the best King Kong is not compared, I have seen the price of the mall before, let alone hundreds, I am playing King Kong for the first time, okay.
Stuff is good
The thing is really good, the delivery of my girlfriend, but at noon when I was not in Cana Express was a little unpleasant, the logistics company directly put the mail in the treasure and did not send me a verification SMS for pickup, causing me to run twice.
But the baby is really good.
Worth buying
The little monkey is cute, the Amazon discount is really big, Zhou Shengsheng's official website direct delivery, the night before yesterday order, this afternoon received it, really fast.
The postal courier is also responsible.
Support!
A customer's confession
1 After receiving such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to be in a hurry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that the problem will be handled by a specialist, and he will inform you of the result.
You can never actively contact this commissioner, do not know her work number, and do not have a direct contact number, that is, you cannot contact her, only she can contact you.
3 The tragedy is that after waiting for nearly 3 days, this commissioner contacted me, my mobile phone left for a while, and I did not receive a call from this commissioner.
I waited for 2 hours without waiting for the commissioner's call, during which I contacted Amazon customer service and emailed customer service to ask her to call me back.
4. Nearly 3 days have passed, and I still don't know what Amazon will do to me to receive this defective coffee machine!
5 There is no problem with Amazon goods in the United States, overseas shopping is good, but it is far worse than the service to Meiya.
6 for me I can only keep waiting...
The bottom is uneven
Because looking at the reviews are very good, all of them are looking forward to this pot, and I like it very much when I get it, very light, but when I open the pot, I found the problem, the bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle protrudes, the perimeter is concave, the oil is running to the periphery, specially bought open pot big fat meat fried a lot of oil can not cover the central area, paste, open the pot can not be opened, such a structure is estimated to be unable to cook normally.
I don't know if I was unlucky and just got a pot with an uneven bottom, but thanks to Amazon's one-month return service, I decisively returned.
I brushed the pot clean and retreated, working for half a day.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve
This is a product with a very clean design style.
In the shape of the cube, the designer processed the top into a slight curve.
It was supposed to be very smooth lines.
Unfortunately, the final result was not achieved.
Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel, and the back water box top cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel are actually inconsistent, and a height difference of about 2mm appears after stitching.
Although it looks like a small gap.
But it can be said that the whole sense of design is destroyed.
I feel a little sorry for that product designer.
It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet capable of creating such a level of products.
(Of course, you can't ask too much for the feedback of the after-sales lady, but when I heard the after-sales say that all the individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought has a problem, her disapproval and truthful emotions make me understand that beauty can not be too demanding) 2019-7-7The water output of the water pump failure is small, and it has been repaired for the second time, and it is broken two weeks after the first repair.
It's a good deal after the offer, and it's sad that the Amazon fake offer is sad
Buy one week after the baby is born, super heat preservation.
The outside of the pot can not feel a trace of heat, that is, it is not afraid of scalding people, and it can effectively protect the temperature from dispersion.
After an overnight air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said that the anniversary event 320 discounts, later found that everyone 249, 289, 299, instantly felt deceived, but go to the supermarket to compare is still more cost-effective than the same price of various miscellaneous brands, in the future can go out with the car.
Vitamix Vitamix 6300
I have been waiting for a long time, and I see that Meiya 6300 is discounted, and Central Asia overseas purchases are at the same price, so I hurry up and start.
The order was placed on September 2nd, and the expected arrival was on the 21st, but the result was on the 12th, almost 10 days in advance, and the speed is really fast!
The packaging box is not large, directly using the original packaging of Vitamix, and Amazon is not afraid of breaking across the ocean!
The machine looks quite new, the accessories are complete, that is, the cup shakes badly on the base, and I am afraid to start the cup and fly out directly!
I asked a friend who has 5200 and listened to his description as not as loose as mine.
The included recipe is all in English, it's quite tiring to read, and I can't find Chinese version on the Internet, which is a trouble!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer, it is estimated that it can arrive in 3 days, and then I will toss it well!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
Not large at all!
The second Totes, 1. This one does not have an umbrella cover 2. The material of the umbrella handle is general 3. It is clearly written Large, which is actually a convenient umbrella for one person, and it is estimated that two people can choke.
On the contrary, the one I bought in Meiya before can be used by three people without pressure.
It doesn't feel good
First of all, the box is not very strong, and it is deformed with a single press, followed by the back design to prevent the ABS scratching of the box surface when it is laid flat and does not work, and again the inside of the box is a piece of cloth wrapped, the place where the lever is prominent. Wait, all kinds of dissatisfaction, the final zipper is a little unsmooth.
PS: The wheels do feel good
It's OK
Pros: This backpack is more delicate and looks durable.
Disadvantages: the QR code on the card can't be scanned (what the hell), the 15.6-inch notebook can't fit (a little longer can't do), this backpack zipper can be locked, but does not prepare a lock for buyers, can not be described as service-oriented.
The whole is okay, I don't know if it is genuine leather
The overall feeling is okay, I don't know if it's genuine leather, so I can't evaluate it blindly.
It can hold A4 format documents, and it is estimated that a box-like object that is too thick and too hard to fit in 80 pages thick (which cannot be deformed) is estimated to fit.
The bag is very soft, and the inner bag separation is also more user-friendly, which is quite good.
It's just that there is a small trachoma at the bottom of this one I got, I don't know if it's my bad character or?
Too lazy to toss back and forth to exchange goods, endure.
A four-star overall is still worth it.
ForRoyal is popular all over the world camera straps SLR straps
This strap is designed to be scientific, hanging on both shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected with soft materials, unlike other fast gunners who use screws to fix the bottom wound camera, and it is also convenient to remove photography.
Garbage after-sales
I bought the piano a month and a half ago, missing a part, gave me an after-sales phone after notifying Amazon, after many communications, the parts are not received now, please what is this efficiency!
It is estimated that there will be problems after the repair is more troublesome, looking forward to good after-sales friends or detour, too much trouble!
There are minor flaws, the timbre is good
The headstock is defective, a corner is missing, it feels like a defective product, and there are no giveaways, but the price is already good, and the sound of the piano is also good.
It's okay, the first one
After using it for a long time, except for the bass that can't come out, it's generally good.
It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
When I first bought it, there was something wrong with the thing, all the lights were flashing and it didn't work.
I asked for an exchange, but the goods arrived in Shanghai for three days, and they were not delivered.
Calls to deliveries are also not answered.
The courier company said they only had that contact method.
Amazon couldn't find a place to complain.
Didn't ask for it, in case of late delivery, somehow delayed delivery at my request - such a text message came over.
Later, what about the transit problem.
Anyway, the very poor shopping experience began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
It is estimated that I will not be able to get it today.
The label is too sticky and not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not laminated; And the label stickiness is very poor, for the cable label is not good at all, it is very easy to fall off, buy it for sorting out the cable friends need to pay attention to it.
The pen is okay, but the package is too simple, just a paper box, there is no protection, and the box containing the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent glue, and the tear glue is on the box.
Six hundred yuan of things were treated like this, very disappointing for a purchase.
But the pen is fine.
Hope to improve the packaging in the future!
Quality is not said, if it is about writing, it is not as good as 925-25
First of all, praise the daily express, air parts, super fast, service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25, it is very good, I just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is not said, the style is also very beautiful, the reason why I give four stars is because the pen is a little heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the cap adjusts the length of the lead core a little shaky, personal opinion: 925-25 is more convenient than 85.
Hence becoming a diehard Amazon fan
Bought at a super discounted price, as a result, the child does not like the reading pen.
It has been opened, tried to apply for a return, and actually picked up the package for free.
That's awesome.
Returns are not advocated, but such a service is the only one in China.
Hope not to be abused.
The books in the future were all transferred to buy here.
Headphone bias, and murmur
This headset is really rubbish, I don't know if it's a problem with my ears, or if this headset is really not as good as it used to be.
I bought a blue one in a certain easy two years ago, the sound quality is not bad, no noise bass is also good, after more than two years of use, I plan to buy another one (urbeats), after all, it feels good.
I saw a purple one that looked very good, but I bought this today and opened it today to feel wrong, with a loud voice and a small voice.
At first, I thought it was because of the sound effect of the song and didn't think much about it, but then after listening to it for half a day, I found that this problem was very serious, not only the biased sound, the bass effect was not as good as the one I had before, and there was a little noise, is it only the purple one I bought has this phenomenon? Or is the headset manufacturing process really not working now?
Quite a poor rating, disappointed.
Be sure to return it tomorrow during the day.
PS: Good appearance
This AV amplifier has complex settings, rough appearance and large heat generation.
The sound will be evaluated after a while!
On August 14, I just started the German version of DN1080.
1. Front panel, knobs are plastic.
2. The audio input socket of the rear panel, the speaker output terminal are all bad, and it is much better to find a 1000-2000 CD power amplifier all-in-one machine than this.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, my transformer side is still concave, I have to open the box to restore by hand, the top cover and front panel are loose.
4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, which is very awkward when moving.
It feels like a SONY entry-level machine, just that workmanship, made in Malaysia.
It feels like Sony is much better than Pony to be placed in China.
5. The machine has a large heat, and the top cover of the two channels used to watch a movie for about 2 hours has to be touched by hand to have 40-50 °C, I don't know if the transformer is too large and the heat is large.
Now with more switching power supplies, this stupid transformer is estimated to be 4KG.
Sony should use a silent fan with active heat dissipation inside the machine, and after unboxing, only see the large aluminum plate heat sink on the tube.

Never taken apart
The battery is in use.
Would love to dissect it and see what's in its belly.
Thinking about it later, if you are disappointed after dismantling, it would be too unjust to spend so much money; In case you are satisfied after disassembling it, it will be difficult to install it again, and it will be unpleasant to use.
Forget it, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed description of the electricity, the average person will feel weak in their hearts when they look at it.
Fortunately, I have worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time, in addition to not understanding circuits, I can also be regarded as a half battery engineer, and I can withstand it.
be overjoyed
I really didn't have a bottom before I bought it, until I opened it and looked at the package!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, I felt particularly flexible and the quality was so good, I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and turn on QQ Music.
I was shocked that the sound quality turned out to be surround 3D!
I asked in the physical communication store, about 30 or so, but by no means a pinsheng brand, it is a miscellaneous brand, so although this pinsheng is 27 pieces, but the cost performance is definitely worth having!
The worst online shopping experience
After placing an order on September 28th, the system showed that it had been shipped, but the result was that the goods were still not received until October 12th.
Check the status of the Amazon order, the seller did not provide the tracking number, and could not find out where the order was.
So I sent an email to the seller to ask if I could provide the tracking number, but there was no reply after two days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service, the customer service told the seller's mobile phone number, I called the store again, after calling a few times, the phone was connected, and I was told that the express was lost, and I could immediately send me another one.
Although I was very angry, because the computer was in urgent need, I didn't tell the seller much, just send it to me immediately.
As a result, the next day called and asked, was it shipped?
The seller said that it was not yet, and it could only be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon to ask, the seller said that it must be sent, and it will be shipped after five or six o'clock in the afternoon, but when I called at seven o'clock in the evening, no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again and asked if the goods were sent?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said that it was not sent, and told me that if I was in a hurry, let me order from another house, and if I could wait, I would send it in the afternoon.
No way, it takes a long time to place an order from another house.
I can only ask the seller to hurry up and deliver the goods.
Finally, after countless phone follow-ups, I received my computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, so I'll add comments later.
I just bought it for half a year and didn't use it a few times, and now it's in bad contact, can I fix it?
Because I have a desktop, I haven't used it a few times after buying it.
Just carry it in your travel bag a few times.
Recently, it was found that when the power is turned on, it is not charged, and you need to use your hand to hold the connection between the charger and the wire a few times to charge it.
I suspect that the interface is in poor contact, I don't know if I can repair it now?
It is highly recommended that Amazon deactivate EMS!
Five stars for goods, one star for logistics, three stars for average.
I don't understand why Amazon sends EMS, the industry is recognized as unreliable, well, computers are also valuables!
The order after buying showed that it was expected to arrive on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why send from Xiamen to Fuzhou, why four or five days!
On the morning of the 22nd, the logistics check finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready to receive the goods happily, as a result, in the evening without receiving any phone calls, text messages, as soon as the logistics was checked, it was actually signed at noon, and it was also shown that he signed for it!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I doubt life!
Finally, I ran to the collection point to move the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier brother reversed the two order numbers, fortunately, the piece was not lost.
I strongly recommend that Amazon do not use EMS, and if Amazon uses EMS to send express delivery in the future, I will definitely not buy it again.
The goods are not bad
First of all, just bought a few days and found that the price was reduced, bad reviews, this is not bad, cost-effective, CPU and graphics card are enough to cope with mainstream online games and a considerable part of large stand-alone, heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little light leakage (the common problem of IPS screen), the audio quality is not very good, the hard disk is not good (it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid state), yesterday took it to the after-sales to test the hardware, there is no problem, The built-in win8.1 is not very easy to use, it is recommended to upgrade to 10, the seller ships quickly, and the answers to various inquiries are also very fast, and the invoice arrives the next day after receiving the computer, not bad, but unfortunately there are no gifts.
(By the way, when buying keyboard film, you must not go to a store called E Cool Digital Center to buy it, the delivery is slow and the quality is poor, the product is not returned or replaced if there is a problem, the boss is still full of dirty words, special exposure)
Stuff is good, platform bureaucracy remains
The quality of the hard disk is very good, the cost performance is absolutely high, cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, and it is definitely recommended to buy if you are not in a hurry and can endure logistics.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same, and a few years ago I swore that I would never use it when there was no improvement, you can never find out the actual logistics situation, the information will always be delivered after a few weeks, you can never complain, that's how bureaucratic it is!
The goods have been received for a few days, and the logistics information is still 10 days later you will receive the goods!
Logistics is not worry-free
Sent like this, not only the packaging is flattened, the packaging of electrical appliances is also open, and I don't know if there is a transfer package.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet, but I've always trusted Philips and wanted a longer battery life than other brands.
Check on the Internet, it may be a common problem of water ingress, and there is no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it, I don't know how long it can be used?
Bought someone else has taken apart
The tax for more than 300 machines is indeed relatively high, and now more than 600 is much more balanced.
When I received it, the state of the sealing rubber strip looked very wrong, as if it had been disassembled, and I quickly took a picture first, sure enough, it was torn open, and the cardboard inside was damaged after opening, I was worried that it was someone else's return, and I quickly tried it for my husband before the anniversary, and the result was that the machine had no electricity at all, fortunately, there was no slag in the knife head, or it would be far away!
Whether it is good to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term is unknown, such as the previous evaluation, the things sent out when out of stock are indeed unreliable!
The sense of experience is on the upper middle level
Almost top-of-the-line electric, there are many cleaning modes, but few people will change different modes of brushing every day.
After using it for half a year, there is no problem, brush every day, almost 1 more than a week flush.
Brush head accessories are equally cheap to buy on Amazon.
App is a little difficult to use, in addition to changing the color those, other seemingly compatible problems are the reason for the overseas version?
Those who want to learn Dafa.
Good value for money
Already used 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It is very simple to use and very convenient to clean.
3. You can get a DIY haircut and save money.
All in all, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes
Last time I bought two packs, it turned out to be two different versions, originally the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but it turned out that one package was not, it was a white word, and as a result, the cat had diarrhea when it was eaten.
Whether Amazon's source is fake or dropped by employees when shipping, I can't be sure.
I will buy it again, and if it is still a fake, I will find you related people accountable.
It's crossbar!
Isn't it a lie that there is a slash on the Amazon picture and it turns out to be a horizontal bar?
The effect is ok
Cats love to eat, that's the point.
It does work.
Tight, narrow, hoop feet, grinding instep.
Not recommended.
1.UN is the most comfortable series of CLARKS, but unfortunately this one is too bad.
Addendum: Today compared the previous UN series insoles (shoes are thrown away for use), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, that is, fake soft.
2. My instep is not high, and the part of my instep is about 3 cm forward at the highest point of the instep.
3. Three pairs of clarks were purchased overseas, and only one pair was suitable.
I was so scared that I deleted all the fun in my favorites.
Go back and try rockport, but you can only go to the ECCO physical store.
Shoddy and poor quality control
First of all, it is worth affirming that Prime overseas purchase of UPS is very powerful, and the order under the 31st was received on the 6th.
The shoe color is much better than the pictures, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a little bigger, 25 feet long 10.5 wide shot 7.5W, the upper foot is a little loose, but I usually like to wear looser, a pair of insoles is just right.
Secondly, this shoe quality control really does not dare to compliment, one sole glue is damaged, the other upper has various scratches and a needle eye, the upper and the sole connection of the rubber strip is misaligned, obviously shoddy!
A little regret!
Do the activity 280 pieces to buy, this price to buy ASICS is quite cost-effective, of course, see the reviews and there is a lower price.
Now about the shoes, the advantages: the shoes are very light, running is quite comfortable, but also more fit, will not be loose.
The appearance is very high, but the shortcomings are also obvious: I generally wear 40 shoes, this time I bought 40.5, and there is about 1 thumb distance from the front of the shoe when I wear it, but this does not affect anything.
The shoe is very "narrow", although there is still a distance in front, but it feels tight.
Another point is that the shoes may not be very breathable, and it feels hot to wear them now.
Press the instep
First of all, the shoes are very well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, Amazon's ibu has also bought a few pairs, never appeared out of fit, but this pair I refer to the review, buy a larger uk7, after the foot because of the size of the length is obviously longer, but because the insole is too thick, or press the instep pressure is strong, plus the hiking shoes are very hard, resulting in very uncomfortable feet.
If your feet are not particularly thin, it is not recommended to buy this one.
If you must buy it, changing the insole can also solve it, but the original insole looks very high-class, and it is a pity that it is not necessary.
A perfect shopping trip!
Very satisfied, very liked, Amazon overseas purchases are genuine undoubtedly, the quality is also very good, good quality and low price, buy rest assured, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very cordial and kind, deal with problems patiently and efficiently, perfect to solve worries, supporting express home delivery is very convenient and stable, delivery master is very considerate of customers, every time will remind timely pickup from the express cabinet, thank Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, our whole family loves shopping overseas on Amazon!
Absolutely bad review!
I was speechless about this agency and Amazon.
In the future, electronic products should be bought on Amazon or be careful.
Although it has been a long time since the past, it is still necessary to complain.
Bought in winter flash deals, less than 200, put at home for several months useless.
When I wanted to use it in the spring, I found that I couldn't connect to the bracelet, and the two device manuals expressed support for each other, and later found that it should be a problem with the heart rate belt, because I still couldn't connect to other devices.
Call Amazon and ask me to contact the agency, which asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, the things were sent back in their original packaging, even the express box was the one I used when I sent it!
There are no replies and receipts and test reports!
Tell me if it's good or bad!
Call and ask, say that sending it back this way means that the equipment is fine, it is good.
But why can't I connect, the agency replied: then it's not their business.
Count me unlucky, too lazy to be tossed by you for a 200-piece thing.
Serious goods are not on the right board.
Very wrong goods.
The headband material is good.
Much better than Nike.
The breathability is also very good.
Just that hat on the front.
Very fine.
Are you here to tease the comparison?!
No sunlight at all.
No return because it functions well as a headband.
Wearing it upwards does not cover the sun.
But it's different from other headband styles.
Keep it for use.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks the spirit of contract, and the delivery man is good.
I request delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon's regulations cannot deliver on Saturdays and Sundays.
It hurt me to drive 200 kilometers from out of town to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery man was positive and welcoming.
Give a thumbs up!
Product, simply tried it, not bad.
But I haven't bought a similar product before, so I can't compare the price!
Size logistics
The workmanship is okay, but the logistics is too slow, the previous shoes are everything DHL, this time Apex is really ... I HAVE BOUGHT A LOT OF UA IN CHINA, THE PRICE IS NOT LOW, AND IT FEELS HIGHER THAN NIKE ADIDAS?
Actually, it's all the same okay, so sea shopping.
Size: I am 176CM, 68KG, my shoulders are wide and the general clothes are 180, I bought M, the hem is slightly longer, the other wear is just right, I see that there is a recommended size S, is the figure so slender? Or do you prefer to be tight? I think it's better to have a loose hoodie.
The size is just right
Chest circumference 99, height 184, weight 84 kg, consulted customer service before buying and was told that I should buy xxl, and then read the comments to decisively buy L, and after receiving the goods, I found that the size was just right, and I was almost pitted.
The price of Double 11 is much more expensive than that of Black Five.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Z affordable product problem is troublesome!
The order placed on the 18th, the goods received only on the 25th, the speed of Guangzhou to Beijing snail!
I bought a Z affordable product, and the instructions told that there were scratches, but after receiving the goods, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
The child is reluctant to return it, thinking that there is no big problem, but the small parts of accessories, the child's grandfather ran to several hardware stores nearby and did not buy them!
Finally Grandpa gave it to the glue!
It seems that you will not be able to buy Z affordable products in the future!
The quality of toy processing is not good
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, the upper bolt is very difficult, it can be seen that the processing quality is not good, and I don't know how long I can play, because it is something promised to the child, and it will not be returned.
Other reviews say that the installation is not laborious, is it only the one I bought that has problems?
Very general
Could it be that I'm unlucky?
The packaging is too old to work; The workmanship is very average; There is only one kind of music, and it is only 8 seconds long and then repeats itself; The action is to shake your head and walk forward, without any change.
Not worth the price.
If you use it urgently, you will not return it.
The quality of the toy is good, spit on the packaging
Received the express yesterday, Amazon bought it, marked EMS delivery, and finally it was sent by Tmall express, how many turns did this take? Amazon and Tmall have a good relationship?
Let's talk about the packaging, that is, wrapped with plastic wrap for several layers, there is not even a packaging plastic bubble paper inside, open it, all the parts are placed in the empty box, fortunately the quality of the toy is good, there are no broken parts, it is much smaller than expected, because it is not with a battery, hand push often derailed, feel that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, the design is unreasonable.
Good quality and fun
It's fun, the components are very accurate, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is similar to Lego, and the price is very good when doing activities.
The assembly process is quite interesting, I will fight, and my 5-year-old son will play it, which is very good.
He played with amazement and laughter~ I will probably continue to buy this brand of toys in the future.
The machine is new, and the sea is good
I looked at it at Christmas, and the one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the delivery is a little slower.
The machine is still good, all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then connecting the Poké Ball will send a dream.
It's not bad to play, better than PS4, and it's more portable.
Already bought Zelda, wait for the game, try again.
Produce rotten goods, sell rotten goods, and as a result of rotten goods service, buy six watches to send to children, one of the fast numbers is not completely displayed, the time of the six pieces is inconsistent, the difference of more than ten hours.
I contact the manufacturer to ask if there is a check time for the watch in storage? They replied "Yes", since there is, then why is the time difference so much, it must be that the watch has no accuracy, simply put, it is a parallel product, not as I said ugly, look, obvious quality problems (the digital display is not complete) are taken out and sold, is it garbage.
I contacted the seller, and the seller said a lot of reasons, and complained that he should not have bought their things in the first place, such a product, such a seller, such after-sales service, who would dare to buy something on Amazon in the future.
In short, I recommend not buying things with this seller, buying things is also garbage.
Amazon shipping issues
After receiving the goods, the inspection found:
1. The table packaging is seriously worn.
2. The table manual has serious use folds.
3. The watch does not go, the lamp charging is not used, and the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, you can only mail to the United States at your own expense, and make up the postage.
The reason for 5 and 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.
It can only be said that it is okay
The time is not very accurate, about one second faster every day, and it has been more than two minutes in just a few months.
I have used a piece of Citizen before, and I feel that a year or two will not be a few seconds behind.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, the timing function is a bit chicken, basically not used, occasionally touched to enter the timing mode.
Solar sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging does not have to worry about battery replacement, has world time, a variety of alarms and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror surface is easy to scratch and dust.
Cost performance: the general price in China is between 220-300, and more than 180 overseas purchases (about 1 week).
Very happy watch
It must be genuine, I went to the counter to inspect the goods, the appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the material is sufficient, plus it is an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight, it is those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches can not be compared, this is genuine.
The timing of the watch is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, the packaging of the watch has a jewelry identification certificate, the 12 characters of the dial are real diamonds, this is very suitable to wear, as a gift to give out is also very faced.
Bentley watches are really good.
Worst shopping experience ever
On the evening of September 23, my wife's mobile phone fell, and on a whim I immediately came to Amazon to order an 8P, which is in stock but not self-operated and does not increase the price (I am secretly happy), because the delivery is relatively slow because it is not self-operated, the system shows that the latest receipt is expected to be September 27.
My wife died uncomfortably without a mobile phone, and the next morning at 6 o'clock called me to think of a way, and then went to Jingdong to see that 256G was in stock and could be delivered on the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.
After buying a new one, I want to cancel Amazon's order immediately.
Since the order is placed in the middle of the night, it is impossible to collect the express in the early morning, call the customer service at 7 o'clock to cancel the order, and the customer service reply has been canceled, please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I waited patiently, and at noon on the mobile phone, the order was still in the state and still unshipped, so I immediately contacted customer service to request to cancel the order as soon as possible, and the customer service replied that the operation was OK.
At 3 p.m., I saw that the order was still on my phone, and I had no choice but to contact customer service again to clearly inform that it had been the third call, please cancel the order and inform the seller that it must not be shipped!
The customer service contacted the seller on the spot at my request and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would wait until he was familiar with the system before canceling the order.
But clearly tell me that the seller already knows, and will definitely not ship, please rest assured.
When I looked at the order on Monday, it had been shipped, and I was speechless.
Since it is not possible to contact the seller directly, you can only call customer service again.
The latter processing is simply speechless, basically I say one step, and the customer service continues to operate.
The order is still in a delivery rejection state so far and is ready to be delivered again!
Won't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
The seller's company also collected money anyway, and it didn't matter if it didn't follow up.
To sum up, large items will definitely not be paid upfront, this look is too troublesome.
It looks wonderful
I fancy this camera a long time ago, but because there are some other reasons besides the price, I didn't buy it, and this time because of the free shipping, the price is okay, so I bought it.
After buying it, there is no problem with the others, that is, when the software is connected, how can not be connected, my home is a TP router, after checking the Internet, I found that many people have this problem, got more than two hours, various changes to the settings of the router, and finally I used 360WIFI as a medium to get it, during the period to call Xiaomi customer service, they have no solution to this problem, directly let me contact Amazon for after-sales.
Another noteworthy point is that I saw user comments on the Internet that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and the smaller storage capacity cannot be recognized, I hope you pay attention to this.
It feels okay to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, the machine has a certain degree of heat, if you keep it on, I feel that this level of heat is a little unacceptable.
To sum up, this product still has many shortcomings, I hope you should be cautious when buying.
The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I bought it with my first love in life, and I have been dating for almost 3 years, so I left me last year, and I have been until now.
The reason why I gave 3 stars is because I bought it with my first love in life, and now I don't know how much I use it, maybe throw it away!
After dating for almost 3 years, I left me last year, and now when I think of her, I want to leave this world with a heartache, and the first woman in my life has brought me a lifetime of shadows and heartache, and I have not been able to come out so far.
When buying this mobile phone, think about the two feelings at that time, or can share happiness and suffering together, but now it is unbearable to look back, life may be like this, some people do not want to encounter in their lives, some things do not want to know in their lives, but what is the way?
How many times as soon as I see the mobile phone of Samsung, I think of her in my mind, and the pain fills the whole body, I have never been willing to use a mobile phone of more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I did not hesitate, no matter how good it is to a person, but one day when she changes her heart, all the mountain alliance sea oaths will disappear.
A boutique among domestic brands
Huawei is a boutique among domestic products.
Low-key CEOs and enterprises rely on technology and quality to win customers, which is completely different from the current business atmosphere of relying on advertising operations to increase visibility!
It is impossible for a company without strength to do this, and it is not afraid to do so!
It is for this reason that I chose Huawei.
I have been buying it for more than half a year, and I feel that it has been very good, very good.
The reason why I didn't give a perfect score was because once when using it for offline navigation, there was a phenomenon of non-positioning, and I didn't find out the reason in the end, other times it was fine.
And its online input of the destination, after the search automatically designed the route, after leaving the wifi departure, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical, no need to run traffic, it directly talks to the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, very good!
Sony Dafa is good
Sony's low-end machine, the sense of design is still full, and the price is cheap, the screen is large enough, the endurance is excellent, and it is very suitable for the elderly.
Although a long time has passed, there is still nothing wrong with this machine.
But because my Z2 was devolved, this phone also fulfilled its mission.
Although the hygiene level of the food stalls is not good, the residents like the excitement of being able to call their favorite dishes to their bosses and eat together, and they also think that since they choose to eat at the food stalls, they must tolerate their hygiene.

However, it has caused strong privacy and national security issues controversy in many countries and regions such as China, the United States and Europe, and the people believe that this function violates user privacy, and bad intentions can use this function to track other people's computers, and once Intel's serial number database is leaked, it will bring incalculable losses, and national security agencies of many countries believe that the intelligence services of hostile countries can use this function to easily record and analyze computer activities, forced by market pressure. Intel disabled this feature starting with the Pentium III processor codenamed Tulatin, and has not used this feature on subsequent products such as the Pentium 4 and Core processors.

In an article published in August 2021, Billboard magazine pointed out that fans of the group "used honest means" to exploit loopholes in the charts, improving the ranking of singles such as < Butter > in the United States, helping the song to top the Top 100 singles chart for several weeks; While chart performance on the Top 100 is often determined by streaming and playback, < Butter >'s chart performance has come primarily from sales-driven (much of it from BTS's online store, which allows fans to purchase multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) and fan-led crowdfunding campaigns (including the use of global fan crowdfunding to make purchases on services like PayPal that only count toward U.S. sales); However, an article in the Korea Times refuted claims of chart manipulation, arguing that the fan base of other singers such as Justin Jr. and Ariana Grande had adopted similar promotional measures that were neither illegal nor unethical, and that the fans involved in these measures were simply "smart consumers who lead the global trend."
It is basically certain that the last common ancestor has genes and genetic coding, and its genes are likely to be composed of DNA, so the last common ancestor appeared after the RNA world; In the case of DNA, its DNA code uses the same four nucleotides as today, namely adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T); Its DNA maintains a double helix structure with DNA polymerase, a template-dependent enzyme, and its DNA polymerase may belong to group D polymerases; The integrity of its DNA structure depends on a class of enzymes that maintain and repair the structure of DNA, including DNA topoisomerase; In addition, if the basis of its genetic coding is DNA, these codes will be expressed through a single strand of RNA as an intermediary, and its RNa will be generated by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and its RNa code will use nucleotides similar to DNA, but the thymine of DNA will be replaced by uracil; In addition, this organism will have a variety of tissue proteins, including folding proteins.

Even if the amendment takes effect, the public holidays that overlap with Saturdays can theoretically still reach 5 days per year, but this only occurred in 1999 (the 123rd day of the lunar year and the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival did not overlap with Sunday, and there was no case of making up holidays on Saturdays, but there were still as many as 5 public holidays that overlapped with Saturdays, namely the day after Good Friday, Labour Day, Buddha's Birthday, the day after Mid-Autumn Festival, and Christmas). In the 36 years from 2011 to 2046, public holidays that overlap with Saturdays, The maximum number is 4 days per year, with an average of 2.78 days, as shown in the table below (public holidays for 2024 and beyond have not yet been announced, assuming that the Public Holidays Ordinance is not amended by 2046; Since the 50-year fixed period of one country, two systems implemented since the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997 will expire on July 1, 2047, and the laws and systems in force in Hong Kong thereafter are still unknown, so 2047 and beyond are not calculated).
This paradox states that there is no finitely additable measure defined on a sphere whose value is equal to all mutually congruent subsets (Hausdorff also proved that there is no countable additable measure that can be defined on all subsets) , and that the structure of the group formed by the rotation of the sphere plays a key role here - and this statement does not hold in planes or line segments; In fact , Banach later proved that it was possible to define an area for all bounded subsets on the Euclidean plane such that all subsets were equal to each other ( this is the same for length on real numbers ) ; However , this is only finite additive , so it is not a measure in the full sense , but for the property " so that all subsets are equally equal to each other " , it is equal to the Lebesgue measure , which means that two equi-decomposable sets equal to each other have the same area.

Some may argue that saying that "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" is a reversal of cause and effect, and the real causal relationship should be "more bad behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment"; However, research shows that the relationship between corporal punishment and bad behavior is indeed "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children", rather than "more bad behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment", and "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children", which is supported by post-analysis; In addition, even after controlling for various variables that may affect children's behavior, such as parents' social status, the fact that "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" still holds true, that is, corporal punishment itself does lead to more bad behavior in children, and its adverse effects cannot be explained by any other possible cause; Some studies have also concluded that educational strategies that emphasize both care and supervision can effectively reduce the incidence of bullying, while exclusion, permissiveness and corporal punishment are positively correlated with the incidence of bullying.

In the end, nut TNT only had a die-hard hammer powder to order more than a hundred, scarce production made the factory refuse to start, and these subscribers could not get the goods, some media people commented that this is also the root problem of the hammer: Luo Yonghao is extremely conceited and dreams big, but it seems that there is no equivalent huge pool of funds and technological innovation, at the beginning, relying on a "Chinese craftsman precision dream" ideology and words to cater to the rebellious wind of online youth sucked a group of fans, these iron fans have some ability to become employees, others as consumer customers, But ideology always burns out a day and the final market will test your technical hard power, the current hammer at best only has the ability to create or rewrite APP, or a brand factory stage of assembling upstream supplier spot, craftsmanship is reflected in the shell construction, but the mobile phone shell can actually do very few changes, now automated processing technology also makes each manufacturer actually shell process is not much different, other cards are not necessarily "not sophisticated" where.
Before 2021, China's application launch advertisements have problems such as difficult to see pop-up information signs, extremely small close buttons, disguised pages, and induced clicks. In July 2021, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology launched a special rectification action for the Internet industry, including rectifying the behavior of infringed on users' rights and interests such as deception and misleading users by pop-up windows starting pop-ups, forcing the provision of personalized services (including pop-up windows for jump links, providing false close buttons when targeted pushes, etc.), etc., which made many advertising norms on many platforms. However, at this time, in order to seek the benefit of launching advertising, some platforms created a new shake advertisement, treating users as "shaking" for their consent to view the advertisement and circumventing rectification; At the end of the year, during the "Double 11" and "Double 12" period, some applications launched shake ads, although their push is random, not everyone or every time they open the software, but because the trigger is too sensitive, and once caused many complaints.

When the applied energy is injected into an energy level system by electric field, photons, chemistry, etc. and absorbs it, it will cause electrons to transition from low energy levels to high energy levels, and when photons generated by spontaneous radiation encounter these electrons that jump to high energy levels due to applied energy, these high-level electrons will be induced to migrate to low energy levels and release photons (so-called stimulated radiation), and all the optical properties of stimulated radiation will be the same as the original spontaneous radiation, including: frequency, phase, forward direction, etc. When these stimulated photons encounter other electrons that jump to high energy levels due to applied energy, more of the same photons will be produced, and finally the intensity of the light becomes larger and larger (that is, the light energy is amplified), and unlike ordinary light, all photons have the same frequency, phase (homology), and direction of progress.
After the two arrived at the warehouse auction venue, they often met some opponents who were also warehouse bidders when they walked into the door, and would try to greet each other for some simple social pleasantries, and ask each other whether there were local bidders who should pay attention, and some venues often had bidders who were willing to spend a lot of money to grab all the items regardless of the cost, this kind of bidders are usually divided into two types, one is a large bidder whose pocket is very deep, the warehouse of the venue is often won by him, this kind of large household monopolizes the warehouse for a long time, They don't want outsiders to come into the auction house to bid, so they will specially raise the amount of bids regardless of the cost, trying to drive away foreign bidders, the other is a novice bidder, does not know how to set the upper limit of bidding, shouting indiscriminately so that some warehouses that were originally very low costs are shouted high, other bidders often give up bidding because the bidding price is shouted too high, and the novices themselves are unable to make ends meet and lose miserably.

After the leaves of the olive kernel tree wither, they are collected and boiled and brewed, and the so-called black water in the aquarium can be used, which can strengthen the heat of Thai betta fish and improve conception, especially in the reproduction of Thai betta, because the leaves will release pigments; Tannins, make the water color darker, increase the water color to simulate the environmental conditions of black water, can stabilize the mood of fish, relieve urgency as soon as possible, maladapt, strengthen and improve the body; The color of the tail and dorsal fin, which lowers the pH (acid increase), it contains a lot of tannins; humic acid; Folic acid, etc., can adjust the pH value of water, the role of soft water, can make the water slightly softer, but also depends on the softness of the raw water, such as hard to use more leaves to soak to achieve the same effect, there are large leaves of the soaked fish tank, there are organisms will die later mold, so it is inferred that the large leaf olive kernel leaves should more or less inhibit the growth of mold antiseptic function.
On the eve of World War II, German gunsmiths conducted research on assault rifles, and concluded that although the existing 8mm Mauser rifle cartridge has a range of more than 800 meters, the long range is difficult to play in actual combat, the scope is not a universal equip, and most of the soldiers' marksmanship is not up to the level of snipers, and the high rate of fire can suppress the enemy in close combat, but the existing rifle cartridges are too heavy range, although the power is large, but the recoil is also too large, if it is used for fully automatic shooting, it will be difficult to hold stably. The hit rate during bursts was so low that it lacked practicality , so the idea of reducing the existing 8 mm Mauser ammunition charge , by shortening the length of the ammunition , not only reducing recoil but also reducing weight , led to the introduction of this shortened version of the 8 mm Mauser rifle cartridge in 1938 , maintaining a diameter of 7.92 mm , and about half the length of the previous Mauser rifle cartridge.
In addition, there are dances used on special occasions, such as the "Victory Dance" when celebrating victory in war and celebrating meritorious achievements, the "Friendship Dance" of social events between neighbors or friends, and the "Ghost Dance" that calls on ancestral spirits to fight with the spirits of dead warriors after contact with whites and after the war, the "Corn Dance" performed to pray or thank you for a good harvest, or "The Booger Dance" to pray for the exorcism of disease or whites, the Cherokee considered a demon. The Bug Dance is usually held indoors , and some of the invited people wear a snake mask symbolizing Bug ( after contact with white people , the horns of demons are added ) , and use a pseudonym to indicate that they ( Bug ) are not to harm humans but to dance , and after the dance , Bug is peacefully invited away.
Cat litter bucket toilets were first introduced in the Denver City school district in Colorado, where there have been multiple school shootings, and when there are emergencies such as school shootings, police will ask teachers and students to take shelter in classrooms until police have completed a campus inventory to confirm that they are safe, and John McDonald, the head of safety for Jefferson County Public Schools, said the idea was proposed a few years ago, when a school in the area was cordoned off for hours after the shooting threat. After the April 2019 shooting threat, the district began equipping classrooms with portable cat litter-based toilets, a decision that Diana Wilson, a spokeswoman for the district's public schools, said most teachers supported the decision, and that litter bucket toilets had been added to Denver's teacher ration list along with items such as pop-up tents and first aid kits.
After the demise of Balariulu, the location of the tribe became a place where the good tea tribe cultivated grain, and the remains of the ancient city can still be seen today, but the whereabouts of its remnants are completely unknown; On the other hand, although the Karishi tribe regained its independence and rebuilt its homeland, it also perished under a landslide and flood caused by heavy rains, and only some people in the present-day Wutai tribe (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township) claimed to be descendants of Karishi; In addition, because he led the tribe to win the war, the descendants of Bellen, Dalapathan (also known as Druluane and transliterated as "Lu Luan"), are also known as "military meritorious leaders", and the highest point of the old good tea tribe, Omomos (meaning "easy to fog"), and the original leader family Kadrangilan, are listed as two major leader families.
The cluster of infections originally caused by cabin crew at the end of December 2021 belongs to the Omicron variant, The genetic sequencing of the virus showed that both appeared earlier Omicron variant virus strain BA.1 subtype, and the infection group caused by the quarantine hotel in early January 2022 belonged to the Omicron variant virus strain BA.2 subtype, although both belong to the Omicron variant virus, but there are 10 different mutations in the spike protein of the two, and preliminary studies in the UK and Denmark have shown that the BA.2 subtype is more infectious than the BA.1 subtype. The BA.2 subtype results in a higher rate of breakthrough infection in people who have received two and three doses of vaccine, but those who have been vaccinated may have reduced the chance of spreading to others, while the first generation of transmission in the quarantine hotel cluster has reached 12 people, indicating that the Omicron variant BA.2 subtype is more infectious than the virus strain previously detected in Hong Kong and is more difficult to interrupt its widespread transmission.

In the later years of his reign of Anastatius, he realized that his days were numbered and that he had three living relatives, but Anastatius did not know who was the most suitable successor, so he summoned three relatives to a room with three sofas, one of which contained a letter that the person who chose the right sofa was eligible to be the heir, but two of the relatives sat on the same sofa, and the other sat on the other sofa, but the sofa containing the envelope was not chosen. So Anastatius thought of another idea at this time, who was the next person to walk in, who was the successor, and the person who walked in was Justin, the captain of his guards, although Anastatius did not expect Justin to become the successor, but he was also satisfied with the result, and Justin became emperor.
The Japanese Navy had been ordered to block the waters of Hong Kong at that time, and when the British torpedo boat fleet sailed to the waters east of the Lantang Strait, it was discovered by the Japanese Fang-class destroyer and the Hong-type mine boat Magpie, because the firepower gap between the two sides was very far away, Chen Ce then instructed the torpedo boat fleet to line up and face the Japanese ship at high speed, pretending to launch a torpedo attack on the Japanese ship, in fact, the torpedo boats at that time did not carry torpedoes in order to reduce the load and carry as many people as possible, and to avoid the risk of explosion after the torpedo was hit by artillery fire. However, the Japanese ships saw that the torpedo boat fleet was menacing, so they were fooled and took evasive actions, so the torpedo boat team got rid of the Japanese interception, the fleet passed through the Guozhou Islands and then turned to Dapeng Bay, and finally Chen Ce and more than 70 people landed in South Australia on the Dapeng Peninsula, after which the Chinese and British personnel quickly scuttled all the torpedo boats to avoid being discovered and tracked by the Japanese at the landing site, and then fled by land to Huizhou, Guangdong.
Buddhism opposes some views of Brahmanism, for example, in the Bunsen Sutra, the bodhisattva questioned why Brahma allowed suffering and evil to run rampant, similar to the problem of evil, and some Buddhist scholars also denied the existence of Brahma from the rational level, so Buddhism did not believe that the meaning of life came from the great Brahma king, who was still trapped in samsara, and Buddhism also denied that Brahma was the origin of all things, believing that Brahma was only one of the five manifestations, so some later Hindu theologians accused Buddhism of promoting nihilism. However, Buddhism refutes this statement, arguing that the root of all things is emptiness, and it is emptiness that enables all things to appear and change, and meaning in it constantly arises with the origin and disappears with the condition, so everything in the world is not meaningless, but because of impermanence, meaning cannot exist in the world forever.

The Zengwen River basin where the Zengwen Reservoir is located has a total length of 138.47 kilometers and a basin area of 1,176 square kilometers, making it the fourth largest river in Taiwan, with an average annual flow of 1.6 billion cubic meters. The average annual flow of the dam site is 1.064 billion cubic meters, and the Japanese technician Yoichi Hata, who designed Jianan Dazhen in the early days, used the upstream of Guantian Creek, a tributary of Zengwen Creek, to build the Wushantou Reservoir, and set up a dam in Tai Po Creek to draw water through the tunnel to the Wushantou Reservoir to supply farmland irrigation in the Jianan area, but its water intake rate was only 25% of the total flow (according to the Zengwen Reservoir Construction Record, before the construction of the Zengwen Reservoir, the original water used in the Wushantou Reservoir was 330 million cubic meters). Therefore, if the dam was built directly at Tai Po Creek, the mainstream of Tsang Man Creek, and operated in tandem with the Wushan Tau Reservoir, the amount of irrigation could be increased, so in 1939, Hatta Yoichi proposed to build a dam at the site of the current dam, but it was abandoned due to war.

Bills were easier to pass after debate with the chairman or committees, and the members themselves were asked not to reflect the party's ideology in the agenda, and after the 2000 reform, the committee clearly had to move closer to the Kremlin authorities, making important bills easy to pass to meet the Kremlin's demands.

Because the life history of cryptofungi is still poorly understood, it is not clear whether most species can have both cell surface parasitism and intracellular parasitism, so the form and life history of Lodza are not necessarily atypical.

Because fantasy novels mostly come from online writers, they are published on the Internet at the same time as they are written, and they often change their style to adapt to the audience during the serialization process (because of the possibility of instant opinions, so they are more like the audience than the reader), these changes may make the content of the novel often inconsistent, but as long as the plot arrangement is brilliant and reasonable, there is no need to deliberately distinguish the category of the work, and the weight of the chapter theme can also be used as a distinction. Each chapter can be classified as a fantasy novel if it is thematically limited to a fictional world and only adds a few other unconventional plots; If the chapter revolves around martial arts and science fiction and magic is only used as embellishment, it is more recognized as a fantasy novel.

This is not reasonable, because a good nib is often a high-grade fountain pen and has a certain weight, and secondly, when writing, you need to press the nib hard to make a rough effect, but the atom pen only puts the paper on a soft material to write, but also can do, the atom pen often has a better effect on hard pen calligraphy, and the space to play is greater, but to have a certain degree of understanding of different writing skills, the writer needs to have more observation, pen calligraphy needs speed, because water-based ink nibs can not write too slowly and stop at one point too long, This alone is far less portable than an atom pen, and the only advantage of a fountain pen is that the ink color is brighter than an atomic pen.

Chapter I
Hao Ren, as his name suggests, is a good person.
His family lives in a little-known northern town, if Beijing plans to build a twenty rings and thirty rings, it can barely be regarded as the foot of the Son of Heaven, if the good guy card under the whole world is counted on his head according to the homophony, it can barely be regarded as famous in the world, walking on the road no one knows, with a square face that is ordinary except a little masculine, the goal of life is to be a good person, otherwise there is no feature - this is him.
Although the weather in the north is cooler, it is very irritable to walk on the road against the big sun during the day, so the busy city center can see all kinds of vehicles rushing everywhere, but you can't see how many pedestrians are walking outside, and a tall young man wearing a white T-shirt, gray trousers, and an ordinary face is one of these few pedestrians.
Hao Ren feels that the students in this year are becoming more and more disengaged, and when he was working outside to distribute folds, he would never stuff this kind of thing into the hands of the gentlemen who could see at a glance that it was a bachelor, but anyway, this hard folding fan is quite suitable.
"The last two, if it doesn't work, forget it." Hao Ren muttered and looked at the last two recruitment advertisements in his hand, fortunately, these two places are next to each other, he can quickly complete today's "task", and one of them is in front, is an advertising company that absolutely does not show much strength from the outside, but the signboard at the door is loud: Galaxy Media pan-cultural development and promotion company, as soon as I hear this name, it will be poured within half a year, Hao Ren came for this name at that time, the main purpose is not to apply, I just want to see what a strange person the owner of a company that can come up with such a magical name is.
He walked hundreds of meters with great interest to bypass the barrier of the road, and then ran to the door of this advertising agency with a special name against the big sun, and was surprised to find that the company had indeed closed, the signboard at the door was still hanging, but the glass door was posted with a notice of closure, the date was two days ago, and the job posting in his hand was four days ago... This is really a world that changes frequently, do you have to recruit two new employees two days before the company closes this year?
Conveniently rubbed the recruitment notice of the advertising company into a ball and threw it into the trash can on the side of the road, Hao Ren looked down at the last copy, and two seconds later crumpled it into a ball and threw it into the same place, by the way, reflecting on whether he was blind when he screened this thing two days ago - a clerk in the recruitment office of the bus company, requiring twenty-five to forty years old, able to bear hardships and stand hard work, computer experience, work experience is preferred, gender female.
He came to the city center with this gadget in hand, just to see how bright the glass door of an advertising agency that was busy recruiting workers two days before the closure was and could barely eat.
Hao Ren, gender male, love female, age twenty-five, no ** hobbies, the advantage is not picky eaters, currently single, few relatives and friends, he lives alone in the old house left by his parents in the old town of the south of the city, like most young men, his life goal is to achieve a monthly income of more than 10,000 at the age of twenty-five, marry a beautiful daughter-in-law, if you can, it is best to have a car, parents are unable to be filial, so at least you must live well enough to not be a shame at home, Now a third of this series of life goals has been accomplished: he is twenty-five this year.
It's a sad story.
He came to the city today to look for a job, but in fact, he personally did not have any urgent need for a source of livelihood: as mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lived in an old house left by his parents, and he should thank the older generation for the family business, at least this house is quite large - it is a two-story old-fashioned house that has been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For several years, Hao Ren has been living by renting out houses, but because the place where he lives is so remote, even so remote that it may take several ten-year plans to wait for the demolition of the old house.
To be fair, with this kind of stable income, Hao Ren does not need to come out to find any work, but this person, too long idle time is a little pretentious, always feel that he should work a little harder, open up a path of life, plus more important reasons - his old house is too remote, biased to the extent of almost out of human civilization, since the last migrant couple moved from the rental house, no one has come to rent a house for half a year, looking at the two-story "apartment" that has been empty for several months, Hao Ren realized one thing from the bottom of his heart: unless the municipal planning is tilted towards him, I am afraid that if he wants to survive, he will really have to come out and find a job.
After studying urban planning at home for three days, Hao Ren thought that the possibility of his home becoming a commercial center overnight was really unlikely, considering that as a big man could not abandon himself, he finally decided to find a job first, at least have an income to support himself.
How to say that he was also a hardworking and good man who worked to earn tuition back then, and Lang Lang Qiankun could still starve himself to death?
However, fate does not depend on human will, and he basically ran blindly outside on this first day... That's all that's left to run away.
It was useless to think so much, Hao Ren stretched his waist and decided to rest under the shade benches in the small park on the roadside, wait for the hottest hour at noon and then go to find a small restaurant to fill his stomach, and then take the car home.
Even if the economy is developing rapidly, it can still maintain a little bit of leisure and openness. He found a piece of paper to wipe the bench clean, then lay down loudly, covered his face with the foldout with the logo of the women's hospital and the beautiful girl to block the sun, and rested without care.
But just as if he had not been lying down for a minute, the sunlight shining through the edge of the fold had dimmed down, as if someone had come to him. Hao Ren slightly deliberately showed his face, and was shocked to find that the sky was already setting sun, and a petite and slender female figure was standing next to him, this figure just blocked the already sinking sunset, because against the relationship of the light could not see the appearance of this woman, and could only confirm through a dim silhouette that the other party was a slender girl with short hair.
"Oh, are you awake?"
At this time, the strange girl seemed to finally realize that her position against the light made it difficult to see her appearance, so she grinned and turned slightly sideways so that the other party could see her appearance clearly.
A very beautiful girl - this is Hao Ren's first impression.
This self-cooked girl has short hair with a shawl, probably likes sports, her skin is slightly wheat-colored, healthy and full of sunshine, her appearance is beautiful and lovely, the most noticeable thing is that a pair of smart big eyes, more vibrant than any pair of eyes Hao Ren has ever seen, as if the whole person's spirit is going to come out of these eyes.
Behind her is a large suitcase that looks quite weighty.
Looking at Hao Ren, who was a little stunned, this beautiful girl with short hair bloomed an unprecedented brilliant silly smile (although it seems a little inappropriate to say this, but Hao Ren does think that this is a silly smile), the smile is clean and pure, and now it seems that it has rarely been seen on the faces of girls of the same age in this year, the other party fumbled hard in the small bag he carried for a long time, and finally felt out a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Hao Ren: "Lao Jiao, do you know where this place is?" ”
Hao Ren patted his face to sober himself up, and didn't care what was going on with this reckless girl, but looked down at the address on the paper... Eh, I'm not going to my own home?
Chapter 1
The shimmer of the morning pierced the inky blue sky, and the vast sky was pale with a fish's belly.
Xianyu County, Martial Sect Academy, in the back mountain forest, a thin boy wearing a loose martial robe, squatting with the tip of his tongue against his teeth, his whole body strength concentrated on the left and right two punches, slamming thick trees.
The fist technique is smooth, free to retract, the inner strength is contained without spitting, just in the middle with softness, and there is already a bit of fire.
The boy's name is Su Yu, fourteen years old, beautiful and handsome, with a tall posture and childishness.
The black hair fluttered lightly, and a pair of eyes as vast as the stars and as deep as the ancient starry sky, showed wisdom that did not match his age.
Three hours later, the sun was high in the sun.
Su Yu stopped punching, looked down at the bloodstained fists, and sighed softly: "I have worked twice as hard as others, but the effect I have gained is less than half of the one with the best qualifications." ”
"When I come to another world, I really don't know, is it a blessing or a curse?"
Two months ago, Su Yu took a plane and unfortunately suffered a plane crash, and when he woke up, he found himself in a world called Shenyue Continent.
Become a student of a certain Martial Sect Academy in the mainland.
It took two months for him to digest the memory of the original owner.
Shenyue Continent, respecting martial arts, the weak and strong, cruel and strict.
Human beings cultivate martial arts, reach the pinnacle, and reach the transcendent realm of sainthood.
Martial arts is divided into nine layers, each of which has three levels: Xiaocheng, Dacheng, and Peak.
Beyond the nine layers of martial arts, break the shackles, and leap into a god, become a mythical figure, and be known as the "holy king on earth".
The realm of the Holy King on Earth is the ultimate in martial arts, and it is the limit pursued by hundreds of millions of human beings.
It is rumored that the holy king of the world can move mountains and fill the sea, soar clouds and drive fog, and can do anything.
A holy king on earth is enough to change the luck of a dynasty for a hundred years, and it is a god-like existence.
However, how difficult is it to cultivate in the world?
Su Yu is the supreme genius of Qingshan Town under the jurisdiction of Xianyu County, only fourteen years old, he has cultivated to the peak of martial arts, and has become a century-old wizard in the minds of everyone in Qingshan Town.
However, when he was accepted by the Immortal Feather County, the Martial Sect Academy that was above everything, Su Yu discovered what a frog he used to be.
Wuzong Academy collects all the geniuses of Xianyu County and collects them once a year.
And he, among all the geniuses of the Martial Sect Academy, was only at the bottom!
Wuzong Academy, according to qualifications, divides students into three categories.
Golden trainees, excellent level geniuses, are often the best in a city, and the top geniuses who suppress the rest of the geniuses in the city will be cultivated by the Martial Sect Academy.
Silver trainees, geniuses of the potential level, in the town, there is a superior talent, with a little effort, there may be hope.
Su Yu is a silver trainee, he knows very well, in fact, the silver trainee is a category that has no hope of cultivating to the great completion, but it is a pity to give up, and it is a pity that the food is tasteless and abandoned, and it is like a chicken rib.
Silver students are not optimistic, the cultivation resources given by the academy are very limited, and the possibility of coming out is close to zero.
"Su Yu, hurry back to the academy, Qin Guogong summoned you!" An urgent voice cut through the tranquility of the mountain forest, and a middle-aged man in blue ran up the mountain panting, with a bit of anxiety on his face.
"Duke Qin Guo, can you snub? Come with me! The middle-aged man in blue was impatient, stepped forward and grabbed Su Yu's shoulders, ignoring the pain of Su Yu's thin body, grabbed him and quickly went down the mountain.
Su Yu gritted his teeth, endured the sharp pain in his shoulder, and remained silent.
Middle-aged in blue, he is a deacon of the academy, managing day-to-day student activities and, in the words of Earth School, the director of education.
After half a cup of tea.
Academy, a luxurious and elegant lounge, exquisite as a dream.
Only core students, high-level students of the academy, and powerful people can rest here, in addition, gold students and silver students are not qualified.
Su Yu was also the first time to come to the luxurious lounge, and ordinary poor boys might be nervous when they came here. But Su Yu, in his previous life, was a business elite, a five-star hotel, a presidential suite, a luxury ball, a frequent guest, a calm mentality, and no insults.
In the lounge, there were three people, a pair of young men and women, and a man with a noble temperament and extraordinary dignity.
When his gaze swept over the fourteen-year-old girl, Su Yu's gaze paused slightly.
It was a woman with a beautiful face like an elf, her jade face was as delicate as a carving, her skin was as fair as the snow of spring, her figure was delicate, and she was dressed in a delicate white clothes, like a fox fairy, and she was very beautiful.
It's just that her gaze looking at Su Yu is cold and complicated.
Beside him was a sixteen-year-old boy, heroic, handsome, and indescribable.
"Hehe, I'm the Duke of Qin, it's nice to meet you." Duke Qin Guogong, one of the three major dukes of the Fenglin Empire, at this time, did not have any pride, but was extremely kind, and asked Su Yu to sit down with a smile.
Su Yu shook his head coldly in his heart, unmoved by the slightest kindness.
Those who are in high positions have attracted the attention of hundreds of millions of people, so they pay great attention to their own recuperation and their own image.
Just like politicians on the earth, they are obviously making trouble, but after meeting, they still shake hands and greet each other, smiling with a smile, only stabbing under the stage and making black hands.
"I am Qin Feng's father, and this time, I came for his affairs with Qing'er." Qin Guogong's handsome face appeared and smiled kindly: "I have heard Feng'er say everything, for this, I, as Feng'er's father, apologize to you." ”
Bitterness flashed in Su Yu's heart, the bitterness of another Su Yu's remnant soul. The girl in front of her, named Jiang Xueqing, was a genius who came out of Qingshan Town with Su Yu, and was also included as a student of the Martial Sect Academy.
Two childhood sweethearts, two little guesses, golden children and jade girls, a pair made in heaven and earth.
However, after entering the Wuzong Academy, Jiang Xueqing from the small village town was shocked by the huge and prosperous world and gradually became fascinated by the flashy world.
With her fox-fairy-like beauty, it is difficult to avoid being sought after by young magnates and handsome geniuses.
Initially, she was able to convince herself to stick to her heart and accompany Su Yu through her first school year.
However, gradually, understanding the cruelty of the world, she gradually transformed from a naïve little girl, knowing that it would be difficult for Su Yu to have a future in the future, and following her, she was likely to suffer and become a subordinate.
Finally, her inner defenses were loose.
Two months ago, he completely broke off contact with Su Yu and became the son of Qin Guogong and the partner of Qin Feng, the Duke of Xiaoguo.
Although Jiang Xueqing scrupulously abides by her duties as a girl in a good family and has never encroached on the relationship between men and women, since then, the two have often accompanied and become inseparable, becoming a fairy couple envied in everyone's eyes.
And Su Yu became the laughing stock of the Martial Sect Academy.
Su Yu was shocked, and begged Jiang Xueqing to change his mind many times, and did not hesitate to kneel and plead, losing face, but was coldly rejected by Jiang Xueqing.
Su Yu couldn't bear the great tragedy and fall of life, and committed suicide by throwing himself into the lake, and it happened that Su Yu of the earth had an air crash, and his soul crossed into him, a pathetic and pitiful weakling.
Qin Guogong saw Su Yu fall into memories, only when he couldn't give up his friendship for Jiang Xueqing, sighed: "Feng'er is young and insensible, his fault, I am willing to pay compensation, what do you want, although mention, but, as a father, I hope you can complete Feng'er, he is serious about Xueqing girl." ”
Listening to Qin Guogong's seemingly heartfelt words, Su Yu secretly shook his head in his heart, this trick, it is okay to deceive ordinary people, it is useless to him.
Snatched my girlfriend and made me perfect? Where is this to apologize, it is clear that it is overwhelming!
Qin Guogong seemed to have a gentle attitude, but he was actually full of naked insults.
Let me ask, if it is the woman of the monarch, the woman of the emperor, and is favored by his son, does he, the Duke of Qin, dare to let the monarch give his woman to Qin Feng? He didn't dare, because he couldn't afford to provoke the monarch, he could only afford to provoke a commoner like Su Yu!
Su Yu shook his head lightly, got up and wanted to leave, he had no nostalgia for a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing, even if Qin Guogong did not overpower people, he did not intend to compete for her.
As for Qin Guogong's so-called compensation, although Su Yu lacked cultivation resources, although he was a poor boy, he had nothing. However, he still has a will not to admit defeat, and he has not yet fallen to the point of being given alms.
Jiang Xueqing understood the character of "Su Yu", stubbornly did not admit defeat, saw that he wanted to leave, only when he still refused to give up, the silver teeth bit lightly, the lotus step moved gently, and the snow eyes were like a cold moon: "Su Yu!" Please respect my choice! ”
"Since it is today, I will speak completely and hope that you will die." Jiang Xueqing's eyes flashed with coldness.
"Qin Fenggui is a small country, he will be a pillar of the empire in the future, he can give me glory and wealth, you are a poor boy in a mountain village, can you give it to me?"
"Qin Feng is honored as a golden student, and in the future, he will catch up with the holy king of the world, standing above hundreds of millions of people, can give me a sense of security, you are a silver student, can you give it?"
"Su Yu, accept the reality, I don't deny it, once you were my attachment, the most dazzling genius in my mind, but, that is I am too young, too simple, the real world, cruel and real, I have no choice!"
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last trace of concern in his eyes, stared at Su Yu's gaze, gradually distant, as if looking at a stranger, and sighed softly: "Brother Feng is very good, as long as you promise not to look for me again in the future, he will try his best to compensate you, give you a few Spirit Melting Treasure Pills, promote cultivation, your strength has improved, and your life in school will be much better." ”
After thinking about it, Jiang Xueqing took out a palm-sized statue of a woman carved in crystal from her sleeve.
Crystal clear, shimmering brilliantly deep. The most beautiful thing is that the woman of the crystal statue is ethereal and beautiful, like a fox fairy, so beautiful as a fairy, so obsessive.
The appearance of the statue woman is lifelike, and it is no different from the owner who holds it, Jiang Xueqing.
"This is your promise gift to me, and now, return it to you, we, and never owe each other." Jiang Xueqing mercilessly stuffed the statue in Su Yu's hands, turned back to Qin Feng's side, looked out of the sky, no longer looked at Su Yu, and was cold.
"Chi Yao, I treat you like a beloved, why did you kill me?"
Zhang Ruochen roared, wanted to pounce forward, pressed the gilded bed "creaked", and sat up suddenly.
Finding that it was just a dream, Zhang Ruochen let out a long breath and wiped the sweat beads on his forehead with his sleeve.
No!
That was not a dream!
How could everything that happened between him and Princess Chi Yao be a dream?
Zhang Ruochen was originally the only son of "Emperor Ming", one of the nine emperors of the Kunlun Realm, and at the age of sixteen, he cultivated to the great consummation of the Heavenly Extreme Realm with his heaven-defying physique.
However, just when he became the first person of the younger generation in the Kunlun world, he died at the hands of his childhood sweetheart, Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chi Yao is the daughter of "Green Emperor", one of the nine emperors.
Emperor Ming and Emperor Qing are the best friends, and Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao are even married to each other, growing up together and cultivating together.
A heroic and sassy and a beautiful woman can be called a golden boy and jade girl, which could have become a good story in the cultivation world. Zhang Ruochen never expected that Princess Chi Yao would actually make a move on him!
After dying at the hands of Princess Chi Yao, when Zhang Ruochen woke up again, he found that he was already eight hundred years later.
The former Princess Chi Yao, calmed the Rebellion of the Nine Emperors, unified the Nine Kingdoms, established the First Central Empire, and became the master of the entire Kunlun Realm - Empress Chi Yao.
Eight hundred years ago, the Nine Emperors, who dominated the Kunlun Realm, completely became the past and disappeared into the long river of history.
The Nine Emperors are dead, and the empress is erected.
In this era, there is only one emperor, that is, Empress Chi Yao, who rules the world and threatens all directions.
"Why did she kill me?
How can her heart be so cruel, or is a woman's heart so cruel? Zhang Ruochen's eyes were sharp, his heart was as heavy as iron, and he was full of questions. However, there was no one to help him answer.
Eight hundred years have passed, and it has long been vicissitudes, and things are different from people, except for Empress Chi Yao, who has cultivated peerlessly, her youth is still the same, not old and immortal.
Those old people have all turned into loess and turned into white bones. Even the majestic Nine Emperors of those years have all disappeared in the world, leaving only a glorious story that will be recited by future generations for a long time.
"Squeak!"
A beautiful woman in palace costume with a weak body pushed the door from outside and walked in, looking at Zhang Ruochen sitting on the bed, with concerned eyes, "Chen'er, you have nightmares again?" ”
The beautiful woman in front of her is the princess of the king of Yunwu County, and Zhang Ruochen's mother-in-law, Concubine Lin.
The original owner of this body, because of his weak health, died on the bed three days ago.
After Zhang Ruochen was killed by Princess Chi Yao, he woke up again and appeared in this body, bringing the originally sick teenager back to life.
Even more coincidentally, the original owner of this body is also called Zhang Ruochen. When Zhang Ruochen just woke up, he was still very repulsive to Concubine Lin.
After all, in Zhang Ruochen's eyes, Concubine Lin was just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Ruochen gradually found that Concubine Lin really cared about him very much, and simply took care of him, and when he saw Zhang Ruochen having a nightmare, he was awakened, and he immediately rushed to Zhang Ruochen's room regardless of the cold.
In the last life, Zhang Ruochen had never seen his biological mother. It is said that she died when she was born!
Unexpectedly, after being killed by Princess Chi Yao, he was reborn in this body, which actually gave him an extra mother and felt the warmth of maternal love. "Maybe she doesn't know that her own dust died three days ago!"
If she had been told the truth, she might not have been able to withstand the blow of this bad news.
Zhang Ruochen looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes softened, and he smiled slightly: "Mother, don't worry about me, it's just a dream." ”
Concubine Lin's thin body was draped in a jujube-red hooded mink fur, sitting on the edge of Zhang Ruochen's bed, stroking Zhang Ruochen's forehead, and said worriedly: "It's been three nights, and you have always been awakened by nightmares, and every time you call the name 'Chi Yao'." Who is she? ”
Concubine Lin naturally couldn't associate the name "Chi Yao" with the empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after Empress Chi Yao unified the Kunlun Realm and established the First Central Empire, she was known as the "Great Power and Great Virtue Female Holy Emperor", and no one dared to mention the word "Chi Yao" at all.
There will be taboos. Zhang Ruochen said, "It's nothing, mother, you heard it wrong!" ”
Concubine Lin sighed and said, "In the future, don't call the word 'Chi Yao' again, even in a dream, that is the name of the empress." Calling the empress by her name is disrespectful, and once it is heard by someone with a heart, she will be executed. ”
Zhang Ruochen nodded, squeezed his fingers tightly, and said with deep meaning: "Absolutely not!" “
In the future, I will be her nightmare.
Concubine Lin looked at Zhang Ruochen, who was thin and pale, and sighed softly, her heart was extremely sad.
Although he was born in the family of the county king, he has been weak and sick since he was a child, he is sixteen years old, and he can only lie in bed all year round, I am afraid that this life can only be like this!
Outside, there was a sound of messy footsteps.
"What are you doing?
A delicate-looking maid wanted to stop the eighth prince who broke in, but was gently pushed by the eighth prince and fell more than ten meters away. The Eighth Prince is a martial artist, cultivating to reach the late stage of the Yellow Pole Realm, and a palm strike is enough to knock a three-hundred-pound stone plate out ten zhang away, let alone just a hundred-pound maid?
With a flick of her finger, she can be ejected and flying.
The maid screamed, fell heavily to the ground, and broke her left arm.
The eighth prince was dressed in a golden robe, with a jade belt wrapped around his waist, a strong body, slender arms, and a steady step, walked into the Jade Shu Palace, and stared at the maid coldly, "A slave also dares to block the way of this prince, it is really looking for death." ”
Behind the Eighth Prince, followed by six guards wearing Linpi armor, with tall bodies and tiger backs, obviously all of them were martial arts cultivators with strong combat power, belonging to the palace's guards.
After hearing the movement outside and calming Zhang Ruochen's emotions, Concubine Lin closed the door and walked out.
She stared at the Eighth Prince standing outside, frowned slightly, and said, "Your Royal Highness the Eighth Prince, this is the Jade Palace, even if you are a prince, you can't break in!" ”
Eighth Prince Zhang Ji raised his head to stare at Concubine Lin, and said loudly: "The queen has an order, and the dormitory of Concubine Lin and the ninth brother will be changed to the 'Ziyi Partial Hall'." In the future, the owner of the Yushu Palace will be Prince Ben's biological mother Xiao Concubine Niangniang. ”
Concubine Lin's face changed slightly, she had long expected this day to come, but she did not expect it to come so quickly.
Concubine Lin smiled miserably and said, "Is the queen going to drive our mother and son out of the Jade Palace so soon?" All right!
My mother said that she wanted to enter the Yushu Palace tonight. Please Concubine Lin Niangniang move to the side hall now!" ”
The eighth prince smiled coldly, and said unceremoniously: "Concubine Lin, there are many poor people in this world, but not everyone is worthy of pity." Since the ninth brother is weak and sick, what is he still living in the world for? ”
"He's your ninth brother!"
Concubine Lin wanted to say something more, but suddenly, the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruochen's body was weak, and he could barely stand by supporting the doorpost with his hand, staring at the eighth prince not far away.
His seemingly weak body seemed to contain an unyielding will, and said, "Don't ask for them, we will move away now." ”
"Chen'er, why did you get out of bed? It's cold outside, and it's not time to go back. Concubine Lin hurriedly stepped forward to help Zhang Ruochen, for fear that he would catch the wind cold.
Concubine Lin looked at Zhang Ruochen's firm eyes, and seemed to be infected by his emotions, and nodded tearfully.
Concubine Lin and Sam supported Zhang Ruochen and walked out of the Jade Palace step by step, except for the maid who was pushed out by the Eighth Prince and broke her arm.
None of the other servants followed them out of the Jade Palace. Everyone could see that Concubine Lin and the Ninth Prince had completely lost their power, and it was difficult for them to gain a foothold in the County King Mansion.
Originally, they were the servants of the Jade Palace, but now they naturally chose to stay in the Jade Palace, all to please the new master of the Eighth Prince.
Ziyi partial hall, generally the place where the princess who has fallen out of favor lives, is very remote, full of fallen leaves, and it seems that no one has lived for a long time.
The night was deep and the wind was cold.
Sitting on the cold stone bench, Zhang Ruochen's thin body was wrapped in a coat, but he still felt the cold.
"This physical body is too weak, only by cultivating martial arts can the body gradually become stronger.
Otherwise, even if I am the son of the county king now, I can still only be at the mercy of others. Zhang Ruochen thought to himself.
Eight hundred years have passed, and Zhang Ruochen doesn't know where he can go now?
Since the heavens arranged for him to be reborn in this body, whether it was to take revenge on Empress Chi Yao in the future, or for the sake of the mother who took care of him in every way, he must become strong. The humiliation and cold treatment suffered today are entirely because they are too weak to resist, unable to control their own destiny, and even the place where they live has been forcibly occupied by others.
If you want to be respected by others and get a warm and comfortable living environment, you must become a warrior and prove your ability.
In the Kunlun world, if you want to become a warrior, you must first open the "Divine Martial Mark".
The so-called "divine martial arts mark" is the qualification given by the gods to human beings to cultivate martial arts.
Those who do not open the "Divine Martial Mark" will never be able to cultivate True Qi and become a strong person between heaven and earth. Zhang Ruochen is sixteen years old, and he still hasn't opened the "Divine Martial Mark".
After the age of sixteen, he missed the best age for cultivating martial arts, and even if he opened the "Divine Martial Mark", he could not achieve much.
They are also the sons of the king of Yunwu County, why can the eighth prince be superior? Able to drive Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin out of the Jade Shu Palace?
It is because the eighth prince opened the "Divine Martial Mark" when he was ten years old, and he is now a young warrior in the late stage of the Yellow Pole Realm.
"As long as I open the 'Divine Martial Seal', I can cultivate the Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra.
With the mysteries of the Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra, even if I have missed the best cultivation age, it is still possible to catch up with other geniuses and become a martial arts powerhouse again. The Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra is the supreme treasure book for Emperor Ming's cultivation, and apart from Emperor Ming, only Zhang Ruochen knows the complete cultivation method of the Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra.
"Tomorrow is the sacrificial ceremony, I hope to be recognized by the gods and open the 'Divine Martial Mark'."
Zhang Ruochen clenched his fists, full of desire to open the "Divine Martial Mark".
After Concubine Lin cleaned up the room, she came over to help Zhang Ruochen, "Chen'er, you should rest early!" Tomorrow, I will go to the festival. ”
"Don't worry, I will definitely be able to open the 'Divine Martial Mark' tomorrow!" Zhang Ruochen said.
"Hmm!
Concubine Lin took a deep look at Zhang Ruochen and sighed softly in her heart.
Chapter I
With a "bang", a rusty iron door was opened, and the remnants of the iron door were blocked back by the surrounding ancient buildings.
After a dozen breaths, a young man with his head pulled was dragged out of the iron gate by the arms of two jailers. The young man with his head stretched his head seemed to have no breath, and even his arms were thin and only bones remained. From the bloodstained and tattered clothes on his body, you can see what kind of torture and torture this young man has suffered.
The thin man was thrown to the ground by two jailers, splashed with some dust, and then remained motionless.
"This kid should be dead, right?" A stocky jailer asked, staring at the young man who was motionless on the ground.
The other jailer snorted, "It should be dead, who let him not know whether he is dead or alive, and dares to be rude to Miss Jian." Now it's good, not only has Ningfu been destroyed, but he himself can be regarded as relieved and deserves it. ”
"Elder, speak carefully, let's drag him out and deal with it first." The stocky jailer hurriedly admonished.
Hearing the words of this short and fat jailer, the other jailer called the old council involuntarily shrunk his head, and was about to pull up the man who had no breath on the ground and prepare to drag him away.
At this moment, a somewhat weak voice shouted on the side, "Two eldest brothers, I want to take my husband away." ”
The two talking jailers then saw a woman wearing a coarse linen robe standing on the side, and although this woman was wearing coarse linen, she could still vaguely see her good demeanor. The only regret was that her face was disfigured and obscured by slightly messy hair, making people reluctant to look a second time.
The two jailers recognized who this woman was, and it was one of the only two remaining living mouths of the Ning family.
Ning Gao is the housekeeper of Ningfu, and when Ningfu was raided, he left Cangqin abroad to have an accident, so he escaped. And this woman is the daughter-in-law of Ning Mansion, and the wife of this thin man who has just been thrown out of prison, called Concubine Ji Luo.
She escaped because she stayed in the Cangqin Two-Star Academy. Of course, this is also because Concubine Ji Luo has little to do with the Ning family, and the reason why she married into the Ning family is because the Ning family and the Ji family are family friends, and she and Ning Cheng have been married since childhood. It's just that the Ji family fell in the most inexplicable way, and in the end, only a disfigured Ji Luofei remained.
Even so, Ning Cheng's grandfather Ning Hongchang still took Concubine Ji Luo into the mansion. Ready to wait for Ning Cheng to really gather qi, and then let the two become married.
"Okay, okay, drag it away, it's ugly to die here." The stocky jailer put away the silver coin and said with an impatient wave of his hand.
They were going to dispose of Ning Cheng's corpse, but they couldn't think of someone coming to deal with it, and also gave silver coins, this kind of good thing, of course, they would not refuse.
When Concubine Ji Luo heard this, she quickly carried Ning Cheng on her back, increased her speed, and quickly disappeared from the prison gate.
"If this Ji Luo Concubine is not disfigured, she is also a beautiful embryo." Looking at Concubine Ji Luofei's back, another jailer threw the silver coin in his hand and said in a judgmental tone.
"Don't talk nonsense, that Ji Luo Concubine is also a person from the Cangqin Two-Star Academy, even if it is ugly, it will not be our turn." The stocky jailer patted the talking jailer on the shoulder and pulled him through the iron gate again.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled an extremely pleasant fragrance, and the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a white neck. The next moment, Ning Xiaocheng reacted, he was being carried by a woman, and the fragrance was emitted from the woman carrying him.
No, he remembered that after being rejected by Tian Muwan, he was in a very bad mood, and as a result, he went the wrong way and walked to the elevated road alone. Then a yellow glow from the sky hit him, and then there was no more.
Could it be that he is not dead yet? What the hell is going on here?
As soon as Ning Xiaocheng thought of this, all kinds of information flooded into his mind, and he was actually reborn.
What shocked Ning Xiaocheng was that the body he was reborn in turned out to be called Ning Cheng. The reason why he was shocked was because his original name was also Ning Cheng.
It's just that he often has nightmares that he sees himself in a very strange place, secretly put in prison, and then tortured to death. Although it was just a dream, Ning Cheng still changed his name to Ning Xiaocheng.
Unexpectedly, he still called Ning Cheng, and he was really reborn in the environment of his dream.
Ning Xiaocheng wanted to raise his hand to wipe the cold sweat on his forehead, but the woman carrying him glanced back and didn't say much.
"Sorry, I don't have the strength to walk." Seeing that the woman looked back at herself, Ning Xiaocheng said a little apologetically.
"The Ning family is gone, and you are already lucky that you are alive." The woman's tone was calm, it seemed that even if Ning Xiaocheng was really dead, she had this calm attitude.
Ning Xiaocheng fell silent, just now he had sorted out some fragmentary information. He should have called back Ning Cheng again now, and he was the Duding of the Ning family of Cangqin Kingdom.
Ning Cheng's parents went to the Mango Sea area to look for spiritual objects when Ning Cheng was very young, and then did not return. Ning Cheng has been following his grandfather Ning Hongchang to live in Cangle City, the capital of the Cangqin Kingdom. Although Ningfu is big, there are not many people.
Of course, Ning Cheng also became the first person in Ning Mansion, and Ning Hongchang never cared about Ning Cheng. All the bad things that Ning Cheng did in Cangle City were borne by Ning Hongchang. Cangle City is full of princes and noble qi, and although Ning Hongchang is also the elder of the Cangqin Kingdom, he is still a little worse than those princes and noble qi.
Finally, one day, Ning Cheng provoked a basket that even he couldn't bear. He actually offended Jian Sujie, the palm pearl of the Jian family of the Cangqin Kingdom, don't say that the Jian family is something that the Ning family can't provoke, even Jian Sujie's fiancé Qiu Yingguang, the Ning family can't afford to provoke.
Ning Cheng thought of this and sighed. The result he couldn't provoke was, of course, he was put in prison, and his grandfather Ning Hongchang exhausted his connections and family wealth in order to save him, but he was not bailed out, but took the entire Ning family in. This news was still learned by his predecessor from the mouth of the jailer, and it can be said that the Ning family was also destroyed because of him.
After Ning Cheng sorted these things out, he sighed again in his heart, there is no reason in this world, whoever has the biggest fist is reasonable.
At the same time, he also understood who this person behind his back was, and this disfigured woman was his fiancée, named Ji Luofei, somewhat similar to a child bride on Earth.
Later, the Ji family inexplicably declined, leaving only a disfigured Concubine Ji Luo. But Ning Cheng's grandfather Ning Hongchang still took Concubine Ji Luo to the Ning family, ready to wait for Ning Cheng to gather qi and help the two consummate their marriage.
Ning Hongchang indulged Ning Cheng in other matters, but he would never give in on the matter of marrying Concubine Ji Luo. The original Ning Cheng was very dissatisfied with the disfigured Ji Luofei, and often hit and scolded, but fortunately, Ji Luofei was submissive and would never refute anything to Ning Cheng. Moreover, Ji Luofei is different from Ning Cheng, she has qualifications and can cultivate.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he entered the Cangqin Two-Star Academy, and was already a cultivator of the third layer of gathering qi. In the Cangqin Kingdom, anyone who can cultivate is called a cultivator.
At this time, Concubine Ji Luo had already carried him into an extremely low black stone house. Although the black stone house is low, the area is not very small, at least there should be it. There is even a small courtyard with a deep well in it.
Even if it was related to himself, Ning Cheng had to figure this matter out. Although he guessed that the Jian family and the Qiu family did it, he had to ask a little more clearly.
"Why ask me about what you do yourself?" Concubine Ji Luo replied simply, and put Ning Cheng down.
After that, she poured another cup of water and fed it to Ning Cheng, and then said: "I'll go and boil water for you to bathe, and forget some things, you know it's not good for you." ”
Ning Cheng watched Concubine Ji Luo go in to boil water, and did not continue to ask, he understood what Concubine Ji Luo meant. With his ability, the more he knows, the faster he dies.
I don't know if Concubine Ji Luo added something to that glass of water, Ning Cheng felt that after drinking this cup of water, the whole person recovered some strength.
Ning Cheng sat on the old wooden bed, thinking of his current situation in his mind, and then thinking of his sister Ning Ruolan. At the same time, he really didn't understand why Tian Muwan treated him like that, according to his understanding of Tian Muwan, Tian Muwan was definitely not the kind of snobbish girl.
Chapter 1
Chu Li sailed on the lake, the lake breeze was blowing, refreshing and refreshing.
Duke Yiguo's Mansion is a huge lake of ten thousand hectares, ninety-nine islands, and the Yanwu Hall he is going to is eighteen miles away from the East Garden.
On the boat, he was of medium stature, wearing a green shirt, his appearance was ordinary but quite heroic, looking at the vast lake, his thoughts drifted away.
Nineteen years, two months and three days, already nineteen years, two months and three days!
A high-energy physics researcher, a promising student, a future big scientist, a small mistake in the experiment, came to this world after the explosion, reincarnated and reincarnated as a human being!
"Bang!" The muffled sound broke his musings, and he turned his head to see a golden carp beating non-stop on the boat.
Chu Li shook his head and bent down to throw the carp back into the lake. Standing up, a tall building came into his eyes.
The hundred-meter-tall building, shimmering bronze light, thick and heavy, shows the majesty of the Guogong Mansion.
This bronze high-rise building is the Hall of Performing Martial Arts!
In front of the martial arts hall is an open martial arts training ground, red mud paved ground, hundreds of people practicing, or practicing swords, swords, fists, palms, or mutual competition, lively and lively.
Chu left the boat ashore, stepped on the martial arts training ground, and after taking a few steps, a handsome young man suddenly flashed, his face was like a crown jade, his eyebrows were like a sword, and his expression was bright.
He was long, Gao Chu was one head away, hugging his shoulders and looking down at him: "The surname Chu, what are you doing here?!" ”
Chu Li frowned: "Get out of the way, good dogs don't get in the way!" ”
The handsome young man smiled and said, "Could it be that you want to practice martial arts?" ”
Chu Li suddenly smiled and continued to walk forward: "Zhuo Feiyang, I fell to the ground and screamed, believe it or not, you can't eat and go?" ”
Private fighting is forbidden and cannibalism is forbidden, and the guards are divided into guards and guards, one weapon and one text, and the two are especially forbidden to fight privately, and the light is reduced to the degraded, and the heavy is expelled from the house.
Chu Li is an unqualified guard, Zhuo Feiyang is an eight-grade guard, and it is a taboo for the guard to do something to the guard, he fell to the ground and screamed, and Zhuo Feiyang will be severely punished no matter how genius he is.
Zhuo Fei raised his sword and frowned: "The surname Chu, okay, shameless enough!" Chu Li continued to walk forward.
Zhuo Feiyang took a step sideways, with a gloomy and handsome face: "The surname Chu, you can only use these small means!" ”
Chu Li smiled and said, "To deal with such a fool like you, small means are enough!" ”
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him deadly, his fists clenched tighter and tighter, as if he would swing out in the next moment, but Chu Li looked at him lazily, full of provocative taste.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly showed a bright smile and raised his hand vigorously: "Junior Sister Zhao!" ”
In the distance, a graceful and beautiful girl walked over, her skin was snowy, apricot eyes and willow eyebrows, her temperament was gentle, and she was as gentle as water.
Chu Li's face changed slightly, Zhao Ying, entering the house at the same time as them, beautiful, kind, and gentle, is the kind of woman that men will like when they see it.
"Senior Brother Zhuo?" Zhao Ying walked over lightly and said in surprise, "Senior Brother Chu? ”
Chu Li sniffed the faint fragrance she brought and smiled: "Junior Sister Zhao, I haven't seen you for a long time." ”
Since he was assigned to the East Garden, he has spent most of his time going to the library building, wanting to use knowledge to change his fate, and rarely come to the martial arts hall.
This time I came to the martial arts hall because I encountered problems in cultivating the small washing pulse technique, and I wanted to see the secrets and cultivation notes related to the small washing pulse technique.
Zhao Ying said with a smile: "Senior Brother Chu, congratulations, the East Garden is a beautiful thing." ”
Chu Li smiled and nodded: "It's not bad." ”
The East Garden directly belongs to the third young lady Xiao Qi's Yuqi Island, only he and Li Yue are the two guards, not only leisurely, but also have the opportunity to meet the third young lady, once the third young lady green eyes, the flying yellow is just around the corner.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath, this guy was lucky, he actually entered the East Garden, God is too eye-opening, he has to clean him up!
"Junior Sister Zhao, take care of this waste, I just practiced the delusional sword technique yesterday, let's have a discussion?"
Zhao Ying frowned, feeling that Zhuo Feiyang spoke ugly.
"Okay, don't say he is waste!" Zhuo Feiyang hurriedly smiled and glanced at Chu Li: "Although he is a waste!" ”
Zhao Ying's eyes widened in dissatisfaction.
"Junior Sister Zhao, it's okay," Chu Li smiled and said, "There is no need to worry about this kind of arrogant fool. ”
"Senior Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying said with disdain.
Chu Li stretched out his hand to make a surrender gesture: "Junior Sister Zhao, come to the East Garden to play, the scenery is very beautiful, and Brother Li's cooking skills are also excellent." ”
"Hmph, what is there to see!" Zhuo Feiyang pouted: "But it's just flowers and plants, it's better to practice martial arts when you have that time, and the plaything loses its will!" "According to what you said, the third young lady and the eldest prince are both playthings, so why not you?" Chu Li seemed to be smiling, and the West Garden belonged to Xiao Tieying, the eldest prince.
Zhuo Feiyangjun's face turned red, sneered, and decided not to fight with him.
"Senior Brother Zhuo! Senior Brother Chu! Zhao Ying said with dissatisfaction: "You guys stop for a while!" ...... Senior Brother Chu, I will go over to play, if you have something to do, get busy first. ”
Chu Li looked at her deeply: "Junior Sister Zhao, there are people who have a good skin, it will take a long time to see people's hearts, Junior Sister don't trust others easily!" ”
"The surname Chu, what do you mean!"
Chu Li ignored him and smiled at Zhao Ying and hugged his fist.
Zhao Ying turned and left.
Zhuo Feiyang was busy to keep up, and before leaving, he suddenly stretched out his hand while Zhao Ying was not paying attention.
He almost slapped Chu Li in the face, very confident that Chu Li didn't have time to avoid it, seemingly not paying attention, but he was transporting internal force, and the speed was extremely fast.
Chu Li gently turned his head, Zhuo Feiyang's fingertips brushed against his cheeks, he could feel the breeze, and the power of this palm was not light.
"Snap!"
A crisp and loud slap sounded.
Chu Li slapped his left palm on his face, crisp and loud, with little force, and the sound was very loud, and then quickly stopped.
Zhao Ying hurriedly turned her head to look. Chu Li's expression remained unchanged, as if this palm was not on his face.
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him with a gloomy face. Chu Li smiled and touched his face: "It's really good kung fu, admire!" ”
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him deadly.
"Senior Brother Zhuo——!" Zhao Ying sank her jade face.
"I can't help it, I really didn't mean to." Zhuo Feiyang gritted his teeth, his voice squeezed out between his teeth, and said coldly: "Presumably Junior Brother Chu won't care, right, Junior Brother Chu?" ”
Chu Li turned his head and smiled, "Junior Sister Zhao, forget it." ”
Zhao Ying looked at him embarrassedly, hurriedly dragged Zhuo Feiyang to leave, and stayed longer, the two had to fight!
Chu Li stared at Zhao Ying's graceful back motionlessly, touched the hot left face, and activated the big round mirror wisdom to suppress the fluctuations in his heart.
If it weren't for the Great Round Mirror Wisdom, it would inevitably be secretly calculated by Zhuo Feiyang!
This world respects martial arts, deeply rooted in the concept of his heart since childhood, Zhao Ying is gentle and kind, and protects himself openly and secretly, which makes him quite moved.
But as a man, he needs the protection of women, and as a man, he really can't bear it!
He walked through the crowd in the martial arts training ground and entered the martial arts hall.
Untied the wooden sign around his waist and handed it to the young man in front of the hall, the young man's eyes were like electricity, and he glanced at it, indicating that he could enter.
In the eyes are rows of bookshelves, he walked, stopped by chance, reached out and pulled out a book, quickly flipped through it, put it back and continued walking, stopped again, and pulled out another book to flip through it.
In one hour, he flipped through twenty-two books.
It seems that he has long known the location of these books, just go and pull them out, in fact, he is coming for the first time, and the little washing technique is in the library building.
The entire hall of martial arts was presented in his mind, and the names of each row of bookshelves and books were clear and vivid.
He walked to the second floor, went directly to the third row of bookshelves, pulled out the delusional sword spectrum on the second floor, flipped it over, and then pulled out seven secret books, which were the cultivation experience of the delusional sword spectrum.
When he left the Yanwu Hall, he had already imprinted thirty secret books in his mind, twenty-two small washing pulse cultivation notes, one delusion-breaking sword book, and seven delusion-breaking sword cultivation experiences.
He sailed on the lake in a small boat, and the breeze was blowing, and the original raging anger had dissipated.
Thirty books began to be comprehended in my mind.
The midday sun was scorching, and he sailed back to the East Garden.
The East Garden is a two-mile island, divided into flower beds, each with a rare flower, and the whole island is floating.
There is only one small courtyard on the island, Chu Li pushed the door into the courtyard, the cool atmosphere came to his face, and a large tree covered half of the yard, driving away the heat.
He entered the west wing room, brought out a Qingfeng sword, and swung it in the center of the courtyard, slow as a Taiji sword, and in a moment a layer of sweat appeared, and his forehead was bright.
He never forgot it, and the secret notes he had seen were imprinted in his mind again and again, and the delusional sword technique he had just learned from the Yan Wu Hall was indeed amazingly powerful, but it was also extremely labor-consuming.
"Squeak..." A strong young man walked out of the main hall, with a big face and small eyes.
He swayed like a black bear, stretched his waist, yawned twice, and then spoke lazily: "Brother, came back so early? ”
Chu Li focused on sword practice, and only snorted. Li Yue, the Ninth Pins Guard, the two are in charge of the East Garden together, good appetite, excellent cooking skills, good martial arts, but afraid of death and do not break into the Ninth Pinlou, willing to be a guard.
The guards and guards of the Guogong Mansion are divided into nine grades, and the wage difference is ten times.
The guards have little money, and the grade should be seniority, nine grades in three years, eight products in ten years, seven products in twenty years, six products in forty years, and five products in seventy years. Regardless of the other guards, they only look at martial arts, break into the ninth grade building, and break through the first floor to promote one product.
With a lot of wages, he can often go out of the house to do tasks, and live a colorful life, unlike the guards who can only stay in the house to serve people, but everyone who has some ability is a guard.
Li Yue shook his neck, stretched his legs, and his bones emitted a series of crackling sounds, and then he shook his fist and practiced, his fist was like a shooting star, whistling in the wind.
"Brother, don't practice swords, practice boxing with me!"
Chu Li spit out two words, and a layer of soybean sweat on his forehead.
In this world, martial arts are prosperous, and martial arts practice starts from the doll.
After the age of eight to eighteen, once the meridians are set, no matter how miraculous the mental method is, it will take several times more time to build the foundation.
Before the age of eighteen, he missed the foundation building in the Akuba Temple where he grew up. Twice as strong as ordinary people, strong spirit.
In addition, he was a researcher in high-energy physics in his previous life, and his understanding of the world is far comparable.
When the two were combined, he finally practiced the Great Wisdom Origin Sutra and achieved the Great Round Mirror Wisdom and Divine Power.
The spirit is strong, his cultivation lasts far better than ordinary people, he has divine powers, and he observes meticulously, so his small pulse washing technique has made rapid progress, and he can build a foundation in five years.
"Hehe..., just your sword, the chicken can't be killed, what else do you practice?"
Chu Li suddenly collected his sword and hummed, "Bibi? ”
He was panting and soft, and he slammed his sword to the ground to support his body, and the sword technique was too physically exhausting.
1. Chapter 1
In the antique room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
This is an instinctive reaction of an excellent special forces!
As soon as the hand fell, an electric shock-like soreness came, and there was a weakness.
Ling Tian opened his eyes.
There was a gentle female voice in my ears.
Ling Tian saw a delicate face and was looking at him with a caring expression.
This is a classical beauty, breathtakingly beautiful, which can be described as a country of alluring.
Ling Tian, a native of China.
He served in the most outstanding Wolf Tooth Special Operations Force in China, and made countless contributions during his service.
He has participated in world-class special forces competitions, won the personal honor of being the first in individual combat ability, and is recognized as the 'King of Soldiers'!
Later, during a transnational SSS-level mission, because of a small personal mistake, a comrade died.
Remorseful, he chose to retire and left the wolf tooth.
After retiring, he fell silent for a while, chose to go abroad, and became the trump card in one of the most prestigious mercenary organizations in the world.
As long as it is his task, the success rate is 100% unprecedented!
Although he retired from the Wolf Tooth for many years, he still cares about Hua Guo.
As long as it is a task that is unfavorable to China, he will not only not accept it, but also find out the person who issued the task and carry out inhuman torture.
Over time, he became a thorn in the side and flesh of all countries except China.
In the eyes of other countries, he is a ticking time bomb.
However, as one killer after another evaporated in the world, Ling Tian became more and more moisturized, and no killer dared to take this 'death mission'.
Killing Ling Tian was tantamount to seeking his own death. This is a phrase recognized by the world mercenary community and killer community.
Throughout the earth, there are few opponents, and there is no defeat!
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted broker.
Country R has created a colorless and odorless biological weapon, intending to transport it into China to carry out a terrible conspiracy.
Of course, Ling Tian would not sit idly by.
He shot!
With the help of the broker, the location of the batch of biological and chemical weapons was found.
Just as he broke a bloody path and entered the underground research room, ready to destroy the batch of biological and chemical weapons. The underground research chamber suddenly dented, trapping him in a fully enclosed cage.
When I saw people from country R armed with various firearms, they appeared outside the cage. Ling Tian understood.
I was betrayed by the most trusted person!
Otherwise, with his shrewdness, the conspiracy of the R country people would not succeed.
Until he was shot indiscriminately and died, Ling Tian still couldn't figure it out.
"Tian'er, what's wrong with you, don't scare the mother."
A gentle voice came, full of anxiety.
He was absolutely certain that he didn't know this woman.
But the woman's eyes now seem to be looking at a loved one, without any hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
Just when Ling Tian was preparing to theorize with this beautiful woman.
Ling Tian was like being struck by lightning, completely frozen, as if he had been lit.
The only thing that satisfied Ling Tian was that this guy was also called Ling Tian, and his full name was 'Duan Lingtian'.
Duan Lingtian, fifteen years old.
The surname of the Li family in Qingfeng Town is a child.
His mother, 'Li Rou', is the ninth elder of the Li family.
His father... In his memory, there was no father at all.
In the process of fusing this strange memory, Ling Tian also knew the reason why Duan Lingtian was seriously injured and lying on the bed.
Early this morning, 'Li Xin', the youngest son of the seventh elder of the Li family, scolded Duan Lingtian for being a wild species with a mother and no father.
It's just that he who hasn't even finished quenching the body, how can he be the opponent of Li Xin, who has a double quenching realm, and was directly seriously injured by Li Xin and dying.
After fusing all the strange memories, Ling Tian sighed in his heart.
He knew that from this moment on, he would merge into this strange world as Duan Lingtian.
From now on, he will be Duan Lingtian, and Duan Lingtian will be him.
"Madam, the head of the family has asked people to bring the medicine."
There was a sound in his ears, and Duan Lingtian looked up.
A maid hurriedly walked in from outside the room and handed the exquisite box in her hand to Li Rou.
The box is opened. Suddenly, the aroma of medicine wafted away.
"Tian'er, come, take the pill, and my mother will heal your wounds."
Li Rou took out a black elixir from it and handed it to Duan Lingtian's mouth.
Taking a deep breath, Duan Lingtian opened his mouth and swallowed the pill.
The elixir melted in his mouth, turned into a warm current, and entered his body.
Then, Duan Lingtian saw it again.
A cold air flow entered his body, turning the warm current of the elixir into a healing for him.
An hour later, Li Rou stopped.
Duan Lingtian found that most of the soreness in his body had disappeared, and there was no burden.
What did he just take be a panacea?
At this time, Duan Lingtian found that Li Rou's face was pale and his forehead was still sweating, obviously spending a lot of yuan power to heal his injuries.
"Mom, are you all right?"
Duan Lingtian's heart warmed.
This 'mother' is called cordially and without any unnaturalness.
"It's okay, just take a break."
Li Rou smiled and shook her head.
For the sake of his son, consuming this bit of yuan power is nothing.
"He and the Seven Elders are still waiting in the criminal court." Half an hour later, the maid walked into the room again and said softly.
"Put? Go and tell the person sent by the owner that I will personally deal with this matter. ”
The amiability on Li Rou's face was gone, and her face was cold.
"Mom, what kind of pill did you give me just now, I feel that my injury is almost better."
Duan Lingtian got out of bed and stretched his body slightly.
"That's 'Eight Pins Golden Chuangdan'."
It turned out that these eight-pin golden creation pills, even if they were the Li family in Qingfeng Town, only had two, and now they actually used one on his son with a foreign surname.
Obviously, his mother's status in the Li family is not low.
"Tian'er, the head of the family is still waiting, let's pass."
Li Rou took Duan Lingtian to a spacious courtyard in the Li family's mansion.
This is where the Li family enforces family law. Criminal Academy!
It was midday and the sun was blazing.
The courtyard was full of people, all of them watching the lively Li family children.
In the courtyard, a teenager was tied to Xing Zhu and exposed to the sun, and there were two middle-aged people standing on the side.
The cross-eyed middle-aged man on the right saw Duan Lingtian's mother and son with an angry expression.
"Duan Lingtian is also here... The family's treasured eight-pin golden creation pill is really powerful! "Yes, I also saw it when Duan Lingtian was carried back, half-dead."
"Li Xin is too, usually just bully Duan Lingtian casually, the Ninth Elder will not say anything, but this time he actually put such a heavy hand that he almost killed Duan Lingtian, it's strange that the Ninth Elder is not angry."
One by one, the children of the Li family saw Li Rou and Duan Lingtian coming, and whispered.
Li Rou took Duan Lingtian and saluted the middle-aged man on the left.
"Ninth Elder, today's matter, my son Li Xin was wrong first, but now that you have nothing to do, my son has also been exposed to the sun for a morning, can you put him down?"
At this moment, the middle-aged man in the-eyed eye, that is, the seventh elder of the Li family, 'Li Kun', had a gloomy face.
Who knows, Li Rou didn't pay attention to him at all.
Instead, he took Duan Lingtian and came to Li Xin, who was tied up.
"Tian'er, how did he hurt you in the morning, now, you will return it all to him!" Chapter 1
When Gu Xijiu woke up, he found a very fatal problem. The surrounding environment became completely unknown to her!
Looking out through the gap in the cloister, there was a moon bending in the air, the sky was full of stars, and she was lying sideways and being carried forward.
She was a little confused, couldn't help but move, and then found a more deadly problem———— she was naked! Her body was covered only in a thin silk quilt, which wrapped her tightly from head to toe, and only a pair of eyes were exposed.
Her cold gaze first fell on the two big men who were carrying her.
Kong Wu is powerful, muscular knots, ancient costume warrior dressed, although carrying people to walk but quietly, at a glance is a practitioner, martial arts is not low.
Gu Xijiu's fingers in the quilt tightened!
She is the king of modern killers, cold and ruthless, all over the world, but she did not expect to encounter the secret calculation of the most trusted person, that person is named Long Xi, her former instructor, but also a doctor, she does not trust anyone, only believes in him, and even likes him, and wants to marry him.
She was already dead, but she didn't expect to go to Yan Wang Ye for tea, but she came here inexplicably.
At this time, she naturally did not think that she had arrived at some shooting base.
She crossed!
Crossing over to this body, it was wrapped up like a rice dumpling and carried towards a rather luxurious hall.
"Ahhh... Yes...... Help me...... Help me...... Ah, ah, don't..." The woman's delicate and painful scream came out instantly, recalling Gu Xijiu's flying thoughts. Her gaze swept quickly and froze slightly! The furnishings in the hall are naturally beautiful, whether it is rosewood tables and chairs, or tortoiseshell screens of flowers, birds, and birds, all of them show two words - noble!
The man above has a handsome face, twenty-seven or eight years old, long hair pinned with a green jade hairpin, scattered on the shoulders, smooth muscle texture, strong and powerful in the movement of a volt together, the corners of his lips are slightly pursed, and he has a cold smile, which is a cool and handsome macho man.
Below is a young girl, looking very young, eyebrows are clear, and the man's expression of enjoyment is different, the little girl is pale, her small mouth is slightly open, her voice has been shouted hoarse, whimpering, cold sweat has soaked her hair, obviously painful to the extreme. Gu Xijiu's face changed slightly!
This bastard, strong x seedlings! Who is he?
Those two big men carried Gu Xijiu in, but they couldn't disturb the man's good interest, his movements were faster and more violent!
The little girl finally couldn't help it, screamed a few times in a hoarse voice, rolled her eyes, tilted her head, and stopped moving.
"Discouragement!" The man cursed lowly, rolled over, got off the girl, and kicked the girl off the bed like garbage.
The girl couldn't move, her little face had turned waxy yellow, and there were blood lines running down the corners of her lips. I don't know if it's dead or alive.
"This is also too useless, carry it to the mass grave to feed the dogs!" The man's tone was full of desire and dissatisfaction.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff City, is a small city in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in the north of Arizona, on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, adjacent to the gambling city of Las Vegas to the west, and the famous Grand Canyon of Colorado to the east.
The United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon of Colorado and Las Vegas, these four names are heard of many Chinese, but the flagstaff city wrapped in the middle of these four areas, not many people know it.
Half a year ago, Li Du was also one of those 'few' until he came to study in Flagstaff City.
Flagstaff City is not famous in China and is not famous in the United States, but there are several good universities, such as the University of Arizona, Flagstaff American College, etc.
The school where Li Du studied is called Flagstaff National College, which is only one word different from Flagstaff American College, but between this one word, it is a world of difference!
Flagstaff American College is a branch of American colleges, which is a very good private university that provides undergraduate, junior college, preparatory and other educational work.
This is a pheasant university, and Li Du was completely fooled to go to graduate school.
As a result, his tuition and research funds were only paid for half a year, the school was closed, and the school board and admissions department got the news in advance and ran away, leaving a group of international students with a confused face and were driven out of the school by the police.
Li Du was lucky, because the school accommodation was too chaotic, he did not have a dormitory in order to study quietly, but found an apartment room to rent, and now he has a place to stay. His classmates, who paid for the accommodation fee to live in school, will be living on the streets.
But his situation is not much better than that of his classmates, it is the end of January, his rent is due, if he does not pay the rent in time, he may have to live on the street.
The miserable thing is that this will leave him without money!
Of course, he can borrow money from his parents and classmates and friends in China, but there is a premise that he is studying abroad. Now that the school has been banned, he will definitely not be able to study as a graduate student, where is the face to ask his elderly parents for money? As for finding classmates and friends?
Sitting at the door of the small building with a sad face, the door of the pine room behind Li Du was pushed open, and a blonde girl poked her head out: "Hey, Li, are you here?" ”
The girl was his landlord, Hannah Fox, and the house was the inheritance of her parents who died in a car accident, belonging to her and her brother Hans Fox.
However, Hans claimed that he "had big business to do", and did not come to live for a few days throughout the year, and the vacant bedroom was rented out by Hannah to generate income.
Hearing the greeting, Li Du got up and said, "Oh, yes, Hannah, is there something wrong?" ”
The girl shrugged and smiled, and a pear swirl appeared on her beautiful face: "When I was cleaning the refrigerator just now, I saw a few cans of beer, which must have been left by the Hans guy." I remember you like wort beer, might as well drink it? ”
She was carrying half a dozen bottles of beer, a very common wooden box package with the Budweiser logo on it.
Seeing these beers, Li Du also smiled, there is only one Xiaoice box in the apartment, he will open and close every day, where is there any beer in it?
Besides, with Hans's temper, if there really is beer, he will definitely not stay, this guy is addicted to alcohol.
According to his guess, Hannah bought the beer to comfort him, and after learning that their school had been shut down, Hannah had comforted him many times, which touched him very much.
But Hannah doesn't have many ways to comfort him, either by giving him an inspirational book or beer.
This American girl once asked him to understand Chinese culture and learned the saying 'one drunk relieves a thousand worries'. She thought that according to Chinese's personality, getting drunk and sleeping could alleviate her sorrows, so she sent him beer several times.
Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness and owed this girl a favor. In American socialization, there are some gifts that cannot be refused, otherwise it will be misunderstood to reject friendship, and he cherishes his friendship with Hannah.
He took the wooden box, and Hannah left with a smile, saying before leaving: "There are many problems in life, but it is still good." ”
After repeating this American slang phrase several times, Li Du opened the package and wanted to take out a can of beer. But as soon as he opened the wooden box, an amber-like crystal suddenly fell out, and it fell to the ground with a 'click'.
The crystal, about the size of his thumb, fell heavily on the cement floor, and several cracks appeared on it.
The reason why I guessed that it was amber was because it was pale yellow in color and wrapped in a small worm, similar to an amber he had seen in the sixth grade of elementary school. At that time, their textbook had a text called "Amber", and when the Chinese teacher gave them lessons, he brought an amber.
The crystal reminded him of some good times in his childhood, when his teacher said that amber with small insects was precious. It's a pity that this one has already broken the crack, which makes him regret, otherwise selling it may not be able to exchange it for two months of living expenses.
The crystal fell so badly that it shattered when he picked it up, revealing the purple worms wrapped in it.
The insect looks like a locust, it is about two centimeters in length, strange in appearance, with locust-like compound eyes, but only two legs under the belly, strange lines on the legs, no wings on the back, looking clumsy.
Li Du had never seen this kind of bug, and he strangely raised it to see it clearly.
At this moment, something strange happened: the little worm's claws suddenly moved, and then quickly regained its vitality, twisting its body to break free from between his fingers.
Before he could react, the little worm jumped behind his palm, his head drooped, and it burrowed into the palm of his hand so slowly and little by little!
Li Du was scared to pee, really wanted to pee!
Screaming, he stumbled towards the house and shouted, "Hannah, hit 911!" Help, a bug got into my hands! ”
It is estimated that his screams are too harsh, and Hannah came out with a panicked expression: "What? What bugs? ”
Li Du spread his hand to show her: "That's it, this bug in the palm of my hand!" ”
Hannah's face was blank: "The bug in the palm of your hand? Where are the bugs in the palm of your hand? ”
Not only is there a bug, this bug is still moving, after it burrowed into the palm of Li Du's hand, it seemed that it was not willing to be lonely, and this would drill out again, and half of its body drilled out.
Li Du pointed to the insect that was drilling out, and said in horror: "This, just this, purple locust, can't you see it?" ”
Li Du interrupted her and shouted, "I understand what you mean, you think I'm crazy!" But I'm not crazy, Hannah! ”
"Shet, this bug is coming out again!"
Just as he was shouting hoarsely, the little worm slowly drilled out of his skin and jumped to the ground, leaned out his upper body to support his legs, and walked on the ground with his legs like a human.
It happened that next to it landed was a drainage outlet, and the little worm didn't pay attention to walking over and planted it headlong.
Seeing this, Li Du was overjoyed and said: "Great, the worm fell into the drain." ”
Subconsciously, a thought appeared in his mind, that is, what is in the drain? Will there be sewage and drown this bug?
However, a scene that made him unbelievable happened!
Chapter I
The land of Shenzhou, the northern desert.
Ice and snow ravage the entire land, the mountains and ravines are covered in silver, goose feathers and snow fall, and the sky and earth are completely colored from afar.
On the curved mountain road, a caravan was resting, the wind and snow were too great, the carriage was difficult to walk, and had to wait for the wind and snow to be less before going on the road.
"Look, coffin puller!"
The exclamation of a middle-aged man attracted the attention of everyone in the caravan, and a group of people looked up into the distance curiously, only a few glances, and all of them were shocked physically and mentally!
The wind and snow howled in the sky, the sky and the earth became misty, and a mysterious golden ancient coffin loomed in the distant mountain road, gradually appearing in everyone's field of vision.
The golden ancient coffin was two meters long, one meter wide and one meter high, and the walls of the coffin were engraved with ancient patterns and runes. The pattern runes emitted a faint glow, blocking all the falling snowflakes, which was extremely strange.
What shocked everyone was the coffin puller in front of the ancient coffin.
It was a teenager who looked to be only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was naked ~ naked, hunched over his back, grabbed two cold iron giant chains with both hands, carried the chains on his shoulders, and was struggling to pull the ancient coffin forward step by step.
Ice and snow, teenager pulling coffin!
The picture is visually striking and breathtaking. The glow emitted by the golden ancient coffin behind reflected the boy's body a little blurry, and he couldn't see his face clearly, and everyone seemed to see a god pulling the coffin in a trance.
"This young man is born with divine power."
The middle-aged man exclaimed again, and many people looked back at the young man carefully, making sure that there was no Xuanli light shining on him, and he was moved again.
An ordinary willow coffin has three or four hundred catties, and this ancient coffin is cast with gold throughout, needless to say at least three thousand catties or more.
If the young man does not have Xuan power, then he is not a real martial artist, even a strong man has only five or six hundred pounds of huge strength. The young man alone can pull a three-thousand-pound ancient coffin, although it looks a little difficult, but it is frightening enough.
"Young and quite handsome, actually came to pull the coffin, this boy wants to be unlucky for the rest of his life?"
An old man sighed, and many people nodded in agreement. Although the coffin pulling is not common, it has happened occasionally in the history of the Northern Desert, and everyone knows a little.
After the elders of important clans in the Beimo family died, they liked to be buried in golden giant coffins. These giant coffins are not buried under the earth, but placed on the top of an iceberg, which is said to protect the people of the tribe.
When the family declines or encounters major changes, the family will hold a coffin pulling festival to find a new iceberg to transfer the ancestral coffin in the clan, replace feng shui, and recast the family's well-being.
This led to the emergence of the coffin puller.
In the hearts of many Beimo people, when pulling the coffin, their own luck will be absorbed by the corpse in the coffin, and the body essence and yang shou will also be absorbed, and they will be unlucky or sick for a lifetime.
Therefore, pulling a coffin is the most humble profession in Beimo, even if the commission given is high, young warriors will not be moved, only down-and-out old warriors will go to pull coffins.
The boy's facial features are Peugeot, about one meter and seven or five meters tall, broad shoulders and narrow waist, slender legs, and knotted muscles. He wears a quaint animal tooth around his neck, which looks wild and very good in terms of appearance alone.
Fourteen or fifteen years old, handsome in appearance, with a terrifying divine power, the conditions of the teenager are not bad. But to do this most despicable coffin pulling work?
"He is not afraid of being robbed of luck, a great reduction in his yang life, and a lifetime of bad luck?" The middle-aged man stared at the golden ancient coffin a few times, and said with relief: "This seems to be the ancestral coffin of the Liu family?" That's right, I heard that the Liu family has recently undergone a big change and offered a sky-high price. ”
"Silence, the people of the Liu family are here." An old man suddenly said, and everyone in the caravan quickly shut up and looked into the distance.
Whining!
In the distance, there was a howl of wild beasts, and a group of warriors wearing black armor and riding silver giant wolves rushed forward, and before they could get close to the fierce aura on the giant wolf, they rushed towards them.
"The Silver Wolf Guard, it is really a warrior of the Liu family."
Everyone nodded secretly, in the entire vicinity of Wuling City, there was only one army riding the silver wolf, which was the strongest silver wolf guard of the Liu family.
The Silver Wolf Guard stopped after catching up with the young man, and a middle-aged giant man in the front held a long whip, looked at the young man and said coldly: "Lu Li, go faster!" If you don't pull to Blackhawk Ridge before dark, you won't be paid. ”
The young man known as Lu Li glanced up, surrounded by more than a dozen huge silver wolves one meter tall and two meters long, he did not have much fear, nodded and said: "Don't worry, my lord, I will definitely arrive before dark." ”
The giant man let out a deep sigh, rushed away with the Silver Wolf Guard, and soon disappeared into the vast mountains in the distance.
Lu Li glanced at the caravan staying nearby and continued to move forward in silence. He grabbed the giant chain of cold iron with both hands, carried it on his shoulders and struggled forward, each step was extremely difficult, and the muscles of his whole body trembled. Nevertheless, he did not stop in his footsteps, and soon crossed the caravan and walked towards the distance.
"It's so heavy!"
After a few miles, Lu Li stopped after going up a steep slope. He was exhausted and panting, but he was sweating hot in such a cold weather, and you can imagine how physically exerted he was.
He thought about resting for a while, and after placing the ancient coffin, he sat on a stone and took out clean water and dried meat from the sack behind his back, chewing and swallowing to replenish his strength.
You should be able to get there before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat and looking at the sky, his eyes quickly brightened, and he said to himself: "Pulling a coffin can be exchanged for a pill, I wonder if the Liu family's quenching pill is really as legendary, one can increase the strength of five hundred catties?" ”
"If I can really increase the giant force of five hundred catties, I now have three thousand catties of strength, and I only need to pull a dozen coffins to reach ten thousand catties of huge force, and I can... Awaken the bloodline! ”
"Look who in the tribe dares to bully my sister? Hehe, I will soon be able to live a good life with my sister. ”
Thinking of this, Lu Li's tired face lit up with glory, and he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward, this time his steps were more steady and fast.
Rustle!
After walking for several miles, a voice sounded behind him, and Lu Li glanced back, his face slightly gloomy.
The rear is also a puller, but an old man. The old man's hand holding the iron chain was lit with white light, and there was a faint white light circulating on his feet.
Lu Li muttered enviously, white light is a martial artist's Xuan power. The strength of a warrior with Xuan Power will increase a lot, and this old man uses Xuan Force, so he can walk like a fly, easily pulling the ancient coffin.
The old man caught up with Lu Li, he glanced at it, frowned and said: "Young man, why are you pulling a coffin too?" This will be bad luck. ”
Lu Li smiled slightly and did not say anything, the old man glanced at him a few times, and quickly pulled the coffin away without further words.
"If you can't awaken your bloodline again, then what future is there? Only a lifetime of mediocrity, being bullied every day, and even suffering with my sister. ”
"No, it's not the life I want!"
Thinking of this, Lu Li's face became a little distorted, and he roared angrily, gritting his teeth and quickly pulling the coffin forward.
The wind and snow are getting bigger and bigger, the sky is gradually getting darker, and the glow emitted by the golden ancient coffin in the vast mountain road is looming, which is extremely strange and mysterious.
Chapter 001
"Brother is going to look for a job, you do your homework at home, here is ten dollars, don't forget to go out to buy something to eat at noon."
In front of a low hut in the slum, Lu Li patted the head of the little loli, rubbed and rubbed it with pity, it was good to see his sister alive and healthy so well!
"Brother, I know," little Lori pouted and complained, "don't rub my hair, it's all messed up by you." ”
Sister Lu Xin very thoughtfully helped Lu Li sort out his clothes, and instructed like a little adult: "You must work hard, my brother can endure hardships so much, I believe I will be able to find a job this time." ”
"Don't worry, my brother will definitely find a good job, earn a lot of money, and let Xinxin live a good life," Lu Li hugged his sister and secretly added in his heart, and he will not watch you lose your life little by little because he has no money.
"When Xinxin grows up, she will also make a lot of money," Little Loli twisted in Lu Li's arms, waving her little fist in confidence.
No matter how reluctant he was, Lu Li still said goodbye to his sister.
When he got on the bus, his hand in his pocket paused and couldn't help but smile bitterly.
The money for her sister to eat lunch just now was back in her pocket, and she should have expected that this little girl would do this, which was really well-behaved and poignant.
Now is the 23rd century, science and technology are infinitely developed, all kinds of intelligent technology flood every corner of the world, this development has brought rapid progress to people's lives, but incidentally, it also minimizes the demand for human resources.
Unemployment is no longer unusual, especially for people at the bottom of society like Lu Li, finding a stable job can only be a luxury.
If there are no accidents, he will remain unemployed.
It wasn't until he joined a game union by chance that the gold group stabilized, but because when he entered the game called "Dawn", the game had been open for nearly a year and lagged too far behind in the level, so he never became a super master.
Two years later, her sister Lu Xin was found seriously ill during a physical examination at school.
There is no money to pay for treatment up to millions, and during that time in the game, he has been chased and killed by several unions, and he can only watch his only relative weaken day by day.
That taste was worse than cutting meat with a knife, and Lu Li held his sister more than once and cried bitterly.
However, fate took a turn. On the day he received the critical illness notice, Riku cried for a while and then fell asleep in front of his sister's hospital bed, and woke up to find that he had been reborn, reborn three years ago.
While he was happy that his sister was still healthy, he knew that he had to make money, make lots and lots of money.
With money, you can cure your sister's illness as soon as possible, and only with money can your sister live the happy life that innocent and cute little girls should live like countless of her peers.
With money, you will raise your eyebrows, and you will not be inferior at any time!
After calculating it, Lu Li helplessly found that even if he was reborn, it was not easy to become rich.
The only thing he can do seems to be playing the game — the one he's been playing for more than two years — is just a few days away from opening.
Lu Li had already given up his plan to find a serious job, and he came out today and went directly to the headquarters of the Xingyue Union where he served in his previous life.
The Xingyue Union is not the top ten games, nor is it the top four in China, it is just a game alliance composed of a group of college students, and the leaders of the union are very rich second generations, because they are willing to spend money, so the development is also similar.
Located next to the university town, the Qinghu community is the most scenic place of this generation, surrounded by mountains and waters, cherry blossoms, office buildings in front, villa areas in the back, and only very wealthy people can set up companies here.
The beauty at the front desk glanced at Lu Li's dress with a little disgust, dialed a series of numbers, and then informed Lu Li that she could go in for an interview.
"We are currently only recruiting death squads, and we don't accept gold fighters," said a girl in charge of recruitment, dressed very fashionably, wearing nail polish and not raising her head while in charge of the interview.
The so-called death squad is actually cannon fodder, and it is a normal thing to die a dozen times a day.
The reason why Lu Li wants to find a studio to join is to use the studio's game helmet for free, although the gold striker has no future, but at least he can upgrade, and the cannon fodder that is destined to upgrade difficult is not what he wants, and death in the game will lose experience.
"What, 20 gold!" Nail polish was applied to her face at once, and the girl exclaimed like a cat that had been stepped on.
Although "Dawn" represents today's most advanced virtual technology and has the world's most first-class design team, it is not confident enough to dare to go public without the inside, but the content of the test is relatively small, and it is a decentralized test, which will not affect the normal game.
In just a few days of testing, the most impressive impression on players is that gold coins are not easy to fight, and there are too many places to spend money.
Players in normal games basically can't make ends meet in the early stage, and experienced gold players can't save a few silver coins a day.
Some senior professional players estimate that if they want to save enough 20 gold to build a union, a hundred people play gold group to brush the right monsters, remove repair equipment and potion consumption, at least a week or more, this is still before the third system update of the game before the high rate of money explosion.
And this kid in front of him, he actually promised to take out 20 gold in a week!
20 gold, that's 200,000 copper coins.
"Have you participated in the inside, did you find any money swiping bugs?" The recruitment beauty moved in her heart and asked suspiciously.
Lu Li smiled and said nothing, appearing extremely inscrutable.
"Aojian, I have something here, you come here... Well, someone came to apply for a gold collector, saying that he could hand in twenty gold in a week, I suspected that he had a bug of brushing money, "There is no way to recruit beautiful women, I can only call the top in a whisper."
After a while, he heard a rush of footsteps, and when he turned his head, Lu Li was also a little surprised.
In addition to Xingyue's boss Aojian, the people who came over actually followed several people, Lu Li had been in the Xingyue Union for two years in his previous life, most of these people knew each other, all of them were high-level members of the union.
"Oh, don't tell me, it's this kid who can get twenty gold a week," the little man walking next to Aojian couldn't help but wail, this person's game name is Half a Cigarette, he is the leader of the Xingyue Union Thieves' Group, and he is a very frizzy person.
"You have a way to get twenty gold coins in a week, are you sure it's the game Dawn?" Aojian's face was not very good-looking, originally holding a glimmer of hope, but seeing Lu Li's appearance, this glimmer of hope was gone.
Lu Li looks ordinary, his face is sallow and dark, his clothes are wrinkled, and there are obvious traces of wear and tear at the corners, and he can tell at a glance that he is the kind of person who rolls at the bottom of society.
"Words are unfounded, even if you can't get it, you won't lose much, right?" In the face of the social elite with a huge aura and a cluster of people in front of him, Lu Li did not have the crampedness of the little people at the bottom, just smiled faintly, and his calm eyes seemed to be full of endless confidence.
Chapter I
"Ye Mo, Ye Mo, are you okay, hurry up, it's about to start class, this class is ruthless, you hurry up." A somewhat anxious voice sounded in Ye Mo's ears, and Ye Mo had a very strange feeling.
"This idiot, it is estimated that he has no face to see, cover his face." Another voice sounded in his ears, but Ye Mo woke up now.
Ye Mo looked around a little blankly, no one knew anyone, all unfamiliar faces.
Seeing Ye Mo's dazed look, another burst of laughter came, it was obvious that the laughter here was all made at him, seeing that the people laughing around seemed to be laughing at him, he didn't dare to ask out loud for a while, he could only secretly guard to prevent someone from attacking him.
Looking at the classmate sitting next to him, it seemed that he was the only one who did not laugh at himself, and he kindly pushed himself to wake up just now.
"How is it like a school?" Ye Mo subconsciously asked with some surprise.
"Haha..." came another burst of laughter.
"Ye Mo, I see that you are confused, can Yanyan also write love letters casually? It's good that you are in the Ye family, now you are no longer from the Ye family, be careful in the future. ”
The same table sighed, naturally he didn't believe that Ye Mo wouldn't remember it for a while, he just loved face. He hadn't recognized the reality yet, he was no longer Ye Mo of the Ye family.
Ye Mo's first pain was in a burst, he remembered that he and Master Luoying were refining back to Yuan Dan, and then the group of miscellaneous hairs from Xiliumen came over, and then there were explosions and various fighting sounds, remembering that the master behind him held himself and used a charm, but how could he appear here? Is this still Luoyue Continent?
By the way, I am sitting here now, what about Master? The master is only three years older than him, not to mention that the reason why Xiliumen came to suddenly attack them was because the master was too beautiful, and the young master of Xiliumen wanted to marry his beautiful master, which only happened after being rejected by the master.
In case the master fell into the hands of Xiliumen, the consequences would be unimaginable, thinking of this, Ye Mo could no longer bear the panic in his heart and stood up suddenly.
"What's the matter, don't you know that the class bell rings?" A young woman with a cold face walked up to the podium with a few books in her hands, coldly glanced at the students below who were laughing, and the laughter suddenly decreased.
Everyone knows that this is Yun Bing, the lecturer of the English class, and the most annoying thing is that the students are coaxing, and once she is targeted, there is absolutely no good fruit to eat. Ye Mo already felt that something was wrong, although he understood these words, but the obvious language was not what he originally used, could it be that this was no longer the Luoyue Continent? Frowning, Ye Mo wanted to know more clearly, a burst of headaches came, and a lot of messy information was remembered.
And Ye Mo was completely expelled from the Ye family after his father's death, the specific reason was because Ye Mo was not Ye Wentian's species. More precisely, after Ye Mo's father died, Ye Mo's bloodline was re-identified and determined to be not the Ye family's species, which led to the matter of being driven out of Yemen.
However, he also has a younger sister Ye Ling and a younger brother Ye Zifeng. It's just that neither of him nor him is a mother, but a half-siblings. Three years ago, his father seemed to know that he owed Ye Mo, and specially proposed to the old man of the Ye family to marry the Ning family, Ye Tianwen probably knew that he was not healthy, so he wanted to help Ye Mo find a backer, and only then did he find the Ning family in the capital.
For the Ye family, one of the top five families in Huaxia, the Ning family was of course extremely willing. Promised Old Master Ning's granddaughter, Ning Qianxue, to Ye Mo.
During a physical examination in the hospital, Ye Mo was found to be a heavenly hemorrhage, to put it bluntly, it is inhumane. Although the Ye family wanted to try hard to hide the fact, it seemed that overnight everyone in the capital knew that the Ye family, one of the five major families in China, had a heavenly defect, and the Ye family could be regarded as losing a big face.
"Ah..." The memory was turned here, Ye Mo exclaimed, stood up, and almost immediately took off his pants to take a look. He already somewhat understood that he might be reborn into a person named Ye Mo, but he couldn't be humane, so it was better to kill him.
"That classmate, what's your name, what do you shout during class, go to my office after class." The beautiful teacher who was lecturing was interrupted by Ye Mo's exclamation, and her face was very ugly.
The rest of the students in the class are secretly funny, let a college student go to the office at every turn, it is estimated that only this English teacher can come out, if you don't go, the credits are in the hands of others.
Ye Mo sat down decadently, although he didn't understand much about the inside story of the family struggle, but he also knew that he was probably driven out of the Ye family because of the heavenly hemorrhage, not necessarily because he was not from the Ye family, and who knew if he did something in the DNA test.
Ye Mo was not worried about his own expulsion from the Ye family, he would not care about this at all, he cared about his own heavenly problems. And what happened to his master Luo Ying.
However, he also understood why the classmates in the class laughed, because his predecessor had obviously been kicked out of the Ye family, and he still did not change his attitude to pursue the hottest girl in the class, Yanyan. As a result, the person pasted his confession love letter on the blackboard, and then stood on the podium and looked at himself with contempt and said: "Young Master Ye, can you sleep with me?" ”
Later, after the news of Tianji was reported, he wanted to find a girlfriend because he was ashamed to save face, but what he didn't expect was that the girl who was originally very bothered with him actually treated him like this, and he fainted in shame and cheapened his rebirth.
I was actually reborn in such a place. He couldn't understand a word of the beautiful teacher's class on the stage, even if he understood it, Ye Mo wouldn't listen to it, and he absolutely couldn't accept the fact that he was now a heavenly heck. Instead of being reborn like this, it is better not to be reborn.
It doesn't matter if you don't go to college, the main thing is to figure out where you are now. His heavenly confinement is related to the reputation of the Ye family, and although he has been driven out of the Ye family, who knows if he will suddenly be killed? Maybe there were other insiders that caused him to be kicked out of the Ye family, is his safety still guaranteed now?
After the class bell rang, of course, Ye Mo's first thing was not to go to the beautiful teacher, but hurriedly rushed out of the school, he wanted to find a place to see if his little ** was really a natural hemorrhage.
Fortunately, there are not many other things next to Ninghai University, but there are many small alleys, and Ye Mo hurriedly ran into a remote and uninhabited small alley and quickly pulled down his pants.
The little ** was really small, but Ye Mo was not disappointed because the little ** was small, but really sighed. He is not a celestial hemorrhage, but because the small ** is too big, it is blocked by a meridian to develop, causing this false celestial hemorrhoid.
But that's it, with the technology on the earth now, it is undoubtedly a fool's dream to open up this blocked meridian of his own, but this is difficult for Ye Mo, although he does not have the ability to open the blocked meridian and make his little ** strong, but as long as he reaches the third layer of qi training, this meridian will automatically be washed away.
It's just that Ye Mo immediately began to be a little disappointed again, because in the case of such a thin heaven and earth vitality on the earth, it is undoubtedly a difficult task to cultivate to the third layer of qi training, maybe he can't achieve it in his lifetime, in that case, he is still equivalent to heavenly qi. Sighing, Ye Mo was about to pull up his pants, when a sudden exclamation made him shiver.
"Playing hooligans..." An absolutely high-decibel soprano sounded in front of Ye Mo, who had just checked his little ** and actually forgot to check the situation around him. I didn't expect that this small alley was still connected, but it was not visible here at the turn in front.
Ye Mo is not an exhibitionist, and he doesn't have any capital to expose now, so he quickly pulled up his pants and was about to slip away.
"Ye Mo, why are you?" After this woman screamed, she actually asked in a surprised tone, it was obvious that she knew Ye Mo.
Chapter 1
In the dead of night, Qingzhu Senior Community, Jinhai City.
Shi Feng sat quietly on the soft leather sofa, holding a stack of documents in his hand, looking at the swimming pool outside the floor-to-ceiling window, full of loss and unwillingness.
As the leader of the Phantom, one of the four major game studios in Gimhae City, he leads the Grand Guild of tens of thousands of people, and he is also a well-known master sword magician in Gimhae City, but now he can only sit at home and drink to relieve his worries.
Ten years of gaming.
Ten years of bloody fighting.
After countless pains and tribulations, he finally led the Phantom Guild and established ten city-states in "God Online", and when he could start competing with the first-class guild and enjoy endless glory, a piece of paper became a cloud of smoke and never returned.
Shi Feng never thought that his ten years of hard work would be in vain, for the sake of the game, he gave up so much, but in the end he became the wedding dress of others, all because he opposed the merger of the phantom into the super guild to dominate the world, and the Lanhua consortium gave him an answer less than the next day, deleting the 200-level sword king account that he spent ten years of hard work to train, and went to the finance office to settle the salary.
All he could get was five million credits and a mansion, which was less than a drop in the bucket compared to the ten city-states he had established, and the virtual kingdom of Doujin Jinjin.
Shi Feng thought that he had paid so much for the shadow and turned the Lanhua Group into a big consortium, and a lot of the credit was his, but the result was like throwing garbage, throwing him away, and he would definitely take revenge for what the Lanhua Group did.
"I'm never going to just forget it, it's a big deal to start over."
Shi Feng's eyes flashed with confidence and firmness, and the termination documents in his hand were torn to shreds, and then he picked up a bottle of red wine on the table and suddenly poured a few sips.
Even without the Sword King account and the support of the team, the technology and knowledge in the game will not betray him. As long as the technology is still there, it can also rise in the God Domain and establish a virtual kingdom of its own again.
Early in the morning, the sun has just risen.
Di Di Di!
The ringtone of the phone keeps ringing.
Shi Feng was woken up dissatisfied, and helplessly got up and picked up the mobile phone next to the bed, last night's hangover is still fainting.
"Hey, what's going on?"
"Brother Feng, I'm Kuroko, what else are you asking? We said we wanted to become a professional gamer, but today is the day of recruitment at the Phantom Studio at school, haven't you always wanted to be a core member of the Phantom? ”
Shi Feng was a little confused.
Just dismissed by the Lanhua consortium, how could he go to the shadow assessment. "Brother Feng, Brother Feng?
Are you listening? They will be tested at ten o'clock, and if you don't come quickly, it will be too late! ”
"Kuroko, don't be kidding, I just got fired by the Shadow."
"Brother Feng, how much did you drink yesterday? I haven't woken up until now, the phantom hasn't recruited anyone, how did you get fired? Okay, hurry up. ”
Before Shi Feng could react, Kuroko hung up the phone.
Shi Feng, who had a drowsy head, looked at his mobile phone and found that this shabby Love Crazy Six was not his mobile phone at all, and his mobile phone was the latest Love Crazy Twelve.
Then look around. The small bedroom of less than fifteen square meters was a mess, full of books about game guides, and the laptop on the desk in the corner, which was also a very backward old model, and there were many clothes scattered in the large wardrobe by the wall, and a familiar face appeared in the fitting mirror of the large wardrobe.
Shi Feng was suddenly startled when he saw this familiar face.
Shi Feng immediately got up and walked to the fitting mirror, took pictures and photos, and only then determined that he was really younger.
Yesterday I slept in a spacious and luxurious bedroom, but now I get up and go to this broken place, and I am still younger.
For this place, Shi Feng still has some memories. It was ten years ago, in order to fight in the small house rented by his teeth when he was a senior in God Domain, he lived for more than half a year, and then made some money in God Domain, so he went to rent an apartment-style big house in the city.
In order to get him to college, he still owed a lot of foreign debts, so his parents also worked hard every month to send enough living expenses to make themselves suffer.
Shi Feng is bent on making money to change his family's situation, but college students are all over the street, and it is more difficult to find a job with a good income than to climb to the sky, so he thought of the most profitable virtual game, in order to improve game technology, he ruthlessly bought a virtual helmet, has become a professional gamer as the goal, in the virtual game hard to practice technology.
At that time, he ate white noodle buns and instant noodles every day, in order to save money, every time the class organized a class reunion or friendship did not participate, so it became a small transparent in the class, the boys despised, the girls saw away, every time I went to the supermarket to buy instant noodles, there were less than ten credit points in the wallet, and I didn't even dare to buy ham sausages with one credit, the saleswoman looked at Shi Feng pitiful, recommended special ham, Shi Feng looked at the tempting ham, touched the wallet again, or gritted his teeth and refused.
"Who is kidding me?"
Shi Feng looked at the familiar scene and his younger self in the mirror, and couldn't help but shake his head and deny this idea.
Even the most developed United States does not have such rejuvenation technology, who would joke with a down-and-out uncle.
Shi Feng looked at the time on his phone again.
April 19, 2129.
"Could it be that I was born again?" Shi Feng showed a wry smile on his face and joked.
He remembered that today was August 5, 2139, and it couldn't have been April 2129, when he was still in his senior year.
Shi Feng shook his head, wanting to sober up, but he still had a trace of expectation in his heart, hoping that he could be reborn and really return to ten years ago, so he walked to the computer desk and opened the laptop.
If the time of the mobile phone can be fake, then the message on the network cannot be fake.
After a few minutes on the net.
Shi Feng was completely shocked, and the various information he queried on the Internet showed that today was indeed April 19, 2129, and even the official opening time of the world's fiery God Domain, the official website was clearly written, and the countdown was April 25, six days later.
"Am I really back ten years ago?" Shi Feng stared at the news report of God Domain, leaving tears of excitement in the corners of his eyes.
At this time, Shi Feng's mood was indescribable, there were regrets, grief, and joy.
It was as if everything in front of you was a dream.
However, the sound of cicadas outside the window and the cold air blown by the air conditioner reminded Shi Feng that all this was true.
Looking at the family photo in the mobile phone when he was in college, Shi Feng never found that his father had white hair, and his mother's eyes were also wrinkled, and they were really old and not as energetic as before.
When he noticed that his parents were old, it was a year and a half after the opening of the God Domain, high debts, excessive labor and pressure, so that his parents were seriously ill, and once they couldn't afford to get sick, they needed millions of credit points to heal and recover, but Shi Feng at that time was just a small captain of the phantom, and the money earned could not pay such an expensive fee.
In order to raise money, Shi Feng tried his best, but unfortunately it was not enough, even if Shi Feng tried his best to maintain, his parents still left a few months later.
In the last life, he did not take good care of his parents, and who knows about the pain and regret?
Even if Shi Feng later earned millions of credit points, this would become an eternal pain in Shi Feng's heart.
Unexpectedly, fate played such a joke on him, and he really started from scratch and everything returned to the original point.
"Good, great, hahaha. Now that I have been born again, I have to change all this, earn enough money, cure my parents' diseases, and prevent them from working hard for life. Shi Feng wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes and secretly vowed.
Just as Shi Feng was planning his future, Kuroko's call came again, constantly urging Shi Feng to go to the university for assessment.
However, Shi Feng was unhurried, dressed, and packed himself before heading to Gimhae University.
He was all too familiar with the Shadow.
I remember that when he was in college, Lan Hailong, the eldest son of Lanhua Group, opened the Shadow Studio, and at the same time provided a lot of funds to organize the master students in Gimhae University to fight in the God Domain, at that time he also went to the assessment and became a core member, and Kuroko became a peripheral member, and he was happy for a long time at that time.
Three years later, the shadow studio had his leadership, and suddenly let Lanhua Group make a lot of money in the God Domain, and became a big consortium, but he didn't expect to be personally expelled by Lan Hailong in the end.
Since he was reborn, he still has an incomparable advantage over the God Domain, naturally he is not ready to join the shadow again, become a tool for others, make money for others, he wants to take a different path, he has to fight for his own life, no longer need to let his parents send living expenses, pay off all debts, so he wants to start a business, open his own studio, create his own company, create his own virtual empire, and live a good life.
When Shi Feng came to the No. 1 teaching building, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned young man walking around the gate, anxious, this person was Kuroko.
"Brother Feng, you are finally here, fortunately there is no deadline for registration, let's hurry in and register." After Kuroko saw Shi Feng, he said anxiously.
Shi Feng shook his head and said very seriously: "Kuroko, I'm not going to go to the shadow, I want to open my own studio, are you coming?" ”
Kuroko met in a virtual game, the technology is very good, and then broke into the world together, it can be said that they are brothers, in the days when the shadows worked together, although Kuroko did not have game talent, but the management was very strong, and the guild managed hundreds of thousands of people in an orderly manner, if there is Kuroko's help, the goal will be further achieved, but he will follow Kuroko's choice, after all, he now has nothing, Kuroko's family is not good, in order to live, he decided to be a professional player and join the shadow to earn living expenses.
It took a full minute before Kuroko looked up at Shi Feng.
"Brother Feng, don't say stupid things, do you know how much a virtual helmet costs? That's eight thousand credit points, to open a studio, at least six people, but also a workplace, but also to pay salaries, etc., the start-up capital alone is 780,000, and follow-up investment, that's a lot of money, but now do you have that much money? Kuroko knows Shi Feng's situation very well, knows that Shi Feng's family is not good, and wants to persuade Shi Feng to give up this crazy idea.
"You're right, I don't even have the money to buy a virtual helmet in God Online right now." Shi Feng nodded silently and admitted, as Kuroko said, even seventy or eighty thousand is less, remembering that the hundred-person studio recruited by Lan Feilong spent more than five million, and in the later stage, in order to improve the quality and strength of the studio, it spent a lot.
"In that case, why should we take risks, it is not more stable to go to the Phantom, at least the Phantom can provide a virtual helmet, otherwise we can't even play, let alone become professional players." Kuroko saw that Shi Feng understood the key to the problem, and immediately breathed a sigh of relief, so he pulled Shi Feng to enter the teaching building.
Shi Feng threw away Kuroko's hand, looked at Kuroko seriously, and said with a serious expression: "But I still plan to open my own studio, I don't want to be restrained, Kuroko, are you coming?" ”
Shi Feng will not force Kuroko, after all, he does not have any guarantees, and it is impossible to tell the secret that he is a reborn, he only hopes that Kuroko can believe him.
When Kuroko saw Shi Feng's serious expression, he always felt that today's Shi Feng was very strange, too crazy, it was impossible to make money in the early stage of the virtual game, everyone knew this, could it be that Shi Feng had any way to make money in the God Domain? Even if they make money, it is months later, and they don't have so much time to waste.
Kuroko hesitated for a long time, gritted his teeth, and finally agreed: "I know, who made you the big brother, I will open a studio with you, but what about virtual helmets, we can't play games without helmets?" ”
Shi Feng's tightened brows suddenly relaxed, happily patted Kuroko's shoulder, and said with a smile: "This is my good brother, the virtual helmet matter is assured, I remember that there is a college student trial discount in God Domain, there is a distribution place in each university, as long as you use your student card, you can get a virtual helmet for free trial for ten days, let's take a look." ”
Kuroko's dark face turned livid at this time, feeling that the future was dark, why would he believe Shi Feng? Could it be Shi Feng's self-confidence and stability? Is it really okay to start a business with Shi Feng?
What can I do in God Domain in ten days?
Ten days have passed, you will definitely miss the good opportunity for major studios to recruit people, and in the end it is not to buy a virtual helmet, but how will the money come from?
If you want to earn 16,000 credits in the ten days of the opening of God Domain, even a professional player with a group can't do it!
"Leave the question of money to me."
Shi Feng patted Kuroko's shoulder and smiled confidently.
Earning 16,000 credits in ten days is whimsical, but he has the courage to be a reborn, and no matter what difficulties he faces, he will break them one by one. And the opening of the God Domain was the beginning of his rise.
Then Shi Feng took Kuroko to receive a trial helmet, and bought instant noodles with all the money, put it next to the computer desk in the rental room, a whole two large boxes, enough for more than ten days of food, and then explained some things about the God Domain, and quietly waited for the opening of the God Domain.
At nine o'clock in the evening of April 25, a few shimmers flickered in the dark and silent cabin.
Shi Feng lay quietly on the bed, closed his eyes, and gently clicked the start button of the helmet.
"God Domain, I'm coming."
I can't tell what kind of sound it is, and when I hear it in my ears, it seems to penetrate the body and rush into the soul, so that the human body can't help but make a few noises in this cold snowy night.
The desolate north wind whimpered through the heavens and the earth, and the white snow fluttered with the wind, fragmenting the firmament, sprinkling the earth layer by layer, and looking at it from afar, it was like a silver blanket, and the desolation was everywhere.
It's not late night, it's just dusk, but the bleakness of the sky is the same as the night, giving people a heavy feeling, as if it is pressed on the heart, breathless. On the silver earth, a huge silhouette can be seen, it is a majestic city, as if a giant beast is coming.
In the center of the city, there is a tower-like altar, in the shape of a heptagon, pitch black, straight into the clouds, standing majestically in the storm and snow, and the whimpering wind blowing on the altar is mixed with such a karakara sound, scattered into the distance, with a primitive roughness, with a special charm.
The hoarse murmur wafted out from the altar in this wind and snow, and seemed to merge with the wind, faintly indistinguishable.
"If there is hope, where is hope, if there is no hope, why let me see!!" The voice seemed to be crazy, almost hysterical, roaring and swirling for nine days.
Below the altar, at this moment, there are countless figures in robes, standing there silently, looking at it from a distance, there are hundreds of thousands, they have men and women, around this altar, dense, not moving, but fanaticism emerges, as if the people on the altar say a word, they can give everything for it.
Snow, bigger.
"Since you let me see, there must be hope, but hope... Where! The hoarse voice on the altar was bitter, containing sorrow, and lasted for a long time.
"Today's bright yellow is wrong, Santai opens up the land, the snow and wind come, and the old man will be counted again!" The voice suddenly became louder, and I didn't know what means I used, but I saw that the wind and clouds in the sky changed, and the countless falling snowflakes all stopped suddenly, and then all rolled upside down, whistling from all directions and condensing together, making the sky tremble!
There was no more snow falling in the sky, and all the snowflakes condensed to form a huge snow-colored Xuan Dragon, and as soon as this dragon formed, it immediately raised its head to the sky and hissed, and the sound was so harsh that everyone who heard it immediately shocked their hearts, as if they were about to be torn apart by this sound.
Bursts of shocking blood emanated from the snow dragon's body, and soon filled its whole body, making this snow dragon like a blood dragon, it roared fiercely, struggling its body and rushing towards the sky, like a brute shooting star straight into the sky, as if to blast this day open a hole and open a hope.
Its speed is so fast, in a blink of an eye, it is endless, roaring and roundabout, as if this dragon hit an invisible diaphragm somewhere, the sky shook, the buzzing sound spread in all directions, the blood dragon screamed fiercely again, and the body collapsed layer by layer at a speed visible to the naked eye.
At the moment when it was about to completely shatter, the hundreds of thousands of silent people below the altar, all pinched with their hands, bit the tip of their tongues, and spewed out a mouthful of blood, and those blood seemed to be pulled by some force, galloping up, like a sea of blood rising into the air, straight to the collapsing blood dragon, and after fusing with it, the dragon's collapse momentum was eased, and it rushed to a higher sky.
Seeing that the blood dragon flew higher and higher, condensing everyone's gaze, but at this moment, the blood dragon shook its whole body violently, and after emitting a sharp hiss that spread for tens of thousands of miles, it could no longer stop the collapse of the body, turning into countless blood-colored snowflakes, floating down, and seeing from a distance that the heaven and earth had been dyed red yellow spring.
Even at this moment, the moment the blood dragon collapsed, a voice completely different from a miserable roar came from its mouth! "Death..."
At the top of the altar, in the very center, sat cross-kneeled an old man in a purple robe, his face was wrinkled and covered with brown spots, his eyes were open in muttering, but his eyes were bleak, obviously blind.
In front of him was a complete spine, radiating a white glow, and in his right hand he held a stone tablet, resting on the thirteenth spine.
His empty eyes silently looked at the sky, for a long time, for a long time, and let out a long sigh.
As he spoke, the right hand holding the stone piece moved again on the strange spine, rubbing the beast bone, making a clicking sound, dispersing into the distance, and his figure was significantly bleak, merging with this voice, revealing a sad loneliness and decline.
Late at night, it was pitch black, but the mountains were not calm, fierce beasts were infested, roars shook the mountains and rivers, the trees trembled, and the leaves fell down.
Another beast roar, Lin Feng shrunk his neck, dusted off the leaves that fell on his body, looked at the mountains in the darkness, and sighed in his heart, this place and the earth are really completely different.
Lin Feng sat under the tree in a daze, and several fierce teenagers on the opposite side looked at him with contempt, and a little fat man shouted at Lin Feng: "Leaving you a foreigner in the village is not for you to eat dry food, hurry up and work!" ”
Lin Feng came back to his senses, did not speak, patted his butt and stood up and walked away.
Behind him, the little fat man snorted: "Useless waste, physical strength is not even as good as a child, you should throw him into the mountains for the fierce beast to eat!" ”
Lin Feng pouted, brother an earthling, how can he compare his physical strength with your group of animals?
This Tianyuan Great World is a world dominated by a true cultivator.
This wolf village in front of him is just a small village in the reckless mountains, and there are naturally no truth cultivators, but every villager has practiced martial arts hard and worked hard, even women and children.
Only in this way can we survive in this world where ferocious beasts are rampant and even infested with ancient relics.
Just like now, although it is late at night, the young and strong in the village also have to go into the mountains to hunt, many prey are accustomed to coming out at night, although it is dangerous to enter the mountains at night, but the harvest will be greater.
The people of the village are used to this kind of life, and the children who remain in the village do not sleep, so they gather together to play and wait for their adults to return from hunting.
Children who were still dragging their noses were playing with dozens of pounds of stone locks as toys, while a group of teenagers were competing to see who could lift the huge dings weighing thousands of pounds at the entrance of the village.
Lin Feng looked at this group of small animals, sighed secretly, compared with their strength, he really looked very wasted.
But this did not make Lin Feng feel frustrated, and although he was talked about behind him from time to time, he still used his ability to fool and temporarily settled in this small mountain village called Wolf Village. What really hurt him was that there was one more thing in his mind.
Super Grandmaster System.
At first, Lin Feng was still happy in his heart, thinking that crossing would have benefits, but the first item of the system explanation made his heart cold by half.
"The main mission of the system: host the opening of the mountain and establish the sect, establish the world's first sect in this side, and become the first ancestor."
"The main quest is divided into different stages, each stage needs to be completed within a limited time, and if the timeout is not completed, the host will be directly obliterated!"
Lin Feng looked at the system instructions, especially the last sentence "erase the host", speechless for a long time, and finally squeezed out a few words from between his teeth: "I bought a watch last year!" ”
After the anger, Lin Feng read the content of the task helplessly, he was not ready to risk challenging the system to see if the other party could erase him, just came to this world butt has not yet sat hot, he does not want to die again.
Main Quest 1.0 - Hosting Four Lineage Disciples.
Mission Description: Even if it is a casual cultivator, if you want to inherit your mantle, you must accept disciples. The most important resource of a sect is always people, it is the inheritance of talented disciples, famous teachers are high apprentices, famous teachers are difficult to find, and high disciples are even more difficult to find.
Task time limit: one year, the timeout is not completed, and the host is directly obliterated.
"Pit daddy!" Lin Feng sighed, just our newcomer who has just crossed over, immature like a refreshing little cabbage, I should quickly find a big cow as a master and hug my thighs, right?
System big brother, you give me this cheat, so that I can accept apprentices, this poor and white, what do you let me teach people? Flickering and blowing?
What's more, the system explained that there was a newbie package, but told himself that the package system was faulty, and the newbie package was issued late, making Lin Feng sigh that there is no most pit daddy, only more pit daddy.
The exchange system that opens, but all kinds of good things are dazzling, elixir magic weapons, magic skills, only you can't think of it, without him there is no goods.
The problem is that everything needs to be exchanged for points, and Lin Feng does not even have a single exchange point at the moment, so he can only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was scolding his mother in his heart, and there was a sudden commotion at the entrance of the village, and it seemed that the hunting party had returned.
The teenagers waiting in the village all cheered and greeted the entrance of the village, Lin Feng glanced at it indifferently, but was stunned to find that the young and strong people who had returned from hunting had all returned empty-handed, without prey, not to mention, even the weapons were gone.
For these villagers, weapons are the second life, living in this mountain, they cannot live without weapons.
The corner of Lin Feng's mouth hooked an imperceptible smile: "It seems that there is a story." Thinking of this, he also walked towards the crowd at the entrance of the village.
Before he got closer, he heard someone roaring angrily: "Wolf Wind is the hope of our Wolf Village, and now it has been seriously injured by the people of Shicun, and we must not give up!" ”
Lin Feng looked up and saw a young man in the middle of the crowd sitting on the ground with a withered expression, his body covered in scars, and his eyes flashed with hatred and cold.
"This is the genius that is talked about by the people of Wolf Village?" Lin Feng peeked and observed, for this wolf wind, he has also been famous for a long time, the idol of the teenagers in the entire wolf village, regarded as the hope of the village, today Lin Feng is the first time to see a real person.
Although Wolf Wind was injured at this time, his expression was weak, but he was full of qi and blood, and although his physical strength could not be compared with that of a true cultivator, he was definitely the top among secular martial artists.
According to the public theory of the Tianyuan Great World, if you have this level at a young age, if you cultivate true qi, you will also have a future for development, and in the final analysis, the cultivator is to guide the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into the body, condense mana, and strengthen its own foundation.
Lin Feng quietly toned out his Super Ancestor System, which had a disciple talent detector, and he pressed OK against Wolf Wind.
"The object's qualifications are too low to become a disciple of the host."
Lin Feng's brows furrowed, this system was also too picky, he originally thought of first accepting four disciples casually, fooling the system over the one-year period, and finally it was a big deal to expel these disciples from the door wall.
But now it seems that it is not so easy to drill the loopholes of the system, even a genius young man who is famous in ten miles and eight villages like Wolf Wind is not qualified enough, and Lin Feng wants to collect four disciples to complete the system task, the difficulty is too great.
"One year, one year..." Lin Feng sighed depressedly.
In the crowd, an old man beside Wolf Wind turned livid and snorted: "Wolf Wind is my grandson, of course, this matter can't be left alone, but not now." In recent days, there has been a lot of movement in the mountains, it seems that there is a mountain treasure about to be born, first get the mountain treasure, and then settle the account with Shicun! ”
There were often armed fights between rural clans, and Lin Feng was not interested in this, but the words "mountain treasure" entered his ears, which made his heart move slightly.
Lin Feng was pondering Shanbao, when he suddenly heard someone in the crowd curse in a low voice: "I don't know how Shicun raised such a little monster, less than four years old, a little doll, can actually defeat the genius wolf wind of our village, it's really hell!" ”
Lin Feng's eyes suddenly lit up.
A little doll less than four years old, defeated this wolf wind in front of him?
Wolf Wind already has some talent, and the person who injured him is not even four years old, so what kind of talent should it be?
The little fat man beside Lin Feng scolded in a low voice: "Damn little ghost, you must kill him!" ”
After glancing at him, Lin Feng echoed, "Yes, yes." ”
But in my heart, I was thinking that this little doll might be recognized by the system. Thinking of this, Lin Feng quietly withdrew from the crowd, he now wanted to immediately grow wings and fly to the stone village, but he did not dare to go out of the village alone, otherwise he would directly add food to the fierce beasts in the mountains.
At this moment, a mechanical dull prompt suddenly sounded in Lin Feng's mind.
"Starter pack released, do you want to check it immediately?"
After Lin Feng was stunned for a moment, he was overjoyed in his heart, he had never felt that the boring and dull system prompt sound was so pleasant.
Find a place where there is no one, Lin Feng opened the gift bag.
Newbie Package: The host obtains the basic cultivation to the four-layer realm of the Qi Training Period, gets a lottery opportunity, gets 300 exchange points, obtains the Dao secret "Nine Heavenly Thunder Zhengfa", and obtains the magical power Nine Heavenly Thunder Guidance.
Lin Feng was stunned, and a warm current fell from the top of his head, straight between his chest and abdomen, and quickly rushed away from a hidden acupoint in his body.
There are twelve important acupuncture points hidden in the human body, which are called the twelve layers of the building by cultivators.
The cultivation during the Qi training period is divided into twelve floors, which is to open the twelve floors. When each acupuncture point is opened, the aura will be converted into mana, and the cultivator's mana will go up a step.
Lin Feng now felt a warm current of succession, walking all the way, until he opened the four acupuncture points in his body. As Lin Feng breathed, the Heaven and Earth Vitality from the outside world was rapidly inhaled into his body, hovering in the four acupuncture points that were opened.
Each acupuncture point is like a star-cluster universe that is constantly running, and the spiritual energy is constantly transformed into Lin Feng's own mana, just like the beginning of the universe flood and the evolution of all living beings.
Lin Feng felt that his entire body became lighter, his mind moved, the mana in his acupuncture was like a spring, and the explosive power was about to move.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body, and he was relieved in his heart: "Finally a little self-preservation." But thinking that the ultimate goal of the system was to establish the first sect in history, and he wanted to become the first ancestor in history, Lin Feng was suddenly stressed again, and quickly checked the other things of the newbie package.
"Raffle opportunities?" Lin Feng looked at it, in addition to the exchange system, there was also a lottery system in the auxiliary cultivation system, but it was gray and still in an inactivated state, so there was no need to think about it for the time being.
For now, we can only hope that the purchasing power of those 300 redemption points will be higher.
While thinking, Lin Feng entered the exchange system, he was poor and white before, and he couldn't bear to look at the price.
Looking at the price carefully, Lin Feng secretly scolded the system for being black-hearted, the lowest level bottle of Qi Nourishing Pill costs ten exchange points, and a slightly spiritual iron smelting sword costs thirty points.
Even if you want to get a basic outfit, a set of feather star crown, it takes fifty points.
The most basic magical powers, such as "Fireball Technique" and "Palm Thunder", cost 100 points.
As for those high-end goods with a string of zeros hanging behind their butts, Lin Feng didn't dare to look at them at all, for fear of dizziness.
Lin Feng looked at the pitiful 300 in his "Existing Exchange Points" column and shook his head: "The start-up capital is too small. ”
Fortunately, the newbie gift package opened a Dao secret and a magical power, otherwise Lin Feng would really be blind.
Dao is the foundation of cultivation, mainly to improve the realm, while divine powers are practical martial arts or spells with many wonderful uses.
Surprisingly, the grade of the Jiuxiao Heavenly Thunder Zhengfa in the gift package is very high, and the existing exchange system cannot even be exchanged, and it can only be exchanged after the system is upgraded.
As for the system upgrade, it will only be turned on after Lin Feng completes a certain number of system tasks, and it is still very early.
The Jiuxiao Heavenly Thunder Zhengfa is one of the top thunder system Dao methods in this Tianyuan Great World, but it has been lost for many years, and the predecessors who have achieved cultivation in the past are all big bulls who walk sideways with this Dao method.
According to the instructions, the newbie gift package is a random opening of a Dao, can open the Nine Heavenly Thunder Zhengfa, Lin Feng is considered to be the ancestral tomb green smoke, although the purchasing power of 300 exchange points is limited, but Lin Feng's heart is depressed at this time.
Such a top-level Dao method, if there was no damn main quest, Lin Feng would definitely find a place where no one would practice a divine skill before coming out to kill all sides.
But now that he is going to accept apprentices, it is another way of saying it.
Dissatisfied and dissatisfied, Lin Feng quickly adjusted his mentality and acted quickly.
He remained silent, and after asking Ming the path to Shicun, he quietly left the Wolf Village without alarming others.
The two villages are now in a state of hostility, and Lin Feng, who has become a true cultivator, is not afraid of the people of Wolf Village, but he is afraid that they will expose their identity in front of the people of Stone Village.
Fortunately, now the people of Wolf Village are gathered at the entrance of the village, because the wolf wind was injured and there is a lot of discussion, Lin Feng went around from behind the village, and no one noticed his movements.
Walking on the road, Lin Feng did not hesitate to directly invest in fifty exchange points and buy a career for himself.
How could Lin Feng from the earth not know the truth that "Buddha wants gold, people want clothing", if you want to promote things, publicity and packaging must first be done.
Looking down at his feather star crown, white robe and wide sleeves, a fairy wind Dao bone master's image, Lin Feng nodded with satisfaction, the system things are expensive, but the quality is really nothing.
When Lin Feng came to the entrance of Shicun Village, the first thing that caught his eye was a half-cut huge dead wood, the trunk was more than ten meters in diameter, and the whole body was scorched black.
Lin Feng glanced at it and speculated that this was a lightning strike tree, which had been struck by lightning many years ago, and the huge canopy and vigorous vitality of the old tree were destroyed, and now there was only a stump eight or nine meters high on the surface.
But just by looking at the size of the existing trunks, you can imagine how huge the tree was when it was alive.
The dead trees were scorched black, and there was no sign of life.
At this time, an old man came over and said while coughing: "This tree has been withered for ten years. He walked in front of Lin Feng and looked Lin Feng up and down with a pair of eyes: "Xiao Laoer is the village chief of this stone village, I don't know how I can help this Dao Chief?" ”
Lin Feng smiled slightly, his body naturally exuded a dusty and proud atmosphere, and with a dress, white robe with wide sleeves, feather crown and star crown, the appearance was completely unpicky, absolutely superior in the world.
"Finding a target is suitable for becoming a disciple of the host."
Lin Feng just wanted to speak, but when he heard the sudden sound of the system prompt, he almost choked on his saliva.
The old village chief of Shicun looked at Lin Feng strangely, but he was startled.
I saw Lin Feng's two eyes glowing green, staring at the entrance of the village like a hungry wild wolf.
At the entrance of the village, a pink-carved jade peck, snow-white and cute child, is pulling the tail of a big yellow dog, and the child's voice is crisp and loud: "Babbling, don't run!" ”
The system sound in Lin Feng's mind kept sounding: "The talent system has been sorted out, and the information of target No. 1 is as follows. ”
"Root Bone – > 10; Enlightenment – > 8; Mind – > 8; Fortune – > 8."
"Summary: The goal talent is extremely high, it is recommended to be included in the disciple, carefully taught, and will be the pillar of the sect."
Lin Feng didn't see anything else, his eyes stared directly at the blood-red number "10" behind the root bone.
What does the root bone of 10 mean?
For example, if someone else runs, it takes 100 meters from the start to the end, and if the end point is the same, this little point starts from 90 meters!
No wonder, no wonder that wolf wind that he could beat before he was four years old was full of peach blossoms.
Xiao Budian also found Lin Feng at this time, and looked over with a blank face, blinking his eyes wide, and full of cuteness.
Lin Feng smacked his mouth, this product is not only strong to the sky, but also has a super genius level.
Isn't it a little stressful to accept such a product as an apprentice?
Lin Feng pondered, and a warm and sunny smile gradually appeared on his face.
If someone who was familiar with Lin Feng in his previous life saw him showing such a smile, he would definitely hide as far as he could immediately.
Chapter 1
The morning sun, spilling in through the light silver veil, just fell on the bed, and her eyes were almost open.
At last night's party, she drank too much for a while, and Lu Yanchen picked her up later.
Time sat up, the thin silk was slipped off, a touch of red on the white sheets was revealed, and his greasy white skin was covered with kiss marks.
At this glance, you can tell that it is the result of a night of indulgence.
"I love you."
When the love is strong, his touching love words seem to still be in his ears. Time was full of peach, his eyes were shy, and he turned his head to look around.
What about Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out for breakfast?
Time lifted the quilt and got out of bed, and when his legs touched the ground, he weakened and almost fell to the ground.
At that time, when the light came out again, Lu Yanchen also returned, calmly and slowly walked into the living room, his slender and tall figure with a powerful and oppressive aura.
Time lifted his eyes, and fell into a pair of deep eyes, his gaze was as calm as an unfathomable pool.
After all, it was the first time that such an intimate relationship had happened, and Time was inexplicably a little shy, and he lowered his eyes and did not dare to look at him.
When she was confused, she vaguely heard him say that he wanted to surprise her.
Is it to propose to her?
Time was a little overwhelmed, and my heart was pounding.
As soon as she spoke up, she was interrupted by Lu Yanchen's deep voice: "Break up!" ”
What did he just say, break up?
The surprise he was going to give her, was it a breakup?
Was he teasing her, joking, or seriously, breaking up?
A cry of extreme pain, hidden in the throat can not come out, for a long time, time to find its own voice,
Very light and light, as if low to the dust. "Break up, before we have a relationship... After that, Lu Yanchen, what do you mean? ”
Lu Yanchen's indifferent expression did not change at all, "Last night, who called me to pick her up, and who hugged me so hard that I didn't stop, you also enjoyed it last night." ”
Time is like a thunderclap!
She was stunned, looking at this man who was completely different from what she remembered, she couldn't control her trembling, and asked three words with difficulty, "Why?" ”
After speaking, he turned to look out the window, with a faint smile at the corner of his mouth.
That smile looked like a mockery in time.
Time's face was as white as snow, the pain started from the heart, pressed the nerve endings to the limbs, and the dizzy-like darkness struck, and her fingertips tightly pinched her palms so that she didn't faint.
The air suddenly became cold and damp, freezing people shivering and suffocating, making people unable to stay for a minute.
Time is gone.
Chapter 1
Rain country, Cangyun Town Ling family, moon passed the middle of the sky.
It took Ling Han a full ten seconds before he was finally sure that he had indeed been reincarnated and reborn.
For a powerhouse in the Heavenly and Human Realm, it takes ten seconds to affirm something, which is absolutely incredible, but it also proves how incredible what happened to him is.
In the previous life, he stood at the peak of martial arts, and he had unprecedented achievements in the Dan Dao, and the "Three Fire Introduction" technique he created triggered a revolution in the alchemy world and was honored as the "Dan Emperor".
But he was not satisfied, and he wanted to go one step further, reach the legendary Void Realm, break the void, and turn everything into a god. To this end, he visited countless ancient monuments, and finally entered the Black Blood Valley, and after many dangers, found a mysterious ancient tower.
Without disappointing him, the golden text appeared on the ancient tower, it was a supreme exercise, called "Immortal Heavenly Sutra", when practiced to the highest level, the body would not be bad and immortal, coexisting with heaven and earth, and living with the sun and the moon!
But even with the martial arts cultivation of the Ling Han Heavenly Human Realm, he still felt that this Immortal Heavenly Scripture was obscure, as if he was reading a heavenly book, and he had no clue at all.
He forcibly wrote down this exercise, and was about to study the ancient tower, but the ancient tower was light, releasing an immeasurable divine light, which instantly shattered his physical body. But strangely, his soul did not dissipate, and fell into a state that seemed to be awake and not awake, like a dream and not a dream, which lasted for tens of thousands of years.
In these ten thousand years, his soul has been pondering the Immortal Heavenly Scripture - he can't do anything else but this, and after ten thousand years, he finally comprehends the first layer of this exercise.
A strong man in the Heaven and Human Realm spent 10,000 years to comprehend the first realm of an exercise, what is this concept?
You must know that the powerhouses of the Heavenly and Human Realm are generally less than a thousand years of life, and normally speaking, there is no one in the world who can cultivate this Immortal Heavenly Sutra, because they have already died of old age before they have even started.
But Ling Han mastered the first layer of the Immortal Heavenly Sutra in this strange way, and then, he suddenly came to life and was reincarnated in the body of a sixteen-year-old boy also named Ling Han.
"No matter what's going on, I'm alive again!"
"Although this body is only the cultivation of the second layer of refining the body, and the waste materials can no longer be wasted materials, I used to be a strong person in the Heaven and Human Realm, standing at the peak of the martial arts, and I am a Dan Dao master, and if I have poor qualifications, I will use pills to make up for it, so I don't believe that I can't return to the peak."
"Moreover, I can finally cultivate the Immortal Heavenly Sutra, which is a supreme exercise, and even... It may not be owned by the mortal realm, but from the legendary god realm, otherwise how could it take ten thousand years to understand the first exercise? ”
"In this life, I will definitely be able to surpass my predecessors and achieve the throne of God!"
"Also, what is going on with this body, who only cultivated to the second layer of refining body at the age of sixteen, is it because today's martial arts are too withered?"
Boom, countless memories flooded into his mind, this is the memory that belongs to another Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in this process, two completely different people also fused together, regardless of each other.
"I see."
Ling Han nodded in his heart, the reason why he was now the second layer of refining was because his spiritual root was too poor.
If you want to cultivate to become a martial artist, there is a prerequisite, that is, you must have a spiritual root. With the spiritual root, you can absorb the spiritual energy between heaven and earth, temper your body, and turn it into your own yuan power.
Some spirit roots absorb spiritual energy quickly, while some spirit roots are slow, so the spirit root is divided into four major grades of heaven and earth Xuanhuang, and each large level is divided into three small grades, with the highest grade of heaven and the lowest grade of yellow grade.
The key to judging the quality of the spirit root is the purity, the purer the better, but Ling Han's spirit root is both five elements and the most chaotic, in the martial arts world, this is the most inferior spirit root, counting as a yellow-level lower grade can only be said to be reluctant, so he is now sixteen years old but only cultivated to the second layer of refining body, and his peers have also reached the fourth and fifth layers of refining body.
In his previous life, Ling Han was a Heavenly Spirit Root, and he was also a Heaven-level Nine Yang Fire Spirit Root, coupled with an unmatched Dan Dao talent, with Dan Fuwu, it only took two hundred years to reach the Heavenly and Human Realm, which was an unprecedented record.
"The Five Elements Miscellaneous Spirit Root, this is the lowest spiritual root, no wonder that although the predecessor worked extremely hard, it only had the cultivation of the second layer of refining." "As far as I am concerned, although the Five Elements Miscellaneous Spirit Root is a bit tricky, with the help of elixirs, I will definitely be able to return to the peak in four hundred years at most!"
"Huh!"
Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, with an unbelievable expression of shock on his face, he was stunned for a while, and with a powerful soul power, he looked back at the spirit root at his dantian, and his shocked expression suddenly turned into ecstasy.
"This is not the Five Elements Miscellaneous Spirit Root, the five elements are perfectly balanced, forming a Dao Lotus! This is the Five Elements Chaos Lotus, the best of the best, even rarer than the Nine Yang Fire Spirit Root, which can be called a god-level spirit root! "The predecessor's cultivation was slow because god-level spiritual roots all required special exercises to exert their true power."
"And I... He has mastered a five-element heavenly extreme skill that matches the Five Elements Chaos Lotus! ”
"One hundred years! No, it only takes fifty years for me to reach the realm of heaven and earth again! ”
Rao Yi couldn't help but show joy in the cultivation of the Heavenly Human Realm in Ling Han's previous life, and the spiritual root was destined to be born and could not be changed the day after tomorrow. In his previous life, in order to break the void and become a god, he visited countless ancient sites and obtained a large number of secret techniques, and the Five Elements Heavenly Extreme Gong was one of them.
In the previous life, he stood at the peak of martial arts, and in this life, he will create glory again and create immortal myths.
"How did the predecessor die?"
Ling Han picked up the memory, and soon he showed a scowl on his face.
Formerly the only son of Ling Dongxing, the head of the Ling family, his mother and grandparents passed away very early. And the Ling family is a martial arts family, every clan member practices martial arts, and also respects martial arts, like Ling Dong behavior, what can sit on the position of family master? It is his strongest strength and played.
But because of the problem of Linggen, Ling Han was treated as waste wood since he was a child, and he was eaten up with white eyes.
In order to fight for a bright future for his son, Ling Dongxing reached an agreement with Huyang Academy - Huyang Academy would recruit Ling Han as a disciple and cultivate it with all his strength, and in exchange, Ling Dongxing would enter the Purple Light Land Valley to find something that had been lost a long time ago for Huyang Academy.
Huyang Academy was established by the Rain Country Imperial Dynasty, with countless resources, if it is fully cultivated, even those who waste materials can be promoted to the Juyuan Realm.
But the people of Huyang Academy can't be idiots, if that thing is easy to take, how can they be willing to offer such favorable conditions?
Purple Light Land Valley, there are many dangers, and you may die if you take a wrong step, but for the sake of your son, Ling Dongxing set out without hesitation seven days ago.
Yesterday, people from Huyang Academy came and informed the Ling family that they would pick up people today as agreed. But at this time, Ling Chongkuan, the archdeacon of the Ling family, ran over to discuss with his predecessor, asking him to give up this precious place to his grandson Ling Muyun.
The reason is that Ling Muyun is a genius with unlimited prospects, and such an opportunity cannot be wasted by a waste material.
The predecessor naturally would not agree, this was the opportunity that his father bought with his life! But Ling Chongkuan said that it was a discussion, but in fact, he was just informing the predecessor, and he didn't take his opinion to heart at all.
The predecessor couldn't bear to make a move, but Ling Chongkuan was a strong person in the Juyuan Realm, and he could suppress him with one finger, how could he be an opponent?
With just one punch, his predecessor was seriously injured, and then locked up in his room, obviously not wanting him to make trouble in front of the people of Huyang Academy. And by the time Ling Dongxing returned, the wood was already in the boat.
And the heavily damaged predecessor was so angry to death.
Ling Han snorted, it was really a deception, the place that his father gave his life in exchange for was actually taken away by Ling Chongkuan's grandfather?
This shameless dog stuff!
Can't bear it!
He got up from the bed and suddenly felt sore all over his body - he was alive, but the injuries on his body would not improve invincibly for no reason.
"Linggen is also traumatized!" Ling Han frowned, Ling Chongkuan's blow caused damage to his spirit root, and the spirit root was injured, this was a very troublesome thing, ordinary medical stones were ineffective.
"As far as I know, there are seven kinds of elixirs that can repair the spirit root, but the four required materials are too expensive, even if the entire Ling family is sold, it will not be able to exchange them - moreover, my spirit root is only lightly damaged, and I don't need such a high-grade elixir."
"Of the remaining three, two need to be refined into pills, which is too reluctant with my current cultivation of the second layer of refining body. Then there is only one choice - the Yuan Heart Rejuvenation Spirit Dispersion, only need to mix the medicinal herbs in proportion and boil them into a medicinal juice. ”
"First heal the injury, and then stop Ling Zhongkuan's grandfather, although I am not rare in this place, I must not let my father use his life to exchange the opportunity to cheapen this pair of shameless grandchildren!"
He sat down cross-kneeled and began to run the Immortal Heavenly Sutra.
This was the first time he had operated this technique that might be a god-level, but because he had been pondering it for tens of thousands of years, he was now extremely calm.
Buzzing, a powerful vitality suddenly arose in his body, and the Yuan Power was consumed in large quantities, but the injury was quickly recovered.
In just a few minutes, he was exhausted from his injuries.
"It is worthy of the Immortal Heavenly Scripture, I have just started cultivating and I have such a miraculous effect. It's just that this is completely different from other exercises, the normal exercise is to use the spiritual root to convert the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into Yuan Force, but the non-extinguishing Heavenly Sutra is just the opposite, quenching the Yuan Force to the body and heal injuries. ”
"After practicing to the highest realm, it is not impossible to die and not die." "That's why it can be called the Heavenly Scripture!" "It's a pity that the current level is not enough, otherwise I would be able to repair all the spiritual roots with the Immortal Heavenly Scripture."
Ling Han opened his eyes, looked at the whitening sky outside the window, and muttered, "Now, it's time to go to meet Ling Chongkuan's faceless old product for a while, and surprise him." ”
He put on his shoes, walked to the door, and opened it.
A tall figure immediately appeared at the door to block his way, this person was Zhang Yuan, one of Ling Chongkuan's lackeys.
"Young Master Han, the Archdeacon has ordered, you have to stay in the room today!" Zhang Yuan said with a smile, although the person on the other side was the son of the head of the family, he was a well-known waste material, and it was a joke in his eyes.
Ling Han's eyes were cold, "You dare to stop me?" ”
It's you who stopped you, the archdeacon said, you must not let Ling Han make trouble today, if necessary, you can beat it up! Zhang Yuanpi said with a smile: "This is the order of the archdeacon, and I also ask Young Master Han not to embarrass me." ”
Ling Chongkuan, the old dog, was really cautious, beating him into a serious injury is still not at ease, and also sent someone to guard the door, and this can also see how important it is for Ling Chongkuan to let his grandson enter Huyang Academy - but when this hope is dashed, Ling Chongkuan's disappointment and annoyance can also be imagined.
"Get out of here!" Ling Leng said coldly.
Syllable!
Ling Han raised his hand and slapped it over, and said coldly: "What are you, tell you to roll or not?" ”
What, he was actually slapped by a scrap material? Zhang Yuan stroked his face in disbelief, this waste material actually dared to strike at him, and it hit, what kind of joke was this?
Syllable!
Ling Han waved his hand again and slapped him firmly.
"Meh—meh—meh—"
An acoustic sheep cry echoed through the silent mountains.
Li Qiye climbed the hill, the night wind was sharp and cold, but at this time, he was so anxious that he was sweating. At the age of thirteen, he climbed the mountain with his hands and feet, and the night seemed particularly lonely and creepy.
Although the night looked terrible, Li Qiye's heart was anxious.
Li Qiye, who was born into a family of sharecroppers and his parents were poor, began herding sheep at the age of seven.
Today, Li Qiye herded sheep as usual, but when he drove the sheep back in the evening, he found that there was one sheep missing, which made him anxious, and he hurriedly returned to the hill to look for it, but he rummaged through the entire hill and did not find the sheep.
Thinking of the ferocity of Zhang Dahu's landlord and losing a sheep, Li Qiye was anxious and panicked.
Now the entire hill has been searched, and there is no shadow of the sheep, at this time, Li Qiye thought of a place, and only one place did not look for - the Immortal Demon Cave!
Looking up at the night of the valley in front of him, like a fierce beast, he opened his mouth and chose someone to devour at any time, and faintly heard the sound of wolves crying and ghosts in his ears, and overlooking the mysterious night of the fairy demon cave, Li Qiye couldn't help but shiver.
Fairy Demon Cave, a place famous in the local area, legend has it that there is a demon living in it, and anyone who enters it will be eaten, and after entering, no one can ever come out alive.
However, at this time, Zhang Dahu's crackling leather whip echoed in Li Qiye's ears, losing a sheep, Zhang Dahu would definitely smoke him to pieces!
"Good, good, good, the immortal crow of this seat has finally been refined, only lacks a soul, and today is just a time to borrow your soul!" I don't know how long it took, a deep and gloomy voice sounded from the Immortal Demon Cave.
"Snap-pop-pop-" After a while, a rapid flapping sound sounded, and a crow-like strange bird flew out of the fairy demon cave.
"Fly, fly, this seat will borrow your soul to remember the burial place, fly over the ruins, as long as the Nine Realms are still there, this seat must be found!" In the Immortal Demon Cave, a deep and gloomy voice echoed.
From then on, between heaven and earth, there was a yin crow soaring, entering the burial ground, entering the immortal city, crossing the fierce domain... I can't help myself, fly through the nine realms, endure all kinds of tribulations, and not die for millions of years!
Time passes, times change, invincible characters rise, and one giant after another falls. Slowly, I don't know from what time, a mysterious crow began to appear, a mysterious crow that got rid of its confinement, and began to find a way to control its own destiny.
From the Medicine God, to the Flying Immortal Emperor, to the Blood Seal Immortal Emperor, to the Mingren Immortal Emperor, to the Sun Swallowing Immortal Emperor, to the Ice Feather Immortal Emperor... Finally to the Black Dragon King.
Generations of invincible giants have risen, and generations of gods have fallen away, but after tens of millions of years, the crow still looms in the river of time.
The cold wind is like a knife, and the snow is flying.
As soon as Lu Sheng opened his eyes, he saw that he was sitting on a yellow-gray carriage, the carriage was a little shaky, and there was a little girl's voice talking softly beside him.
Outside the carriage, there were noisy and noisy voices. There are shouts, shouts, cheers.
Lu Sheng sighed deeply.
He knew that he could not go back, from an old oil boy who was eating and waiting to die in a state-owned enterprise, once drunk, he woke up and went into this world.
It's been five days now.
He sniffed his nose, and the air smelled of wine, flapjacks, and fried fruit.
"Oh, the white cinnamon wine in Osmanthus Fang is getting more and more fragrant." The maid in the carriage was small and milky.
Coupled with a natural baby face, he is also small. It looks no different from a ten-year-old.
The little face is chubby, white and red, wearing a small green cotton skirt, and his small hands are still rubbing the hair rope for Lu Sheng to tie his hair when he gets out of the car.
This hair rope is made of a very expensive kind of bark, which will naturally emit a faint fragrance, but the only downside is that it will be hard when it is cold, and it needs to be rubbed hot with hot hands.
Lu Sheng smiled and did not speak. The carriage stopped quickly.
He lifted the curtain and got out of the car, and the gray-white street was paved with bluestone bricks, each the size of a basin.
There were cars on the streets, and people led horses to and fro. The hawkers and the girls and dependents who came out to hang out did not shy away, showing their faces and laughing one after another.
Lu Sheng looked up at the winery in front of him. The white plaque is rectangular in shape, and in the middle of the dragon flying phoenix dance is written three big characters: Osmanthus Place.
"Inside please! The A-sized box is reserved for you! A small smiling face greeted him.
Lu Sheng nodded, a rich boy made a pie, took the silver-edged white paper fan from the small hand beside him, shook it gently, the fan was unfolded, and there was a picture of the mountain shisha wave on it, the landscape rose and fell one after another, light and dark overlapped, and there was an inscription of everyone's style.
He followed the small house into the winery.
The brewery is divided into two floors, and many people are sitting in the lobby on the first floor listening to people singing.
A girl in green stood crisply in the air, her voice was gentle, and there was a middle-aged woman playing a pipa next to her.
The song is a Sanhui Legend, which tells the poignant love between the general who went to war and the fox girl in the mountains.
Unfortunately, the drinkers present were all rough people, only a few literati could still understand, and the rest ignored the two girls.
Lu Sheng stopped, seeing that the first floor was so lively, he simply found an empty seat on the first floor and sat down.
"Who ordered this three will pass on?" He asked casually.
His status in this Osmanthus Fang is different, if this Osmanthus Fang is equivalent to a high-level entertainment club on the earth, then he is the supreme VIP customer here.
Such expenses are already considered top customers in a small city in the north like Jiuliancheng.
"It's Young Master Zhou. Zhou Que Zhou Gongzi. ”
Lu Sheng didn't embarrass him, so he waved him and let him go.
After he pulled Xiao Xiao to sit down, his eyes swept around the crowd on the first floor, and soon he saw a pale-faced thin man, dressed in white, holding a golden ruffled folding fan with a bag, gently shaking.
"I guess it's the little girl who sings again." Lu Sheng shook his head.
"The eldest prince only warned him last time, this guy is really a bad person!" Xiao Xiao pouted and said dissatisfied.
Lu Sheng smiled and stopped talking. Start listening quietly.
A table of wine and dishes was quickly served on the dark red wooden table, and Lu Sheng took a clip of stir-fried shredded meat with lettuce and put it in his mouth.
Take a sip of white cinnamon wine, which is similar to a drink. The faint sweet and sweet floral aroma mixed together, it is similar to drinking juice.
In this Northland Snow City, ice shrimp is a specialty here, and a random catch in a thick ice cave can make a large number of translucent shrimp.
Ice shrimp are half the length of regular shrimp, but they taste delicious.
Of course, the price is also extremely expensive.
Ordinary people eat once a month is already a luxury, where can you have a meal like him.
While Lu Sheng was eating food, drinking wine, and listening to small songs, he was thinking about other things.
It has been so many days since he came to this world similar to ancient China. But according to his observations, there are many oddities about this world.
At first he thought he was back in ancient times, but then he found out that it wasn't.
The customs, festivals, and climate here were far different from any dynasty he knew.
Thinking about things, the door of the brewery opened again.
A group of strong men in short suits walked in one after another, found a table near the corner and sat down.
These strong men knew at a glance that they were not locals, and they were dressed more like they were from the Central Plains, and their clothing temperament was not as rough as the Northland.
The strong man at the head was a bald man with copper earrings and a face full of flesh, but at this time he sighed. ” “
"What is the eldest brother worried about, Lijia Village can't get by, we can take the second road, and it's okay to go around from Zhangcun." The other man frowned.
"You know what, when I came to meet, I came from the Zhangcun side. The situation is similar to that of Lijia Village, and many people have died. ”
"What happened, big brother, you tell the brothers, let us gain insight." A man urged.
The bald man sighed again. "I don't know exactly how, I only know that several fishing villages by Suiyang Lake have accidents, as if there are water ghosts doing it."
“？ No way? ”
Lu Sheng's table was not far from them, and their undisguised chat could be heard.
Originally, he was just listening and playing, but he didn't expect that these people actually talked about Shinto things.
The Lu family in his life is one of the largest households in this Northland Ice City, and the family wealth is still less.
If you want to compare it on the earth, it is at least a rich person with assets of more than 100 million.
In the past few days, he has also heard a lot of rumors about monsters and ghosts in the brewery, but most of them are legends.
This is the first time that these people have experienced first. So Lu Sheng pricked up his ears and carefully stole the sound.
Fortunately, those few people did not hide it. Continue to chat loudly about the strange things in the fishing village.
"That water ghost, I saw it with my own eyes, more than a foot tall, green-faced fangs, covered with a lot of water and grass, obedient, if it weren't for your eldest brother I ran fast, now you are the ones who don't want to see me." The bald head still has palpitations.
"Big brother, is there really such a thing as a water ghost?" A man does not believe.
"I'm afraid it's not the story you made up, big brother, right?"
Lu Sheng also felt funny when he heard this, and it is estimated that a reckless man bragging appeared out of nowhere. During this time, he had seen many of these people.
After eating and drinking, he asked Xiao Xiao to take the song list of the singer girl and browse it at will.
Although Sanhui Chuan is good, it is not a good scene, and he plans to change to a cheerful one.
Syllable!
But at this moment, the bald man turned red and slapped the table.
"A bone that the water ghost fell to the ground! I picked it up secretly afterwards! ”
He carefully took out a jade-like green stone from his arms and slapped it on the table.
"Isn't this just a piece of jade!" A man laughed.
"Miscellaneous jade? Is this miscellaneous jade?
"This brother. Can you show me this thing? ”
Suddenly, a gentle voice came from the side.
Lu Sheng stood at the table of several people with a smile, his gaze sweeping over the green jade on the table.
"This thing, you dare to ask for it? This is what the water ghost left behind. The bald head said in amazement.
He also took it out now, and planned to throw it away in a while.
After all, this is not a thing left by people. If you really want to attract water ghosts to find trouble, it will really be worth the loss.
"I'll take a look." Lu Sheng doesn't believe in any water ghosts, just looks good at jade, not like ordinary miscellaneous jade.
You must know that the general miscellaneous jade, which can be bought everywhere in the stalls in the store, is the scrap material of jade polished at will, and the price is extremely cheap.
But I don't know how, as soon as he saw this piece of jade, he felt that something was wrong.
Tsing Yi and white fox, wearing a green jade hat, wearing moiré black-soled boots embroidered with silver thread.
All the clothes can be spent in this osmanthus workshop for several months. It is even enough for ordinary people to live for more than a year.
"Gongzi wants, it's not impossible, eh.... A silver or two will do! ”
Lu Sheng asked Xiao Xiao to take out a piece or two of broken silver and put it on the table.
The bald head decisively picked up the jade and shoved it into Lu Sheng's hand. Several people changed their eyes, got up and left.
Lu Sheng didn't speak, watching a few people leave, holding the jade in his hand, picking it up and looking at it carefully.
"That is, I can be so rich and powerful in this life." He shook his head, one or two taels of silver was nothing to him, according to the memory of this body, his monthly expenses on weekdays were at least more than one hundred taels of silver. Occasionally more, it may cost thousands of taels.
Thinking of this, he secretly thought of a loser in his heart.
Holding the jade, he ignored the sight of the lively guests around him, but left the winery on his feet and walked towards the carriage waiting outside.
But as soon as he left the winery, he didn't go halfway, when he suddenly startled and picked up the jade and put it in the palm of his hand.
The jade stone was in the palm of his hand, right in the palm of his right hand, and it actually melted.
The originally hard stone turned into a dark green mucus in just a few seconds, and a scream was faintly heard from the mucus.
The entire slime suddenly exploded, turning into a cloud of green smoke that slowly drifted away from Lu Sheng's face.
He stood in place stunned, and saw that the jade was still in his hand, but the green inside did not know when it quietly disappeared.
He stood stunned, constantly recalling the previous picture for a while.
Xiao kept calling him from the side.
Lu Sheng returned to his senses, and then looked at the jade in his hand, it was simply an ordinary pebble, not even jade.
"Gone, go home!"
The two got into the carriage, the coachman picked up the whip and smoked it a few times, and the two black horses covered in long hair slowly moved.
In the carriage, Lu Sheng didn't say a word, constantly looking at the pebbles in his hand. Xiao Xiao also noticed the strange appearance of the stone at this time.
"Fooled again!" She muttered in her heart, and didn't say much, the eldest prince was quite good this time, the biggest time he was deceived before, it was for a so-called antique wine jug, it cost thousands of taels of silver, and almost made the old man angry. This time it was only one or two silver, and the young master sometimes had more than this amount of money for a meal.
The carriage went all the way back to the house. When passing by the city gate, Lu Sheng heard someone shouting outside.
“..... I've heard that the water ghost was removed before! A wandering Taoist intervened to solve the danger of the fishing village! ”
"Is there anyone from the imperial court?"
"I came early, and I heard that even Ouyang Huntou of the prefect Yamen in the city almost fell into it. Fortunately, I met a Yunyou Daoist, and it is said that as soon as that person made a move, it was a flash of golden light, and the water ghost Dangcang screamed, turned into green slime, and then exploded into thick smoke and dispersed. ”
"Of course not!"
Lu Sheng heard that this was the officer guarding the city gate gossiping.
He often deliberately passed by this side of the city gate, and the officers and soldiers here were well-informed and liked to brag about strange things everywhere.
"It's a coincidence..." Lu Sheng's face was silent.
He recalled the jade stone before, and his heart sank.
Autumn 9999 of the Shenzhou calendar, East China Sea, Qingzhou City.
Qingzhou Academy Palace, Qingzhou City Holy Land, Qingzhou City nobles and more than half of the strong people in the sect family all walked out of Qingzhou Academy Palace. Therefore, the people of Qingzhou City are proud to be able to enter the palace to cultivate, and if they have the opportunity to enter the palace, they must study hard.
However, it seems that not everyone has this awareness. At this time, in a school building in the Qingzhou Academy Palace, a young man was sleeping on the table.
Above the lecture hall, a girl in a blue dress also noticed this scene, and a hint of anger could not help but appear on her pretty face, and she took a step towards the sleeping teenager.
Qin Yi, seventeen years old, official disciple of Qingzhou College, disciple lecturer of outer sect, beautiful appearance and hot figure. In the school building, a pair of eyes moved with Qin Yi's moving posture, even if he was angry, Qin Yi's steps were still elegant.
"This guy actually slept in Senior Sister Qin's lecture hall again." It seemed that this was only when he noticed the sleeping figure, and many teenagers around him were a little speechless, obviously, this was not the first time.
"With Senior Sister Qin's appearance and figure, even looking at her is enough to be pleasing to the eye, what exactly is in that guy's head."
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular lecturer, there is no one, as for the reason, as long as you see her, you can understand that I don't know how many people worship her as a goddess, and her lecture hall has always been crowded with school buildings.
Qin Yi's steps were very light, and she didn't make a sound when she walked to the young man's side, she stood at the table, looking at the sleeping face in front of her, her beautiful face was covered with frost.
"Ye Futian." A soft voice came out, but it did not come from Qin Yi's mouth, but from behind Ye Futian.
It seems that he heard someone shouting himself in his sleep, Ye Futian's body moved, his hands supported his head, he opened his eyes leisurely, and under his hazy gaze, he was greeted by undulating peaks.
"It's so big." Ye Futian couldn't help but whisper, his voice was very light, as if he was talking to himself, but in this quiet environment at this moment, this voice was still particularly abrupt, only for a moment, many eyes were frozen in the air, and then turned into anger.
"How dare he... Blatantly frivolous Senior Sister Qin? ”
One after another angry gaze seemed to turn into a sharp sword, making Ye Futian shiver, as if he felt that something was wrong, his gaze moved up the alluring place, and then he saw a face that was as delicate as jade but full of anger.
"Eh..." Ye Futian had a black line on his face, how could it be Qin Yi?
When he glanced back, he saw a fifteen-year-old pure girl glaring angrily at him.
Ye Futian glanced at the girl, and then cursed secretly, he was miserable, no wonder the size was wrong.
"Senior Sister Qin, I..." Ye Futiangang wanted to explain.
"Ye Futian." Qin Yi interrupted him indifferently and said, "In what context was Qingzhou Academy Palace founded?" ”
Obviously, Qin Yi wanted to avoid the embarrassment just now and change the topic, but her anger at the moment, Ye Futian could clearly feel, he even faintly felt a wisp of sword intent flowing from Qin Yi's body, sharp and piercing, stinging every inch of his skin.
"Three hundred years ago, the Eastern Phoenix Emperor ruled the Eastern Shenzhou and ordered the princes of the world to establish the Wufu Academy Palace and prosper the Martial Dao, and the Qingzhou Academy Palace was founded in this context." Ye Futian responded, of course, what he said was the official history, and there was another name in the wild history he saw in the family, but the forbidden name was never allowed to be mentioned.
"What are the professions of cultivation?" Qin Yi asked again.
"Cultivation can be divided into martial arts and techniques, there are many professions such as warriors, knights, and swordsmen, and there are many professions such as mages, dan masters, alchemists, etc., and mages are divided into many lines, of course, there are also talented people who practice martial arts." Ye Futian responded.
"You also seem to have missed a profession." Qin Yi looked solemn and asked very seriously.
The young man's face showed a divine brilliance: "Shenzhou recognized as the strongest profession, the Heavenly Favorite, the Heavenly Mandate Mage, has the talent given by the heavens, those people with rare talents, such as summoners, beast tamers, and star magicians, most of them are from the Heavenly Mandate Mage, and the Heavenly Mandate Mage can have stronger talents than others regardless of their martial arts." ”
Everyone around them is fascinated, the Mandate of Heaven mage, a legendary profession, inherits the Mandate of Heaven, and has to be favored by the heavens. "Not only that, even the Heavenly Mandate Mage is naturally suitable for both martial arts and cultivation."
Qin Yi's eyes showed longing, and then looked at the young man in front of him, and said a little angrily: "I didn't expect you to know a lot about this." ”
"Of course." Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said seriously, "I am a Heavenly Mandate Mage. ”
"Poof..." A young man who was drinking water not far away choked violently, coughing violently, and a pair of eyes around him looked at Ye Futian like an idiot.
There is such a brazen person in the world, worthy of being a legend of the Qingzhou Academy Palace, not only openly teasing Senior Sister Qin, but now lying that he is a Heavenly Mandate Mage, in order to attract Senior Sister Qin's attention?
However, what kind of person is he, who has been practicing in the palace for three years, has been wandering in the first realm of awakening the Qi Gathering Realm, his body is weak, obviously the refining body has not been completed, such a mediocre and even a character who can be called a waste firewood, saying that he is a Heavenly Mandate mage? Is this still shameful?
Qin Yi's chest rose and fell again, and suddenly it was magnificent, and she looked at Ye Futian angrily: "Since you are a Heavenly Mandate Mage, the Natural Destiny Palace has a soul, release your Destiny Palace soul for me to see." ”
"My life soul is still sleeping and cannot be summoned, and I fell asleep in the lecture hall because of the life soul." Ye Futian responded calmly.
"Ye Futian..." Qin Yi suddenly shouted loudly, his beautiful eyes stared at the young man in front of him, and said: "Three years ago, you entered the palace at the age of twelve, when I was still a disciple of the outer sect, visiting your talent test, your perception of Aura as a heavenly product, shocked the palace, many masters paid attention, but in the next three years, there was no progress, always stayed in the first reunion qi realm of awakening, doing nothing all day long, lazy, absent-minded in the lecture hall, did you practice?" ”
"In the past three years, whether it is the Spring Examination or the Autumn Examination, you have all abstained and directly ranked first in the school palace, Ye Futian, do you have any shame?"
With Qin Yi's angry roar, the entire school became silent, and the needles could be heard, and everyone's eyes stared at Qin Yi's excited face, as if this was the first time they had seen Senior Sister Qin look like this.
Ye Futian also seemed to be calmed, and those dark eyes stared at the delicate face in front of him that was red with anger.
"Three years." Ye Futian whispered in his heart, he didn't expect that three years had passed before he knew it, and the guy in the fate palace still hadn't changed at all, and he was a little surprised, the iceberg sexy goddess Qin Junior Sister, who had always been indifferent, had been paying attention to him, and it had already begun since he stepped into the palace to detect the talent of heavenly perception.
The space was dead silent, Qin Yimei's eyes stared at the young man in front of him, a handsome face with clear lines, clean and deep eyes as bright as stars, fifteen years old, in addition to the thin body, can not fault other things, in three or two years, it must be a beautiful man.
"Am my tone too heavy?" Qin Yi saw that the corners of Ye Futian's eyes seemed to be a little lonely, and he couldn't help but secretly say in his heart, and his anger also dissipated a little.
"There is still a month to go to the Autumn Exam, if you still abstain or fail this time, even if you intercede for you for the rest of your life, it is useless, and the Academy Palace will not allow you to continue to stay, do you understand?" Qin Yi continued, the eyes of the people in the school house froze, it seemed that the school palace could not bear that guy.
If so, I am afraid that it will be recorded in the annals of the history of Qingzhou Academy Palace, after all, it is rare to be expelled from Qingzhou Academy Palace.
"He goes, I go." At the back, an indifferent voice came, and many people looked at the young man sitting in the corner, with complicated eyes, envy, jealousy, worship, and fear.
"The Academy Palace has decided that he does not need to participate in next year's Spring Festival for the rest of his life, and he can arbitrarily choose the Academy Palace battle building, the Knights, and any palace practice in the Magic Palace, and his future can no longer be affected by you." Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed, the fate of him and Yu Sheng would eventually go in a completely different direction.
The corner of Ye Futian's mouth outlined a faint smile, a little cynical.
"Shut up..." Sitting behind, Yu Sheng stood up, his eyes shining with brilliant sharp light, stabbing towards Qin Yi.
"Sit down." Ye Futian didn't reply, said lightly, Yu Sheng's gaze froze, looked at the back in front of him, and then sat down quietly, as if Ye Futian's words were an iron order to him.
"I decided..." Ye Futian showed a slightly frivolous smile on his face, and looked at Qin Yi and said, "I have officially participated in this year's Qiuyun Examination." ”
Behind, a brilliant light flashed in Yu Sheng's eyes.
It's been three years, and he's finally, is he going to be serious?
Qingzhou Academy Palace has been practicing for three years, and everyone in the Academy Palace only knows that he is extremely talented for the rest of his life, golden attribute perception is heavenly, and martial arts talent is also extremely high, but he can cultivate both law and martial arts, although he is a disciple of the outer sect, his realm is higher than many lecturers.
However, who really knows about the sleeping teenager?
"Your body is weak, and you are still stuck in the realm of awakening the first reunion qi, even if you participate in the Autumn Examination, how can you pass?" Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed in his heart, even if he rose up now, he was afraid that it was still too late.
"What if it's over?" Ye Futian seemed to have no self-awareness at all, and there was a strong confidence in his tone.
"If you can pass, you can do whatever you want in the lecture hall in the future." Qin Yidao.
Ye Futian's eyes flashed a strange brilliance, looking at the silhouette and hot figure in front of him, his eyes involuntarily looked at the place where he shouldn't, and said weakly: "Can you do whatever you want?" ”
"This guy, what do you mean by this..." Many people stared at Ye Futian.
"Where are the eyes of this impudent bastard?" It seemed that noticing Ye Futian's eyes, many people had the urge to run away, he even dared to tease Senior Sister Qin?
Qin Yi naturally also noticed Ye Futian's eyes, and the sympathy that had just been born disappeared instantly, and his beautiful eyes stared at Ye Futian viciously, gritting his teeth and saying, "Whatever you want, you can do it!" ”
Deep in the mountains and forests, ten thousand demons gather.
For the first time, all races put aside their grudges and appeared at the same time, tigers, rabbits, foxes and snakes... All kinds of demons have arrived. For a while, the entire forest was full of all kinds of demon sounds, big or small, delicate or charming. At the top, there were ten demon kings, and these ten top powerhouses in the demon realm had the same heavy expression between their eyebrows at this time.
"Fellow demon races, what has happened here recently must be in your hearts." The Tiger Clan has always been strong, and the Tiger King was the first to speak to silence all the demons, "We belong to the same demon category, and under such a crisis, I think all races should put aside their prejudices, speak together, and solve the current problems together." ”
"For what purpose?"
"Do you still need to guess this?" The Tiger King snorted coldly, "Apart from those cultivators in the three sects of the six factions, who would do such a thing. Have we had fewer demons slaughtered by him over the years? ”
"But we and these Immortal Cultivation Sects have always been at odds with each other, why they suddenly blocked me from waiting for the way out of the boundary." The Fox King looked puzzled.
"I didn't eat the first son of their three sects and six factions." The snake king also guessed, "They don't need to tear their faces like this, right? ”
"It is!" The Leopard King also said indignantly, "After so many years like this, which demon has not eaten a mortal, how can the three sects and six factions suddenly make trouble?" I don't think it's them. ”
"Yes, everyone knows that the demon qi of my realm is detrimental to their cultivation, so they never come close to the border forest, how can they stay here."
"But... In addition to the six factions and three sects, who still has the strength to kill all the demon races out of bounds within three months. The Tiger King still insisted on his ideas.
The Eagle King nodded, as if he had thought of something, and the feathers on his body trembled, "I heard that those demon clans who were out of bounds were all dead to the bones, and there were corpses that were skinned and cooked, and there were dried corpses on the old shame trees in the forest." It's so cruel to start... Birds and beasts are not as good. ”
"It's just too deceitful." The Tiger King smashed the arm of the stone chair with a palm, and stood up angrily, "Demon Kings, I think instead of guessing who laid the hand here, it is better to kill together to find out clearly." I don't believe it, no matter how high their cultivation is, can they still block this army of ten thousand demons? ”
As soon as he said this, the other nine demon kings suddenly showed expressions of approval, and it was indeed better to take the initiative to attack than to be afraid.
The deer king was the first to respond, "My son just died in their hands, instead of guessing here, it is better to go out and kill." What about the three sects and six factions, when did we monsters ever fear them! ”
"Isn't that why we're here today? Whoever he is, kill to avenge the dead of his kind. Even the rabbit king, the least daring, stood up in response, and the rabbit tribe died the most.
"That's right, this revenge is not rewarded, it is a demon!"
"The demon soul of the clan is on top, I wait for this oath to take revenge."
Other demon kings also stood up one after another to respond, and even the demons of all races and races who were waiting around also appeared, bright claws of bright claws, excitedly shouting the slogan of revenge, looking like the whole army was ready to go.
"What..." a thin voice suddenly sounded in the demon group, "I don't think I have to go." ”
In the wave of anger, a voice of opposition suddenly appeared, although it was not loud, but it successfully attracted the attention of the demons. As soon as the shouting stopped, the eyes of all the demons pierced in unison.
"Who is it?" The Tiger King roared a tiger, searching for this unplanted demon.
The demons looked around, obviously they were the demon with the most acute senses, but they didn't find this person who spoke up for a long time.
"Who the hell did you just speak?" The Tiger King was a little angry, "Where did the demon come from?" There is a kind of stand up for Ben King! ”
"I'm here, here!"
The demons patrolled the surroundings several times again, but they still didn't see who the person who spoke up.
"Here and here..." the voice rose again, "left left, no... After that, a little on the right, wrong, look here, look at this! ”
The demons followed the voice left and right several times, but still did not find anyone who made the sound.
"Alas! Forget it, I'm here! ”
Until a sigh, a figure suddenly used his hands and feet and climbed onto the high platform where the demon kings were sitting. Only then did the demons see the one who spoke up.
It was a woman in a gray fluffing robe, her shoulders were weak, her eyes were pulled down without a head, and the whole person showed a lazy temperament, she was short and thin, and her face was a little yellow.
The word "weak" appeared in the minds of the demons at the same time, too weak! Even the demon qi on her body was pitifully weak, as if any demon breath could blow her away.
It's no wonder that the demons didn't find this person after looking for a long time just now, such a demon is too inconspicuous.
The bloody tiger king suddenly couldn't see it, the tiger nose sprayed, and said fiercely, "Hmph, you are a brat without seeds, a few cultivators have scared you and turned into this." Demons can be transformed, but this is the Ten Thousand Demon Assembly, so most of the demon races here have revealed a little prototype to distinguish races, only she maintains a complete human form, which makes the Tiger King even more unpleasant, "Don't dare to show people in the original form, what kind of demon are you?" "I'm human."
"I'm human." The woman replied.
"Shemale?" The Tiger King was stunned for a moment, "What kind of demon is a shemale?" Never heard of it! ”
"How can any messy weak demon dare to come to the Ten Thousand Demon Conference." The Tiger King glared at the woman indignantly, "You little demon who has no seeds, Hugh has to talk nonsense here, affecting my morale to wait for revenge." ”
"No, I'm serious." The woman raised her hand unrepentantly, but her shoulders unconsciously drooped, making her appear weaker, "You really don't need to go out and find someone to take revenge." ”
"Still saying demoralizing things!" The Tiger King was angry and roared, "Believe it or not, I ate you little demon." ”
"You ate me, so there's no need to run for nothing?"
"What do you mean?"
"I mean, the guy you just said killed all the monsters and inferior to the beasts..." she sighed, patted the gray robe and looked up, still listless, but pointed to her nose, "Maybe... It's me! ”
The audience was silent for three seconds.
"Kill her!"
The ten thousand demons who reacted rushed towards the woman at the same time.
Small animals or something - what a hassle!
Five minutes later.
——The first and last Ten Thousand Demon Conference, the curtain!
Chapter One: Tony Downe?
The loud noise stimulates the nerves in the brain, and the decibels can cause deafness. A dazzling white light shot into the eyes, and the sun ** bulged and hurt.
Tang En couldn't help but narrow his eyes, but the white light did not fade, but spread to the entire world.
What the is going on? Am I in a rock club?
Donn cursed in his heart and opened his eyes, but what rushed into his eyes was a big scary face. A black face covered in sweat, and the hot air from the two black holes under the broad nose seemed to have stained his face. The white teeth in the large cracked mouth are as frightening as wild animals, and of course, the bad breath erupts from there.
What followed was a violent, head-on collision. Donn felt as if he had been hit in the jaw by a heavy punch, and the whole person fell backwards.
The weight of two people weighed on the poor plastic bottles, and they were overwhelmed and disintegrated. The water of the white flower splashed out, and even a water column shot out from the mouth of a certain bottle, directly rushing to the face of the "pond fish" behind, and the other "pond fish" seemed to be frightened sparrows.
"Damn it!"
"What the hell!"
"What's going on?"
"Team doctor, team doctor!"
"How did you kick?"
Donn lay on the ground, staring blankly at the strange faces around him, some of them anxious, some gloating, and some covering their faces without expression. It was still noisy all around, but the loud noise had changed its tune just now, and there was boos and laughter.
Where is this? Who are they? What's going on?
Wait, let's see what was born on the sidelines? The live commentator suddenly became excited, he stood up and looked down from the top stand, "David Johnson, the main striker of the Forest team, was slammed into the sideline coach's dugout in a fight with the opposing player, and poor coach Tony Downe happened to be standing on the sidelines directing the game... Oh! Look at the tragic situation on the ground, this is really a collision of Mars hitting the earth!
Donn lay on the ground, his light gray suit soaked, crumpled with grass clippings and dirt, looking like a freshly used rag.
A man with a big nose and a black beard and a bit like Mario appeared in his field of vision, and he quickly took out white gloves from the back-colored leather bag he was carrying and put them on, and then began to examine Donn's body.
Hell, he seems to have the back of his head on the ground!
"Can you hear me?" He stretched out his hand and shook it in front of Don's eyes, and his tone was obviously much more anxious than just now.
At the same time, the scene just now began to be played repeatedly on the TV screen.
David Johansson was pushed hard by the opponent in a fierce fight with the opponent's No. 14, and then the big black man leaned over to Tony Downe, who was standing on the sidelines. But the strange thing is that Donn could have dodged it, he had plenty of time, but now he stood on the sidelines like a puppet, watching his team crash into him.
A scene up. The Forest players anxiously gathered around the coach's dugout, and the center of the crowd was naturally Donn lying on the ground, and the black striker David Johansen, who made a mistake, knelt on the ground and prayed. If his coach has any three strengths and two weaknesses, he will be the first player to kill his manager on the pitch.
Unlike the nervousness of the Forest players, most of their opponents stood in the stadium, wrapped their arms around and watched the play, and there were curious people who took on the duty of being the scouts of the whole team, constantly running to see the excitement, and then running back to share the situation in the crowd with their teammates.
Forest fans in the stands didn't seem to be worried about the fate of their manager, and they took the opportunity to curse their team's poor performance, with words beginning with "F" or "s" bursting out of their mouths, and countless high middle fingers that set off the "0:2" on the big screen.
The Forest team doctor Gary Fleming (gary F1eming) is still doing his best, he obviously saw Tony's eyes move just now, why didn't he react again?
He patted Tony Downe's face, still unresponsive. The acting head coach of the team was lying on the ground like a wax figure, his mouth slightly open and his eyes round, as if he had seen something very surprised.
The blue sky, the white clouds like marshmallows, the faces with different skin tones and expressions, the noisy environment, all this is very familiar, but so strange, as if thousands of miles away from themselves.
The referee signaled to the team doctor to watch and deal with it, he could not let the game be suspended endlessly because of an off-field injury. He sounded the whistle to get the players back on the pitch and the game to go on, even though the Forest players were out of the mood.
"But he may even be in danger of his life!" Fleming was angry at the referee's indifference, pointing at Don who was still lying on the ground and yelling at the referee.
"Then you call an ambulance, I'm just a referee!" The referee pushed back without showing any weakness, "Besides, he doesn't seem to be as dangerous as you say." He pointed behind Fleming and ran back onto the pitch.
Fleming turned back and saw Donn touching the back of his head and standing up slowly, and he quickly went up to help him. "How are you feeling, Tony?"
Donn asked blankly, "Where is this?" ”
Fleming turned around and cursed, what a bad luck these days. "Des, Des, come here!" He beckoned a golden man from the dugout to come over.
The man called "Des" ran over. "How's Tony?"
"It's awful. He even asked me where this is? ”
Des reacted the same as Fleming just now, and he also turned his head and cursed.
"I suspect it's the result of the impact he just fell to the ground and suffered a blow to the back of his head."
"Is it bad, Gary?" Des bit his lip with a solemn expression.
"I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad." Fleming shook his head.
"What does that mean?"
"In good cases, he only has a brief amnesia, and he will ease up after a break. Bad situation... Do you still need me to say? ”
Des waved his hand, signaling that he understood. "Take him to the hospital? But now the game is still going on, and we are behind, and we need him to direct the game..." He said and turned his head to glance at Tony Downe next to him, but he was surprised that Donn was slowly moving towards the player tunnel alone.
"Hey!" Des quickly threw Fleming down and ran forward to grab his colleague.
"Tony, where are you going?" In a noisy environment, Des shouting with his teeth and claws actually has the effect of "whispering".
Donn looked back at Des blankly, this look made Des look cold, now the afterglow of the setting sun above their heads was golden, but he couldn't see any brilliance in those eyes at all.
"Tony, where are you going?" Des repeated.
"I... I don't know, maybe... It's going home," Donn muttered, trying to break free from Des's hand.
Fleming also ran over from the side: "Tony, you can't go home now." We're playing, you're the manager, you're in charge of the team! ”
The tugging of the three people at the entrance of the passage attracted the attention of the benches of both teams, as well as the stands, and even the players on the field would glance here from time to time.
Donn suddenly smiled: "I'm a coach? This is ridiculous, how can I be a coach... Although I am a fan and play football manager games a lot, how can I be a coach? This must be a dream, or a damn nightmare!
Fleming said next to him as if introducing the two who met for the first time: "He's Des, Des Walker (Desa1ker)." A former England international who played as a centre-back who only retired last season and is now your colleague, your assistant. ”
Donn nodded, and then said to Des: "Okay, now you command the game for me, I'm going to rest." After that, he broke away from Des's hand, and no longer cared about the huge boos behind him and the two stunned people, and walked into the passage.
Fleming looked at Down's back and at Des Walker.
Walker sighed heavily, turned and walked back. "This game can't be played!"
Donn sat in the passage, his back against the wall, staring blankly at his surroundings. On the white wall opposite him is a huge sign, with three wavy curves below the large red "mushroom" and an English word underneath: Forest.
Where have I been? What's going on?
Donn touched the back of his head, where there was still a faint pain.
, sneak attack Lao Tzu, hit Lao Tzu behind!
"What's my name?" He muttered, but suddenly covered his mouth again. Only then did he realize that all he had been speaking was bird language - English.
"***, how did this happen?"
Donn, who finally realized where he was, stayed again, so strange that his brain stopped responding after the load calculation. And all this seems to have little to do with him anymore.
This is the scene at City Stadium this afternoon, where Forest acting head coach Tony Downe stands on the sidelines and is knocked down by his players, and then appears to fall into a brief coma. When he got up again, he walked straight into the players' tunnel.
Through the faint glow of the street lamp outside, Donn stood in the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. A middle-aged ghost with a tall nose, deep eye sockets, blue eyes, and a slightly curved brown head.
In fact, Tang En, who is from Sichuan, China, is only twenty-six years old, and at this moment the people in the mirror even have head-up lines! Thirty-four years old! This is Tony Downe's age.
Not only did he inexplicably lean over an Englishman, but he also crossed forward for four years and three months!
Although he never felt that he was very handsome, he could attract the favor of many women.
He growled at the mirror and then shattered it with a punch. The self in the mirror suddenly became innumerable, the fragments fell to the ground and there was a faint noise, and countless faces looked at Don, as if mocking him.
Donn felt a little dizzy, and he took a step back, leaning against the smooth wall and gasping for air.
Donne, who had been quiet in the dark for a few minutes, gradually calmed down, and he decided not to think about such a complicated problem first. He has a habit in China of going to find a place to drink whenever something goes wrong. Chengdu is full of bars, maybe you can find a one-night stand or something. He habitually regarded Nottingham as Chengdu in his heart, and decided to go out to find a bar to borrow wine to pour his sorrows.
Glancing at the hazy sky outside, he put on a thick trench coat and walked out the door.
"Having lost 3 at home to underdog Walsal, Forest have had a really bad run lately. Paul Hart, who had high hopes for the team, did not produce good results and submitted his resignation to team president Nige 1Doughty after the last round, which was quickly approved. ”
Today's sports news is being played on a television set fixed to the overhead, with the focus naturally on everything that was born on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest game.
There was a boo in the noisy bar.
A drunken man gave the middle finger to the TV. "That Tony Down I know him! A little furry kid who used to be an assistant to Paul Hart in the youth team. ”
The drunk had just finished his tirade when Donn pushed the door in. The slamming of the door attracted the attention of most of the people who were drinking and chatting in the bar, and everyone turned their eyes to the door, and when they saw who the person who came in, they were first surprised, and then a playful smile appeared on their faces.
A typical middle-aged British man stood up with a wine glass and shouted, "Our Coach Tony Downe has arrived!" ”
"Woohoo!" The people inside the bar booed "welcome".
"Cheers to his beautiful off-field breakout against Johansson!" The middle-aged man raised the wine glass in his hand, and the people around him immediately echoed and raised the wine glass in his hand. "Cheers!
Another man who was obviously drunk stood up crookedly, walked to Don, held a beer bottle in his hand to his mouth, and burped and asked: "Coach Tony Downe, it was a beautiful defense, but the referee and public opinion are obviously not ... are not so thought... Belch!
After asking, he turned his head and laughed at the other people in the bar.
So with a gloomy face, he pushed away the wine bottle that stood in front of him. Then he went straight to the bar and said to the bartender inside: "Please bring the bottle..." He habitually wanted to say that the bottle "Xiao Er" - the small bottle of two pot head, although he is from Sichuan, but he went to college in the north, and he has liked this strong liquor since that time - but he now does not speak "Xiao Er" in English, and more importantly, he quickly reacted that this is in England, not China. He looked down and cursed, then changed his words: "Come the strongest wine." ”
The others who had been watching him heard him say the strongest wine, and they all shouted loudly.
"Yo! Coward Tony even drinks too? ”
The young bartender was also a little overwhelmed by these excited guests, and he wanted to go to get the wine but was stopped by the drunkards: "Bring him juice!" Fruit juice! ”
"No, no, it's still milk, we have the freshest milk!"
"Ahaha!"
The owner of the bar, alarmed by the noise outside, came down from the stairs and stood at the entrance of the stairs, and saw almost all the guests who had not yet fallen asleep on the table gathered around the bar, and among them sat a man wrapped in a black trench coat, laughed at by the drunkards.
His loud voice suddenly quieted the tavern. The drunkards, who were still arrogant just now, suddenly quieted down when they saw the people standing behind them.
Donn felt strange, what kind of person can make this group of people honest with just one sentence? He turned his head slightly and saw a man coming out of the shadows at the entrance of the stairs.
The young bartender quickly pointed at Donn and said to the man: "Boss, he wants a strong liquor." ”
When the visitor saw who was sitting, he was a little surprised, but he still said: "Just give it to him." ”
"But... But they won't let . " The bartender looked at the drunkards who had returned to their seats.
The man looked around the bar, but anyone who was swept by his gaze lowered their heads, either pretending to sleep or drinking vigorously. Tang En became more and more interested in the capable middle-aged man in front of him.
"I see no objection to it, pour him a glass of Scotch whisky, I'll treat him." The bar owner turned to Donn and asked, "Single or double?" ”
The drunkards laughed out loud watching the excitement on the side.
The bar owner laughed too. "I forgot who you are..." He poured half a glass of golden whiskey over the glass, then added half a glass of water. Then handed it to Down: "This is the wine of my hometown." ”
Donn took a sip and immediately coughed, he rarely drinks foreign wine. Not to mention that this pure Scotch whisky also has a strong charred smell.
There was a burst of schadenfreude laughter inside the bar.
"The Tony Down I know never drank and lived like a true traditional Puritan. And he won't look at me like this now, don't you know who I am? The man stared at Don, who now seemed to be seen through by this man.
He had to find a way to cover himself. "Uh... I", Donn lowered his head and took another sip, this time he didn't dare to let the wine stay in his throat for another second, and swallowed it directly, the uncomfortable feeling was indeed lighter.
Another burst of laughter.
The man touched the back of his head to show understanding.
Someone next to him helped Don En to relieve the siege, and a voice shouted: "It seems that our Coach Tony has really broken his head!" The person sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, a two-time European Cup hero and winner of the 1978 Stanley Matthews Award, Mr. Kenny Burns! He's a hundred times stronger than your stupid donkey! ”
The people behind him laughed loudly, and the "stupid donkey stupid donkey" kept crying, but he couldn't prevent the object of his mockery from throwing out the remaining half glass of wine in his hand. The golden Scotch shone brilliantly in the light, drew a beautiful arc in the air, and then shot accurately into the face of the hapless bastard - accurate and beautiful like David Beckham's right-footed free kick. "Bang!"
His swear words were smashed back by a thick wine glass, and Donn pounced on the other party with a swift and wine glass that no one could expect. He had endured this breath so much that he couldn't bear it anymore, inexplicably came to this place, inexplicably crossed forward for four and a half years, and was inexplicably ridiculed and insulted... He wants to find someone to vent now, whether he knocks someone down or someone else knocks him down.
The two slammed into the table behind them, and the empty wine bottle fell down, shattering to the ground with a crisp sound.
The laughter stopped abruptly, and everyone was stunned. They didn't expect that Tony Downe, who was still like a coward just now, would suddenly explode.
The first person to react was bar owner Kenny Burns, who pushed a fat man standing next to the bar and shouted, "What are you doing standing silly?" Pull them away! ”
In addition to the miserable situation on the ground, blood had oozed from the forehead of the beaten, and a red circle appeared there, which was the mark of the mouth of the cup. In addition to this, he received a punch on the left cheek, as red as if he was drunk.
And Donne, except messed up his head and clothes, there was nothing. After being pulled up, he seemed to have vented his anger, and there was no need to pounce on the fight, he straightened his clothes and head, and then said to the unlucky ghost who was held up by his companions: "I don't care who you are, don't mess with me." ”
Then he turned to Burns and said, "I'm sorry for making a mess of you here." Today is too ***..." he was annoyed at the thought of being crossed, "Another day... I will personally apologize, and please don't worry about compensation. ”
Then, without waiting for the owner of the bar to say anything, he turned and walked towards the door. When he passed the fat man, he also mocked: "Your milk is still for yourself to drink, fat pig." ”
Everyone watched him push the door out, but no one thought to stop him, so they watched him leave, leaving a mess.
There was silence in the bar. At this time, the drunken drunkard sat up from the table, looked at the silent room of people and the mess, and asked in confusion: "Did I miss something?" ”
I don't want to be a ghost! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Donn shout that?
Since your "past life" is quite bad, why not use this opportunity to have a different life? Although he has never been a football coach, but he has also watched football for more than ten years, football manager games have been played in every generation, and he knows more or less about the nature of the work of some coaches, isn't this a good opportunity to challenge?
He stopped thinking about why God had chosen him for this boring question. He now just has to think about how to do more like a real career coach, and although it will be hard, it is worth trying.
"Hey, man. You broke into my home without my permission, and I called the police if you don't leave! An old voice suddenly sounded next to him.
Donn looked blankly at the old man standing opposite, holding many, many newspapers in his arms and a half-bitten burger in his hand.
"This... Is it your home? He pointed to the bench below him.
"Of course."
"Ah, sorry to interrupt..." Donn got up from the chair, and the other party immediately sat down, and then lay down. Cover yourself with newspapers in your arms and press them firmly between the back of the chair and your body.
Looking at the beggar who was contented to eat a burger and lie in a "newspaper den", Donn even had to thank God for not allowing himself to "possess" him. Fate did not treat him badly.
A taxi dropped off in front of him, he walked up quickly, and got in. Donn took one last look at the beggar lying in the cold wind enjoying "dinner" in the car and asked the driver to take him back to that strange home.
From today, a whole new world slowly unfolds before Don's eyes. On Saturday morning, the wind was fine, and Zhao Yao was walking on the way to sterilization... On the way to neuter his cat.
In the cat bag in his hand is a yellow beaver flower cat, also called orange cat, one of the pastoral cats. The head, back, and limbs are covered with layers of yellow-orange markings.
The chest and stomach are a large piece of fluffy white hair, and the tips of the limbs are white, and it is said that this snow-white glove has a second-killing effect on girls, controlling their brain waves and making them make "ah~~ah~~" sounds.
Although it is a male cat, it has big eyes and looks very girly.
At this time, the cat is letting out a heart-wrenching howl. The vast majority of domestic cats are very, very homely, and they are only willing to stay at home for the rest of their lives, and moving or going out is a very scary thing for them. Zhao Yao only kept comforting the cat out loud.
At the same time, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dark meteor slowly crossed outer space and gradually flew over China, and the surface of the meteor flashed with a strange luster, which seemed to be constantly releasing some kind of ray towards the surrounding void.
In the Star Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao put the cat bag at the front desk: "The male cat is neutered, I made an appointment before, and my surname is Zhao." ”
"You haven't been to us before looking at the record, and you need to fill in the information field of the medical record card."
In outer space, meteors slowly crossed the sky over the land of China and began to move towards the Pacific Ocean, where the meteors passed, many cats suddenly shook their bodies, and a deep luster flashed in their eyes, just like the luster emitted by meteors.
At this time, matcha suddenly moved, struggled to jump, and rushed towards the hospital gate.
The little nurse let out a scream, but Zhao Yao on the side swooped out and grabbed the fleeing matcha.
Zhao Yao's speed was still too slow, and he couldn't grab matcha's body, but only grabbed matcha's tail.
The tail was caught, matcha let out a roar, instinctively turned around and bit towards Zhao Yao, this is the instinct of felines, the speed is also extremely fast, instantly opened a hole in the back of Zhao Yao's hand, Zhao Yao's back of the hand hurt, and immediately released the palm.
Perhaps knowing that he had run into trouble, matcha did not continue to escape, but just curled up and looked at Zhao Yao with some unease.
Zhao Yao hugged matcha and said angrily: "Silly cat, what are you biting, rebelled, right!" ”
The matcha cat's gaze suddenly flashed a ghostly light, and the traces of blood stained on the teeth completely disappeared.
Zhao Yao also felt that his head suddenly dizzy, and then he wanted to see if the wound on the back of his hand was deep, but this look was slightly dumbfounded, and he saw that the back of his hand was smooth, and there were any wounds and blood stains.
The little nurse on the side took the cat and comforted: "Good matcha, it's okay, it'll be fine for a while, don't be nervous." ”
This cry was heard in Zhao Yao's ears, but it was not a simple cat barking, but it became an understandable word.
Zhao Yao pointed to the matcha in front of him in shock, and said with a surprised expression: "This... This...... This cat spoke! ”
The little nurse looked at Zhao Yao suspiciously and said, "Mr. Zhao, are you okay?" ”
"Didn't you hear?" Zhao Yao hurriedly said: "It... It's talking. ”
The little nurse's brows furrowed, and her gaze became more and more strange as she watched Zhao Yao.
"Do you understand me?"
"Take me home!"
"Woooo
Zhao Yao opened his mouth sharply, looked at the little nurse who didn't notice anything on the side, was still comforting matcha, looked at matcha again and said: "Can you understand me?" ”
"Can understand, can understand, I want to go home, take me home, woooo
The little nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao, who was talking to the cat, but her face became more and more strange.
Ignoring the strange gaze of the little nurse, Zhao Yao quickly picked up the matcha and stuffed it back into his bag, trotting all the way out of the hospital.
Inside the rental house, the matcha cat returned to the familiar environment and immediately relaxed, lying on the coffee table and began to lick his little white hands, his eyes narrowed, and his face was leisurely. For cats, licking is a very suitable behavior for relaxation.
In front of the coffee table, Zhao Yao stared at the matcha cat in front of him, and said tentatively: "Can you still talk?" ”
Saying that, he stood up and said with a look of eagerness: "Does the master want to play a game?" ”
"Eh, this... Wait and play again. Zhao Yao scratched the back of his head and said a little at a loss: "When did you learn to speak?" ”
Looking at the innocent matcha cat, Zhao Yao looked strange.
The matcha cat did not feel strange about the situation in front of him, suddenly jumped into Zhao Yao's arms, squinted and rubbed Zhao Yao's body, and said in a milky voice: "Play games with me." ”
Looking at the matcha cat in front of him who spoke like a five-year-old child, Zhao Yao touched the other party's head, and the latter showed a snoring sound of enjoyment.
"You are only one year old, and now you are only five years old as a human being." A smile appeared at the corner of Zhao Yao's mouth: "It's still a child, this seems to be good." ”
A month later, at nine o'clock in the evening.
Zhao Yao opened the door of the rental house with a tired face, took off his clothes casually, and sat down on the sofa.
Although the rental house he lives in is only thirty square meters, it is fully decorated and furnished, it is a newlywed's house in the past, and it is very close to the company, so he does not have to worry about traffic problems every day overtime, so although the rent is not cheap, it still makes Zhao Yao's willingness.
After Zhao Yao lay down, the matcha cat unconsciously crawled to his side and rubbed his arm with his head, looking affectionate and flattering.
Zhao Yao smiled and rubbed matcha's head, who showed an expression of enjoyment.
But at this moment, the mobile phone on the sofa was also pushed by matcha.
Chapter 1
Tang Mo'er was lying on the table, her thin white slender arms were pillowing her little head, and her long black hair flowed in the air, revealing her half girlish bright little face, well, hot, so hot.
What's going on?
There was a steady stream of heat in her body that burned her little face, making her feel uncomfortable, today she came to the imperial capital from Yecheng, and just drank a cup of boiled water handed by Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, her half-sister.
"It's not good, Tang Mo'er jumped down, hurry up and chase, can't let her run!"
Tang Mo'er was a stirring spirit, sobered up for a long time, Han Xiaowan actually designed her!
What to do?
Tang Mo'er looked at the man, as if he had caught a life-saving straw, "Sir, save me, I was drugged, and there were several men behind who wanted to blast me." ”
The man's deep and cold narrow eyes glanced over the girl at the men behind him, although his gaze was light, but it was chilling.
Those men are punks, and they have also seen some of the world, this man who covers the headlines of the entire financial magazine and controls the economic lifeline of the entire imperial capital, they have seen on TV.
Gu Mohan.
This man they absolutely couldn't afford to mess with, so they turned around and ran. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, an earth-shattering battle is being staged, angels with flaming wings, knights covered in heavy armor, crusader warriors holding golden swords, and a group of evil armies composed of bone dragons covered in black smoke, hideous and terrifying death knights, and countless skeleton soldiers.
The battlefield of the battle between the two sides is not a plain full of war and gunsmoke or a buried ground full of bones, but a dark darkness that cannot see the edge, which is undoubtedly a very strange imagination.
But what is even more strange is that outside this battlefield, in the void shrouded in endless darkness, you can hear a few faint voices whispering?
"Operate, hurry up! Oh, my God! ”
"When talking about others, let's control your death knight first! The Death Knight and the Mobile Bunker are fighting! ! ”
"Where are my troops? Who is attacking my troops? Where is the enemy? ”
After the battle, the angels, knights, and skeletons that had scattered on the battlefield disappeared into the darkness of the background, and the absolute silence shrouded in endless darkness was once again restored, as if nothing had happened.
But several voices continued to exchange something, and even more voices joined in.
"My teammates are a bunch of pigs! Tied dogs are better than them! Not only will it not help the battle situation in the slightest, but it will also seize the command of the core troops..." the voice that failed before said with some reluctance.
"Bah! It is clear that the undead creatures are too weak, if it were replaced by my demon army, it would definitely be different..." Another voice also countered without showing weakness, and forcibly justified his wrong command: "I originally thought that the death knight could easily solve those bunkers. ”
After hearing this voice, there were a few chuckles in the darkness, and the two sides of the argument suddenly lost their temper, and said helplessly to the victorious side: "The skill is not as good as the people, and you are willing to bow down." ”
And the winner actually made a round of ungraceful mockery at this time?
"Haha! Good will triumph over evil! ”
"In the face of our strength, whether it is the undead or the devil, even the gods will kill you!"
This is undoubtedly more infuriating, and the two sides that have calmed down suddenly launched a new round of scolding, and the third person of the victorious side who wandered outside this new battlefield asked a little helplessly: "Shouldn't I organize this round of games?" ”
It turns out that the previous tragic and magnificent battle was just a game?
A voice that was not involved in the game responded: "It's amazing to be able to simulate a realistic war with consciousness and make us onlookers feel like we're there, and you're really good at surprising us, I hope Your Excellency." ”
And this guy, called hope, faced the other party's sudden thanks, and replied low-key: "You have passed the prize, this is just a pastime." ”
Yes, the great battle that was like a life-and-death duel between the righteous and evil camps was just a pastime, which could only add a little fun to this endless prison.
This is the void realm outside the plane of reality, which should be a Jedi that is forever dark, cold, and silent, and no living beings will survive, which is a realm more terrifying than death.
However, in such a place, this place of death that is difficult to accommodate any living beings, but tenaciously lives a group of indecipherable creatures, who have lost their physical bodies, and only the last consciousness remains in this void.
They call themselves Voidwalkers and are imprisoned forever in this prison called the Void.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were all extremely strong people in all races and fields, mages who reached the apex of the demonic path, warriors who touched the limits of martial arts, alchemists who created all things, missionaries who were firm and noble, demons who ruled hell, witches who controlled souls, and so on, and so on, they have left their names in the history of all planes.
Many people think that they have long since died, only those historical records prove that they once existed, but they do not know that this group of old monsters who are strong enough to be described as perverted are actually imprisoned in the endless void outside the plane, have spent incalculable years there, and seem to be imprisoned here forever, the seemingly thin barrier between the reality plane and the void is a wall of sighs that they can never break through, Rao is that the power they once had is so powerful, but there is nothing they can do about it.
But they never gave up hope of getting out of trouble, because among these 33 Void Walkers, there was an extremely special existence, that is, the fifth walker codenamed Hope.
Hope's original name Bai Yi did not come from the big and small planes of human existence outside the void, but from a strange place called Earth, he used to be the editor of a small news website, and his daily job was to extract news from other websites at home and abroad, and then replace it with a such thing as shock!
Men will cry, women will be silent, and other headlines are published on their own website, a noisy and tedious job.
Later, Bai Yi, who died due to an accident, did not immediately disappear his consciousness, but entered this mysterious void by mistake, met several other void walkers, and finally survived so strongly, until this moment.
The Voidwalker insisted that he from a different world would be the key to getting out of this endless prison, "Only you are different, want to get out of here, you are our only chance, I firmly believe this, that's why I call you by the code name hope." The First Walker of the Void, the one codenamed Sorcerer, had said to him.
They have always believed in this, that they will one day be able to see the light of day, even if they have been imprisoned for countless years, hundreds of years? Thousands of years?
To last thousands of years in this eternal prison without going crazy, it is obviously not enough to chat or discuss, in fact, the main means for Voidwalkers to spend time is an activity called memory sharing.
This activity is based on a conscious technique called memory recall, which allows people to recall every detail of their experience, even every punctuation in the newspaper.
Then through a certain degree of editing, remove some memories that you don't want others to see, such as sleeping with a woman or sleeping with your left and right hands, and then exchange memories with each other, which is equivalent to enjoying a super long movie about someone else's life, which is a great way to kill time.
The memories of the thirty-three Void Walkers are equivalent to allowing him to experience thirty-three lives, even if he later forgot most of his memories in order to avoid memory confusion, and only retained their knowledge and experience, but his state of mind was also in these thirty-three life experiences, sifting out all kinds of weaknesses such as childishness and impetuosity, becoming mature and calm, no longer the ordinary person on earth.
That's why he was pinned on high hopes by other Void Walkers, but after these countless years, even he couldn't find any opportunity to get out, and the only thing he did was to make this boring time a little less boring.
At the same time, the reality plane East is about to usher in nightfall, and when the afterglow of the setting sun fills the entire Xiansai College, the students finally end the heavy schoolwork of the day, accompanied by young and energetic laughter, strolling along the tree-lined paths in the college.
Miya, a second-year student of the soul armor department, is also one of them, she has a cute and delicate face, long black hair combed into two equally cute double ponytails, wearing the standard uniform of Xiansai Academy, after a simple farewell to her classmates, she came to the square of the academy alone, randomly found a bench to sit down, and then took out some of the remaining half of the bread from the jacket pocket, carefully tore the bread into a little crumb, and then sprinkled it on the bluestone floor of the square.
A moment later, there was a sound of wings flapping in mid-air, several white pigeons quickly fell to Miya's feet, while looking down and pecking at the crumbs she spilled, while making a cooing sound, Miya carefully squatted, the long double ponytail also gently swept to the ground with her movements, she quietly looked at the group of pigeons she had long been familiar with, and a gratifying smile appeared on her face.
Beautiful maidens, docile white doves, squares with several statues standing quietly, and various lush vegetation around them, under the last golden afterglow of the setting sun, they all converge into a beautiful picture.
This is what Mia does every day, and it is also the most relaxing time of her day, as a student with average qualifications, life in the institution of higher learning of Sensai Academy will always be extremely hard.
"It's getting dark, let's get here today, I have to go back to practice, goodbye, gentlemen pigeons." With a relaxed smile on her face, Miya said goodbye to the pigeons and hurried back to her dormitory with slender legs wrapped in white stockings under the hem of her short uniform skirt.
Evenings are also important study time, especially for a gifted student like Mia, who does not require as much effort as the smile she always has on her face.
1. Chapter 1
In the Su Family Mansion, in the huge martial arts arena, a martial soul awakening ceremony is being held.
The young man on the altar, named Su Yu, was the son of the Great Elder of the Su Family and had outstanding talent.
Su Mo, the son of Su Hong, the head of the Su family, completed the nine-fold quenching body at the age of only fourteen, and was known as the first genius of the Su family.
Now that a genius like Su Yu has appeared, then with Su Mo's talent, the awakened martial soul will definitely not be worse than Su Yu.
If Su Mo can also awaken a martial soul above the fifth order of the human level, then the Su family can appear two top geniuses this time, and the future development of their Su family is not small.
When the presiding elder shouted this name, the shocked disciples, elders and others in the audience all looked at the beautiful young man next to them, and the anticipation in their eyes was extremely strong, even surpassing Su Yu before.
Su Mo's face was calm, and he walked to the altar with his feet up.
Su Yu, who walked down from the altar, was full of pride and smiled coldly at Su Mo, his eyes full of defiance.
Su Mo ignored the other party, took a deep breath, sat cross-kneeled, and closed his eyes.
From below that altar, runes of light immediately floated out, continuously burrowing into Su Mo's body.
His talent is a top-notch existence in the Su family, and he completed the quenching body at the age of only fifteen, and his talent is not bad. However, he was always crushed by Su Mo.
At this time, more and more runes flashed on the altar, enveloping Su Mo's body.
Su Mo, who was sitting with his eyes closed, breathed slightly, and from his body, a roar gradually sounded.
Everyone stopped breathing and stared at the altar!
Rumble!
Finally, with a bang, a pitch-black phantom suddenly rose, the pitch-black phantom was like a black hole, slowly rotating inside, deep and bottomless, giving people a sense of coldness.
At the same time, above the shadow, a yellow aura flashed.
Yes!
In an instant, everyone in the audience immediately froze.
A halo?
The lowest-level martial soul?
How is this possible?
Even Su Yu's face was stunned.
Because, he never imagined that on the first day of the Su family, he only awakened a human-level first-order martial soul, the lowest level martial soul!
Su Mopan sat on the altar, his eyes slowly opened, and when he saw his martial soul, he was also stunned.
"A human-level first-order martial soul...!" Su Mo muttered, a wry smile curled at the corner of his mouth, he never expected that he actually awakened a lowest-level martial soul!
The most garbage martial soul? "I actually awakened a waste martial soul!
"What the first day is simply the first waste of my Su family."
For a while, including Patriarch Su, Deacon and others, everyone's eyes looking at Su Mo changed, some disappointed, disdainful, and contemptuous.
On the altar, Su Mo slowly got up and clenched his fists unconsciously.
Scanning the circle with cold eyes, Su Mo sneered in his heart: "These people are really snobbish enough!" ”
In the past, Su Mo was extremely talented, and everyone was polite to him, and everywhere he went, he hugged him and the horse's butt snapped.
Now, he awakened the garbage martial soul, and these people immediately changed their faces.
Su Mo shook his head, did not think about them, walked off the altar and strode away.
The face is a little itchy, and the surrounding area seems to be a bush.
"Didn't I die in a car accident? How did it come back to life again? ”
He was a little surprised, but before he could figure out how he survived, the sight in front of him made his eyes widen with excitement. Immediately I was confused!
No, you can't! How can a girl who looks so beautiful be convenient anywhere?
Xu Que's eyes widened. Just like that, I watched the beautiful girl completely remove the hem of her skirt in front of her eyes, and the profane pants inside were also taken off little by little, and it was a tender white and tender white in her eyes, and it also carried a unique body fragrance of a woman.
"Girl, what are you doing, you can't defecate anywhere!"
The scene suddenly froze. She let out a scream, lowered the hem of her skirt in panic, and the whole person bounced up from the spot, and actually stepped on a sharp sword and flew away.
I lean, what is this? Royal Sword Flying into the Sky?
It turns out that it's really a fairy?
Xu Que was suddenly startled, and at the same time, a large strange but familiar memory suddenly welled up in his head, as if he had experienced it innately.
I crossed!
Immediately reading the memories in his mind that did not belong to him, Xu Que sorted out everything.
This is actually a world of immortal cultivation, just like this little fairy in front of her who is so angry that the sword flies into the sky, people can cultivate various exercises to become immortals.
And the owner of his body is the current horse master, but this horse master is completely unlucky.
He himself is just a poor orphan, but he has a unique spiritual root that is rare in a thousand years.
When he was young, he was favored by the emperor by chance and recruited as a horse, providing him with countless heavenly materials and earth treasures for him to cultivate, and in just six years, he condensed the belly pill and entered the golden pill period.
When he stepped into the golden pill period, he really entered the cave room with the princess, so he spent seven days and seven nights in a row on the marriage bed, and as a result, the beautiful princess was like a fox, and he was completely cultivated, and even the talent of the spiritual root was taken away.
The genius horse master had just been newly married and became a wasted man, and he was sent out of the palace overnight in a low-key manner, and was slapped to death by the people arranged by the emperor on the way to the frontier, died of anger, and finally abandoned his body here.
"Alas, it's a pity!"
After sorting out these memories, Xu Que's face was full of regret, shook his head and sighed, and said with chagrin: "Damn it!" Why didn't you take a step forward and travel to the happy time of crazy exercise in bed with the beautiful princess? ”
Remembering the charm, proud figure, and amorous breath of that beautiful princess on the marriage bed, Xu Que felt more and more pity, he was one step late!
"Bold and obscene, dare to peep at this girl's toilet and give me my life!"
At this time, a coquettish voice suddenly came, and it was the fairy who went and returned.
Her face was red with shame, but there was endless killing intent in her eyes, and she stepped on the cold sword under her feet, and killed Xu Que.
"I lean, fairy, this is definitely a misunderstanding! It is clear that you squatted where I lay with your ass, and... Even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, please put your pants up first, okay? The way you look makes me have no motivation to escape! Xu Que shouted, pulled out his legs and ran.
The woman's face suddenly changed, and she lifted the profane pants under the hem of her skirt with a red face, snorted, and angrily reprimanded: "Obscene thieves are looking for death." The speed of the sword flying under his feet suddenly increased, and he swooped towards Xu Que.
While running wildly, Xu Que frantically thought of a way to escape.
Suddenly, a flash of light flashed in my head.
Immediately, he stopped his footsteps, reached out and felt a familiar token from his arms, turned around and shouted at the woman: "Bold demon girl, I am the horse of the Fire Yuan Nation today, you dare to be disrespectful to me?" Be careful that I accuse you of the Nine Tribes! ”
At this moment, a series of system prompts suddenly sounded in Xu Que's head.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for activating the pretend face punching system, this system will escort you and help you pretend to help you fly!"
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully pretending, the reward pretending is worth 1 point, do you want to enter the mall to redeem?"
"The system has detected that the host's 'Xu Que' ability is weak and it is difficult to survive in the difficulty of this world, so a newbie gift package is rewarded, do you want to check the gift package?"
At the same time as the prompt sounds, a light curtain window pops up in front of you, displaying several pieces of information data.
Xu Que first gasped, followed by an uncontrollable laugh. What kind of pretend to punch the face system, as soon as I hear it, it is tailor-made for me and helps me break through the sky! Now it's time to play.
"Adulterer, death is imminent, what are you so funny about?"
Suddenly, a reprimand pulled Xu Que back from his ecstasy.
The woman didn't know when she was already standing more than ten meters in front of him, holding a flying sword in her hand and pointing at him, but Shui Lingling's big eyes were staring at him suspiciously.
"Come on, come on... Want to do it with me, don't you? Do you want to take a step closer to me and try it? ”
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for the success of pretending, and the reward pretending is worth 1 point."
Sure enough, the system prompt sound in Xu Que's ear that only he could hear sounded again, and he couldn't help but laugh again. "By the way, there seems to be a gift bag."
Suddenly, the picture of the light curtain window in front of him changed, a square gift box appeared, the gift box was opened, and several streamers jumped out and flashed away.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining the Beginner Experience Pill, taking it can get 10,000 experience points."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining two Beginner Divine Walking Talismans, which can be instantly moved anywhere within a radius of five kilometers after use."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining the Primary-level "Taikoo Five Elements Recipe" (Note: The Beginner Chapter can only be cultivated to the foundation building period, and can be exchanged in the mall later)."
"Ding, it has detected that the host 'Xu Que' Spirit Root is incomplete and does not meet the cultivation conditions, and the system will complete all the Spirit Roots for you."
Immediately, Xu Que felt as if an electric current was penetrating his body, and his scalp instantly became numb.
But what followed was a sense of comfort, and the pores of the body seemed to be completely opened, greedily absorbing the spiritual energy of the four directions.
Rumble!
Soon, he felt that his body had undergone earth-shaking changes, becoming closer to nature, as if he could integrate into and control everything.
But he knew very well how familiar this feeling was, when the Heavenly Fire Spirit Root had not been taken away by the princess, he had such a cordial feeling for the flame, and now the system not only repaired his Heavenly Fire Spirit Root, but also completed the Spirit Root of other attributes.
Gold, wood, water, fire and earth, all five kinds of spiritual roots were all at once, and each of them was the best "heaven" level.
I'm going, this is going against the sky!
Thinking of this, Xu Que finally couldn't help but raise his arms and shout: "The system is in hand, I have it in the world, what shit Princess Emperor of the Fire Yuan Kingdom, when I Xu Que upgrades and returns, I will trample you all under my feet and step on it to smash." ”
"A bold thief, since he claims to be a colt of the Fire Yuan Nation, he dares to speak wildly in a vain attempt to kill the king?" The woman next to her was a little silly, is this horse crazy?
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully pretending and getting 1 point for pretending."
Xu Que only then slowed down, the corners of his mouth twitched slightly, damn it, Gu pretended to look forward to the future, almost forgot about this trouble at hand, and had to quickly find a way to run.
"That's right, Experience Dan!"
He suddenly remembered that there was also a beginner experience pill in the newbie package.
Without the slightest hesitation, he hurriedly used the operating system interface of his mind to open a package, and three items appeared in it.
"Use, use." Xu Que stared at two of the items and shouted in his heart.
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully cultivating the Ancient Five Elements Technique."
"Ding, the host 'Xu Que' took the Beginner Experience Pill and gained 10,000 experience points."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for upgrading, the current realm refining period is one layer."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for upgrading, the third layer of the current realm refining period."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for upgrading, the current realm refining period ten layers."
In just a few breaths, Xu Que changed from a mortal without the power of a chicken to an immortal cultivator, directly sprinting to the tenth layer of the refining period, only one step away from the foundation building period.
Moreover, his current strength was actually countless stronger than the normal ten layers of the refining period.
The reason was that he possessed five Heavenly Spirit Roots, which was equivalent to a person possessing five times the strength of an ordinary person.
Even under the interdependent nature of these five different auras, the power that bursts out is far more than five times simple.
"This time there is really no words, who is invincible if I am not invincible?"
Xu Que couldn't stop getting excited in his heart. But at this time, the woman on the opposite side swung a stream of light, streaked through the sky, and the sharp blade rushed over like a poisonous snake in the blink of an eye.
"I lean on, fairy, I just told you little beauty to come forward and give Ben Horse Master a good look, who let you out the sword?" You are sneak attack! ”
When Xu Que saw the flying sword attacking, he was immediately startled, and immediately opened his mouth to curse.
But scolding and scolding, the movement under his feet was not vague at all, and he slipped back, and a wisp of water yuan aura condensed from the tip of his finger, lightly flicking on the oncoming blade.
"Dang!"
With a brittle trill, the sword was ejected by him.
"This... How can it be? ”
The woman froze suddenly, the sect can crack this sword so easily, except for those unfathomable senior uncles, at least those senior brothers and sisters in the sixth layer of the foundation building period can do it!
"I wondered, they all said that what happened just now was a misunderstanding, you are still entangled, and you actually want to kill me? Don't think that I won't hit you if you look like a fairy, anyway, I didn't see it clearly just now, this time I'll take a look at it in the open. ”
Xu Que cursed in annoyance, stepping out under his feet, Tuyuan Spiritual Qi suddenly merged into the earth, his speed suddenly doubled, and he appeared in front of the woman in the blink of an eye.
Immediately after, a wisp of water yuan spiritual energy gushed out of her palm, surrounding all directions, and before the woman could react, she was imprisoned on the spot.
"Kinky... Adulterer, what do you want to do? The woman was shocked, feeling that the Fire Yuan Spiritual Qi in her body was completely suppressed.
"Hey, hey! Since you call me an adulterer? Then I can't carry this pot for nothing. ”
Xu Que smiled cheaply, raised his eyebrows, and reached out to directly pick at the hem of the woman's skirt.
Chapter 1 If there is an afterlife, dance with the world!
Nine heavens, sea of clouds, wind and thunder platform, a line of heaven!
Here, it is the Nine Heavens Continent, three days ago, a Jedi, Wind Thunder Platform! On the wind and thunder, in and out of the line of the sky!
But at this moment, on the wind and thunder platform, there is a bloody fog!
"Chu Yang, hand over the Nine Tribulations Sword! Spare you not to die! ”
"Chu Yang, the Nine Tribulations Sword, the number one divine object in the world, is in your hands, it is a waste, how many years, you have made no progress, it is simply a violent heavenly object! It's better to hand it over.
A loud shout came from all directions.
The look in his eyes is still as calm and frozen as a rock! -The body is still as straight as a javelin!
Just like the sword in his hand, it is full of the meaning of rather bending than bending! Even though he has been mortally wounded!
At his feet, within a radius of hundreds of kilometers, countless stump limbs were broken, and blood was dripping.
Looking at the group of masters around who just shouted, but did not rush over, Chu Yang showed a mocking smile on his face, arrogant and disdainful!
Such people, such a mind, no matter how high the cultivation is, no matter how many there are; Even if you can kill me ten thousand times, you are not worthy of being my enemy!
How could the matter of the Nine Tribulations Sword in his hands leak out? He obviously investigated for three years before he determined that there was a sword body of the Ninth Tribulation Sword in the Wind Thunder Platform in the last three days, and after a lot of hard work, he finally found an opportunity to risk nine deaths to come to the last three days, but why did he encounter such a huge ambush after coming here?
Today, I have entered the first three days, and it is only the fifth day! Today's game, pure death! He has always been known for his secretive whereabouts, but who knows his plans?
I rushed more than a dozen times in a row, and each time, I was blocked back! And these places you choose belong to dead ends!
Extreme affection, extreme sword! Kill your feelings into the sword, enter the martial path with the sword path, seek the heavenly way with the martial way, at the cost of lifelong loneliness, and kill everywhere as a treasure raft, but unfortunately, after all, you still can't practice the Nine Tribulations Sword and practice the Nine Heavenly Divine Skill!
Is it a mistake to choose yourself? Or is this path simply wrong?
Heartless swordsman Heartless swordsman, if a swordsman is affectionate, what kind of swordsman is it? Kendo Martial Dao Heavenly Dao, after all, is ruthless... But now at the time of life and death, why is it so shaken?
Nine Tribulations Sword, Nine Tribulations Sword, what is your secret?
Looking at the gazes around him who were greedily staring at the Nine Tribulations Sword, Chu Yang smiled bitterly in his heart. You only know that if you get this Nine Tribulations Sword, you will be invincible in the world, but do you know how much I have paid for this Nine Tribulations Sword?
There is nothing left.
Blood is flowing, Chu Yang clearly senses that his life is passing quickly, he pursues martial arts all his life, falling in love, breaking love, and leaving love to ruthlessness and then extinguishing love, at the moment of dying, he thought that the only regret should be that he did not reach the supreme realm of his pursuit of life in his lifetime, but what he didn't expect was that at this moment, a figure appeared in his mind, which he thought had long forgotten.
Mo Qianwu, Chu Yang's woman who fell in love!
"It turns out that I don't really break my feelings..." a self-deprecating smile appeared at the corner of Chu Yang's mouth, and he muttered to himself.
A trace of remorse quietly spread in his heart, like smoke, and swept his entire heart in an instant.
Light dance! I don't know if I may meet you when I go to Huangquan this time?
"Let's go together! Simply chop him! As for the Nine Tribulations Sword, let's discuss it slowly! One shouted, "If not, when he replies, it'll be our turn!" Everyone around them roared, and suddenly their swords were raised in unison, and they surrounded Chu Yang.
"A life is not a light dance, a dance is a lifetime of bitterness; In this life, it is a gentle dance, and a life of bitter dance! ”
This is the night of love, a little poem written by Mo Qianwu. I still remember that at that time, Mo Qianwu's eyes were tearful, her eyes were miserable and resentful, she... I knew that I was using her love to practice, but she still threw herself into her arms like a moth to a fire, letting herself burn to her heart's content!
After hearing the news, he immediately rushed to go, but he was one step late after all. Although he later killed all the people in the family that hurt Mo Qianwu, even the chicken dogs of the Nine Tribes, the beauty could not be resurrected after all!
That peerless red face, when he was dying, lay softly in his arms and said to himself: "Chu Yang, if there is an afterlife... If I can still meet you, I hope you can do well... Take a look at me. I'm better looking than a sword! ”
Light dance, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, how can there be tears in the corners of your eyes?
Two tears, but smashed their hearts at that moment! Since then, this heart has been in the dust!
Life and death follow each other to Jiuxiao!
This is a poem specially made by Xue Tear Han, the first genius in the world, who felt Mo Qianwu's deep affection for Chu Yang.
And now, light dance, you have reached Jiuxiao, but I am still alive... However, I will be able to live and die with you immediately... Live!
Chu Yang thought out of his mind, and the corners of his always cold and hard mouth hung a gentle and sad smile.
Light dance, wait for me!
Light dance, you know, if there is an afterlife, I would rather not practice any kendo, would rather not have any peak, would rather not take revenge, but also be with you!" In this world, what can be worth the smile of your satisfaction?
No! Not bitter... Light dance, you are bitter, but you do not feel bitter, and now... I'm bitter!
The sword added more and more, blood flew out little by little, and pain focused from all over the body little by little, finally interrupting the song and dance in his mind!
Chu Yang's furious roar! Standing up suddenly, his long black hair flew up fiercely!
Chu Yang's heart hurt, and when he looked down, the piece of jade hanging on his neck was shattered in front of his eyes. Time is splitting in an instant!
This is the only memorial left for yourself by the light dance!
"Kill!" Chu Yang raised his head, the murderous intent in his eyes rushed wildly, and with a wild drink, the Nine Tribulations Sword in his hand suddenly swung out ten thousand sword lights, just like the Nine Heavens Lightning suddenly connected into a belt of lightning!
There was a bang, and all the weapons around him were neatly cut off!
Everyone hurriedly retreated, looking at the neat circle of half-cut weapons under Chu Yang's feet in horror, and cold sweat flowed down their vests. Unexpectedly, the power of the Nine Tribulations Sword was terrifying!
Chu Yang looked around and suddenly asked softly, "You guys want the Nine Tribulations Sword?" ”
Without waiting for anyone to answer, he laughed coldly and said slowly: "Good! I'll show you the Nine Tribulations Sword!" ”
He suddenly jumped up! He had already suffered countless fatal injuries, and he actually jumped up!
"Nine Tribulations Sword, a little cold light!"
As the arc shoots out, thousands of cold rays rush out!
Nine Heavens Sword Technique! One sword!
Nine Heavens is the name of this continent. All the sword techniques in the past have never dared to use these three words to name them, but this Nine Tribulations Sword Method is directly the name "Nine Heavens" used!
Throughout the ages, this is the only one!
Although Chu Yang could not exert the true power of the Nine Tribulations Sword Technique, he had comprehended these swords for a long time. Although the power of these swords is not as great as imagined, it is far beyond the worldly sword technique.
Dozens of masters around them, knowing that this sword is extraordinary, all of them showed the ability to press the bottom of the box, and tried their best to resist this attack! Everyone's bodies shook, feeling the weapons in their hands, and they were almost unstable.
"Nine Tribulations Sword, why not slaughter the world!"
The first move is not finished, and the second move has already arrived murderously! The rushing light is like the rising tide of the sea, and the boundless killing machine bursts out overwhelmingly!
The screams sounded, and more than a dozen masters who were enough to dominate one side tried their best to resist at the same time, but they were still splashed with blood and retreated in embarrassment!
At this moment, everyone had an illusion: Chu Yang now was definitely not injured! Absolutely complete state!
They didn't know that they interrupted Chu Yang's memories, interrupted Mo Qianwu's song and dance, and made Chu Yang completely furious, completely exerting all the potential of his body! This is the force of life, the fury of the soul!
"Nine Tribulations Sword, a gathering of wind and clouds is the emperor!"
Chu Yang Huoran opened his eyes and roared lowly, "Why?" Why not? ”
In the distance, in three directions, three rays of light rose at the same time, transforming into three golden shadows in the air! Trembling and dazzling, with unspeakable rampantness.
He is only a Martial Venerable, although he is only one level away from the king level, but this level is tantamount to the difference between heaven and earth!
Three kings! What a big hand!
"But these past three days, it's not a place where you can spread wilderness with a poisonous sword martial Venerable!" One person said slowly: "It's a pity that I can't fight you fairly, it's a pity!" ”
As he spoke, the other two appeared together. The three people, all in wide robes and large sleeves, with fluttering clothes, came from the wind. The posture is dashing, and the face is calm.
Chu Yang's eyes were already a little blurry: "You three kings... Want the Nine Tribulations Sword too? ”
"I want you to die!" The three of them smiled at the same time, with a demeanor: "But taking over the Nine Tribulations Sword by the way is also an unexpected gain." Big bonus! ”
Chu Yang smiled coldly, straightened his back, and said proudly: "It's a pity that you don't know about the Nine Tribulations Sword!" You'll never get it! His eyes became decisive and absolute!
He is now powerless to fight again!
This was the only sword that he could exert his full power, and when he first saw the sword technique, he knew that this sword could be cast by himself. But such a sword needs to be urged with your own life!
It was the Nine Tribulations Sword Soul who killed people on its own and destroyed everything!
The three kings were almost too late to parry, and even the screams were too late to scream, and they were wiped out! Even, the golden shadows transformed by their king-level power were still flashing in the air, but their lives had already been reduced to nothingness!
Chu Yang sighed, he was in mid-air, his eyes skimmed casually, but he found a figure that he thought should never appear here. In the distance, a man in white looked at this side dumbfounded, his face full of disbelief.
"Tianji?" Chu Yang's eyes have always been and finally understood. Why was his such a secret operation ambushed, and why all his attacks were accurately blocked!
It turned out to be him, and the god pan ghost counted Mo Tianji. No wonder you have failed so badly!
Chu Yang's body slowly fell from the air and slowly fell, like dead leaves floating in late autumn, falling into the dust, with a faint but warm smile on his face, muttering: "Light dance, if there is an afterlife, accompany the world dance!" ”
Since death is inevitable, embrace death with the greatest enthusiasm and the strongest longing! Because there, have your own lover!
Chapter II
Meng Qi's secret joy was interrupted, and pride turned into shame, and Zhende and other Xiao Shami's gazes were surprised and disdainful, quite like elementary school students want to draw a line with bad classmates, only Zhenhui "Fang Ah Qi" looked at the golden Buddha statue in front of him blankly, looking like he was wandering the world.
Subconsciously, Meng Qi half-turned his head and looked at Xuanzang next to him, would he see any clues?
For him, shame and frustration are trivial things, and exposing the fact that he borrowed his corpse to return his soul is a big problem!
Xuan Zang was still full of bitterness, his eyes were sad, and after feeling Meng Qi's gaze, he shook his head slightly: "Nan Wu Amitabha Buddha, everything is subject to the decision of Senior Brother Xuan Ku." He didn't hint and said it directly.
Well, he thought I saw him pleading with him... Meng Qi quietly breathed a sigh of relief in his heart, knowing that he had passed this level, unless the parents who abandoned this body, the horse-faced uncle, etc. came to find it, it should not be seen through, if it was another ten years and eight years, then no one doubted it, and the memories of childhood were easy to forget.
Compared to this, breaking into the miscellaneous house is just a trifle!
Meng Qi, who was crooked, tried to make his expression as dull as Zhenhui, lest Xuan Zang see that he was actually not so depressed and sad.
After the broad-faced and big-eared Xuan Ku questioned the remaining children one by one, Jia Mengqi and Zhenhui together had a total of six people enrolled in the Miscellaneous Hospital, and the rest belonged to the Martial Monk's Monastery.
The ruler in his right hand gently tapped his left palm: "Follow me to the miscellaneous courtyard to shave, receive monk's robes and Buddhist scriptures and other things, and work hard in the future, and I will not have the opportunity to enter the Bodhi and Dharma Institutes to practice advanced Buddhist scriptures and martial arts." ”
Dharma here too?
Meng Qi was stunned for a moment, but Xuan Ku didn't give him time to think, and walked straight through the children and towards the outside of the hall.
There were strangers around, Meng Qi did not dare to ask more, followed the two yellow-clothed monks Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang, and turned into a nearby courtyard.
"You are not a formal beginner, you just worship the Buddha and leave your name." Xuan Ku pointed to the futon road in the small Buddha hall.
"Yes, Senior Uncle Xuanku." The children all responded with Zhende, and then one by one knelt on the futon and kowtowed to the golden Buddha statue above.
When all the children had worshiped the Buddha, Xuanku clasped his hands together, solemnly saluted the Buddha statue, and chanted "Nan no Amitabha Buddha", then he walked up to a child and caressed his right hand over his head.
The child's long black hair changed immediately, turning its roots to yellow at a speed visible to Meng Qi's naked eye, floating on the ground like fallen leaves, and in less than two breaths, this child became a real little Shami.
"Troubles are gone, red dust is far away." Xuan Ku said solemnly, his mellow voice echoing in the pure Buddhist hall.
"What kind of martial arts is this? It's amazing! ”
Meng Qi was stunned and excited, would he have the opportunity to learn such martial arts in the future?
One by one, Xuan Ku walked up to the children, removed their hair, and kept the same words in his mouth.
When it was Meng Qi's turn, he lowered his head, silently recited the name of Buddha Daozu, and mourned the hair that was about to say goodbye to him.
The thick and wide palm caressed the top of Meng Qi's head, and dry hair fell in front of his eyes, which made him sad and almost uncontrollable, but he loved the red dust to death, and he never wanted to become a monk.
"Troubles are gone, red dust is far away."
Xuanku's voice was like a bell that suddenly rang, which made Meng Qi tremble and his heart was clear.
But after Xuanku left and the clarity disappeared, Meng Qi's belief was still firm, and he must return the customs in the future!
After worshipping the Buddha, shaving, and leaving a name for the monk's plate, Xuan Ku asked a few gray-clothed monks to take the children to the backyard to receive their own things - two sets of gray monk robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, "Shaolin Precepts", "Twelve Mantras in the Morning Class" and so on.
"Before that, I will first talk about the main precepts of this monastery, first, you must not deceive the teacher and destroy the ancestors, second, you must not allow, you must not steal martial arts, third, you must not kill, fourth, you must not drink alcohol, fifth, you must not break the color vows..." Xuan Ku repeated the main precepts that need to be observed several times, and finally said solemnly: "Those who violate it will be scolded at best, and abolished their martial arts and expelled from this monastery at worst." ”
He mentioned only two of the punishments, the lightest and the heaviest, and the others for coolies, copying scriptures, rods, and walls.
After explaining these things, he and Xuanzo left the "Utility Courtyard" with the gang of Xiao Shami.
"In this monastery, those in gray robes are ordinary monks, those in yellow robes are deacons and monks of various houses, and those in yellow monk's robes and red robes are abbots, heads of each monastery, and elders..." Along the way, Xuan Ku did not relax to instill "common sense in the temple" in Xiaoshami, until Zhende and the others entered the "martial monasteries", he became silent again.
The group walked further and further, inside and outside the yellow wall, all covered by green trees, rarely saw the Buddha hall, and after a while, Meng Qi saw a mottled and old courtyard.
"Oh, Junior Brother Xuanku, Senior Brother Xuanzang, you came so early?" A fat monk at the door greeted him with a smile, also dressed in yellow, but with a slanted collar and a shy stomach.
Xuan Ku frowned, and meticulously agreed: "Nan Wu Amitabha Buddha, Senior Brother Xuanxin, how can you be so lazy?" ”
The fat monk Xuan Xin had long been familiar with Xuan Ku's temper, and said without anger at all: "Oh, you are too obsessed with the foreign minister, this is for our disciples of the Miscellaneous Academy?" He was unwilling to entangle with Xuan Ku on this issue, and directly pointed at Meng Qi and the others.
"Also ask Senior Brother Xuanxin to arrange." Xuan Ku replied seriously.
At this time, Xuan Zang, who had been making a saw-mouthed gourd, suddenly spoke: "Zhenying, is Zhenguan still in the Miscellaneous Courtyard?" ”
"Still there, still there!" The fat monk Xuanxin said suspiciously: "Senior Brother Xuanzang, what do you ask them to do?" Is it intentional to take them as apprentices? ”
Xuanzang shook his head and sighed: "My martial arts have been destroyed, it is inconvenient to mislead people's children, how dare you accept disciples?" Junior Brother Xuanxin, I am tired of you letting them live in the same room with True Ying and True View. ”
He was referring to Meng Qi and Zhenhui.
Meng Qi's heart beat violently, Xuanzang this is the first time to arrange his own affairs, could it be that the two monks of Zhenying and Zhenguan have something special and can help themselves?
"Haha, Junior Brother Xuanzang, what you ordered, Junior Brother, how dare I bear a 'labor'? Why such a trifle? Xuan Xin agreed.
Xuan Ku glanced sideways at Xuan Zang, and did not say much, but said to Meng Qi, Zhenhui and other Xiao Shami: "I arranged you in the miscellaneous service courtyard because you all have problems, if you can understand yourself and polish your mind, you may not have the opportunity to enter the martial monastic monastery, the Dharma monastery, and even the Bodhi monastery in the future." ”
"But if you continue to be sneaky and slippery, lazy and playful, impetuous in heart, and unbearable to suffer, I will not hide it, and I will inform the precept house and punish you accordingly."
He unabashedly said his thoughts to show that he was frank and frank, without a bit of selfishness, and the old face of Xuanxin next to him was slightly red.
"Yes, Senior Uncle Xuanku." Meng Qi and Xiao Shami replied in unison.
After watching Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang leave, Xuan Xin twisted his body and made the fat flesh shake up and down: "Finally gone, I am most afraid of seeing this iron-masked ghost." ”
This monk... Meng Qi pretended not to squint, and followed Xuanxin, who was walking around, into the Zen room.
"Zhenying, Zhenguan, this is your junior brother Zhending, Zhenhui." After Xuan Xin pointed to Meng Qi and Zhenhui, he turned around and took the other little Shami to another Zen room.
Inside the Zen room, there is a bunk, enough for seven or eight people to sleep, and the rest has nothing else.
On the bunk, two gray-clothed monks lay down and sat down, both in their twenties, the lying people had dull expressions, dazed and speechless, and the sitting people had deep eyebrows locked, and their tone was cold: "Just put the wrapped luggage and so on at the bottom of the bunk, if you want to drink water, go to the water tank in the courtyard to get it." "I don't know what Senior Brother is called?"
Meng Qi glanced at Mu Mune's true wisdom and decided to establish a good "roommate relationship" by himself.
The sitting man said coldly, "True view." ”
After answering, he stopped speaking, and even turned his head not to look at Meng Qi and Zhenhui, making the topic of Meng Qi's stomach getting closer to each other impossible.
As for Zhenying, he closed his eyes and continued to sleep.
Who are these people?
Meng Qi secretly slandered in his stomach, but on the surface, he smiled and said to Zhenhui: "Junior Brother Zhenhui, I am Zhending, in the future, you can just call Senior Brother." ”
"Yes, Senior Brother." Zhenhui shouted without embarrassment at all.
It's still this dumb little guy!
Meng Qi secretly sighed, and decided to play the role of senior brother and help Zhenhui well: "Little junior brother, eh, I'll call you little junior brother, come, let's change the monk's clothes first." ”
Although there were people in the house, Meng Qi, who often went shirtless in the dormitory when he was in college, was not unwell, and quickly took off his clothes and changed into monk robes.
While quietly thanking the monk's simple dress, so that he would not show his ugliness, he checked the things on his body that he had not had time to examine before.
The robe of this body, the weaver is fine, the texture is light and soft, even if Meng Qi does not recognize the goods, he can see that it is worth a lot, at the same time, "he" has a transparent jade pendant hanging from his waist, and a small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red rope around his neck, close to his chest, cool and cool, so uncomfortable.
Meng Qi carefully played with this thumb-sized jade Buddha, and saw that "it" was full of compassion and lifelike, obviously carved extraordinary, and at the same time, "it" felt delicate, both warm and cool.
"According to Uncle Horse Face, what kind of nameless old monk sent this jade Buddha? But since what Hou Ye did not take away, it is estimated that it is not an extraordinary product, and it is better to wear it close to the body. ”
Meng Qi hung the jade Buddha pendant back on his chest, hid it closely, and then packed up the jade pendant, clothes, etc., and put it under the bunk he selected.
At this time, Zhenying, who had been sleeping sharply, turned over and sat up, put on his shoes and went out, and Meng Qi was stunned when he saw it, not understanding what happened.
"It's dinner time." Zhenguan said coldly, also got off the bunk, and walked out the door.
What kind of people are these two!
Meng Qi scolded secretly again, and then turned to Zhenhui and said, "Little junior brother, are you okay?" It's dinner time! ”
"Okay!" As soon as Zhenhui's words fell, the small figure rushed to the door like a rabbit, as if he was hungry.
Meng Qi was suddenly embarrassed, is he the only one who is more normal here?
Zhenhui suddenly stopped at the door, looked back at Meng Qi, and his face was full of doubts: "Senior brother, aren't you going?" ”
You have a little conscience and know how to wait for me!
Meng Qi thought secretly, and then replied half-jokingly: "I'm not as hungry as you guys. ”
Looking at you two is like a starving ghost reincarnated! \Q>
He turned around and ran.
Feed! After a few strokes, he shouted loudly: "Eh, little junior brother, wait for me!" ”
Suddenly, a sadness hit his heart, someone else's is a little junior sister, why do I only have a little junior brother, and there will be no junior sister in the foreseeable future.
Heavy rain poured down, and a beautiful looking woman, aged twenty-seven or eight, with a little boy aged five or six, knelt in front of the iron gate of a luxurious villa.
The woman's name is Zhao Meiling, from a remote mountain village, six years ago she was admitted to university with dreams and hopes, but she didn't expect to meet a man who changed everything for her, this man is the famous flower master in Beitang City... Li Zhe!
Then! Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe were in a school, and by an accident, she was favored by Li Zhe, and then Li Zhe launched a crazy pursuit of Zhao Meiling, almost full of tricks and unscrupulous.
And Zhao Meiling is just a simple and simple girl who has just come to the city, that will be the opponent of such a love field master, not only the body, but also the heart is completely handed over to him, but then after Li Zhe got tired of playing her, he abandoned her fiercely.
Later, Zhao Meiling learned that she was pregnant, and she wanted to give birth to the child, so she did not hesitate to fall out with the people in her family.
After the child was born, Zhao Meiling originally wanted to raise him alone, but after five years, because of the overwork of the body and the terminal illness, there was no longer a few years to live, and she finally decided to send the child to the Li family, wanting the child to feel the father's love and have a better life, then she could also rest assured after death.
But this was coldly rejected by the Li family, completely not recognizing that this child was their Li family, Zhao Meiling could only kneel in front of the iron gate with the child, begging bitterly.
At this time, the iron door slowly opened, and several people came out with umbrellas, and the man led by the boy was somewhat similar to the little boy, he was the boy's father Li Zhe.
"Give! Stinky woman, this amount of money is enough for you to live well," Li Zhe frowned, reached out and handed Zhao Meiling a check.
Zhao Meiling shook her head, looked up at Li Zhe, and said, "Zhe!" You must leave Fu'er, he is your son! ”
Li Zhe refused, and then said coldly, "Do you want this money?" ”
Hearing this, Zhao Meiling was already in tears and shook her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe snorted coldly, threw the check in his hand at Zhao Meiling, and then was about to turn around and leave.
Zhao Meiling, who was kneeling on the ground, hugged Li Zhe's thigh and begged bitterly, "Zhe! ”
"Snap!"
Before Zhao Meiling finished speaking, Li Zhe slapped her heavily in the face, "Let go!" You stinky woman".
When the little boy next to him saw his mother being beaten, he quickly ran over and hugged Li Zhe's thigh, shouting childishly, "Dad!" Don't hit mom".
In fact, since the little boy was born, he didn't know who his father was, and his mother never said it again, until this time Zhao Meiling took out Li Zhe's photo to show the little boy, and the little boy knew that he had a father, and he was so happy that he was about to jump.
But now, he didn't understand why his father didn't want his mother, but also beat his mother.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy holding his thigh, with a look of disgust, he kicked the little boy out, "Who is your father, dead ~ wild ~ species!" ”
The little boy was kicked out, fell to the ground, curled up, covered his stomach in pain, the pain was far beyond what a five-year-old boy could bear, and he couldn't help but shed tears from his eyes.
Zhao Meiling was also shocked, quickly let go of Li Zhe, ran over to pick up the little boy, and asked nervously and concernedly, "Fu'er, are you okay?" ”
The little boy looked at his mother's worried look, pursed his mouth, forced back tears, and shook his little head.
Li Zhe didn't even look at the mother and son, walked into the iron gate, and a man with gray hair next to him who looked like a housekeeper picked up the check, handed it to Zhao Meiling, and persuaded sympathetically, "You better accept this!" ”
Zhao Meiling shook her head, held the little boy, and slowly disappeared into the rain curtain.
The housekeeper looked at the back of the mother and son, sighed deeply, turned and walked into the house, and slowly closed the iron door.
Four years later! Before dying, Zhao Meiling called the little boy who was nine years old and had grown up a lot to the bed, gently rubbed his head, smiled weakly and said, "Fu'er, you can study well in the future, have a good job in the future, and don't resent the Li family, don't resent your father, promise me okay?" ”
The little boy held back tears and nodded seriously.
Seeing the little boy nodding seriously and agreeing, Zhao Meiling had a serene smile on her face and slowly closed her eyes forever.
At two o'clock in the evening, a bright moon hangs high in the sky, and the bright moonlight shines on the earth, making the surroundings not dark.
"Boom!"
There was a sudden deafening sound in the sky, Zhao Fu was startled, looked up at the sky, and saw that the entire sky seemed to be burning, turning into a huge sea of fire, countless emitting colorful light, dragging a long tail, like a meteor falling from the sky.
"Bang!"
With a loud noise, a meteor emitting colorful light fell in front of Zhao Fu, and the dazzling light made Zhao Fu block it with his hand, and then the strong light dissipated, and a spar one finger long and two fingers thick floated quietly in the air two meters above the ground.
Zhao Fu stepped forward curiously, held the spar, and the spar floating in mid-air was grasped by Zhao Fuyi without any reaction.
At this time, people who were originally asleep were also woken up by a series of loud noises, opened the door or opened the window, looked at the countless spars floating in mid-air, and began to frantically rush out of the house, snatching this spar, Zhao Fu did not stay much in place, and quickly returned to his home.
In a single room rental room, Zhao Fu carefully looked at the spar, if only by selling the appearance, this spar has no gemstone comparable to it, if the quantity is scarce, the value is not at all, but the key is too much to fall from the sky, let alone tens of billions, so this spar may not be worth anything at all.
"Detect that the host is a primary intelligent body, and begin soul binding..."
Bite! The soul binding is successful and begins to travel to the apocalypse world.
After this sound, Zhao Fu's eyes turned black and he fainted on the ground. Hong Dali, male, 22 years old, orphan, died of courage to rescue two children who were about to be hit by a car. After the study and decision of the relevant departments, Hong Dali was posthumously named a hero and an outstanding college student in the province. ”
"If you don't go, don't go, I won't go with you to the Hong family to make a family!" Tang Muxin buried her head in the pillow and desperately kicked her white and tender calves: "Hong Dali is a well-known waste in the city, he lost the face of their Hong family, and the people are sick and crooked, and their brains are not bright not to say that they are still a standard loser, so I don't want to find such a person to be my fiancé!" ”
Tang Muxin, the only beloved daughter of Tang Ruisi, chairman of Tang's Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is versatile, Bogu Tongjin not to mention, looks like a flower and moon, a fair lady, a collection of heaven and earth spiritual energy in one, especially a good cooking, the standard hall and the kitchen can get a big bed, I don't know how many boys' dream lover in school.
But today, she heard her father say that he would take him to the Hong Dali family, which is famous for being a loser, to marry him, how could she bear it: "If it weren't for his parents spoiling her, a single seedling in a thousand acres, just such a waste as him, he would have been driven out of the Hong family to fend for himself, how could he have the opportunity to be defeated everywhere like this?" ”
Listening to her daughter's words, Tang Ruisi, who was sitting at the end of the bed, showed a wry smile on her face, and said helplessly: "Xinxin, I can't help it either." ”
Your affair with Hong Dali was personally decided by your grandfather back then, and although he lost a little, it was not a big problem, right?
Tang Ruisi was wearing a blue-gray vest, inside was a spotless white undershirt, a simple bow tie at the collar, a faint stubble on his lips, a bronze pipe in his hand, a short black hair combed back meticulously, shiny oil, the whole image is quite good, but the original bright eyes are now full of helplessness and unwillingness.
Speaking of which, if he is not really cornered, how can he be willing to give away his own daughter? After all, that Hong Dali can be called a strange flower in the world, and the only thing he likes to do or will do is two words: loser.
His most famous quote was: "I have to be defeated, and the undefeated family does not waste my parents' talent to make money?" ”
This sentence can be called the joke that everyone in the entire Tianjing City knows and no one knows, and many parents will say this when educating their children: "If you dare to learn from Hong Dali that loser, see if I don't break your leg!" ”
Therefore, it is indeed reasonable that Tang Muxin would have such a big reaction.
"This is also..." Tang Ruisi frowned and thought for a while, and suddenly his eyes lit up, and said: "Xinxin, how about you see this?" Let's make a kiss first, and when Dad's company returns to normal, then we will find an excuse to quit my relatives. This time we are over the budget for research, once the funds keep up, as long as this project research is successful, it is definitely a sensational event in the world, and when we slow down, then find a way to retire, his family should not say anything, right? ”
Tang Muxin whimpered: "It's easy to resign from a relative, his family is one of the world's top five hundred enterprises, how can it be so easy?" ”
I have to say that Tang Muxin is a very smart girl.
If her family falls, her end will definitely not be much better. This is how the world is, the law of the jungle. No one may dare to touch you when you are strong, but when you really fall into the middle of the road, there will definitely be no fewer people who come to fall into the well.
For example, the young master of the Liu family who has been pestering her all the time at school.
So Tang Muxin cried for a while, and finally knew that there was really no other way than this method, so she could only get up unwillingly: "Then, then try it first, woo, dad, in the future, you must remember to withdraw your relatives, so that I don't want to marry that loser!" ”
"Well, okay, for the sake of my family Xinxin, Dad must try his best." Tang Ruisi sighed and patted Tang Muxin's shoulder: "Xinxin, let's go." ”
Hong Dali sat on the bed, his eyes blank, and his mind was in a mess.
The surrounding environment was very strange, and the memory in his head was quite problematic, and now he could only barely recall the harsh sound of brakes, and the rest was some mess that did not belong to his memory at all.
"Am I not dead, here, where?" Looking at his pale and slender hands, Hong Dali thought to himself: "This is not my body, and this is not where I usually live. So, where is this? ”
He looked left and right for a while and pondered, "The most urgent thing is to first understand the current situation. ”
"One, whether I'm dead or alive now. Second, what is this place and who is my identity? 3. What should I do next? ”
"So let's look at the first point now," Hong vigorously pinched a small piece of oil skin on the back of his left hand, rubbed it, and it hurt: "There is a feeling of pain, so I should be alive." He carefully touched his face, neck, ears, and the top of his head: "This body is obviously not my previous body, but it is still within the scope of human beings." ”
"Then the second question is what is this place and who is my identity." Hong Dali looked around again, the reinforced concrete house structure, snow-white walls, all kinds of modern household appliances, and even a computer with a 30-inch LCD monitor in the corner of the room: "It's true that modern society is right, but I have never seen the stars on the walls around me, and all kinds of toy models have never been heard of." In this way, this world should be the legendary parallel space? ”
There was no one around, Hong Dali stood up carefully and took a deep breath: "This body is really weak enough, thin bamboo pole-like, I really don't know when it will suddenly die." ”
Turning on the computer, Hong Dali opened a few URLs casually, and the content displayed was very different from that on Earth, but at least he understood a few things: "First, the world or the script of this country is still Chinese characters." Second, it is indeed a parallel space, and many things are different from the earth, but they are not much different.
Don't have an ID card? After thinking about it, he was quickly relieved: "Hehe, look at the age of this body should not be very high, about seventeen or eight years old, the ID card may be done, but it is more likely that it has not been issued, after all, this world is different from the earth, and some nuances are normal." ”
"The big loser system is bound successfully, the current level: level 1."
When the system sound was introduced here, a small person suddenly appeared in Hong Dalian's mind, and it seemed that it should be himself.
"Host Name: Hong Dali."
Sexual capacity: 32. Note: The index of normal people is 100. ”
Hong Dali was stunned: "Big loser system? Is this thing real or fake?
Fortunately, Hong Dali was eager to commit suicide, and the metal voice of the system came again: "Explanation: The host can get an attribute point for every 100,000 yuan (RMB) defeated."
When all the attributes of the host reach the normal human level, the big loser system will be upgraded, and new item items will be added, so stay tuned. ”
"Can I get attribute points?" At this time, there is really nothing better than being able to improve your attributes, Hong Dali listened with a smile, "Can you really get attribute points through losers and make yourself like a normal person?" ”
Although the voice of the system is still so cold, it is like a song in the ears at this time: "Yes." ”
Hong Dali was so excited that he almost didn't jump: "I'm going to splurge!" I'm going to lose! ”
Next, ask the host to take on the first task: the first loser. Mission requirements: At least 100,000 yuan before midnight today.
"Current loser amount: 0."
"I lean, it's already eight o'clock in the evening! There are only four hours left, no, I'm going out! I'm going to lose! ”
Just thinking of this, suddenly the door of the room was gently pushed open, and a maid in her forties bowed slightly to Hong Dali and said softly: "Young Master Vigorous, the master and the lady let you pass, please come with me." ”
"Buy me a game pod?" Jiang Fei asked his father expectantly.
"Xiaofei, you are in high school now, you can't indulge in games like before!"
"Mom! This game is different! This is a masterpiece that Shengshi Company has carefully produced for thirteen years, known as the second world of mankind! ”
The game called "Dawn" that Jiang Fei said is indeed another innovation in human history, it is not only a model of virtual real games, the degree of realism is close to 100%, but also through a new technology, players can experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night, through this technology, the human body enjoys eight hours of high-quality sleep physiologically, but mentally can experience a completely different magical career for twenty-four hours!
"This game is promoted by the whole country! Not deceptive, this game not only does not affect learning, but also makes people rest better! ”
Jiang Fei is still insisting!
"I said one last time, no! If you don't go back to your room to do your homework within 20 seconds, your pocket money for the next month will be cut by 50 percent! Dad said with a straight face.
"Old stubborn!"
Jiang Fei muttered in a low voice, but he also knew that there was nothing to talk about, his own home conditions were good, and his father was definitely not reluctant to buy this game cabin, but his father's brain was rigid, and he definitely did not believe that playing games would not affect learning! "Phineas, how's it going? "Dawn" is officially launched tonight, are you ready for the game cabin? ”
As soon as the class bell rang, after the teacher left, a little fat man behind Jiang Fei grabbed his shoulder and asked.
Don't mention it, I can't play with you this time! Jiang Fei smiled bitterly!
Brothers are pointing at you! ”
The little fat man Zhao Feng hurriedly said, this little fat man is one of Jiang Fei's few friends in school, Jiang Fei's high school class is the key class of the school, but Jiang Fei's grades are medium, the grades are not up or down, sports are not good, and not very good at interpersonal communication, so he can definitely be called a standard transparent person.
"My dad doesn't agree, what can I do?" Jiang Fei rolled his eyes, he didn't say anything to his only friend.
"How about the brothers scrape together money to buy you one?" Zhao Feng said that because Jiang Fei's conditions are similar, they are the kind of guys who are not excellent in all aspects, so the relationship between these two transparent people who are not concerned by teachers and classmates is very good.
Jiang Fei comforted himself.
"Hopefully!"
Zhao Feng nodded.
Jiang Fei has liked to play games since he was a child, especially this kind of realistic game, as a boy, the one who doesn't want to fight the sword? The eldest husband should bring a three-foot sword, the achievement of the world, this is every man's dream, but in peacetime, and it is a highly developed society with science and technology, not to mention that there is no war, even if there is a war, it is to press the button, so if you want to enjoy the blood of the battle, you can only go to the virtual game to experience!
But this time, Jiang Fei is hopeless, since entering high school, Jiang Fei has been issued an entertainment restriction order by his father, all the game equipment at home is sealed, and online games are even more free of talk!
Finally, after school, Jiang Fei walked home listlessly, although it was only about six o'clock in the evening, but because it was already winter, it was dark very early.
Thinking that today was the day of the start of "Dawn", Jiang Fei gambled and locked himself in his room! At about ten o'clock, Jiang Fei also finished his homework, he lay on his back on his bed, looking at the wall clock close to ten o'clock, and there was something unpleasant in his heart.
The start time of "Dawn" is ten o'clock tonight, and then it runs eight hours a day from ten o'clock to six o'clock the next morning, which not only does not delay the normal life of players, but also allows players to fully experience 24 hours of gameplay! "Hey! Such a great game is not my share! ”
Jiang Fei muttered while subconsciously rubbing the ring on his index finger with his hand.
"What the hell is this?"
Jiang Fei's mouth was open, looking at the ring on his hand that emitted a faint shimmer, and he was a little scared and speechless!
"Buzz!"
A white light flashed, Jiang Fei's eyes flickered, and when his vision returned to clarity again, it was no longer his room!
"Ding! Welcome to the world of Dawn! No. 34784 No. 12 is at your service! ”
A crisp female voice entered Jiang Fei's ears!
"Dawn? This is the landing screen for Dawn? ”
"To be precise, this is the character creation interface!" The novice assistant replied.
Jiang Fei is still a little unimaginable, he doesn't have a game cabin at all, how can he enter the game?
Maybe this is my dream! Maybe I'm too tired after doing my homework, so I fell asleep in bed, including the mysterious ring just now, I'm afraid it's part of the dream, thinking about it day and dreaming at night, maybe I want to play this game too much! Chapter I
"Liar! Big liar! ”
An angry snort, followed by the sound of the soles of the feet stepping on the bluestone ground to escape.
Zhang Hang stretched out his hands helplessly: "I'm really not a liar, I'm a teacher of the academy... Just want you to be my student! And, even if I say I'm a liar, why add the word 'big'? ”
After muttering, remembering what the political education director had said, Zhang Hang rubbed his eyebrows: "It's the seventeenth!" If I can't recruit even a student today, I can roll up and go home tomorrow! ”
Zhang Hangben is not a person from this world, but the administrator of an ordinary university librarian on Earth, who only remembers the raging fire, and then ... There was no then, and I woke up again into this world.
Similar to what is described in the novel, martial arts is respected, strength is king!
I thought I could cross a waste firewood, I was miserably divorced, and then I hit my face and counterattacked, singing all the way... It seems that after thinking too much, when I got here, I found that it was not a trainee, but ... Teacher!
One of the saddest teachers in the entire academy!
Other people's classrooms are overcrowded, crowded and can't sit down, and his class, there is none, finally pulled in by him, and finally scolded several times as a "liar", turned around and fled!
The reason is that the guy who was pierced by his own soul, the lowest strength among the teachers, not to mention, but also extremely poor vision, can not see anything, the key ... Also taught wrong, there was a case of going crazy!
This is the same as the death of people in the hospital, their reputation is greatly damaged, they are spurned, even if the new trainees are respectfully avoided one by one, for fear of falling into his hands and being taught to be half-dead!
There were no students, and they were criticized, and last year's teacher evaluation, the entire college ranked first from the bottom, and even got the only zero score in history.
Depressed, he poured his sorrows with wine, but he hung up as he wished, and took the opportunity to cross over.
At the beginning of the new semester, the college gave an ultimatum, if he could not enroll another student in his class this year, he would be directly expelled from the teaching qualification!
Today, seventeen new students had passed by his classroom, and as a result, as soon as they heard the name, they all fled without exception, like a little girl who met a strange maize, how fast and fast.
"It seems that you have to find a way to fool one!"
I was thinking about how to open my mouth to pull people, when I saw a dumbfounded girl peeking her head out of the doorway.
"Excuse me, is this Teacher Lu Xun's class?"
The voice is sweet, cute, beautiful and lovely.
Teacher Lu Xun, the star teacher of the college, the class is full every time, and countless people come to admire it.
"That's her!" Seeing that someone threw himself into the net, Zhang Suan's eyes lit up.
Recalling the various pretense routines he had seen in his previous life, he sat quietly on his seat and assumed a posture of a worldly master: "You want to worship him as a teacher?" ”
The girl nodded again and again like a sparrow, her black eyes were full of adoration: "I heard that Teacher Lu Xun is the most powerful teacher in Hongtian Academy, and the students he teaches are all of them with extraordinary strength, and everyone is proud to join his class!" ”
"No matter how good he is, if it is inconsistent with your cultivation theory, not only will it not progress, but it will retreat if it is not done well!" The teacher's reputation is not obvious, and if it is in line with your theory, he can also make rapid progress and greatly increase his cultivation! ”
"That's right... I heard my brother say something similar! The girl was stunned for a moment, and her beautiful eyes were a little confused: "However, I don't know what kind of class I am suitable for!" ”
Seeing her take the bait, Zhang Suan's eyes lit up, hesitated, Marx, Enkos and other sages appeared in their minds one after another, pretending to be embarrassed: "Meeting is fate, so let's do it, I am also a teacher of this academy, I can help you see the root bone, talent, and temperament for free, and help you recommend a suitable teacher by the way!" "Then Mr. Lao is annoyed!"
I didn't expect that the teacher I met casually was so righteous, and the girl nodded quickly with excitement.
"You show me Xiu Wei first, let me see!"
Zhang Suan's eyes were half-open and half-closed, seemingly unconcerned.
"Yes!"
Hoo hoo!
In a moment of kung fu, the fist wind in the room roared, and one after another qi swept around the girl's body like a dragon, and the whole person's breath, condensed but not dispersed, powerful but not visible, represented that she had an excellent foundation.
"Well, I can see that you usually practice hard and hard, have a solid foundation, and have excellent talents, and you are a rare genius!" After a set of punches, Zhang Hang nodded in satisfaction.
He learned this from fortune tellers on earth, and the words are all panacea, and the range is very wide, so that people cannot hear the error, but secretly call it accurate.
"Teacher, I have an injury on my leg, the doctor said, basically equivalent to waste..." The girl interrupted him, with some doubt in her eyes.
"Injured..." Zhang Xian's face turned red, but his face was thick, and others could not see it, and he continued to incite nonsense: "Do you think I didn't see it?" I knew it when you exerted your power just now! I say that because... If it doesn't break, it won't stand! ”
Anyway, it's all flickering, if you can talk nonsense, just talk nonsense, first fool a disciple and then talk.
"Serendipity? Teacher, what kind of chance is it? The girl's eyes lit up.
After her leg was injured, she always felt inferior to others, secretly inferior, but she didn't expect that she might be blessed by misfortune.
"This opportunity can make you soar to the sky and become the first freshman, after all, your talent is already very good, you are a peerless genius in all eternity, but..." Zhang Hang Haikou repeatedly, and almost took out a copy of "Rulai God Palm".
Hearing that she could become the first freshman and praise her as a genius, the girl's face couldn't help but show fire, and quickly asked: "But, what?" ”
"But..." Zhang Hang sighed, with a sigh that a good talent was about to be buried: "There are not many teachers who can see this kind of opportunity in the entire academy!"
"No students?" The girl originally had great hopes, but her eyes darkened slightly when she heard this, and then she figured out something and jumped up sharply: "They don't accept students, then teacher, you... Collect or not? ”
"Of course I still accept it, but, you can also see it, I am indifferent to fame and fortune, and I don't have so much time!"
Poof!
Before she finished speaking, the girl fell to the ground: "I know Mr. Gao Jie, please take me as an apprentice!" I will definitely practice well and not lose the face of the teacher! ”
"Students promise that they will never disturb the teacher as a last resort!" Seeing that he was a little reluctant, the girl quickly nodded and looked sincere.
"I don't have many students, maybe I can't compare with other teachers in terms of resources, and I will be criticized..." Zhang continued.
"So... I heard that refining resources is important..." The girl hesitated.
The resources that teachers receive in the academy are linked to many conditions such as the grades and number of students they are taught, and if the resources are not enough, it will be difficult for cultivation to progress.
"Ahem, I said this on purpose to test you, since you are firm in your heart and sincerely recognize me as a teacher, I will reluctantly accept you!" Seeing her hesitate, Zhang Hang immediately interrupted and quickly said, "Identity verification!" ”
"This... So fast? ”
Unexpectedly, this teacher changed his face like turning a book, fast outrageous, the girl was slightly stunned, took the token that Zhang handed over to represent her identity, and was considering whether to verify it, and saw that Teacher Zhang, who was extremely calm before, had already pulled her palm, took out a sharp knife and swiped it gently, and a drop of blood fell on the jade card.
Airplanes!
The light flickered.
The girl was in a daze.
Didn't this teacher just say that he should think about it and be indifferent to fame and fortune? How to move so fast, and... The knives are ready?
"From now on, you will be my student!" Spilling blood to recognize the Lord, Zhang Hang breathed a sigh of relief and returned to his noble appearance again: "What's your name?" ”
"Teacher Huiyu, my name is Wang Ying!"
Knowing that it could not be changed, the girl said no more and nodded cutely.
"Well, take the identity tag, go get your futon, books, and find your own place to live by the way!" Classes start tomorrow, just come here and find me! ”
Zhang hangs his hand.
"Yes!" Wang Ying nodded and turned to leave.
"Successfully fooled the previous one!"
Seeing her become his own trainee, Zhang Hang breathed a sigh of relief and smiled slightly.
It's really not easy, if I hadn't seen a lot of pretending skills on the Internet, I'm afraid it would be really difficult to succeed today.
With a trainee, you can avoid the doom of being expelled, and when Zhang Suan relaxed, he suddenly felt that the whole person's spirit was much smoother in an instant, and the obsession that hovered in his mind was slowly disappearing.
"Don't worry, since you have crossed into you, I will live well for you!"
Before that Zhang Hang died because he could not recruit students, he was unwilling, but now with students, the last insistence disappeared without a trace, until this moment, Zhang Hang was completely mastered of this body.
Bang!
Completely controlling his body, Zhang Hang was about to fool a few more students next, when he felt a shock in his mind, and a voice of Huang Zhong Da Lu roared.
Bang!
All kinds of mysterious language, shocked him a little dizzy, and then a huge palace appeared in his mind, with five big words shining on it.
Heavenly Dao Library!
Push the door and walk in, countless bookshelves are lined up, all kinds of books are endless, and there is no end in sight at a glance.
"Library? Nima, I was a librarian in my last life, I won't be in this world, it's still the same! ”
Other people's gift packages, either grandfather, or system, all kinds of good things that are bursting, but they are a library, Zhang Hang only felt that his eyes were dark, and he almost didn't faint.
Library? Dry birds? Will there be a fight later, others throw swords, and I throw books?
"See what books they are?"
Helpless, Zhang Hang reached out and grabbed the books on the shelves, wanting to see what the purpose of this library was, but when he grabbed it, he found that his palm passed directly through the bookshelf and grabbed an empty space.
"Are you playing with me? Give a library, but you can't get any books, can't read it, what do you want to do? ”
Zhang Suan's face was speechless, and he wanted to cry without tears.
Chapter 1
Ay? What about my tattoos!
Zhao Yu rolled up his sleeves and looked at his two white and tender arms in surprise. Before, he had two teeth and dancing claws tattooed on his arms, a domineering green dragon!
How...... All gone?
Zhao Yu raised his head and found that he was sitting in an office with dazzling lighting, with small partitions for office on the left and right of the front and back.
At this moment, the phone kept ringing, paper documents were flying everywhere, and more than a dozen office workers were speeding through the hall, all looking anxious.
At this time, a middle-aged man wearing a brown jacket quickly walked over and greeted everyone, "Team leader Qu Ping will now tell everyone about the case of electric baton rape, and we will take action tonight, everyone pay attention!" ”
Someone quickly pulled over a whiteboard full of writing and several photos.
Hearing the greeting, many staff members quickly gathered around, casually pulled up a chair, and sat in front of the whiteboard to listen carefully.
Zhao Yu did not move the place, still sitting in his seat.
At this moment, he was still in a great shock, he touched his right ear, and it was actually intact! Previously, his right ear was split in half by a punk during a fight.
Zhao Yu wanted to find a mirror to see his face, but he saw the photo on the desk. In the photo, there is a young and handsome young man wearing a police uniform, who looks exactly like himself!
Grandma is a bear! Shocked, a stream of strange memories flooded into his mind like the flooding of the Yellow River. Zhao Yu gradually realized that it was... I encountered the legendary - crossing!
Zhao Yu clearly remembered that he was originally a gold medal beater of the Blue Dragon Gang, a riffraff king who fought and did not die! Although his real name is also Zhao Yu, people in the rivers and lakes prefer to call him Zhao Tianba!
Grandma is a bear!
Zhao Yu was shocked again, he finally remembered that before this, he had been executed by drug injection!
But, reading and thinking... How did you get here?
Don't...... I really crossed over! ?
And it's still seamless, and there is no need for reincarnation at all?
As new memories poured in, he was surprised to find that this was a parallel world similar to before, and his current identity was an agent of the Major Crime Unit Mobile Team, which was actually a policeman!
The hall where he is now, nowhere else, is the office of the police station!
Zhao Yu couldn't believe his eyes, this huge contrast was really unimaginable. A senior little riffraff turned into a detective of the Major Crime Unit, which... Where does this make sense?
He subconsciously touched his head, in the past, because he had been cut several times on his head, his hair was always uneven, so he simply left a big bald head, like a fierce god. But now, he actually has flowing black hair, and he is completely a handsome boy.
"Dear colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been 3 cases of electric batons rape in our city..." At this moment, a female detective with short hair and big eyes was telling everyone about the case.
Zhao Yu quickly found the information of this agent from memory, she is the leader of Group B of the Major Crime Group, don't look at her age, but her style is steady, the case solving rate is high, and she is a red person in front of the leader. Generally, if there are any major cases that require the cooperation of the whole team, she will preside over them.
"The victims were all well-dressed young women with bad lifestyles." Team leader Qu Ping introduced, "Most of the places where the incident occurred were near bars, song halls and other weathered places, and the crime time was also after midnight. ”
"According to the victim's confession, the perpetrator first followed the victim into the uninhabited alleyway, then stunned him with an electric baton, and then raped him. After committing the crime, the perpetrator will also be on the victim - pee! ”
Hearing the word "pee", the scene was quiet.
Zhao Yu glanced at it, and this person was Liu Changhu, the deputy captain of the mobile team of the Major Crime Unit. During Zhao Yu's internship, this person sent Zhao Yu a few tribes, and asked him to send letters and pour tea every day, just like the envoys.
And Zhao Yu in this world is not a riffraff king, but a big boy with a weak personality, who has just completed his internship and turned into a regular police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but also many colleagues with old seniority will joke about him and arrange some jobs for him that should not belong to him.
Now Zhao Yu is not a soft persimmon, how can he stand being yelled at? He slapped the table and stood up.
His sudden rise startled Liu Changhu, and even Qu Ping's team leader had to pause.
Who knows, just when everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a silver bell-like female voice suddenly rushed in front of Zhao Yu. I saw a girl with a ponytail, a slightly fat body, and big glasses appear in front of everyone.
The girl is a newly assigned trainee clerk from the Major Crime Unit named Li Beini. This girl is a flower idiot, and after less than a month of contact, she fell in love with Zhao Yu.
Although Zhao Yu has a weak personality and is often bullied, he looks like a talent, one meter seven or eight in size, Yushu is in the wind, young and handsome, and really has a certain lethality to the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing her sweetheart being shouted, Li Beini hurriedly stepped forward to relieve the siege: "Captain Liu, I'll come, I'll come!" I'm still in the internship period, so naturally I do the work! ”
After that, Li Beini smiled at Zhao Yu and ran to the pantry in the hall to make coffee.
Zhao Yu was also not good at seizures, so he could only sit down again patiently and continue to ponder his crossing problem. Although crossed, his memory is very clear, because just a few minutes ago he was lying on the execution recliner. In his previous life, he was sentenced to death for murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in his heart that he was framed by someone and did not kill anyone at all! The person killed was the owner of a real estate group, and Zhao Yu just beat him according to the instructions of his superiors, and it was impossible to cause death.
Besides, even if it is really beaten to death, it is manslaughter and should not be sentenced to murder! Therefore, his death sentence is all someone else's conspiracy!
Thinking of this, Zhao Yu couldn't help but be full of anger, and his fists clenched loudly. If you can find the person who framed you in the future, you must make them pay it back!
At this time, Li Beini had already brewed the coffee and shared a cup for each of the colleagues present. The little girl's face has always been full of enthusiasm, and every time she gives a cup, she will kindly encourage words such as "hard work" and "come on", which is quite favored by colleagues.
"Officer Zhao, this cup contains two packets of sugar! Tonight is destined to be clear, you have to hold on! ”
Without waiting for Zhao Yu to react, Li Beini put the plate away beautifully.
At this time, Team Leader Qu Ping had finished explaining the facts of the case, and Captain Jin Zhenbang, the leader of the Major Crime Team, spoke instead. Captain Jin is over 50 years old, with white sideburns, but he is an old man who does not smile and does things very seriously.
Captain Jin said in a loud voice, "There have been 3 cases of electric batons, and one more will be characterized as a serial incident." Not only on top, we can't wear this big hat!
Therefore, everyone cheered up and strived to solve this case in the shortest possible time! "So... Group A sent someone to the scene of the crime to investigate, since the perpetrator is the murderer who followed the victim, then he must have appeared in the bar and song hall where the victim was before, and all the monitoring there was tuned out, and this person must be found!
"Yes!"
"Group B, you are mainly responsible for the comparison of exhibits!" Captain Jin ordered, "The perpetrator has no criminal record, and the blood line will not work." However, the criminal's urine is an important clue, although the police station cannot find a match, but you can go to the hospital or physical examination center to check and compare, as long as the person has done a physical examination or has been hospitalized, you will definitely be able to find him! ”
"Yes!"
"In addition, the electric baton used by the criminal, the mobile phone signal that appeared at the scene, and the only victim who has seen the appearance of the criminal, these clues cannot be ignored, and all must be followed up!"
"Yes!"
"Okay, each group will arrange an action plan, if there is no problem, then go as soon as possible!" Captain Jin said nothing, closed his folder, and was about to turn and leave.
"Wait a minute, I... I have a problem! ”
Everyone looked back and found that the person who spoke was none other than Zhao Yu.
Captain Jin was also stunned, and hurriedly asked, "What's wrong, Zhao Yu?" What's your problem? ”
Zhao Yu pointed to his forehead and said justifiably, "I'm not feeling well, go home first, you guys play by yourself!" ”
Chapter 1
21st century, Office of the President of Donghai Senior Private Hospital.
"Snap", a thick case was slammed on the table, Dean Lin's face was livid, and he was furious, "Han Yunxi, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Lingyun Group, he owns 40 (percent) of the equity of our hospital, you must give him priority to arrange detoxification!" ”
Facing the dean's monstrous anger, Han Yunxi put his hands in the pockets of his white coat, very calm. "Dean Lin, I'm sorry, Mr. Li is a chronic snake venom, and I am not allowed to cut the queue here unless it is an emergency."
She looks pure and beautiful, a pair of big eyes, a pair of small pear swirls, and is famous in the field of Chinese medicine at a young age for her amazing talent in acupuncture, and is a rare master of detoxification, whether it is dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins or toxins in the human body, it is her strength.
"You figure it out, this is Lingyun!" The dean was so angry that he shot up.
"Enough, don't tell me that everyone is equal in front of doctors, only men and women. Han Yunxi, I tell you, arrange detoxification immediately, otherwise, from today onwards, get out of the medical world! ”
I thought that Han Yunxi would be afraid, but she was still calm and calm, with a serious attitude, "Dean Lin, in front of me, there is no distinction between men and women, there are only two kinds of people, what I want to save and what I don't want to save, Mr. Li, I don't save, please ask for another master!" ”
After she finished speaking, she smiled politely, turned around and left, her seemingly thin body was elegant and calm, and there was a kind of arrogance that could not be ignored in the quiet and beautiful. However, when Xuan Han Yunxi opened the door, Dean Lin was furious.
"Han Yunxi, you dare to speak to me like this, you stop for me!"
Saying that, casually smashed the case clip on the table towards the back of her head, Han Yunxi was startled, and only felt a feeling of dampness and heat slowly flowing from the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, Tianning Kingdom.
Han Yunxi woke up in a daze from the sedan and heard the joy around him, blowing gongs and drums, and his eyes were dark.
What's going on?
Han Yunxi pulled off the thing covering his head and looked at it, and suddenly gasped, this... Isn't this Hipa? Subconsciously raised his head and lowered his head, and found that he was dressed in a phoenix crown, as if he was a bride who was getting married... Half in the bag!
The sedan was upside down, which gave Han Yunxi a headache, and at this time, strange memories also flooded into his mind. Undoubtedly, she crossed, and as soon as she crossed, she was going to get married!
The original owner was the concubine of the Han family, also called Han Yunxi, a medical family in Tianning Kingdom, because her biological mother saved the then empress, which is now the empress dowager, and was accused of marrying the then seventh prince, which is now the King of Qin, Long Feiye, which was also rumored to be a good story at that time, and the Han family's status soared.
But no one knew that Han Yunxi killed her own mother as soon as she was born, and also grew into a waste ugly woman who did not understand medical skills, so the marriage was delayed again and again became a taboo for the King of Qin, but a few days ago, the King of Qin annoyed the emperor, and the emperor ordered that the marriage be completed before the end of the month.
King Long of Qin is the only remaining prince in the battle for the throne, he is only in his early twenties at a young age, but he is the only imperial uncle in terms of generation, and he can be described as the first person with a high position in the Tianning Kingdom.
King Qin's mansion is in the south of the city, the Han family is in the north of the city, the palanquin has to pass through the city from north to south, and the king of Qin gets married, even if he does not show up, but it leads to thousands of empty alleys, and the whole city is sensational.
Just as Han Yunxi was sorting out these memory information, the joy came to an abrupt end, only to hear Xi Po shouting, "It's not good, it's not good, it's not good!" ”
Chapter I
"Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu, get up. It's almost midnight, get up and eat some dumplings. ”
Feng Yu felt that the voice was a little strange, but he felt very kind. He agreed in confusion, opened his eyes, and saw a young face that only existed in memory.
"Sister?"
"Wake up, hurry up and wash your face. Tell you not to drink, you have to drink, I fell asleep without watching the Spring Festival Gala. Feng Danying said with a smile.
Gala? Chinese New Year's Eve night today?
Feng Yu looked left and right in confusion, a cabin of less than six square meters, a single bed, patched bedding, an old wooden table, a twenty-watt incandescent lamp above his head, emitting a dim light, and old newspapers pasted on the wall, all of which were some major national events that he could no longer remember.
Isn't this the old house on his family's farm when he was a child, but this house has long been demolished with the construction of small towns, and how did his sister become so young?
Feng Yu raised his hand, only to find that this was definitely not a joke, because his hands had become smaller and his arms had become thinner.
He jumped out of bed and stood by the door frame, which also had the mark he made with a knife every New Year's Day, the highest line, 1988, 166 centimeters.
It's 1988? He hasn't graduated from junior high school yet?
He pinched himself so hard that he almost cried out in pain, wasn't it a dream?
Feng Yu opened the door and came out, and his mother was cooking dumplings in the cauldron in the kitchen. He lived in a cottage, with the kitchen right outside, and the living room on the other side of the kitchen, called the hall house on the farm.
"Get up, will you drink in the future?" Zhang Muhua glanced at his son lovingly.
Feng Yu looked at his mother, who was still full of black hair, and his eyes were moist.
"Mom, you worked hard."
"What do you say, kid. Quickly wash your face, go to the house and watch TV for a while, and the dumplings will be ready immediately. Zhang Muhua heard that hard work, and his heart was also very gratified, his son has grown up.
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips trembled. In the future, when he was just able to make money, his father was found to have a terminal brain tumor and died in less than three months, without even spending a penny he earned.
The son wanted to be nurtured and did not wait, which made Feng Yu's heart very uncomfortable for a long time.
"Dad." Feng Xingtai turned his head to look at his son: "Get up, is your head still dizzy?" Watch TV, national dance party, can be festive. ”
"Dad, I'll want to have some drink with you later." Seeing the anger on his father's face, Feng Yu quickly explained, "Just beer." ”
He had never drunk with his father several times in his life, and Feng Yu now had a strong desire to drink again with his father.
"I haven't remembered it yet, okay, drink a little more later, I see if you can get up tomorrow to greet the New Year!" Danying, go get two bottles of beer. ”
Feng Danying shook his head helplessly and turned to get the beer and cup.
There is also a single bed with futon on top. Feng Danying went to school and lived in school, and when he came back from vacation, he lived in the back room with his mother, and this bed was Feng Xingtai sleeping in. But three years ago, Feng Yu was still sleeping.
On the west wall of the living room there is a standing wardrobe with three doors, and there are two suitcases above the wardrobe. On a solid wooden table, there is a 14-inch black-and-white TV, and the Spring Festival Gala is playing on the TV.
In the middle of the living room sits a folding round table filled with dishes and chopsticks. There are eight dishes in total, but all of them are leftovers from the evening. There are chickens, fish and elbows, and all eight dishes are meat dishes, and none of them are vegetarian.
Feng Yu did not watch TV, but walked to the front of the wardrobe and looked carefully in the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall in front of the door, February 16, 1988, Chinese New Year's Eve.
He can now be sure that he has been born again!
The mother quickly cooked the dumplings, Feng Yu and Feng Danying both went to the kitchen to help bring the dumplings up, and after the four people sat down, Feng Xingtai picked up the chopsticks.
"Xiaoyu, you still drink!" Zhang Muhua glared at Feng Yu.
"Mom, for the New Year, let me drink some more."
Feng Xingtai also helped to say two words, Zhang Muhua shook his head, and they went. Feng Yu also diligently poured a glass of beer for his mother and sister, and the family must drink a drink.
"Dad, mom, sister, Happy New Year, cheers!"
These leftovers on the table, Feng Yu casually ate a bite, they all felt particularly delicious. This year, there are no hormone additives in later generations. Fish, rabbits and everything else are wild, and chickens and pigs are homemade. The two of them ate these dishes, just dumplings, one person drank a bottle of beer, no matter how much Feng Xingtai did not allow.
After eating, Feng Yu washed up and went back to his cabin to lie down. As he lay in bed, he tossed and turned, and couldn't help but think of his life before he was reborn.
Feng Yuben is a middle-aged man in his forties, and after resigning from a securities company, he made some investment life on his own.
He had a wife and no children, his father died of illness at an early age, and his mother lived with him.
He remembers that it was the spring of 2015, in order to take his wife abroad for infertility treatment, he wanted to make more money, so he mortgaged all the family's savings, including the house and car, and borrowed a large amount of money, all into the stock market.
The situation was very good at first, and his investment soon doubled. So he boldly used high leverage in an investment company, wanting to make more profits, and with such a doubling, he would do nothing for the rest of his life, and he would be able to live and have food and clothing.
When the stock market rose to 5,000 points, he was like many people, greedy and he thought that he could continue to rise, and the stock market did rise again, but the stock market soon ushered in a dive, because he used high leverage, and there was no additional funds, but a large loss. After paying back the borrowed money, he became destitute, his wife did not know that the house and car had been mortgaged, and he did not know how to go home to face his family.
He went bankrupt, he drank a lot that day, and then deliberately fell on the road under the watchful eye of many people and was hit by a large truck.
This should not be considered suicide, he should be able to pay millions of dollars in accident insurance, enough to redeem the house and car, and leave a sum of money to his mother and wife.
He remembered looking at the speeding truck, thinking that if God could give him a chance to do it again, he would not die like this, he would let his family live a comfortable life!
But unexpectedly, God actually gave him a chance to do it again!
Since God let him do it again, then the regrets of the past life will definitely not be in this life. He wants to become a rich man, he wants to become a legend in the investment world!
"Xiaoyu, don't shout, go to bed quickly."
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted. At the same time, complaining about the husband, how to let his son drink at night, this is all nonsense.
Hearing his mother's complaining voice, Feng Yu smiled, turned over, and fell asleep sweetly. Chapter I
Monday, May 20, 2019.
Spring ends and summer solstice.
During this season, the temperature difference between day and night in the Gangnam area becomes very large. He also wears pants during the day to heat up as a dog; At night, he had to shrink under the covers and freeze into a cold bird.
Gangnam University Town.
Song Shuhang stayed alone in the dormitory, and the computer desk was pulled to the side of the bed so that he could watch movies in various postures.
Song Shuhang did not have a hobby of skipping class - last night in the middle of the night, the weather was sweltering, and in his sleep, he made a move 'Double Dragon to the Sea' and kicked the quilt away.
In the second half of the night, the temperature dropped sharply. Song Shuhang, who only had a pair of small pants on his body, was suddenly pressed, and in his sleep, he groped the bed with his hands, looking for it, but he couldn't touch the quilt. In the end, it only shivered into a skin shrimp shape, shivering under the lewd power of the midnight wind.
When the rising sun rose, Song Shuhang had become a member of the seasonal cold army.
His roommate has already taken a leave of absence for him for today's class.
Then, he took cold medicine and slept until now.
The high fever faded, and the body was still a little weak, and I couldn't go to class in such a state. Therefore, he can only stay alone in the dormitory bored to watch movies.
On the screen, the playback progress bar of the movie slowly advances. But the content of the movie, Song Shuhang did not see it at all.
"The effect of the medicine has not passed yet, so sleepy." He yawned, feeling a little heavy in his eyelids.
'DiDiDiDi~' At this time, the chat software in the lower right corner of the computer jumped.
This is a prompt for someone to add him as a friend or join a group.
"Who added me?" Song Shuhang muttered, he reached out and tapped it in the lower right corner of the computer's touch screen, and the prompt message popped up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun (******) requests to add you as a friend.] Additional message: None.
Huangshan Zhenjun? Who, such a strange nickname?
"Are you classmates?" Song Shuhang said secretly, and he couldn't help but think of the guys in the class who were obviously in college but were still in the adolescent fantasy stage. If it were them, they would indeed have this strange nickname.
Thinking of this, he ordered 'agree'.
Immediately after, another system message pops up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun invited you to join the group 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group', do you agree?]
Song Shuhang continued to press agree.
'Book Mountain is under pressure' and agreed to join the 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group'.
[You've agreed to join the group, say hello to your friends!] ] also comes with a system smiley.
This year, chat tools have become more and more user-friendly.
After a series of prompts popped up, Song Shuhang negotiated to close the prompt and group chat window - he is now sleepy, how can he have the energy to care what group he added?
Anyway, his group setting has always been 'only show the number of messages without prompting the message', and the group chat will not pop up to disturb him, but only display the number of chats after the group.
When he wakes up, he can go through the chat history, and he can know what group he joined, and the chat history of the group members will not be lost.
The movie progress bar is still tenaciously advancing, but Song Shuhang's consciousness is becoming more and more blurred.
In the Jiuzhou No. 1 group, after seeing new people joining, some diving members in the group appeared. Beihe Sanren: "Did Huangshan Zhenjun add a new Taoist friend to come in?" Haven't added new people in over a year, right? ”
Another with the ID 'Su Clan A Qi' quickly replied: "Have a new Taoist? Which district of Huaxia is Daoyou? What about the road number? How many products have you repaired? ”
This series of questions, always feel that something is wrong?
"Is it a fairy? If yes, report the three measurements and shine a light! ”
"Brother Sanlang, are you really a goldfish?" Beihe Sanren sighed: "Don't you die again, what if the Huangshan True Monarch adds another senior to come in?" ”
Sanlang this guy is good at everything, affectionate, righteous, and helpful, so he has a good reputation - that is, he usually likes to talk and die.
It's just that this guy's lucky value is outrageously low, and every time he can't help but die, he always offends the seniors. These idle seniors are having no fun, and naturally they are very happy to toss the crazy knife and three waves, which is sent to the door.
"Kneel and beg not to mention the word 'senior', there is a shadow in the heart of this seat." Mad Dao Sanlang sent a row of 'tearful' expressions.
Four years ago, he offended a beautiful 'big senior' with this broken mouth, and was tossed miserably ... That senior tossed him for a whole year and four months in a row. You heard it right, it's a whole year and four months! Remembering those inhuman years, his eyes were moist.
As soon as Sanlangcai finished saying this, a series of bad smiles popped up in the group - undisguised, straightforward schadenfreude.
There were eight people in the group who showed their online status, and six of them popped up in unison with smiling faces.
"You gloating guys, this seat remembers each and every one of you, don't let this seat meet you, otherwise you must be allowed to taste the experience of the seventy-two fast swords of this seat!" Mad Dao Sanlang hated it. He is very confident in his fast knife, and none of the six guys who laughed badly just now were his opponents.
Mad Dao Sanlang just finished speaking.
His cultivation was profound, he had reached the late realm of the 5th Grade Spirit Emperor, and he was only two steps away from the 6th Grade Spirit Monarch, but he couldn't beat A Qi.
His seventy-two sword technique in one hand was fast and ruthless, and he also had a body technique that was as fast as lightning, but he couldn't beat Ah Qi.
He is known as a crazy knife, and he is even afraid of himself when he goes crazy, but he just can't beat Ah Qi!
After the people in the group saw that the three waves had withered, they were again a string of unscrupulous smiles.
"..."This time, Mad Dao Sanlang could only send a series of colons in frustration.
The people in the group made a fuss for a long time, but they didn't see the newcomer make a sound, and they were a little puzzled.
"New Daoist friends don't make a sound?" Beihe Sanren asked aloud.
Unfortunately, because of the medicinal effect of cold medicine, Song Shuhang has entered a half-asleep state again.
At this time, Su Shi Ah Qi sent another message very happily: "I read it, the new Daoist friend is called 'Book Mountain is under pressure'. Have you ever heard of a master who calls this trumpet? Does this sound a bit like a Confucian practitioner?
Looking back, the practitioners of Confucianism were even cooler than Buddhas, not only their mouths were bad, but their fists were also hard enough. And when you are interested, you will also chant heroically to help you get happy, which is refreshing! I like hitting them the most. ”
"Ah Qi, I said, your expectation for the new Daoist friend will always be whether it is good or not, and whether it is good or not?" Mad Dao Sanlang said with a tearful expression.
"Ugh." Su Shi Ah Qi was a little embarrassed.
Beihe Sanren smiled wickedly: "Could it be another 'big senior' who can't use chat tools?" ”
When he said this, everyone felt that this scene was very immediate?
Yes, almost four years ago, it seems that there was also a senior who came out after more than a hundred years of retreat, who also managed to get on the chat software and was joined by Huangshan Zhenjun. But because he couldn't type, he didn't speak.
Then, a guy named Mad Dao Sanlang happily mouthed in front of this senior, and asked this senior to report three measurements, and asked her to send photos, and voice chat.
And then...... Within a few days, Mad Dao Sanlang saw this senior with his own eyes. It was a very beautiful senior, as dazzling and beautiful as the bright moon in the night sky.
Then, this beautiful senior tossed the crazy knife three waves for a whole year and four months before leaving satisfied.
At this time, an ID named 'Pharmacist' spoke.
Inexplicable short message, no beginning and no end.
Fortunately, the people in the group had long been accustomed to the medicine master's short chat habit - he was asking where was the group leader Huangshan Zhenjun?
The short speech is not that the medicine master has a noble and cold personality, but because he uses two-finger Zen and handwriting to type, and the speed is slow. When there are many words, it is easy to make mistakes, and it is painful to delete and write. Therefore, pharmacists are accustomed to speaking short or short.
"He immediately went offline after adding people, and I heard that his family's baby big demon dog ran away from home in anger, and Huangshan Zhenjun went to chase him again." Beihe Sanren replied.
"..."Pharmacist.
"Then we can only chat after the new Taoist friends learn to use the chat tool."
They all have preconceived notions that the new entrants are also like-minded people.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang came to his senses slightly.
"Remember that someone added me to the group just now, it seems to be called Jiuzhou No. 1 Group?" He muttered in a low voice, casually clicked on the chat tool in the lower right corner, and pulled out the chat window of the Jiuzhou No. 1 group.
What kind of group is it?
Soon, the chat history from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang probably toured it.
Honza? Hunting down the Great Demon Dog?
Specialized vocabulary in various fairy tales.
The way people in the group chat and talk is also interesting - half-ancient, half-white. It gives people the feeling that modern people try to communicate in ancient languages, but because the ancient language skills fail, the way of communication is very awkward.
"Huh~~" Song Shuhang laughed.
It seems that this is a group built by fairy lovers?
Oh no, this is definitely not an ordinary group of fairy lovers!
Everyone in the group gave themselves a road name, the place where they lived should be called Dongfu, and the lost pet dogs of the group owner must be described as the big demon dog running away from home. There is also someone who claims that he has not fought a Confucian practitioner in hundreds of years, which means that the person claims to have lived for hundreds of years?
Just looking at these chats feels a good sense of shame.
"This degree of obsession has reached the level of middle two diseases, and it is a fairy second middle school with Chinese characteristics." Song Shuhang nodded secretly.
It seems that this is a concentration camp for patients with two diseases in Xianxia!
This was his first impression of the 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group' and the members in the group.
But why did you add him to the group?
He looked at the information of the group leader Huangshan Zhenjun, and he was not his classmate, and he definitely did not know him.
The slender blue lines run smoothly from under the nib. The pale blue lines on the palm-sized card continue to increase, and gradually, an intricate and esoteric pattern continues to become more perfect as the tip of the pen slides.
Suddenly, the tip of the pen was heavy, changing the light spirit just now, and then a sharp side hook, the pen hook was like a blade! The pattern on the card suddenly lit up, then quickly faded and returned to normal.
After completing this card, his face was still focused, he had only completed fifteen cards now, and there was still ten cards left behind today's task. What he is now making is a one-star energy card, and as the lowest energy card, it is currently the most widely used and one of the most consumed cards.
At this moment, the room suddenly went dark.
The number one hundred is displayed on the gauge. I didn't expect that the energy would run out, and it seems that today's task will add another one. Back at the table, Chen Twilight threw himself into work, and all his livelihood depended on this most paper-quality card.
Chen Twilight's room was small, less than forty square meters, and inside was a half-old work desk. In addition to the relatively clean work desk, the rest of the room was littered with mountains of debris. These sundries are also varied, piles of old books, scattered with various raw materials.
In this humble place, Chen Twilight lived for three years. This is a special relief room provided by the federal government, and a small room like this can be moved in for only one hundred and fifty odies a month. For a poor person like Chen Twilight, there is really no cheaper place than here.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen Twilight finally completed today's day's work - twenty-five energy cards. After carefully counting the number of cards, counting twice in a row, and making sure that there was no mistake in the number, he carefully loaded the energy cards into the card bag in his clothes.
As soon as he entered the door, the shopkeeper noticed and greeted: "Ah Twilight is here!" ”
He replied to the shopkeeper. The owner Uncle Hua is an old man of about fifty years old, and the years have left unconcealable marks on him. Fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, a pair of reading glasses.
Chen Twilight carefully took out the card bag from his arms, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed it to the shopkeeper: "Twenty-five." ”
Uncle Hua took the card in Chen Twilight's hand, put it on the shelf without looking at it, and said with a smile: "Fortunately, you send the card every day, or I will have a shortage of supplies here." ”
Chen Twilight smiled slightly, but did not answer, he knew that Uncle Hua's words were probably a joke. One-star energy cards are the cheapest energy cards, but they are also one of the most consumed cards, not to mention that this is located near Dongwei Academy, where can only twenty-five energy cards be sold a day?
Uncle Hua also knew Chen Twilight's temper, and did not talk nonsense, and asked directly: "Does Twilight need cash or transfer?" ”
Chen Twilight replied dryly, and after speaking, he handed a pale green Deca that had been prepared earlier to Uncle Hua. After finishing the settlement, Chen Twilight said goodbye to Uncle Hua and wanted to turn around and leave.
Uncle Hua suddenly stopped Chen Twilight: "Ah Twilight, wait a minute." ”
Chen Twilight stopped, turned around and looked at Uncle Hua with a slight surprise: "Is there anything else?" Uncle Hua. ”
Uncle Hua took out a goose-yellow paper from the drawer and looked at Chen Twilight with a smile: "I almost forgot something." This is a hearing card for the card maker's training course, which was supplied by the dealer when it was purchased yesterday. ”
Looking at Uncle Hua with a kind face, Chen Twilight couldn't help but feel moved in his heart. He knew how much the old man in front of him had helped him over the years, and if it weren't for him, Chen Twilight believed that the current life would also be out of reach for him.
Three years ago, he had just learned to make energy cards and peddled them everywhere, but few people cared about them, and no merchants were willing to buy them. The amount required for one-star energy cards is very large, and merchants are more willing to purchase large quantities at once. And Chen Twilight can only make up to thirty sheets a day, which is only a small amount for merchants.
Fortunately, he met Uncle Hua. Uncle Hua agreed to buy his energy cards, but the purchase price of each card was one hundred and three odies, which was two odies lower than the wholesale price of energy cards on the market. Despite this, Chen Twilight was still extremely grateful to Uncle Hua.
Although the price of one hundred and three odies was lower than the price of one hundred and five, Chen Twilight felt that he was surrounded by great joy. Sold all the energy cards in his hand, bought the cheapest food, and bought the rest of the money for the raw materials of the energy cards.
Since then, Chen Twilight's life has finally stabilized.
Twenty-five energy cards a day, he didn't interrupt for a day.
That's three years. In the past three years, he has only made one kind of card - a one-star energy card. In addition to making energy cards, he spends all his time researching how to reduce costs.
Finally, in the third year, the cost of energy cards was controlled by him at ninety-five odies, and he could earn eight oddies per energy card, and his daily income was stable at two hundred odies, which was a figure he did not dare to imagine three years ago.
Chen Twilight, who came back to his senses, smiled at Uncle Hua: "Thank you, Uncle Hua!" He took the hearing card and carefully placed it in the card holder in his arms.
They are often advertised with incomparably gorgeous advertisements, such as this listening card that says that "Dongwei Academy recognizes academic qualifications" and "Dongwei University's senior senior card maker authoritatively speaks" Yunyun, in fact, what is inside Chen Twilight is clear. The only thing about the institution that hosted this training course was that the institution had to pay a fee to the Dongwei University each time as the price for maintaining this nominal "joint organization".
Chen Twilight still planned to go and hear what was said in the training class. Card making is one of the most difficult learning, and he has not given up self-study for so many years, but with little success. It wasn't until last year that he understood what was going on.
For a teenager without the slightest foundation, it is naturally more difficult to learn card making on his own, which is known for its difficulty and obscurity. However, he did not have the slightest doubt about his intelligence, and he could learn to make one-star energy cards in a week with only his memory, and the card maker had praised his talent.
Since then, he has put aside this goal that was too high for him for the time being, and began to turn to the most basic theoretical study. Every day, no matter how tired he is from work, he will find time to learn these boring knowledge.
After bidding farewell to Uncle Hua, Chen Twilight walked down an alley towards the south. Today is Saturday, and he has one more job.
After walking through two streets and walking for about twenty minutes, he came to a second-hand card buying station.
He is also the owner of this acquisition station. Every Saturday and Sunday night, Chen Twilight would come here to do three-hour short-term work.
Chen Twilight nodded slightly towards Xiao Hei, but his face was still a little woody.
For Chen Twilight's face, Xiao Hei had long been accustomed to it. When Chen Twilight came here to ask for a short-term job, Xiao Hei originally refused. This acquisition station has been managed by himself since his father, and when it comes to his hands, he has also been taking care of it himself.
However, when Chen Twilight said that he did not want wages, Xiao Hei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Twilight is still paid, and generally Chen Twilight will choose a few waste cards to take away as his wages.
Sometimes Chen Twilight would pick out a few unused energy cards from these waste heaps, and Xiao Hei calculated an account, and every month, the amount he saved on this was a large amount. It's just that for the taciturn Chen Twilight, he can't help but be a little curious, how does this guy know that there is still residual energy in these cards?
But since then, every time he saw Chen Twilight, he smiled.
Chen Twilight crouched down and began to sort the stacked waste cards. There are many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, skeuomorphic cards, and even some relatively rare plant cards and animal cards. However, the cards here are all useless without exception, and all Chen Twilight has to do is to classify these cards.
The work went quickly, and it was clear that he was very familiar with the work.
Chen Twilight flipped his wrist and threw a card towards Xiao Hei: "Hey, this card can still be used for a while." There was at least half of the energy in this two-star energy card, and Chen Twilight couldn't understand why the original owner of this card was so wasteful. The capacity of the two-star energy card is one thousand, that is, there are almost five hundred energy in it.
Xiao Hei looked at the two-star energy card in his hand, and his eyebrows smiled. The fart ran to the energy meter, inserted the card in, and when he saw the "523" number lit up on it, Xiao Hei smiled so that his facial features were almost squeezed.
Three years of production career have given him his own understanding of this most common and low-level card. There was not only one way to make one-star energy cards, and Chen Twilight had already collected twelve one-star energy cards of different structures from this.
These one-star energy cards with different structures gave Chen Twilight a great enlightenment, and it was precisely because he borrowed some of the skills of these cards that he successfully reduced the cost of making one-star energy cards to ninety-five Odi. However, such good luck does not come every day, and so far, he has only collected twelve.
Today's luck seems good, though.
Looking at the one-star energy card in his hand, judging from the texture on the surface, he was a one-star energy card that Chen Twilight had never encountered with another new structure.
He put the energy card aside and continued to rummage through it. The number of one-star energy cards was too much, but Chen Twilight took the trouble to check them one by one. His degree is extremely fast, and he can almost know if he wants it as long as his hand gently strokes over these one-star energy cards.
All this comes from his familiarity with one-star energy cards. This familiarity was left over from three years of uninterrupted production, and he didn't have to look at it, just by the feel of the hand, he could tell if the card was a one-star energy card or a structure he had seen. He was so familiar with them that every detail of them was concerned.
The fingers that skimmed over the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
Lin Che got up from the bed in a daze.
Her head was drowsy as if it was not her own, the luxurious sheets touched by the palm of her hand were not the old ones she usually washed, the lamp above her head, nor the half-broken energy-saving lamp style she was used to seeing, her body was painful as if it had just been torn by something, and when she raised her wrist, the bruises and purple marks on it were clear and obvious.
She covered her mouth, not wanting to let herself make a sound, lifted the quilt, and saw herself inside, and the scream almost burst out of her voice.
Lin Che's smart eyes dripped and spun around twice under his eyes, decisively lifted the quilt, got out of bed to pack up his messy clothes, put them on casually, and ran out without turning his head.
"Ahhh... Let go of me, you let go..." Lin Che struggled with his hands and feet.
The man's big hand pulled her neck and, effortlessly, directly dragged the person back to the bed.
His deep eyes seem to carry an innate pride, cold as frosty cheeks, the pen nose wing high on the fair face, white jade-like skin, making her, a woman who asks if her skin is good, feel envious and jealous.
She asked herself that there were many men she had seen, but those men who were called male gods suddenly became eclipsed in front of him.
Is that this man, who spent half a night yesterday tossing her half to death?
"Who sent you, you actually drugged me? You did this and thought you could get out of here intact? He looked at the stunned woman, anger flashing in his deep eyes.
This strange woman, with skin over snow, a pleasant face, a pair of big smart eyes, eyelashes fluttering, like a frightened deer, and not to be outdone, opened her eyes to force him.
Gu Jingze's gaze fixed on her, and he saw that Lin Che's eyes turned rapidly with his brain again.
However, she was lost in the wrong person.
The person in front of him, although handsome makes people feel dizzy, but it is obviously not the super first-line big star Gu Jingyu.
This time, she was rudely pulled by his arm again, and when she fell to the ground, she even rolled around in embarrassment before she froze again.
"You're mistaken, it's me who is badly damaged now." Her falling butt hurts, her hands hurt, and the pain below is even more impossible to ignore, annoyed, she directly shouted out, "What I want to obsessed with is someone else, and you have nothing to do with it, you think you are worth my drug, this aunt is not casual, you pay me back the medicine money!" ”
Lost in the wrong person?
Gu Jingze's cheeks were tight, his eyebrows were twisted into Sichuan characters, his dark eyes were like dormant beasts, staring at this woman with messy clothes, her white half-amputated shoulders were exposed, the bruises and red marks on it, clear eyes, on the white and tender skin seemed to be plum blossoms blooming.
The images of the night flashed in his mind again, and his lower abdomen suddenly became hot, and he felt the obvious heat surging in his body again.
Looked away from her face.
This damn woman dared to drug him, and the effect was still so strong.
His momentary opening allowed Lin Che to finally get a chance, and desperately jumped out of bed, and she pushed the man away hard.
She didn't dare to turn her head, so she quickly ran out.
Hearing him hiss, she shouted, "Look at what, see for yourself!" ”
"You..." Gu Jingze was just about to turn around and grab her, but he felt a burst of discomfort in his body, and the bottom was once again irrepressibly high.
"Damn it." He cursed and clenched his fists to suppress the damn **.
A series of voices came from outside.
Qin Hao looked back, and his mouth couldn't close in surprise.
What was the situation just now? Why did a woman in disheveled clothes run out of Mr. Wang's room?
He raised his sharp eyes, and his black eyes flashed with essence, making Qin Hao quickly swallow all the doubts that he should not have into his stomach.
Gu Jingze kept washing his body in the bathroom, until the skin on his body was washed pink, and then he scolded in the mirror, "****." ”
Gu Jingze was stunned, at this time, his mother actually came over, and he knew that it would not be a good thing when he thought about it.
When the bathroom door opened, the beautiful lady standing outside was looking at the mess full of beds in amazement.
The beds that had not yet had time to clean up were clearly telling everyone in front of them what had happened last night.
Gu Jingze's dark eyes were gloomy, and he pulled over the bathrobe with one hand and draped it over his honey-colored shoulders, "I know what you want to ask, but, mother, I'm very busy today." ”
How could Mu Wanqing not ask, the excitement on her face could not be concealed, looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed to the bed and said, "Jingze, I already know, you have a relationship with a girl." ”
Gu Jingze pushed open the door and said coldly to Mu Wanqing, "You don't care about this matter, okay?" ”
"How can I not care, Jingze, you have to marry her, you have to be responsible for other girls."
"Mother, I won't marry her, I'm not crazy, she's just a strange woman, I don't even know her name."
"Mother!" Gu Jingze stood there, his expression even more disturbed because he thought of that woman.
"Are you still thinking about that Mo Huiling? I tell you, it is impossible for you to be with her, you have been with her for so many years, you still can't touch her, you are simply not destined to be together! Mu Wanqing said unceremoniously.
"Mother, enough!" Gu Jingze wanted to interrupt Mu Wanqing.
But Mu Wanqing was very excited, "Jingze, you know your illness, you can't touch a woman at all, the family is almost ready for artificial insemination to let you get a child, but you touched a woman today, which means that she is the most suitable object for you!" ”
Taoist famous mountain Qingcheng, since ancient times, there have been countless strange people in and out, the so-called grass reckless hidden dragon snake, exactly like this.
Countless myths and legends, countless legendary stories, like a thick cloud mist, cast a veil of mystery over Qingcheng.
The morning sun was slightly dewy, and on the stone path between the mountains, groups of Tsing Yi Daoists held three long incense plants, quietly and quickly marched on the path, towards a towering stone wall in the back mountain, smooth as a mirror.
The mountain path is steep and the dew is slippery, but these Taoists quickly overtake the galloping horses and bring up the blue shadows. Some people jumped up from time to time, the wind flew across a hundred meters, the morning breeze blew, and the clothes flew, and the fluttering momentum was as straight as a fairy.
In the mountains of Qingcheng Mountain, the peaks, and the major palaces and pavilions, there are Taoists who continue to walk out and gather in front of this nameless stone wall.
Among them, there were a large group of small Taoist priests holding various flags and magic weapons, carrying incense burners around the Nine Palaces Array. The cigarette soared into the sky, and the qi wrapped upwards, turning into a cloud covering the heads of the roads.
In front of many Taoists, just below the stone wall, a group of Daoists wearing gold-rimmed purple Daoist robes, with a silver thread embroidered with a gossip map on the chest and chest, and the edges of the sleeves of the robe have more cloudy patterns and grass patterns, and the gorgeous and matchless Daoists around their bodies are holding a whisk in their hands, and their faces are standing there solemnly.
The group of Daoists waited quietly for a while, and when a red light in the east suddenly jumped, and the red light instantly tore open the heavens and the earth and spread all over the world, many Daoists bowed down in unison, and reverently performed the three kneeling and nine bowing salutes towards the stone wall.
Thousands of people chanted mantras at the same time, and the sound of 'buzzing' incantations became entangled, turning into a subtle sound that made people tremble and spread far away. Gradually, a strange power rose from the sound of the incantation, and a bright colorful light shot out from the top of the heads of many Daoists, shining on the smooth and smooth stone wall.
The Taoists in gold-rimmed purple robes prostrated themselves to the ground at the same time, muttering a prayer in their mouths.
If it lasted for half an hour, a white light finally shot out from the top of the stone wall, and soon the entire stone wall emitted a clear white light.
The smoke rose into the sky, and there were countless clouds of smoke entangled in the stone wall, and several shadows with golden light appeared in the clouds and smoke. The figures became clearer and clearer, and finally three men, two women, and five Daoists wearing white Daoist robes, their faces were blocked by golden light, and they couldn't see clearly, appeared in front of everyone.
The woman in the center looked down at the many Daoists kneeling in front of the stone wall, and suddenly had an extra scroll in her hand and threw it out casually.
A white light flashed on the stone wall, and the scroll woven of purple jade and gold silk slowly floated out, and it fell on the purple-robed old Daoist who led many Daoists to bow down in the front. The woman who threw out the scroll whispered a few words, turned around and left with a few companions around her.
Several purple-robed elders suddenly shouted: "Ancestral mercy, mercy!" ”
The sound of 'knock' continued to sound, and all the Daoists kowtowed heavily to the five men and women, and their brains slammed into a rocky sound.
The woman who threw out the scroll drank coldly, and suddenly all the Daoists knelt stiffly on the ground, not daring to make more movement sounds.
Instead, the other woman beside the woman laughed lowly a few times, and threw a few things out of her backhand.
The stone wall dimmed, and the five Daoists disappeared without a trace.
Several things shining with strange light slowly fell from the air, namely a sword, a bead, a small ding, five talismans, and nine medicine bottles.
The sword, beads, and small dings are tiny and like children's playthings, but each one is a dazzling light and smoke, and it is obviously an extraordinary thing.
The five talismans were even more entwined with golden light and purple qi, and if there was a wave of pressure pouring out of the talismans, those Daoists who were slightly closer were unstable on their feet, and they were pushed back by this force.
The nine medicine bottles were densely engraved with various colored talismans and seals. The old Dao who had just taken the scroll opened one of the medicine bottles in front of many Daoists, and a quiet medicine box suddenly gushed out, and thousands of Dao people in front of the stone wall took a deep breath at the same time, and they felt that the seven tips were smooth, and the meridians all over their bodies seemed to have been washed by clear water, and their whole bodies were open.
Just smelling a wisp of medicinal fragrance was better than these Daoists' three months of hard work. The purple-robed old man hurriedly sealed the medicine bottle tightly and strongly. Just the aroma emitted by the elixir has such a miraculous effect, you can imagine what a treasure the elixir in this medicine bottle is.
Several purple-robed elders gathered together and muttered in a low voice, putting away the sword, bead, ding, talisman and medicine bottle respectively, and then unfolding the scroll in front of all the Dao.
The first half of the scroll is a scripture for practicing qi and nourishing the gods, the Tai Void Qi Sutra. The second half of the scroll made the purple-robed elders lose their faces, and they all shouted in horror. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Daoists in Qingcheng Mountain swarmed out.
The latent forces of Qingcheng Mountain in the secular world were fully launched, setting off invisible waves.
Chapter 1
In the scorching summer of July, the asphalt road emits a pungent smell of paint under the scorching sun, and it looks like it is about to melt.
The sky over the road surface is directly distorted and skewed because of the transpiring air.
Under such a poisonous sun, there are almost no pedestrians on the street, even few cars, and everyone is looking for a shady place to escape the heat or enjoy the blessings in an air-conditioned room.
A woman wearing a washed white shirt and gray suit pants hurriedly walked towards the Second People's Hospital.
The hair was tightly glued to the woman's face because of sweat, and the woman's cheeks had an abnormal redness, which was obviously damaged by the sun.
The white shirt was wet with the sweat on his body, and it felt very uncomfortable to stick to his body, but Qiao Nan had no time to take care of this, and grabbed the bag with 100,000 yuan tightly.
This is the money she managed to get by selling all the valuable things around her, her sister costs 200,000 yuan for surgery, and there are 100,000 more to find a way.
Walking straight towards the ward, Qiao Nan's hand touched the door, and he heard the conversation between the mother and daughter in the ward.
"Mom, it's all Qiao Nan's harm, if it weren't for her, the army wouldn't have divorced me." This is the voice of Qiao Nan's sister Qiao Zigen.
"Don't cry, mom has already taught you Qiao Nan." Mother Ding Jiayi touched her eldest daughter's head distressedly.
Qiao Nan, who was standing outside, felt in her heart, her sister was not caught by Chen Jun because of cheating, Chen Jun would leave with her sister, but what did this matter have to do with her?
Thinking of Chen Jun, Qiao Nan's eyes were gloomy.
Chen Jun was originally Qiao Nan's boyfriend, but Qiao Ziyi was pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child, Ding Jiayi scolded Qiao Nan bitterly, saying that Qiao Nan harbored bad intentions, and was a little beast with no conscience who robbed her boyfriend with her sister, and forced her own sister to have an abortion.
In the end, Qiao Nan only withdrew and completed Chen Jun and his sister.
"Mom, the army divorced me, the child is not by my side, I have this disease again, what should I do? Mom, I don't want to die, I haven't been filial to you yet, I really don't want to die. ”
In the ward, Qiao Ziyi held Ding Jiayi and cried hard, she was still so young and had a lot of good days, she really didn't want to die.
Hearing that her eldest daughter was so seriously ill, and she thought about being filial to herself in the future, Ding Jiayi was moved.
Ding Jiayi coaxed and patted Qiao Ziyi's back: "No, my mother will definitely not let you have trouble." Mom has already gone to raise money for you because of Qiao Nan's dead girl. “
Not long after Qiao Ziyun divorced Chen Jun, he suffered from kidney failure and had to replace his kidney immediately.
But in this marriage relationship, Qiao Ziyun's cheating was the wrong party, plus Chen Jun was also a government worker, Qiao Ziyun was cleaned out of the house, and now he is sick and does not even have the money to see a doctor and take medicine.
Qiao Nan, who had long known that her mother was biased, couldn't help but feel pain in her already numb heart after hearing this conversation.
She is forty years old, and after breaking up with Chen Jun that year, she has never been in love again, not because she doesn't want to talk, but because her mother won't let her talk.
Over the years, most of the money she earned went to her mother, who used the money she earned to buy her sister a 150-square-meter suite, but she could only nest in a rental house of only a few dozen square meters.
She paid for the food and even the utilities at her parents' house, and every time her sister returned to her mother's house, although she came with some things in her hand, she carried more when she went back.
She is not married at this age, and she is laughed at that no one wants leftover women, Qiao Nan does not know that her mother does not let her get married, but just wants her salary.
But this is her own mother, every time she falls in love on a blind date, her mother will make a fuss and seek life, and she can't help.
His hard work over the years, in the end, only exchanged for the three words "dead girl", especially Qiao Ziyun also pushed the responsibility for his cheating and divorce onto himself, Qiao Nan grabbed the 100,000 yuan in his hand, and suddenly didn't want to give Qiao Ziyun.
Before Qiao Nan left, the conversation that Qiao Nan heard next really made Qiao Nan despair.
What if Qiao Nan raised 200,000 but couldn't find the ****? In fact, the doctor said that if a relative is willing to donate a kidney to me, the matching degree will be higher and it will not be easy to rejection. ”
Leaning into Ding Jiayi's arms, Qiao Ziyi said pitifully: "If I really have a relative's ***, maybe I can save a little money for medical treatment." ”
**How can it be so easy to find, some people can't wait for such an opportunity until they die!
Knowing this well, Qiao Ziyun knew that if she wanted to survive, it was not enough to have money, and she had to think of another way.
"How about mom go for a blood test?" Ding Jiayi asked with some hesitation.
Qiao Ziyun shook her head repeatedly, her mother is this age, her kidney is definitely not better than her, since she wants it, she must have a good one: "Mom, you are the mother who gave birth to me and raised me, I can't bear you to use a knife, my father definitely can't do it." ”
"Then..." Ding Jiayi thought for a while, and her eyes lit up: "Wait for the dead girl to come, I'll let her go for a blood test, she is your own sister, it must be together!" ”
"Good is good, but will Qiao Nan not agree, after all, this is a kidney." Qiao Zigen's eyes were full of calculating light.
In order to survive, just in case, she would definitely not let Qiao Nan have the possibility of refusing.
"Miss Qiao, come to see your sister, why don't you go in?" Qiao Ziyi chatted with Ding Jiayi to the side, and there was a nurse's voice outside the door.
Qiao Zigen's face changed drastically: "Mom..." The conversation she had with her mother just now was all listened to by {Qiao Nan's dead girl?
Ding Jiayi didn't say a word, got up and chased out, and sure enough saw Qiao Nan's back, and then shouted Qiao Nan's name.
When Qiao Nan heard Ding Jiayi's shout, he refused to turn back or stop, tears kept falling, but his heart was broken into pieces.
For her mother, her sister, she doesn't even have a home of her own, but her mother and her sister, who calculated that her money was not enough, and now they still want her kidney.
Qiao Ziyi's words, Ding Jiayi did not understand, but Qiao Nan understood, the more so, the more Qiao Nan hated, even if she really owed the Qiao family, it should be enough!
Qiao Nan's head hurt, and she wanted to tell her mother that this was dangerous on the street, and a car rushed towards her.
"Squeak", "Bang", two loud bangs exploded her ears, Qiao Nan was so painful that she couldn't speak, but she still barely opened her eyes, wanting to see how her mother was.
Ding Jiayi was indeed frightened, and when she saw her little daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over, and then muttered: "Qiao Nan, it's good that you, you are dead, at least you can help your sister when you die." Zi Guan's kidney is there, and so is the money! ”
The little daughter was hit and killed, and the person who hit the little daughter will definitely lose money.
Hearing Ding Jiayi's words, Qiao Nan's eyes widened, staring at Ding Jiayi deadly, not waiting for the ambulance personnel to arrive, he couldn't stop being killed by Ding Jiayi alive!
Chapter 1
There is nothing more painful in the world than fantasizing about heaven one moment and finding yourself in hell the next.
Mo Wen is such a person, two months ago he was still sitting in the classroom, fantasizing about being admitted to Xinyi's key university, but at this time he was doing small work on the construction site in the hot sun.
Remembering his tragic experience, Mo Wen spat on the ground fiercely, raised his hand and wiped the sweat that kept flowing on his face. I had just finished moving a cart of bricks, and I was already sweating.
Mo asked, a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy, with an ordinary face, dark skin, a lean body, and a pair of somewhat calm eyes. Perhaps the children of poor families are already in charge, and he is not old enough to make people look a little young.
Putting the cement truck carrying the bricks in his hand to the side of the road, Mo Wen found a shady place and sat down, at this time the foreman was not there, but it was a good time to be lazy. On a boring and busy construction site, it is very happy to be lazy for a while.
He sat on a cement slab, his eyes constantly roaming the road, and soon his eyes lit up; A graceful figure walked out across the road, which immediately attracted his attention.
Although the distance is very far away, you can't see the other person's face, but the figure is absolutely attractive, especially the walking posture is very elegant, like a professionally trained model.
Don't look at just women walking, but there is a lot of learning in it. And Mo Wen stayed on the construction site, opposite the road and sidewalk.
As if remembering something, he pulled out a cyan metal disc from the clothes on his chest, only the size of a coin, tied by a small cyan iron chain, like a strange necklace.
This object was also something that Mo Wen accidentally found when demolishing an ancient house a few days ago, when he found an ancient green brick in a wall, which was pitted and dilapidated, and it was estimated to be a hundred years old.
If it is another century-old antique, I am afraid it can still be worth a little money, but a green brick, even if it is an antique, I am afraid it is not worth anything at all.
At that time, Mo Wen casually threw the green brick on the ground, but he didn't want the green brick to break off and a piece of metal jewelry fell out of it, which was the strange necklace in Mo Wen's hand.
The cyan metal disc was a little strange, divided into eight areas from the surface of the disk, and various strange runes were carved on it.
Mo Wen is not familiar with antiquities, but he can also see that the thing in his hand should be a miniature version of the Bagua Disk, and ordinary people will hang the Bagua Tray at home to avoid evil and worship it as a magic weapon.
Although he is not superstitious and does not believe that the gossip disk can have any ability to avoid evil, he also knows that this ancient gossip disk should be worth a lot, maybe it is still an antique, if it is sold to an antique dealer, it is likely to become rich overnight.
Mo Wen's eyes were full of longing, stroking the gossip necklace as if he was stroking his lover. Once he became rich, those big beauties who used to only dare to peek from a distance and secretly swallow their saliva are not allowed to be picked by him.
"Something happened. Something went wrong! ”
"Something happened! Call an ambulance. ”
A noisy shout sounded from not far away, and then many people ran towards that place, and the shouting also interrupted Mo Wen's sweet dream.
He glanced over there suspiciously, hesitated, but stood up and ran towards the place where the crowd gathered over there.
His gaze swept and he jumped in front of him. A middle-aged man who was nearly fifty years old and dressed in rags lay on the ground and kept convulsing, his face was pale, he was breathing heavily, and his hands were tightly covering his chest, which seemed to be very painful.
From his eyes, filled with deep fear, it seemed that death was felt.
Many workers arrived, but no one dared to step forward, and a group of workers with little education obviously did not know what was happening and did not dare to take action rashly.
"Acute myocardial infarction!"
Mo Wen's face changed slightly, and he looked at Lao Zhang who was twitching on the ground with some ugliness. He recognized Lao Zhang's illness at a glance, because someone in the village had a sudden acute myocardial infarction and died in just a few minutes, and he witnessed the whole process with his own eyes.
His village is very remote, there are basically no professional doctors in the village, usually if he has a disease, he is simply treated with the earthworks handed down from his ancestors, and there is no targeted treatment at all.
His mother was weak and sick, and there was no doctor in the village, and his biggest dream was to be admitted to the most famous medical university in China, and become a doctor to treat his mother and the villagers in the future.
It is a pity that he failed the college entrance examination, and he could have been admitted to the Medical Department of Huaxia University with his score, and he could get the qualification for free admission, but he was replaced by a powerful son brother in the family, and his score was obviously lower than him, but he squeezed him down.
Although he could still be admitted to other good schools with his grades, the high tuition fees were something he could not afford at all, so in order not to burden his mother, he had to give up his studies and start working to earn money.
The site, a marginal development area of the city, is far from the city and the nearest hospital ambulance takes 25 minutes to arrive. But depending on the appearance of the patient, whether you can stick to 25 minutes or two things. Hold on for 25 minutes? That's nothing short of miraculous!
This person he knew, lived in the same shed as him, named Zhang Laoshi, usually everyone called him Lao Zhang, an honest and honest person, because he had no skills, he could only do the lowest level of small work on the construction site like him.
It is said that he also has a son who is in college, and he worked so hard to earn money to provide for his son's college education.
Mo Wen looked at Lao Zhang, a worker on the ground, with some hesitation, his dream is to become a doctor, he has a certain understanding of some simple and common pathologies, and for acute myocardial infarction, he knows that there are several first aid measures that can alleviate the condition.
But this year, who dares to save people casually? It is naturally a good thing to be able to save well, but in case of saving a bad person, the patient has three long and two short, and the responsibility will probably be buckled on his head.
However, society is so realistic, perhaps simply taking some emergency measures to alleviate the disease and prolong the time of death can save a life. But Mo Wen, like everyone else around him, did not dare to rush forward to help.
Taking a deep breath, he was slightly silent for a while, and finally sighed and stepped towards Lao Zhang, who was ill. He is not a rotten good person, but Lao Zhang has a good relationship with him, they are all poor rural people who came out to work, deeply understand each other's difficulties, Lao Zhang is the pillar of the whole family, watching Lao Zhang die, his conscience cannot do it.
"Don't move him, I'm a doctor."
A graceful figure came from afar, all the way through the chaotic construction site, trotting to the scene of the incident.
Mo Wen was slightly stunned, subconsciously stopped, a gust of fragrant wind hit, and there was an additional graceful figure in front of him.
It was a girl, with a beautiful face and a tall figure, only half a head shorter than Mo Wen, wearing an off-white floral dress, the hem of which fell at the crook of her legs, revealing a pair of slender and fair calves. All the way to the end, the dress fluttered, Chu Chu moving.
Mo Wen's eyes couldn't help but be stunned, he squatted on the construction site every day to peek at the young girls passing by, but it was the first time he saw such a beautiful girl! A beautiful plain face that was naturally carved kept echoing in his mind! No powder, but amazing.
He found that the girl in the white dress was the same woman who he had quietly lusted over the other person's body across the road before. Now I know that people are not only in good shape, but also surprisingly beautiful faces.
The girl ignored Mo Qing and squatted down directly to check Lao Zhang's condition, and soon her beautiful face changed, and it seemed that the situation was somewhat grim.
Mo Wen also knew that the patient was in shock at this time, and the situation was not optimistic.
"Can you help me?"
The girl raised her head and glanced at Mo Qian anxiously, at this time, Mo Wen was closest to the patient, and naturally found him for the first time.
"Yes!"
Mo Wen was slightly stunned, he didn't expect the girl to ask him for help, but he quickly reacted and hurriedly walked to the girl's side.
"Can you help me level his body and lift his legs slightly?" The girl asked Mo while carefully squeezing Lao Zhang's outer chest.
Mo Wen knew some ways to relieve myocardial infarction, and soon did as the girl said. He knew that the girl's approach was correct, that lifting the patient's legs was to prevent the shock patient's brain from being deprived of oxygen, and that this was the best solution now without equipment such as oxygen tanks.
He suddenly found that his chest was a little hot and getting hotter and hotter, as if a red-hot piece of iron was sticking to his chest. His face changed slightly, and he subconsciously touched his chest and found that it was the gossip plate excavated from the cyan ancient brick.
An Lin stood at the top of the tall building, facing the noisy wind.
The wind howled, and the weightlessness of falling sharply, even though he was already unloved, was still screamed in fear. "Help!!!"
The fear that death was coming enveloped his body, making every part of his body tremble.
At this moment, An Lin's whole body was suddenly wrapped in a mysterious white light mass.
The terrible feeling of being overweight also came at this moment, and he felt like he was riding a roller coaster, rushing to the bottom, and then going around an arc and flying into the sky.
An Lin's screams continued, and his body flew into the sky before landing on the roof again.
The incomparably intense overweight and weightlessness, as well as the feeling of alternation between life and death, made An Lin feel dizzy in his head, and then vomited without fighting.
"Hey, boy, is it better?" At this moment, an ethereal voice reached An Lin's ears.
He looked up and saw an old man looking at him lovingly.
The old man had white hair, fairy wind Dao bones, and golden fairy qi lingering all over his body, looking holy and flawless.
Seeing this scene, An Lin's whole body was shocked, and countless plots surged into his heart.
All kinds of plots began to surface in An Lin's mind, and the beginning of all dreams was not the scene in front of him!
Poof!
An Lin kowtowed heavily and said with tears in his eyes: "Immortal, thank you for saving me!" ”
The old man who was called an immortal by An Lin stroked his white beard and smiled slightly: "Young man, you are in your prime of life, why do you choose suicide?" ”
"My mother died early, and my father was addicted to gambling." "After my father gambled the house away, he owed millions of gambling debts and couldn't pay them, and then ran away alone!"
"Millions! What do I take to pay back? ”
"Then I was forced to drop out of school and work as a coolie for creditors."
An Lin poured out tears with a handful of snot, only to feel that his life was gray. What is the difference between a life that has been paying off debts all your life and salted fish, it is better to reincarnate early.
After listening to An Lin's experience, the immortal also had a sympathetic look in his eyes, and he slowly spoke: "Young man, your life is really bitter... In this way, you and I meet for a fate, and I see that you have excellent qualifications, so it is better to let Benxian send you a set of 'systems' and let you change your life." ”
An Lin trembled when he heard this, he thought that it was a great fortune to be able to form an immortal relationship with the immortals, but he didn't expect the immortals to be so generous, and they actually sent the system as soon as they met!
"Woo hoo, Grandpa Immortal, you're really nice to me! I really don't know how to repay you! ”
The immortal smiled lovingly, his palm turned to the sky, and then a pure white ball of light appeared in his palm.
"Young man, come over and hold this ball of light in the palm of your hand." The immortal said to An Lin.
Hearing this, An Lin was excited, and couldn't wait to hold the ball of light.
The ball of light in his hand emitted a trace of warm current, and the light revealed in the ball was extremely soft.
"Initiate System Migration." The immortal said slowly.
As soon as the words of the immortals fell, the light on the white ball of light flourished!
At this moment, the immortal said to An Lin: "Young man, you swear quickly, swear to accept this God of War system, and never give up for the rest of your life!" ”
God of War system?
What a domineering name!
But how does this vow look like a marriage declaration?
Without having time to think about it, An Lin hurriedly said: "I swear, accept the God of War system, and never give up for the rest of my life!" ”
As soon as An Lin's oath was finished, the ball of light swooped and crashed directly into his body and merged with him.
Immediately afterwards, a voice sounded in his mind: "The detection host is the physique of the Heavenly Nether Dao, meets the qualifications, and the system begins to fuse!" ”
An Lin was so excited that he wanted to cry.
I originally thought that my life was gray, but I didn't expect that the peak turned around, and I ushered in the life of the open hanging system at this moment!
The immortals were also very excited, and they were so excited that they were already crying!
"Grandpa Immortal, what's wrong with you, are you okay?" Seeing the old man's strange behavior, An Lin asked curiously.
The immortal came back to his senses and wiped his tears, knowing that he had gaffed.
"Young man, after getting the system, you have to cheer well." The immortal language said seriously.
"Hmm! I will! An Lin nodded heavily.
"So, do you want to go to school to cultivate immortals?" The immortal then asked.
Going to school to cultivate immortals? Only a fool will refuse, okay!
"Yes, I especially want to cultivate immortals!"
An Lin almost didn't think about it, so he opened his mouth and replied. The immortal smiled gratifyingly, took out a golden piece of paper and handed it to An Lin, and then said: "This is my letter of recommendation, with it, you can go to study at the Immortal Cultivation Union University and officially embark on the road of Immortal Cultivation." ”
An Lin was shocked in his heart, daring to love this dragon proud heavenly path of cultivating immortals, and the immortals had paved for themselves!
He solemnly accepted the letter of recommendation given to him by the immortal and looked at the immortal with a grateful face.
An Lin was very curious about this immortal who had given him a new life.
"What's the name... Let's not talk about it. The immortal caressed the top of An Lin's head with a sympathetic look on his face.
"I have to go, goodbye lad."
The immortal said goodbye to An Lin, and then flew away through the clouds.
"Immortal, you go slowly!" An Lin bowed gratefully to the immortals who flew into the sky.
There was the laughter of the immortals in the sky, and the laughter was incomparably cheerful and wanton, as if it poured out the grievances of a lifetime.
Why is this immortal so happy, how can he feel happier than me?
An Lin looked puzzled.
At this moment, a female voice sounded in An Lin's consciousness: "Hello. ”
This female voice is beautiful and beautiful, like a heavenly sound, and An Lin is full of cleverness when she hears it.
Is this the sound of the system?
An Lin was shocked.
At this moment, an interface appeared in An Lin's mind.
The interface is gray, and only a few words are displayed on it: the function of the God of War system will be activated after entering the Primordial Continent.
What the hell is the Taichu Continent?
An Lin thought of the letter of recommendation given by the immortal, and he spread out the golden paper in his hand with anticipation.
Then he found that there was nothing inside the golden paper, only a slightly dented handprint.
An Lin was a little confused, but he still put his hand on the paper, coinciding with the handprint.
Suddenly, the paper was full of golden light, and An Lin only had time to "heh" in surprise, and was completely swallowed by that golden light.
An Lin only felt that the sky was spinning for a while, and his vision changed from pitch black to bright again.
Then he found that his body appeared high in the air again and began to land freely.
An Lin once again experienced the feeling of jumping off the building, and no matter how many times the sourness came, he wanted to shed tears.
An Lin raised his head with some difficulty, and then saw a scene that he would never forget.
Two hundred-zhang-tall white dragon gate pillars stood between the sky, and the plaque was engraved with mysterious characters that he could not understand.
Behind the gates, there are thousands of palaces, and there is no end in sight.
Colorful clouds floated around the palace, and various spirit beasts soared between heaven and earth, creating a magnificent immortal atmosphere.
An Lin stood in place, his face full of shock.
It turns out that in this world, there is really a fairyland!
An Lin struggled to calm his emotions and calm himself down.
After a while, he saw a woman wearing a Taoist robe approaching and hurriedly went up to say hello.
"Hello, Fairy Sister." An Lin beckoned to the woman.
The beautiful woman saw An Lin waving to her and walked over.
Seeing this, An Lin asked a little excitedly: "This beautiful fairy sister, may I ask what place is here, I am new to this place, and I don't know much about this place." ”
Hearing An Lin's words, the woman looked a little strange, and then said: "Purr? ”
"Ah, what did you say?" An Lin was a little puzzled.
The woman showed the same expression as An Lin and spoke, "Dingli Woooo ”
An Lin was blindsided at this moment, and a terrible conjecture appeared in his mind.
"Fairy sister, can you speak Mandarin?" An Lin's eyes were a little moist.
"Purr, gurgler?" The beautiful woman crossed her hands at her waist, a little angry.
It's over, the language is not comprehensible.
What the hell was she talking about? I don't understand it at all!
！ Nani? Finally, An Lin cried.
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
On one platform, hundreds of people gathered around screaming and cheering, surrounded by dozens of cars, most of them supercars.
The most eye-catching convenience is the two cars that are about to start.
One is the most expensive bright red Ferrari 488, worth more than four million, and the one next to it is the cheapest Ford Mustang in the field, worth half a million, and the two cars together form a sharp contrast.
This is a duel between Liu Feng, a new young man in Shangjing, and Zhang Han, one of the first four young men.
At the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han silently leaned against the car door, his clothes were scruffy, his hair was very long, his bangs covered his eyes when he lowered his head, people could not see his closed eyes, from the lower half of his cheeks carved by the knife, you can still vaguely see Zhang Dashao's unique handsomeness, but now his temperament has become full of decadence.
And Liu Feng, in the crowd on the right, was like the stars holding the moon, and his expression seemed to say that the world was under his feet.
"Let's go and see Zhang Dashao, who used to be high."
Liu Feng waved his hand, and a sneer hung at the corner of his mouth and took the lead to walk over.
"Zhang Dashao?"
"Asleep? Zhang Dashao, who was invincible before, is now down like this, gee, it's time to start the game, what kind of coldness ah my Zhang Dashao! ”
"He looks like this now, I think he is a poor man who wants to eat!"
"No, I see that he is not even as good as asking for food, maybe he lives by eating pig food."
On the side of the Ford Mustang, stood a chubby man with glasses, and there was a three- or four-year-old girl on his leg.
The little girl is long pink and jade, wearing a white dress, her delicate little face is like a cute princess in a fairy tale, except for her hair is a little messy, everything else is perfect, but at this time, the little girl's clear big eyes contain tears of grievance, listening to everyone's counting of Zhang Han, she seems to be about to cry.
If it is placed in normal times, it is estimated that the cute appearance of the little girl will attract a lot of attention, but now, this is Liu Feng's performance time alone.
A burst of mockery and invective finally made Zhang Han have a reaction.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes, there was a dazed look in his eyes, and when he saw the behavior of the people in front of him, his eyes were full of contempt for the world.
"Wait for the ants to dare to bark in front of this deity?"
Such an inexplicable sentence suddenly burst out of Zhang Han's mouth.
The audience was silent, but the next moment, a sarcastic laughter sounded.
"Zhang Han, I think you're crazy, right?"
"I'm afraid I've become a fool."
Everyone mocked again, but when Zhang Han saw the picture in front of him, he was stunned.
"Isn't this when I was racing with Liu Feng in '09?"
"Why am I here?"
"Am I not crossing the heavenly calamity?"
"Is it..... I am back? ”
"I was reborn by the Nine Heavenly Tribulation Divine Thunder?" A tremor flashed in Zhang Han's eyes.
Zhang Han's memory is that five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight major families in Shangjing, and Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at that time, so Zhang Hantian was not afraid, but once when the family traveled by plane, they were crashed halfway, their parents and sister were killed, and the second uncle Zhang Ming served as the head of the family, but it did not prevent the loneliness of the Zhang family.
Zhang Han was devastated at that time, thinking that his family was killed, and began to privately investigate Zhang Ming, who had always hated his father, but was discovered by him, plus Zhang Han had offended many people before, and was finally expelled from the Zhang family.
It has been five years now, Zhang Han refuses to leave, has always wanted to find out the matter, the life is very bitter, but he has always insisted, until this wolf walking incident.
I remember that when I was racing in this wolf walking mountain, I was seriously injured in an accident, lost both arms, survived for five years and finally jumped off a cliff to commit suicide, but I didn't expect to accidentally enter the world of cultivation. Beginning to contact the immortal cultivators, Zhang Han awakened the talent - smell the treasure nose, and his own nose can smell the treasure breath within a certain range.
With this magical power, in five hundred years, Zhang Han abruptly used all kinds of treasures to pile up cultivation to the extreme,
"Why not five years ago?"
Zhang Han's expression raised a hint of loneliness.
Not fulfilling filial piety has always been the biggest regret in Zhang Han's heart, before his relatives left, he was young and frivolous and did not understand things, caused a lot of trouble for his father, and said a lot of words that made his mother sad, all of which could not be recovered no matter how regretful.
Although Zhang Han was rebellious at the beginning, his love for his parents was no less than that of others.
The tree wants to be quiet but the wind does not stop, and the child wants to be nurtured and does not wait.
"Zhang Han!"
A gloomy voice interrupted Zhang Han's musings, looked up, and saw Liu Feng looking at him coldly.
"You kicked me out of the capital five years ago!
Today, five years later, my Los Angeles car king Liu Feng has returned strongly, but you Zhang Han is not as good as a pig and dog! Remember, today I Liu Summit let you Zhang Han out of the capital sideways! ”
"Oh, so powerful?" Zhang Han refused in surprise: "Then I don't compare." ”
"Zhang Han!"
Liu Feng shook the Ferrari car keys in his hand and said, "As long as you win me, this car is yours." "Then I'll be embarrassed."
Zhang Han said with a smile.
"Huh."
Liu Feng sneered, raised his hand and instructed: "Set up the screen!" ”
As soon as the words fell, everyone behind them set up several TV screens, and at the same time remote control aircraft were also raised all over Wolf Walking Mountain, turning on the screens, and the cameras on the remote control aircraft were transmitted back one by one, reflecting the entire track of Wolf Walking Mountain.
"Ready to start!"
Liu Feng nodded secretly to the fat man with glasses behind the Ford Mustang and sat in the Ferrari.
"Daddy, Come on, Beat the bad guys."
"It's quite cute, how can you call someone daddy casually?"
Zhang Han shook his head funny.
"Brother Han, you will definitely win!"
The fat man shook his fist at Zhang Han and made an encouraging look.
"Borrow your words, your car will bring me good luck."
Zhang Han glanced at him lightly and sat sideways in the wild carriage.
"Ready!"
The engines of both cars roared angrily at the same time.
Inside the Ferrari, Liu Feng's mouth hung a smug smile.
The fat man on the back leaked a meaningful smile.
The lovely princess at his feet was full of fear and worry in her eyes, her eyes were filled with tears, and she was pitiful.
And Zhang Han in the wild horse carriage had a sneer on the corner of his mouth.
"Collusion to harm me?"
"It's a pity, I'm not who I used to be." "Even if there is no cultivation now, how can Er wait for the ants to provoke?"
Chapter I
Rust Lake.
Federal Special Waste Treatment Plant No. 23.
Also known as the "Tomb of the Dharma".
With the continuous development of the cultivation civilization, the magic weapon that used to be high and driven only by the cultivator has entered thousands of households, and has become an indispensable tool for ordinary people to travel at home, study and work.
While bringing convenience to life, it also produces a large number of scrapped magic weapons and metal waste.
Most of these garbage magic weapons have a lot of spiritual power remaining, which is easy to cause radiation pollution, and the talisman array for building magic weapons is extremely unstable, and there is even a risk of explosion, if left unchecked, it will cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the Federation, there are always several "special waste disposal sites" dedicated to dealing with scrapped magic weapons.
The No. 23 Special Waste Treatment Site is located in the southern suburbs of the federal cultivation town "Fugo City".
Under the dim yellow sky, a swamp polluted into purple emits a rich stench, the mountain peak composed of metal fragments is like hundreds of dinosaurs peeking out of the swamp, the mountain peak is full of fragmented flying swords, next to the flying sword sits a rusty spar puppet, the empty eye socket has long extinguished the spiritual fire, only the small insects that feed on spiritual energy poke their heads out from the inside, carefully looking at this dangerous "magic weapon cemetery".
"Boom!"
Countless metal components scattered like flowers of the goddess, scattered and splashed, and caused the serial collapse of several surrounding garbage mountains, raising smoke and dust in the sky, like demons dancing, covering the entire sky.
It seems that this is a forbidden area of life, and only insignificant cockroaches and worms use this place as a paradise.
Li Yao lurked behind a garbage mountain, licking his chapped lips, and the earthy yellow trench coat was full of dust, making him one with the environment.
Glancing at the rising explosive cloud not far away, the young man's clear eyes did not show the slightest emotion, and he was unhappy.
It was only when dirt and metal fragments splashed into the mountain of garbage where he was hiding that he shrunk slightly deeper into the garbage heap and put on goggles large enough to cover half of his face.
"Here it comes!"
At 3:52:38 p.m., the daily routine garbage dumping time is also the carnival moment of Li Yao's "garbage bug"!
The Lingzi watch worn on his left wrist was a hunting model launched by the cultivation sect "Flying Spirit Sect" three years ago, and it took him two months to repair after he picked it up in the garbage mountain.
In addition to timing, it also has a very powerful function that can record vibrations of a special frequency and notify the owner when a specific vibration is heard nearby.
This function was originally used to alert the hunter that there may be powerful monsters nearby.
After Li Yao's modification, it became a reminder that the garbage ship was about to appear.
A moment later, accompanied by a faint hum, a dozen black dots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time, the smoke and dust brought by the explosion have not yet dispersed, and more than a dozen small black dots are mixed in, and it is not clear at all.
Li Yao shrugged the tip of his nose, his finger touched a rune on the side of the goggles, "Oh", the surface of the goggles was blood-red.
Under the scanning of the red light, the garbage ship hidden behind the smoke and dust was outlined as a round figure, which was clear.
And the hunting function of the Reiko watch also firmly locks the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
"Garbage ship 1327, it's you!"
From birth to ten years old, Li Yao has been staying in the tomb of the magic treasure for ten years, and knows every inch of the land here and every garbage ship in the sky, this "garbage ship No. 1327" is specially responsible for collecting garbage from the "Upper East Side" in Fugo City.
The Upper East Side is the most luxurious and wealthy area in the city, where many cultivators live, and the magic weapons they discard are also the most valuable.
Many magic weapons are even intact, but because they are slightly old, or a new generation of products have been launched, they are discarded by cultivators and rich people without care.
For Li Yao, what kind of garbage ship is this, it is simply a treasure ship full of gold mines!
"Swoosh!"
Li Yao exerted his strength on both feet, shot out like a projectile, galloped wildly between the garbage mountains, rushed towards the smoke, and rushed to the "garbage ship No. 1327"!
Surrounded by crumbling garbage mountains, under the feet is "purring" bubbling poisonous swamp, but Li Yao is like the most dexterous monkey in the mountain forest, from time to time in a certain protruding part of the garbage mountain, each pedal can pop out tens of meters away, the action is cloudy and flowing, pleasing to the eye.
"Li Yao, you bastard, grabbing food with Lao Tzu again!"
At this moment, more than a dozen figures emerged from behind several garbage mountains, dressed similar to Li Yao, but not wearing his advanced blood-red goggles and Lingzi watches.
These people were menacing with shovels and iron bars in their hands.
Like Li Yao, they are all garbage insects who rely on the "No. 23 Special Waste Treatment Site" to eat mixed food.
Where there are interests, there is a struggle, a ship of abandoned magic weapons, for the high cultivators may be just garbage, but for these low-level poor, it is the hope of survival, Li Yao is the best garbage bug in the magic treasure grave, naturally it is also a thorn in the eye of most garbage insects, a thorn in the flesh.
Li Yao didn't care, he smiled, his waist suddenly exerted strength, his figure was strangely folded, and he turned ninety degrees without warning, dodged a fat boy with angry eyebrows in front of him, and took advantage of the situation to step on the fat face fiercely, taking advantage of this kick, the whole person swept out another thirty or forty meters.
"Fat dragon, everyone comes out to mix and eat, who is faster, you should lose weight!"
The fat boy had a huge red mark on his face, his nose was about to sink into fat, he was so angry that he shouted, commanded his subordinates to chase after him, and the group quickly entered the smoke and dust area.
There has just been an explosion here, extremely unstable, dozens of garbage mountains will collapse at any time, even the fierce fat dragon and a group of teenagers can't help but slow down when they enter this place, watching Li Yao gallop.
The fat dragon couldn't help but take a sip.
Before the words fell, the inside of a garbage mountain not far from Li Yao exploded again, and tens of thousands of metal components and broken magic weapons rushed down like a flash flood!
"So spiritual!"
But I heard a scream from the smoke: "Xiao Hei, help!" ”
A black light deeper than the night sky shot out, "dripping" in the metal torrent circle, and then rushed into the air, but it was a rusty, sword blade gap, pitch-black flying sword, this flying sword has a huge gauntlet that opens like black wings, Li Yao is like a drowning person grasping the straw, very clumsily lying on the flying sword, surrounded by black mang, rushing to the sky!
In the sky, more than a dozen garbage ships have revealed a huge figure, each garbage ship is hundreds of meters long, the round body is like the legendary turtle that supports the earth, the "turtle shell" is densely engraved with tens of thousands of runes, the spirit flashes, colorful, helping these tens of thousands of tons of big guys resist the invasion of gravity.
"Boom!"
The hatches of the belly of the "big turtle" opened, and an overwhelming array of metal components and broken magic weapons gushed out, smashing to the ground.
For a while, the spiritual power of the entire heaven and earth stirred wildly, setting off a terrifying wave!
Even the garbage boats weighing tens of thousands of tons swayed left and right in the wave of spiritual power, jolting violently, and had to desperately separate to reduce the interference.
Fat Dragon and the others did not dare to approach easily, lest they be affected.
Li Yao was still riding a black flying sword and rushing left and right in the wave of spiritual power, although he looked extremely embarrassed, he was as flexible as a loach.
Of course, he did not dare to confront the stormy waves head-on, but with more than ten years of survival experience, he tried to find a relatively calm safe area between the spiritual power tides, just to get as close as possible to the landing point of the garbage magic weapon.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage ship roared like a giant beast, turned around, and lazily returned home, and the smoke and dust gradually dissipated.
The fat dragon finally climbed into the center point of the dense dumping of garbage, and saw Li Yao sitting comfortably on a brand new mountain of garbage, looking at him with a smile.
"!"
The fat dragon's face trembled, but his heart was quite entangled.
The garbage mountain that Li Yao chose was quite ingenious, it was not the largest garbage mountain, and it did not look like the one with the most abundant materials.
There are also dozens of garbage mountains scattered around, containing valuable garbage magic weapons.
If you continue to entangle with Li Yao here, you may be benefited by other garbage insects.
Other garbage insects had faintly appeared all around, and cheers sounded on many garbage mountains, which were someone who had found something valuable.
Fat Long heard that Li Yao, a stinky boy, was still a student of the famous "Second High School Affiliated to the Chixiao Faction" in Fuge City.
The Chixiao Sect is a well-known large sect in the southern part of the Federation, with strong strength and many masters.
Although Li Yao may not have learned any true legend, he is not something that can be dealt with with with three punches and two kicks, otherwise he would not have single-handedly wandered in the magic treasure grave for more than ten years, still jumping alive, and also fought the nickname of "vulture"!
But when he left like this, where did his face rest?
His nose is still embedded in the flesh! The heart is entangled, a strong wind swept by, the fat dragon subconsciously reached out and copied it, and it was cold, but it was a fist-sized scrap crystal brain.
Li Yao smiled and said: "Fat dragon, everyone is out to ask for a living, isn't it that last time I robbed you of a 'starlight' level crystal brain, and didn't I kill your father, as for being so undead?" Oh, I just found a 'Snapdragon 17' crystal brain refined by 'Qinglongmen', which is the most advanced model, which can calculate more than five thousand thoughts per second, although it burns out, I estimate that it can also be sold for three or four thousand pieces, just when I honor your fat dragon brother, let's level it from now on, how about it? ”
"You..." The fat dragon didn't expect Li Yao to come out like this, and he was immediately stunned, and scratched the fat on his face in disbelief.
"Hey, look over there, the people of the 'Wild Wolf Gang' are almost here, they are not like me, a lone traveler, they will definitely eat dozens of garbage mountains clean, and they won't leave you a single screw!" Li Yao pointed to the west.
"Good boy, you have a set! Let's go, hurry up and sweep the goods! ”
A group of garbage insects scattered and rushed towards the mountains of garbage in all directions.
Li Yao let out a long sigh of relief, sitting in the garbage heap with his butt, beads of sweat rolled down his forehead, and a smiling face instantly cried.
"Dead fatty, the 'Snapdragon' level crystal brain that I finally found cheapened you for nothing!"
"You wait, is my 'Vulture Li Yao' thing so easy to take?
One day I want you to spit it out if you eat mine, give me back if you take mine, plus interest, calculated by usury, and let you know why everyone calls me 'a vulture who wants money and no life'! ”
"No, you have to speed up, the 'Wild Wolf Gang' gang is even more unreasonable than the fat dragon!"
"Mom, how many times have I told you, I'm going to save people, not suicide!"
"Don't lie to your mother, you can't even gouge a dog, and save people? Besides, there is no one in the river at all! ”
Wang Yao was speechless, today he came down from the mountain, saw someone in the river next to the village, hurriedly jumped down to save people, after jumping down, he remembered that he didn't know water at all, and what was more ironic was that the person who fell into the water was not a person, it was an inflatable doll, a very realistic kind.
"There are still people in the village who use this thing so fashionably?!"
It was his last thought before he lost consciousness, and when he woke up again, he was lying on his own kang, next to his parents, frowning.
Then in less than a day, the whole village knew that the stupid contracted mountain, and the college student who planted herbs couldn't think of it, and jumped into the river to commit suicide. "Today's children, I haven't experienced setbacks, I can't stand the blow!"
"Eighty percent of that child is in school, how can a famous college student go home to farm?"
"It is!"
"This medicine, let's not grow it!"
The father, who had been squatting on the side smoking a cigarette bag, popped out this sentence angrily, the people in the village have a good face, this gossip, Lao Wang listened to the panic in his heart, and planted it again, it was nothing to lose some money, and even his son lost it.
"That's it, listen to the damn this time, stop planting herbs, go to the city another day and ask your sister to help find a decent job, the child of your Changmao third uncle's family is just a school graduate from an unknown school, found a job in the city, and now they all buy houses there!" Wang Yao's mother was also on the side.
After hearing this, Wang Yao no longer raised the bar with his parents, so he nodded and agreed.
He was originally a student who graduated from a prestigious university, and after graduation, he returned to the mountain village with enthusiasm, started his own business, contracted a barren mountain in the village, and wanted to grow herbs and make a fortune. As a result, when he really started to do it, he found that this cultivation of herbs was far from as simple as he thought, and it was impossible to rely on full blood, and many things were not in books, only by practice and experience.
In the first year, the herbs he planted suffered from worm disease and lost their blood, and in the second year, the herbs bloomed and the leaves did not grow roots, and this was the third year.
But after being physically comfortable, he went up Nanshan again, which is a barren mountain, probably because of the soil quality, not too long crops, but there are more than a dozen large chestnut trees, jujube trees, there is a large gentle slope on the mountain, there are several acres of medicinal fields that he painstakingly reclaimed, for this he also specially spent money to hire someone to build a hut on the mountain, pulled on electricity, specially to take care of these acres of medicinal fields, ups and downs, spring, summer, autumn and winter, he poured three years of hard work, said to give up, he really reluctant.
Looking at the herbs that were growing well, he reached out and touched them.
Want to try another year?
"Herb detected, trigger condition reached, do you activate the system?"
An icy mechanical voice suddenly sounded.
"What voice, who?!"
All around, there are mountains, water, and woods, but there is no one.
"Shhh, is it an illusion?"
"Activate the system?"
The sound of the machine sounded again, and it seemed to be at hand.
"There are ghosts!"
Wang Yao was full of excitement.
Pharmacist system?
As soon as he said these words, a light curtain appeared in front of him, like a panel of characters in Wang Xuan.
Hallucinations, must be hallucinations.
He shook his head vigorously, and the light curtain that appeared out of thin air disappeared.
At this time, a native dog rushed down from the mountain and came to him, sticking out his tongue and wagging his tail, looking very happy.
"Sanxian, where have you been again?"
This is Wang Yao's native dog, who has accompanied him on this mountain for three years. One person and one dog entered the hut on the mountain, and Wang Yao went to bed, feeling a little dizzy.
"What the hell was that just now?"
He read the name of the one again, and the light curtain appeared again, as if projected.
"Here it is again!"
After several experiments, Wang Yao determined that this thing was not an illusion, but something that existed and could not be explained by science. There are character attributes, skills, and packages, just like an online game.
Career level: rookie (in fact, you are not even a bird, at most an egg!)
Physical constitution 1, strength 0.9, spirit 0.85, agility 0.9, will 1.1 (1 is the average of normal adult men).
It's true? He was completely blindfolded.
Great, he is growing medicinal herbs now, and this is what is missing! Wang Yao, who came back to his senses, jumped up excitedly and startled the "three freshmen" on the side.
And a skills panel? Wang Yao thought about it but didn't look at it.
"Why can't I open it?" He asked subconsciously.
"The herbs are not planted well, and if you want to do something else, shovel!"
As if hearing his question, such a line popped up on the panel.
I lean, what is the situation? Who designed it, come out, I promise not to beat you to death! "What is this again?"
Wang Yu looked in the package column and found a kettle-like sign.
Ancient spring pot with ancient spring water, one barrel a day.
How to use it, reach for it?
Wang Yao's thought moved, and there was one more thing in his hand, it was a wooden kettle, antique in his hand, held in his hand, and quite weighty, gently shaken, there was a sound of water inside.
"What water! Ancient spring water? ”
He found a bucket from the room and poured out the water from the kettle, a small jug, but the water kept coming out until the whole bucket was filled and the water did not stop coming out.
So amazing?
！ Wang Yao looked at the water in the bucket blankly, very clean and pure, reached out and took a sip into his mouth, very sweet.
Delicious!
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank it, and drank three bowls before stopping, drinking this water, feeling that the whole person was much more comfortable, and the tiredness in his body was eliminated.
Woof, the three fresh on the side circled around the bucket.
"Here, you can drink some too."
Wang Yao also filled a bowl in the basin where he drank, and the earth dog quickly drank it, and then barked again, wagging its tail, obviously not drinking enough.
"Okay, let you drink enough!"
This person and a dog drank a small half barrel, if not for the panic, it is estimated that this bucket of water will be drunk by them.
Wang Yao had never drunk such sweet water in his life.
Chapter 1: I want to lose weight!
In the hot summer, the pond cloud rainforest located in the eastern part of the federation is filled with clouds and mist, like a layer of thin veil surrounding, towering ancient trees, criss-crossed, luxuriant canopy, sometimes a few birds soar into the sky, hissing and soaring in the sky.
In the sky, the sun that seems to exist for eternity is no longer what people remember, but many years ago, it was directly pierced by an indescribably large bronze ancient sword, revealing a small half of the sword tip!
This ancient sword seems to have experienced thousands of years, coming from the starry sky, revealing endless vicissitudes, and there is a strong coercion, forming a halo, shrouding the firmament, as if it can suppress the earth and make all living beings worship!
From a distance, this scene of Jianyang Rainforest was like a picture scroll, until there was a buzzing sound in the distance, and it was broken. A large red hot air balloon boat is slowly flying above the rainforest.
The balloon cabin is large enough to accommodate hundreds of people, and you can see many young men and women on the deck, sometimes laughing.
They are students from Phoenix City, one of the four avenues of the Federation that was admitted this year, and the Ethereal Dao Academy are riding on this airship belonging to the Ethereal Dao Academy, crossing thousands of miles to study in the Ethereal Dao Academy.
Perhaps it is the expectation of studying, the journey is not boring for these young men and women, and there are some hazy attractions between men and women, making this journey of thousands of miles more fun.
And because of the long distance, on this airship, there are equipped with restaurants, spiritual cultivation rooms, infirmaries and other areas.
At this moment, in the canteen of the airship, there are many students, and at one of the dining tables, there is a little fat man with a belly.
This little fat man was about seventeen or eight years old, wearing a blue wide robe, and his round little face was barely clear, and he was patting his stomach and making a crackling sound, while looking regretfully at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him.
"This meal will gain three pounds, why didn't I hold back, if I want to become the president of the Federation, I can't die young."
The little fat man frowned, and when he was remorseful, he burped. This little fat man is called Wang Baole, and he is also a student who was admitted to the Ethereal Taoist Academy this time, his lifelong dream is to become an official, and he regards becoming a federal president as his lifelong pursuit, and the reason why he has such a great ideal is inseparable from his childhood experience.
In his memory, when he was a child, his father often patted his head with great seriousness, sighing with emotion.
"Baole, it's better to be an official, you have to remember that although money can solve everything, you will still be bullied, and if you want not to be bullied, you can only be an official and become a superior person."
At first, Wang Baole did not understand, until he was in elementary school, because he did not hand in his homework on time, he was reprimanded by the class leader, and after he sent two pieces of sugar, he was named by the class leader and made a small report to the teacher, all of which left an indelible mark on his young heart.
So from that moment on, he wanted to be a squad leader, not to bully people, but so that he could not be bullied by others.
But as he grew up, he found that there were many more who could bully the squad leader, so he felt that as the biggest official, that is, the federal president, no one really dared to bully him. The reason why he sharpened his head and was admitted to the Ethereal Dao Academy was also because all the high-ranking officials of the Federation graduated from the Fourth Avenue Academy.
It's just that his life is not very good, the family bloodline is very strange, he still remembers the night a year ago, the emaciated father was in the ancestral hall of the family and showed him a family tree.
That was the first time Wang Baole saw the family tree, and he clearly saw that generations of ancestors, all those who weighed more than two hundred pounds, all died young, and did not live more than thirty-five.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream... Before he became president of the Federation, he was reunited with those fat grandfathers.
In the following year, for him, weight loss has risen to a certain height, but even after the Federation entered the Spirit Yuan Era, with the concentration of spiritual energy, with the recovery of ancient martial arts, there are various ways to lose weight, but Wang Baole has tried almost everything, and his weight is still steadily improving.
The emergence of memories made Wang Baole grit his teeth fiercely and make up his mind to lose weight tomorrow.
After making such a decision, Wang Baole suddenly felt a lot less pressure, while picking his teeth, humming a little song, looking up at the blue sky outside the window in the distance, and his brain began to come alive.
"I don't know if the gift for Dr. Lu is like it or not, it's an antique that I came out of my home, so the old guy should like it."
Wang Baole comforted himself, thinking that as long as he fell in love with Doctor Lu, he would have a small backer in the Taoist courtyard in the future.
"The teacher has limited power, but I will also give some gifts in the future, but this Doctor Lu is a lot of age, and he must have a lot of connections, and I should be on the right step in this step."
Thinking of this, Wang Baole was happy, and only felt that he was one step closer to the position of the federal president.
He is very confident that he can become the federal president, mainly from the autobiographies of all the high-ranking officials he has studied since he was a child, and even summed up a few killer tricks for becoming an official.
At this moment, his body and mind are happy, and Wang Baole looks at the blue sky outside the window, and he also feels particularly beautiful.
But soon, his eyes suddenly widened, and he noticed that in the distant sky, there was a black cloud condensed, diffused as if to cover the sky, there was thunder and lightning inside, flashing out one after another electric light, slowly approaching, this scene also attracted the attention of many students, exclaimed.
Wang Baole was also taken aback, in fact, after the Federation stepped into the Spirit Yuan Era, due to the appearance of Spiritual Qi, there were many amazing weather breeding between heaven and earth, and it was difficult to be safe for flying objects in the past, which led to the birth of hot air balloon airships powered by spirit stones.
With the continuous exclamation, the rumbling thunder suddenly came, the loud noise was shocking, you can see the thunder black cloud in the distance growing rapidly, and the lightning inside it has spread, like a large black net, flashing the sky, dazzling and shocking, making people's heartbeats faster, the originally moving airship, at this moment, is also slowly decelerating.
Just when the crowd was restless, the door of the restaurant was pushed open, as if there was a howling wind, and walked into an old man in a white Taoist robe, this old man's face was wrinkled, but he was fairy and straight, especially his eyes were shining, and his body was full of righteousness, and as soon as he arrived, his majestic voice spread throughout the restaurant.
"Everyone, immediately report in the spiritual cultivation room, put on your magnetic spiritual clothing, after half a column of incense, we will enter the thunder magnetic zone!"
As soon as the words came out, all the students in the cafeteria were in awe and quickly stood up.
Wang Baole's eyes lit up, the old man in front of him was the Doctor Lu he had given a gift before, looking at the other party's dragon-like momentum at this moment, Wang Baole felt more and more that his previous investment was right, secretly said that this old guy must be very human, and he is a chess master.
When Zhengmeizi was proud, the old doctor swept his eyes, saw Wang Baole, snorted, walked over, took out half a black mask from his arms, and threw it on Wang Baole.
"At a young age, don't put your mind on some messy places, you haven't entered the Taoist Academy, you learned to give gifts, the old man is also a well-informed person, you have this mask, or keep it yourself." The old doctor looked solemn, looking honest and upright, as if hating iron is not steel.
Wang Baole took the mask, and chuckled in his heart, seeing that the old doctor was angry, a little anxious, just wanted to explain, but suddenly thought of the killer tools he summarized in the autobiographies of those high-ranking officials, one of which is in front of the boss, cheekily admit the mistake for the first time, often can be big and small.
So he took a deep breath and quickly put on a repentant appearance and admitted his mistake.
"The teacher is right, I am wrong!"
The old doctor was a little surprised, and the words that he was about to reprimand were so happily admitted that some of them couldn't continue.
Wang Baole saw the old doctor's expression, relieved, and a little proud, secretly said that this high-ranking official's autobiography is indeed useful.
The old doctor snorted, looked up and swept towards all the students in the entire cafeteria, and pointed at everyone with his right hand.
"And you, you are all future students of my Ethereal Dao Academy, look at what you look like these days, you must always remember that my generation of martial artists, first stand, then speak, and then stand!"
The old doctor hated deeply, these words echoed in the restaurant, so that after everyone heard it, they couldn't help but bow their heads, a little ashamed, and Wang Baole's eyes suddenly lit up here, feeling that the time had come to express themselves.
So he quickly took out a small book from his arms, recorded it on it, looked up at the old doctor from time to time, showed a listening expression, and nodded seriously from time to time, as if to remember every word said by the other party, this trick is also a killer tool he summed up in the autobiography of a high-ranking official.
When the other students saw this scene, they looked at Wang Baole like a god.
After the old doctor saw it, he also froze for a moment, an unprecedented strange feeling, could not help but float in his mind, it was really he ushered in so many students, this is the first time to meet such a strange person, couldn't help but look at it a few times, but gradually sneered.
"Little guy, the old man's horse fart is not so easy to shoot, you have to thank this thunder magnetic storm, otherwise, the old man can train for three days and three nights in one breath, I see if you can write it all in a small book!"
As soon as the old doctor's words came out, the momentum suddenly changed, and a strong breath emanated from his body, as if it turned into coercion, shrouding the entire restaurant, and all the students were stunned, only feeling that this fighting method was still one foot higher than the old doctor.
Wang Baole blinked, touched the recording jade in his pocket, weighed it for a long time, and looked at the approaching thunder magnetic storm, or gave up the idea of taking it out, he felt that it was not shameful to be instigated in front of his superior.
Seeing everyone's expressions, the old doctor was proud in his heart, and said a few words impassionedly.
"You remember, you must put your mind on cultivation, be a person in the future, you can't be greedy, you can't be unrighteous, don't always think about finding some female companion, you must know that there is a knife on the head of the color, these days, you are too unspeakable!"
Just as he was speaking of this, suddenly, a delicate voice floated out from the old doctor's transmission bracelet.
"Grandpa Doctor, where are you, people won't tie this magnetic spirit suit, you come and help me."
This voice was coquettish, when the old doctor heard it, his body involuntarily shook, he barely coughed, and glared at everyone seriously, and then turned away anxiously, and at the same time opened his mouth excitedly at the spirit bracelet. "Oh, it's coming, baby is not in a hurry, I'll come over to help you."
This scene was reversed too quickly, the contrast was too great, everyone was dumbfounded, even Wang Baole was stunned, it took a long time before gasping, with the uproar that everyone couldn't help it, Wang Baole gritted his teeth and scolded a few words.
"This old ghost, all those things I said before are bullshit! There are only so many female classmates, we are not enough points, he is so old, and he comes to grab resources with us, isn't he an official based on his size! ”
The more Wang Baole thought about it, the more angry he became, and in the discussion with the classmates around him, his dream of becoming an official became more firm in his heart.
As the sound of the alarm intensified, everyone ended the discussion, and one by one went to the spiritual cultivation room with indignation in their hearts.
The spiritual cultivation room, located in the core area of the airship, as the name suggests, is a place for these students to cultivate, and it is also the most closely protected place for the airship to pass through the special area.
At this moment, in this spiritual cultivation room, as everyone gathered, under the arrangement of the teacher accompanying the ship of the Ethereal Dao Academy, everyone sat in several rows and wore the special magnetic spiritual clothing for airships issued by the Ethereal Dao Academy.
Just put on the magnetic spirit suit, Wang Baole was immersed in the displeasure of Doctor Lu, casually looked up at the surroundings, the already depressed mood, because of a gaze in the distance, suddenly became even worse, unconsciously wrinkled, revealing a look of disgust.
Where he looked, there was a girl with slender legs, very moving, but now he was also frowning, revealing a look of disgust, obviously in their mutual gaze, the other party was familiar and extremely disgusted.
"Obscure!"
Both of them muttered in their hearts, and quickly avoided their eyes, as if they even looked at each other and felt spicy eyes.
"You can meet this tablet Du Min everywhere, I'm bored!" "What's great, isn't it a broken squad leader, when I get to the Daoyuan, with my officialdom killer skills, Lao Tzu can also mix an official and a half-job!"
Soon, after everyone was dressed and the teachers accompanying the ship of the Ethereal Daoist Academy checked one by one, they explained some precautions, and even sternly warned everyone that after the airship entered the minefield area, there was a danger, and there was a certain life and death crisis.
After seeing that everyone's expressions changed, these teachers who accompanied the ship left solemnly, and the door of the spiritual cultivation room was directly sealed, and the lights gradually dimmed.
At this moment, although there was still whispered conversation in the spiritual cultivation room, as time passed, the tension became stronger and stronger, and gradually no one spoke, falling into complete silence.
In this silence where he could hear his heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still in displeasure, couldn't help but get nervous, until after half a column of incense, the entire airship shook violently and entered the thunder magnetic area!
From the outside, the entire thunder black cloud is extremely majestic, like a large mouth, which will be compared with it, a very small hot air balloon airship, directly swallowed.
This kind of weather seems to contain the power of destruction, can sweep everything, perhaps only on the firmament, that round of shocking Jianyang, can ignore everything, as if looking down on the world for thirty-seven years is not enough, it will be longer.
This year was the thirty-seventh year of Lingyuan.
In 3029 AD, the rapid development of earth science and technology, without national boundaries, the unification of the earth was realized, and the era of federation was entered, and it was at this time that a big sword flew from the starry sky, penetrating the sun, and the world sensationalized.
The hilt of this great sword, perhaps because it was already broken, broke a large number of fragments in this violent shaking, scattered all over the starry sky, and some of them fell all over the earth.
With the arrival of the bronze great sword, as the fragments fell, there was suddenly an endless new energy on the earth that seemed to pervade the heavens and the earth, which was later named... Nimbus!
Spiritual energy is like air, some places are rich, some places are thin, and because those scattered fragments are obtained by the Federation and various forces, on it found various exercises related to cultivation and refining tools, alchemy, and refining spirit stones, and the words on it are full of ancient meaning, causing people to contact ancient texts and become a trend.
The emergence of Reiki also quickly eliminated the original energy, changed people's lives, not only formed a spiritual network, but also changed the process of earth civilization, so that the entire earth opened the cultivation civilization.
Since then, the rise of ancient martial arts, the great changes in the world, and the era of all people cultivating immortals have begun.
History said, Lingyuan Era.
At this moment, in the thunder magnetic black cloud, the slowly moving red hot air balloon airship, surrounded by countless lightning, constantly bombarded, fortunately, there is a soft light curtain spread protection left and right, making the airship extremely stable.
As for the spiritual cultivation room in the core area of the cabin, at this moment, all the students, including Wang Baole, were already unconsciously sleeping, as if there was a strange force that guided them into the dream.
Only in the main pavilion at the bow of the ship, there were seven or eight teachers at this moment, some drinking tea, some laughing, and talking to each other lightly, which was completely different from the way they had scaring the students before.
The person at the head is an old man, with a wrinkled face, holding a smoking gun, smoking in one mouth, if Wang Baole is here, he must recognize at a glance that this old man is the shameless old doctor Lu before.
As a middle-aged teacher spoke, the old doctor who was smoking a cigarette smiled slightly.
