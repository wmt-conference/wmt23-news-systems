The July issue is traditionally released during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: reading the lanes when your heart is eager for Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will talk about the MIFF next time (for now I will only complain that this year the organizers have finally strengthened the inexplicable idea that happy ticket holders are many times more important to the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world sins), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and on “Kinotavr”.
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another nice face - the title character of Robert Rodriguez's Predators, and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about “The Beginning” by Christopher Nolan (the man who, by the way, rebooted Batman...), the most anticipated film of the summer.
This time we are also publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here we certainly don't need to advertise anything specifically, and it's a no brainer that the author of “Suspicion” and “The Rope” is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolyne, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolay Karaev, Denis Korsakov Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Olly Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, Londina Tishchenkov, Evelyn Salt, despite her excellent track record, were suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch her at all costs.
Cornered, she will paint her usual black and go looking for the truth herself.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie as a femme fatale promises to further consolidate the actress's position in the action genre.
She will cause one accident after another, run along the walls a la “The Matrix” and throw around strong men in the same formal suits like children.
This is how beauty is supposed to save the world.
Here he is, my darling, who blew up and repaired the world with the “Fifth Element” and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was his most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And at the same time, all together turned out to be not a boring American-style blockbuster about saving humanity, but a cute live carnival.
I don't want to remember what Besson did for 13 years between “Element...” and “Adelya...”.
To put it mildly, he did not sit idle, but all this screenwriting and production bustle and rare, tortured directorial performances will be forgotten.
But “Adele...” is unlikely.
When you watch this movie, it seems that for 13 years we were not facing our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, drank wine in a cafe across the street and wrote a story about a charming adventurer.
In this case, it is a sin to retell the plot (even in general terms), stirring up expectations.
The whole incredible drive here is that surprises await you around every turn or remark.
And all like one nice one.
Either a girl or a vision
ADELE'S EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES
The most dashing adventure movie of the decade is to hint that Adele's Extraordinary Adventures will start as Amelie, rush towards <Jurassic Park, continue with Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and end with Titanic.
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy's comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin appeared in only three films before Adele.
She made the actress famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for the Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the audience with an outstretched hand, begging him to appreciate special effects, decorations or tricks, but takes him along like an old-fashioned novelist who exclaims before a long journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: “Go ahead, my reader, great things await us!”
At the same time, Besson treats genre films, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has seen enough old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not denying yourself cynicism and not shy about taking risks
DIRECTOR Luc Besson
CAST: Louise Bourgozne, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Belle, Gilles Lelouch
STORY: Strange things happened in Paris in 1912.
The city was disturbed by an ancient monster that brought to life an old medium.
The fossil creature is being chased by the police, as well as by a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Natural History Museum and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who cares not so much about the animal itself as with the medium — she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
IS RELEASED ON JULY 22
“Adele...” is the case when a parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and can radically change it, setting it on a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, Quentin Tarantino's gangster militants, Indiana Jones (they bowed to him and ridiculed him here), and finally with the same Fifth Element.
Besson's style in this film consists of verbal stunts, acting clowning and plot balancing (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts is more organic and strong here than ever).
I should also say a few words about Adele herself.
It embodies an undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer who takes not so much exploitation of sexuality as pure courage and courage.
In movies, such girls are usually assigned to some macho or romantic on duty
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer who is just spinning under his feet (only his knowledge of zoology is useful).
Therefore, an energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre “cats” and seemingly completely sour, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative fever, recalling that the line between the preferences of bored megamall visitors and high-fronted art house regulars is easily crossed by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing an adventure movie without sadness, fear or reproach
DEATH ROOM
A hermetic horror film with a claim to psychologism and political context in 2002, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film was criticized, but liked by the public and made good money at the box office, and most importantly, caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
This is how the young director found himself in a factory that is forging new horrors based on old patterns: Bay set out to remake all the horror classics and entrusted Liebesman with the prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
The criticism grimaced again, but the public liked it again — Liebesman worked in the spirit of the “new scary ones”, emphasizing the excessive physiological nature of violence.
In fact, his example shows how an entire genre convulses, trying to invent new ways to influence a jaded audience: the naturalistic blood of splatters merges with the catch-up of slasher.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without litres of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut film Cube. The film was made by no longer Michael Bay.
So in Death Room, Liebesman was forced to take a different path: stupid massacre or monotonous running around from a maniac, he preferred the smarter option — almost without the notorious blood, but with a psychological game and riddles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with test subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to develop a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break your cell at all costs?
Not only they are being tested, but also by a young ambitious intelligence officer, who is being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who has experienced wild experiments.
STORY: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and each is given a pile of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A survival game begins, with government agents watching the glass closely.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for an outright arthouse
He can have small talk and go over the face with a fire extinguisher, but he can't miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and adamant in her sympathies.
Her father's courtly lifestyle is wounded and frankly spies on how he, as if paroding the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's “Showgirls”, dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and her father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not the difference between generations or the choice of profession, it, one way or another, is already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that everything is bought and sold in modern Moscow.
The sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan, together with Pavel Bardin, shot a comedy with Ivan Urgant “Three and a Snowflake”.
Depardieu persuasively portrayed the father of his growing daughter in the comedy genre
The fractional plot revolves around the love affairs of characters who always talk about psychology, and, apparently, based on the director's witty discovery, focus on the language of sight and gesture.
The secondary story branches (the girl maimed in a car accident, whom Alexey wants to marry, a drunk athlete performed by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are drawn only in dotted lines.
The line about the business of buying football players, and the one left behind the scenes, is especially sorry.
STORY: Most of all, an agent selling football stars is concerned about the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The compassionate dad himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must definitely marry a guy “with a rod”.
What a businessman's disappointment is when Nastya chooses his peer and business partner in spite of her father's struggle for independence and in spite of her father.
But with a potential slogan for the film's audience, the author hit the top nine: “Don't look for a problem where it doesn't exist.” You can't be more precise.
Their resemblance is simply amazing.
Both tapes feature squads of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who set them up and each company has one beautiful girl.
The characters jump to almost the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular footage - something full of dollar bills explodes here and there, and a whirlwind of bucks falls on the scenery.
Even villains dressed in expensive costumes are hard to tell apart (both are played by Patricks—Jason Patrick is here, Patrick Wilson is there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to shoot dance battles - “The Brotherhood of Dance”.
Chris Evans was recently invited to play a hero from other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvan White was inspired by a comic book series that was released in the 70s and relaunched in the 2000s, and Joe Carnahan was inspired by a comedy series from the 80s.
It's amazing how they, without saying a word, brought different materials to an absolutely identical rumbling denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies that evoke a lot of films with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons are invariably in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If we choose between these two films, the Losers look a little nicer and clearly poorer in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times smaller).
At least there's Zoe Saldana here, who is very fond of the bazooka
CAST: Geoffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
STORY: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were set up by their own superiors: a helicopter with the children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were considered dead from that moment on.
But they are alive — and they intend at all costs to take revenge on the scoundrel with the languid voice who set it all up.
It's all nice, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life painting White is only worth it if you don't have any more interesting options at all.
Made from recyclable materials, a conditionally edible action movie
A simple story about a runaway Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, with only this data at hand, one can vividly imagine both the hypothetical content of the picture and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, cinema promises to be highly social.
Of course, it will be realistic and tough at that.
There is a high probability of non-professional actors participating.
The film will also feature a lot of Romanian poverty (yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian, as our festival winners prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were given a lecture about Bresson in the early 80s
The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on a play by Andreea Valean, whose work is in high demand among directors of the Romanian “new wave”.
Cameraman Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All this is also true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - don't get us wrong - it is not abusive at all, but advisory: the Romanian “new wave” is at a blissful stage of development when its representatives believe in methods
she has not yet wavered in her work.
And this moment must be captured: only thanks to this faith can you survive an hour and a half spectacle of a Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pisterean (whose story, despite the gap that separates the two cultures, can easily be
convert into an exploitation a la 70s, with a cowboy who decides to take a walk from jail, from where he will soon leave, to the nearest saloon).
CAST: George Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
STORY: After being four years old, 18-year-old convict Silviu (Pistereanu) is about to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the young man's behavior becomes inadequate.
An affair with social worker Anna further encourages the guy to do desperate things, the meaning of which is limited to the title of the picture.
How ridiculous this is all!
If you want to watch, watch.
A good debut, giving little hope that the Romanian arthouse will someday grow into a decent destination
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandry, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, inter alia, for all Ice Ages, Horton and Robots.
Despicable Me is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully painted (by the way, it makes sense to watch in ZO), especially if you like when different objects constantly strive to jump from the screen into the hall), tolerably painted, and, most importantly, there is not a single underbelt joke that made you shyly squeeze into a chair and cover children's children at Ice Age ears with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the main character's blatant asexuality, which in turn was dictated by the reluctance to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
In addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, the “adult” part here is due to rather harsh black humor (which, I think, we owe to director Coffin).
In general, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who have thought through every detail so that all categories of citizens will like the film.
It's not that we want to see children's cartoon characters be eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion
STORY: The nose-nosed villain Grew, whose childhood dreams of astronautics have over the years transformed into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to resort to the help of children to carry out his grand plan and eliminate a young competitor.
At an advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans — Margot with glasses, Edith wearing a hat, and Agnes, who are only as sweet as the cat from Shrek.
As is usually the case, children immediately transform adult plans.
The main character is copied from Christopher Meledandry - both of them are bald, nosy and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Segel.
In the final, Grew dances the part of Travolta
A car rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a conditional desert, from which three pairs of good-looking boobs come out.
That's right.
The bearers of this gift themselves are not so significant.
The camera confidently captures attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately announce the good news — the whole film is in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the best things about female beauty and the casting was such that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And there's a lot of fun stuff going on.
“Broker”, “killer” and “stripper” dig in the sand, pour water (don't ask why), carry a blizzard and periodically fight fiercely.
The creators believe that a swearing chick with generous shapes, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and shiny white teeth is cool.
“Bitchy Things” is primarily focused on classic sexlot tapes.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of “Xena, the Warrior Queen” and “The Amazing Journeys of Hercules”.
A like-minded film at the Moscow box office is “A Gun for Jennifer”.
It's also cool when a bitchy babe spins balls for a bandit, a freaking punk fights with a Japanese schoolgirl, accompanied by a samurai sword and lesbian sex; and the intrigue is unfolded through endless flashbacks.
In general, for a movie fetishist, you will find a real Klondike of pleasure here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang had a lot of fun shooting this thrash parody, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it were not for the physical characteristics of the actresses, it would be boring by the middle.
We can assume that this game came to us from a night channel for adults (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on TV episodes)
CAST: Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
STORY: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia leader into the desert, who has a substantial amount of diamonds hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and shooting the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to grab, fight with each other and thugs who periodically arrive from somewhere, and regularly kiss and squeeze.
As the case progresses, it turns out that all three are not who they first appeared to be.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even funnier this way.
A product for a narrow circle of fans of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest film “Doomsday”, freaking out “Mad Max” for the poor, Marshall gave a serious misfire
A bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shaken trust.
The new politically incorrect and sullen magnum opus is not ashamed of a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration, and ferocious B-style cinema.
The film also contains the hooligan courage of “Warrior Dogs” and the animal cruelty of “Descent”.
The Marshall Plan to cleanse the “peplum” from the adhering post-gladiator film mud, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the Ninth Legion story.
His battle-scarred legionaries (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough men trying to marry their military duty with an irresistible desire to survive.
Murder and the spicy details of natural necessities in ancient times are depicted here with love and detail.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which cost a lot of budget money, is directly inspired by an introductory giveaway in German forests from Sir Ridley Scott's now standard Gladiator, but for some reason we absolutely don't want to try to accuse Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without pretensions.
CAST: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
STORY: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost, where Centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is serving, has been mercilessly defeated by Pict reconnaissance.
Miraculously escaped, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a bunch of other Roman survivors, try to escape from a group of Pictish militants led by sadist Etain (Kurylenko).
The subtle arthouse artist has so far managed to win back only acute supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that the situation will change after Centurion.
Peplum - revised and expanded edition.
Almost like Gladiator, but more modest and harsher
Continuation of the story about schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her difficult relationship with two extremely promising young people — pale faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and werewolf bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of an animated series about a bald sorcerer boy, designed to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The Fire Lord started a bloody war and subdued his neighbors.
Young Aang will only be able to stop him if he learns to control all the elements and becomes an Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) knows how to steal others' thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the object's sleep, it makes the sleeping brain work according to its own rules.
But this time he will have to do the opposite — leave in one head what wasn't there.
A picturesque lesson in managing illusory worlds by Christopher Nolan.
An experienced magician (Nicolas Cage) finds a young assistant in the hope of defeating an evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
Using destructive spells, they will arrange bedlam with dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
Bald as a billiard ball, the kitty has set out to take over the world, and now superagent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second episode of a furry family comedy.
Several dirty thugs, led by flimsy-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where stylish fanged aliens hunt them sport.
The return of an iconic 80s character to the big screen.
Look out for George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-director Anton Corbyn (“Control”) for a very interesting existential study of the psychology of an aging assassin who hides from people in a small Italian town and belatedly discovers human nature.
“A visionary artist of Corbyne's calibre and the brilliant George Clooney are a film union made in heaven,” the studio's press release boasts.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of Clooney's longest love relationship with Italy: the shooting took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel “A Very Secretive Gentleman”, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the English storyteller was replaced by an American, and the main character turned from an illegal gunsmith into a simple killer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while killer Jack is trying to figure out his latest business and finally get down to a profitable craft, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Thekla Ruten), with whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
“Jack is tempted by fate,” says the official synopsis.
A dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be who she says she is.”
Judging by the trailer, Corbyn's visual experiments, spiced up with Clooney's ash hair (the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a whole new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will star in the film adaptation of Remarque's “On the Western Front Unchanged”
Can I click you with a photo gun!?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at the same time this season.
First, in Venice on the set of Florian Henkel von Donnersmarck's thriller The Tourist (The Lives of Others).
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's heroine.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico, on the site of The Rum Diary, an adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson (Whitnale & Me), whose last directorial work was the thriller Jennifer 8 in 1992.
Looking at the work of the posters of the Russian prison drama, one can not even doubt what inspired them.
But you can't approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, at least the good thing is that the heroine of the Russian film, although alien, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly focuses on projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects: Lucky Gilmore, Big Dad, Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding, and Don't Mess with Gohan!
In July, the fifth comedy, Odnoklassniki, is released, and the sixth is “The Pretender Wife” with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes a seventh film, the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, where Sandler will simultaneously play Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, who will be remembered by the audience this year for the enchanting action movie “Kick-Ass”, will reboot the X-Men.
The director first invited James McAvoy to the film “X-Men: First Class”, giving him the role of young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost, nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will be reincarnated as blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender is expected to become Magneto.
While filming for the new Bond series is being postponed, its new director Sam Mendes does not have time to get bored.
His to-do list includes the musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and an adaptation of Isan McUzen's novel “On the Beach”.
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the lead female role.
Gary Oldman considers the role of practical Major George Smiley - the protagonist of the John Le Caré series - in the film adaptation of the thriller Spy, Get Out!
Alec Guinness played the first adaptation of this work in 1979.
The new version will be shot by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, creator of the horror film Let Me In.
Tom Tykwer is adapting David Mitchell's best-selling science fiction novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, this is not an easy one (the novel has six parallel storylines), but it is an extremely interesting work.
Tom Hanks, Hull Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKelen and Natalie Portman have already made offers from him.
International action movie Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title “Soldiers of Fortune” is being filmed in Crimea.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to war for their money in search of adrenaline.
The roles are played by Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The film is scheduled to premiere in early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy “Baby Jesus” with English pop star Pixie Lotg
Meghan Fox was fired from Transformers 3
According to Ragatoipe, the dismissal “is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler.”
However, English model Rosie Huntington-Wheatley is likely to take the place of the main character and new sweetheart of Shia LaBeouf.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she will have an accelerated acting course.
This fact should not frighten sophisticated viewers - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful recalification of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron (Monstro), Angelina Jolie (Life Interrupted), Jessica Lang (Blue Sky, Tootsie), Kim Basinger (Los Angeles Secrets), Jennifer Connelly (Mind Games), Geena Davis (The Accidental Tourist), and US Vice Miss 86 Halle Berry (Bury) Monsters”) started as models or starred for fashion magazines, eventually winning a well-deserved Oscar.
They also succeeded in acting (also beautiful Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, most importantly, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
Their high rewards are clearly within arm's reach.
In short, Rosie has someone to look up to.
Valeria Guy Germanica, who deserved Special Mention from the Cannes Jury in 2008 for her film “Everyone Will Die But I Stay” and directed the scandalous television series School, was appointed Creative Director at MT.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or vampires).
Germanika also started casting new hosts.
The comedy “Kolotilov” directed by Leo Gabriadze and producer Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into “Freaks”.
The main theme of the film remains the same: Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky), a provincial Russian language teacher, hurries to visit his bride in Moscow, but stays late to train a football team of street children.
The second storyline of the film has received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, Milla Iovovich will play the role of the capital's bride Nadia.
As an additional intrigue, a third one will appear — Nadia's ex-fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the yard team will win the football championship, the dilemma is who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant postponement of filming “The Hobbit” and the presence of a lot of side projects, Guillermo del Toro refused to direct.
Studios are trying to persuade producer Peter Jackson to take matters into his own hands, but he is only willing to take this step if absolutely necessary.
Possible successors include David Yates, who finished filming the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots Sop convention in late July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Crazy from the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed at high speeds between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes took place, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held as soon as they could dive into the Black Sea.
The characters of the competitive films also behaved to match - almost everyone ran somewhere: confused Asians from Yusup Razykov's “Guest Worker” and Dmitry Mamulia's “Another Sky” were looking for their missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's film “Live”
The same cops were happily fooled by detective Klim Shipenko's hero “Who am I?” — which, however, was remembered by the audience rather for the presence of Zhanna Friske, who was totally naked in the frame.
Heroes of Russian show business also appeared in a couple of other competitive films - in the film “Elephant” Sergey Shnurov played a trucker carrying a circus animal to slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets talked about his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film “Satisfaction” for two, where business partners called each other to an alcohol duel because of a lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr also had a tangible impact on the show — none of them were boring.
Sergey Tolstikov, Chairman of the Foundation for the Support of Russian Cinema, arranged a picturesque quarrel with critics at a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian arthouse: “Do you even read press articles that I read?” - he asked the audience menacingly.
“I am writing them,” the President of ERVEZS answered in confusion! Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko's film “Oatmeal” was suddenly removed from the competition program - he would go to Venice: Mostra's selectors decided that an extra Russian screening was a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinotavr did not interfere with giants - films from major festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film “My Happiness”, which competed with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun on the Cote d'Azur in the spring, participated in the competition.
Nikita Sergeevich visited a film by a former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
On the contrary, the chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, did not like Loznitsa's film at all — but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to give her a prize for directing.
Daughter won the award for best debut — “The Missing”
A terrible film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to commit monstrous acts for no apparent purpose.
A precisely directed, purifying experience film directed by a math-trained misanthrope that only calls for one thing—start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical background, Mamulia calls the films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and argues that the viewer's joy lies in the work of understanding his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult film, Kinotavr, has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition — the director's star has been born.
An impeccably dressed and haircut programmer, Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in a hole in a neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, the hero's head is the unfair hand of the punitive authorities, and he begins to run senselessly through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
“Sometimes it's useful to work not only with debutants,” producer Sabina Yeremeyeva triumphantly said from the stage when she won the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabina simply managed to pull the “inner debutant” out of the luminary of Russian art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - now in our movies, bison are following young people.
It's not the other way around.
A documentary shot in such a way that blows your head off cleaner than a similar feature film.
The author is interested in a screwdriver exploring an electric meter and a piece of unsalted butter drifting through a cast-iron frying pan — all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare tooth lover and her criminal brother into a real docking canvas with butter.
Nikolay Sokolov, the winner of the short film competition, tries on the black and white style of the French new wave on the world of residential areas.
Godar's editing moves about two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other playing Bach backwards, may look strange, but thank you for the rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality.
“Three times a year, on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day, about ten An-12, IL-18, An-32, An-24 aircraft take to the sky during the work, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals — liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide (“dry ice”), meteorological pyrocartridges with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process is as follows: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break” clouds going to the city with these reagents. Particles of substances condense moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned and exactly where the cloud was impacted.”
For ten years, we have been working on a remake of a science fiction film starring Michael York.
Carl Rinsch (he already has a remake of Creatures from the Black Lagoon on his schedule), famous for his commercials, was recently appointed director.
The project was previously associated with the names of Brian Singer (X-Men), James McTeague (V for vendetta), and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy).
In the story, the hero, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death penalty, as the society of the future executes all citizens when they reach this age.
Robert Rodriguez acquired the rights to a rotoscopic fantasy cartoon from the 80s and plans to turn it into a large-scale movie.
The original was the result of a collaboration between director Ralph Bakshi (1976 film The Lord of the Rings) and fantasy artist Frank Fracetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of painted boobs.
In it, warrior Larne saves Princess Tiger and all the people from the evil ice lord Necron.
Rodriguez promises to be attentive to the creation of non-humans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will be sending his zombies on vacation soon, as 1 himself plans to remake Dario Argento's classic giallo film.
The characters will be returned to the wide screens by none other than Michael Bay, the lord of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero have already collaborated on Day of the Dead and filmed Two Evil Views together in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing and writing the film.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in a remake of the comedy Arthur
“I wanted to bring more strength to women's character to reflect the situation in China,” Chen says.
— Chinese women now run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gon Lee embodies this power.”
This is the second time in a row that you play an imaginary character.
Is this an accident?
Regularity.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE).
And I play a dream woman in both of them.
But... this is how the director saw me, that's how he introduced me, and a lot of people probably think I'm like this in real life.
A dream girl.
Your film partner Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his hero.
How did you find a common language? How is he on set?
It's absolutely not what it looks like.
At first I saw it and thought, “Yes... it's not easy for me.”
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded.
And we had this contact just a few minutes after we met.
I'm not afraid of the word, we became friends.
I told him about all my fears, all my worries, that I was afraid that I would not succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact and losing our mutual understanding.
That's why we watched the whole movie holding hands at the premiere.
How did the shooting go in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I visited for the first time.
I have never toured there, nor did I go there on vacation or when I was a child.
This city has its own special magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And this is a city you want to come back to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always has time everywhere.
So it wasn't difficult for you to play falling in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on screen, which many, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you?
You know, I'm not a professional actor.
And I'm a very trusting person by nature.
If I come and agree to work with a director, I'm actually putting my hands in his hands and I want to be a test to sculpt from.
I understand perfectly well what I know from the outside, and again, I ask for tips and talk to the director for a very long time, not even me talking to him, but he has preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and accurately what he needs.
And then, in long hours of rehearsals, we come to the organic matter you are talking about.
And how did you work with the film's director Klim Shipenko?
I enjoyed everyone, cameraman, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because it makes me so happy to work with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep or eat - and this was exactly the situation here.
Do not sleep, do not eat for days - and still, at least thunder, even hail.
And if something didn't work out, it was a disaster, and we urgently need to do something to make it happen.
It is very easy to work in this crazy atmosphere.
And it seems to me that when people are so painfully fanatical about what they do, it can't fail because too much energy is spent.
What scenarios do you reject?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you are going to work with?
I don't want nonsense, stupid dialogues, movies that say nothing, don't carry anything.
I don't want to work just to appear on screen again.
Do you have any proposals or projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals or plans at the moment.
I'm not a person who paints charts.
The script came in, I was interested in it, and this premiere took place today.

PUBLICITY BOOTH
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are almost continuous in Moscow: American cinema — Amfest, 2toggo\, 2-t-1 will soon begin, followed by the British Film Festival.
And here's the interesting thing: half of my friends are constantly discussing that someone should be boycotted and someone should be supported, for some — well, excuse me — very vague reasons.
At the same time, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with a terrifying CHU4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The last thing you want to do is grumble about this, but if you buy a ticket for money and stay in the hall looking at giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, they will show them to you.
Meanwhile, we have no pixels in the room: “Tron: Legacy” (a sequel to the classic virtual reality film), “Let me in. Saga” (an American remake of a beautiful Swedish film), “Uncontrollable” (another approach by Tony Scott to the topic of trains) and a wildly detailed story about how films about Conan, a barbarian, destroyer and governor were made.

AS A GIFT TO THE FIRST THREE READERS WHO ANSWERED CORRECTLY — AN ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTION AND OUO FROM THE COLLECTION
a multi-part fairy tale about a cute spectacled sorcerer is nearing completion.
And even if fans of the series have read the book a long time ago and know how it will end, and those to whom the word “Expelliarmus” does not say anything will stay at home, Harry has actually booked the title of the main blockbuster of November.
By the way, studios are not stupid either: in order to stretch the audience's pleasure and finally get the most out of the franchise, they decided to split the seventh film into two parts.
So the sentimental farewell to the magical world of Hogwards will last until next summer.
SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of Facebook
David Fincher's new film is primarily a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the Internet that brought the whole world together, quarreled five friends and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is as brilliant as our conflict genius, an emotionally isolated social exile with an unpredictable array of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a variety of reasons: partly because he's angry at the world around him, part because he's interested in sports, and partly simply because IT's “cool.”
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
Social Network's strengths are obvious from the first shots, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking to his ex-girlfriend Erika (Mara) at a bar five minutes away: screenwriter Aaron Sorkin's sonorous, tough dialogues are gaining momentum here and do not soften until the very end.
It's the same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins, it was played by different actors.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other using computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara landed the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR David Fincher
CAST: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ermie Hammer, Joshua Pence
STORY: Gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a personal turn from the gate, undertakes the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook grows in popularity, relationships with a few companion friends begin to break down and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays a role: warm, sunny in some places, and cozy even in the dark, it maneuvers between two confusing chains of events and two separate litigation.
Beyond the stream of ongoing discussions, not much is happening in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to make even an extra paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
So what drew 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this not-too-generous story?
After watching, there is a strong feeling that “The Social Network” is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic device.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street did about the same thing, only on a larger scale — with cosmic egos and big things.
Now that the daily solvency has become even higher, the policy is no longer being implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, wants to be the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is upset that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now has no one to play with.
The Winklevoss (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are stomping their feet: who said that the rich, beautiful and athletic can't even be smart?
(This line is particularly amusing for Fincher.)
If you wish, “Social Network” could well turn into a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with popularity and leadership, but what's more positive or negative about his case?
And what social consequences would his invention entail?
Is he a swindler?
Or a clever manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin would never close a book if it had even the slightest hint of something like this.
But that won't even be necessary here: it doesn't matter at all in their version of the story.
“How does it feel to be beautiful?” - asked in Tre Veanez's song “Wabu Uotz't A Vsp Map”, which precedes the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is part of a lost online generation that has little idea about beauty and even less about feelings.
A tastefully crafted character drama about a high-profile Internet era trial
At the beginning of the 17th century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames among people of unknown origin had not yet begun to appear.
They used the name “so-and-so, so-and-so son”.
That is, patronyms were used - nicknames after my father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of a father's remarriages, a matronym, a nickname after the mother's name, was used.
Susanin is just such a case: “Ivan, Susanna's son.”
Serfs of small landlords really did without names for a long time - why did she need her when you have 20 souls and everything is always in sight.
But the owners of thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants names.
Thus, Prince Andrei Cherkassky's serfs already at the beginning of the 18th century had surnames all without exception.
In the 19th century, even small landlords did not keep the man on the ground, but let him rent a man - let him earn money by craft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where he had to enter his surname.
By the time serfdom was abolished in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were paid off.
That means they already had names.
The capital's criminologists arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Criminologists from the central office and employees of the forensic science center arrived in Novosibirsk to help investigate the case of a gas explosion in a house at 39 Lineynaya Street, reports the NGS.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Yevgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictional organization Mezhregiongaz, inspected and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked inaccurately, and, on the contrary, overestimated the prices for their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy at Lineynaya Street, a man and a woman visited three apartments in house No. 39, where stove hoses were changed.
So, in one of the apartments, they installed a water hose instead of a gas hose.
Cavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything has been certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed, one completely and the other partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which resulted in the death of 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in connection with the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The fraudsters themselves came from Omsk.
Petersburg managed to avoid sea surge flooding
Arguments of the Week.

Experts were able to prevent the flood by closing the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg sharply increased due to bad weather in the city.
Marine surge flooding was prevented due to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd in a row, according to the St. Petersburg newspaper Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but due to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water kept at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters higher than the lower threshold of the dangerous flood level (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, which sometimes reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can once again sail across the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland are monitoring the situation with the water level.
This helps prevent flooding, which may be followed by increased winds.
In Turkey, 8 people were arrested in connection with the case of defects in collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Sanliurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with construction defects in buildings that collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
As reports Armenpress, Habertürk reports this.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20,000 people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80,000.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of tremors that were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, a World War II bomb exploded on Friday, which sappers tried to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard tens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
“The device detonated shortly after work began to neutralize it.
Fortunately, all personnel are safe.
Departments have begun assessing the damage, “Norfolk Police Assistant Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Photo caption: The explosion happened contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no dead or wounded
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea coast, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before trying to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective sand shaft around it, and the cordon, which was not allowed to enter, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
At first, on Thursday, the bomb experts were going to use a robot to cut off the fuse from the bomb, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to the local press, to use the technique of “slow burning” explosives.
During this burning, the explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
During the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from autumn 1940 to spring 1941, known as the Blitz, alone, 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Women account for almost 40% of Belarusian researchers
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, BelTA learnt from Alesya Solovey, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The share of women among PhDs and Doctors of Science is also increasing: 41.1% of PhDs are women and 21% of PhDs.
In all fields of science, with the exception of technical sciences, the share of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized field of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which women account for 64.4%.
Only men predominate in technical sciences, and 26.7% are women.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1%, which is 10.2% more than in the country as a whole.
The proportion of candidates of science is 46% among candidates of science, and 20% among doctors of science.
More than half of the teaching staff in higher education institutions are women (57%).
Among vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
The largest number of women among senior teachers and teachers is over 60%.
There is also a high proportion of women among associate professors in departments (55.2%).
According to the national monitoring of public opinion conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree with the gender stereotype “science is a male field of activity” to one degree or another.
More than half of the country's residents do not believe that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
“The transformation of gender ideas about women's research competence in the mass consciousness contributes to attracting young women to science, developing their creative potential, and forming a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring,” said Alesya Solovey.
On February 11, the International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated every year.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, encourage women to develop scientific careers and recognize women's achievements in science.
According to UNESCO, women account for 30% of the world's researchers.-0-
The probability of a future increase in the key rate is higher than its reduction
This statement was made by Elvira Nabiullina, Governor of the Bank of Russia, following a meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have taken place recently.
On the one hand, the terms of foreign trade have significantly deteriorated and prices for Russian oil have fallen.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is better than the October forecast.
The shift in the demand structure continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment is slowing down, but budget spending is increasing.
At the same time, proinflationary risks have generally increased.
“Therefore, this year the probability of a rate increase exceeds the probability of its reduction.
The feasibility of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation”, E. Nabiullina.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, consumption will increase rapidly in the face of increased inflation expectations, if the factors that constrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of workers and the lag between labor productivity growth and wage growth.
There are also still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Governor of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the increase in pro-inflationary factors noted earlier, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher key rate trajectory than expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this year and next year, the ranges for the average key rate were increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
“This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its probability and scale have decreased.
On the contrary, it has increased the likelihood that a slight rate increase may be necessary for inflation to meet the target of close to 4% in 2024,” the Governor of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual funds (UIF) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from existing retail mutual funds.
This will make it possible to start managing the remaining liquid assets and resume operations with investment units.
If the retail mutual fund contains more than 10% of the blocked securities, the management company must separate them into a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be given shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the fixed fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed fund.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is being introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, if such securities are sold, management companies are required to pay at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment units on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summing up the results of the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Promsvyazbank Center for Analytics and Expertise, in 2022, air passenger traffic in Russia decreased by 6.3%, and passenger traffic by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and the passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, while domestic traffic amounted to 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that state support programs have influenced the relative stability of the industry.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for flight tours prepared by the Federal Agency for Tourism.
In addition, to ensure the availability of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing citizens' transportation, developing regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to capitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
“Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of subsidies to the industry by the state (25.3 billion rubles have been allocated so far) in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4% to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, to 103.0 million people,” PSP analysts share their forecasts B.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem kills 6-year-old child
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were killed in a terrorist attack in Jerusalem when a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Six more people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It was later revealed that he was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental problems and was discharged from the hospital only this week.
Austria is once again tightening controls at the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people stay at the border in cars waiting for it to cross to the Austrian side.
Thus, this is a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already completed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants must remain in the country where the request was submitted.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send those wishing to cross the border back to Hungary: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, it is necessary to strengthen control.
The decision to tighten inspections by Vienna follows a promise by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to protect the borders of the Commonwealth.
According to Frontex, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status for the first time exceeded 2016 figures and amounted to more than 330,000.
Progress 83 cargo successfully docked to the ISS
The Progress 83 automatic resupply spacecraft successfully docked to the International Space Station on Saturday at 3.45 GMT, completing its two-day orbital flight.
The docking took place at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the South Pacific Ocean.
The docking was broadcast by NASA Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was supervised by specialists from the Mission Control Center.
Cosmonauts Sergey Prokopiev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina welcomed the cargo ship from the ISS.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, and about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur Cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported the depressurization of Progress MS-21, which was prepared to undock from the ISS and further flooding on February 18.
According to the company's press service, the ship's hatch was immediately closed: the Progress MS-21 was isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated.”
The MCC also reported that the ISS crew is not in danger: “The temperature and pressure on board the station are normal.
Nothing threatens the life and health of the crew, and they feel good.”
“Cases of maternity tourism have become more frequent.”
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permit for Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not stay in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic denied entry into the country to several pregnant Russian women who were suspected of arriving for the purpose of “maternity tourism”.
On February 11, they were finally allowed to enter Argentina by court order.
More details can be found in the Gazeta.Ru article.
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permit (residence permit) for Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not stay in the country.
Florencia Carignano, Director of the Service, told C5N about this.
“What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to obtain a residence permit because their child is Argentinian, but at the same time spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country),” she explained.
According to her, when the court considers the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian citizen, the migration service will file data that the residence permit was suspended because this person “spent a month in Argentina and never came again.”
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left may revoke it.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were “stuck” at an airport in Argentina due to a refusal to enter the country.
According to Georgy Polin, head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, the diplomatic mission attributes the incident to the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls at the entrance to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, and two more on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reported.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three specifically were ordered not to enter the country.
“They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the law on migration, where one of the grounds for preventing them from entering the country is to provide incomplete, false, distorted information,” Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine Migration Service, by court order, allowed pregnant Russian citizens to enter the country, said lawyer Christian Rubilar.
“An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina,” TASS quotes him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the Migration Service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a national passport.
It allows short-term trips to 171 countries without visas, including EU states, the UK and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian wrote about the “boom in maternity tourism” to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polina, in 2022, from 2,000 to 2,500 Russian citizens moved to the republic.
The diplomat noted that many of them are Russian women who are going to give birth there.
“In 2023, this number may grow to 10,000,” he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina in 2022, and more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women in recent months.
On February 9, it became known how rental prices in St. Petersburg have changed.
It has fallen in price by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that rent has become more expensive by 25% throughout the country, reports the Patrolman of St. Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-bedroom apartment cost 25,000 rubles a month, a studio 22,000 rubles a month, a two-room apartment cost 36,000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
The Argentine Migration Service did not allow six pregnant Russian women to enter the country, as the purpose of the visit, which they indicated, was false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the Todo Noticias TV channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them confessed that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not allow Russian women to enter Argentina.
According to the publication, the migration service has a procedure if there are suspicions of “false” travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is 33 weeks pregnant, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly tell where to go on vacation, then the migration service immediately suspects her.
Moreover, experts specify that it is difficult to be a traveler “in such conditions”.
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.
Alexander Filippenko, winner of the State Prize of the Russian Federation, said that the decision of the Mossovet Theater not to extend his contract was planned, and everything was agreed in advance with the management.
He said this in an interview with Interfax news agency.
Invite artists from the second cast to the productions he took part in.
The People's Artist of the Russian Federation clarified that his contract expired back in 2022.
All details have long been agreed with theater representatives.
Moreover, everyone knew that the star was not going to renew his contract.
Filippenko noted that the authorities went to the meeting and prepared all the documents.
Thus, he assures that “he did not let anyone down”.
In addition, it became known that the artist emigrated from Russia.
He flew to his heiress in Latvia.
Filippenko is going to undergo “long-term treatment” in a foreign country.
According to the publication, the film actor currently works as a guest actor at the Moscow theater.
According to the newspaper, the artist played in the Moscow City Council in such performances as Shakespearhamlet and The Taming of the Shrew, Uncle Vanya, and Three Sisters.
On Friday, February 10, 340,000 cubic meters of snow were removed from the private sector in Kalinin Autonomous Okrug.
This information was shared by the city hall.
Currently, there are more than four hundred private sector streets in Kalininsky District, from which snow must be removed by spring.
Roads will be cleaned in two stages.
The first one will end on February 15, and the second will take place from March 1 to April 15.
114 units of special equipment and 123 workers will take part in the cleaning.
Authorities reported that contractors are faced with the removal of snow to the roadway by residents of houses.
Kirkorov won a lawsuit against a fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man claimed that the construction of the artist was illegal, but did not appear at the hearing.
The fisherman sued music performer Philip Kirkorov because of an allegedly illegally installed pier at his cottage near Moscow.
Channel Five writes about this.
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were submitted to the court that confirmed the legality of all the structures installed on the territory of the celebrity house.
According to Alexander Dobrovinskaya, the head of the law firm, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff a chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The star lawyer jokingly said that the man probably planned to fish exclusively from the artist's house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He stressed that it is possible to continue throwing spinning from that place.
Somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Somnologist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often occur due to products containing caffeine.
This is primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, since they not only prevent falling asleep, but also make sleep “torn”, which means that they do not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop consuming caffeinated foods 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they help to reduce the excitability threshold of the nervous system and, as a result, it is difficult to fall asleep.
Alcohol also has a negative effect on the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts greater than 36 grams per pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as shallow sleep and frequent nocturnal awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends giving up spicy foods in large portions.
High volumes and spicy foods contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, you should not abuse heavy food before going to bed, as it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will have to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also recalled that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and habitual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to sleep and rest and allow the body to recover.
Bloomberg named Trump's rival in the upcoming presidential election: World: Politics: Infox.ru
According to the agency, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will be the ex-president's main rival in the upcoming elections.
Republican Desantis has not yet officially announced his intention to run for the presidency, but Bloomberg sources report that he is already preparing for the primaries.
According to the agency, Desantis's team is already selecting consultants to participate in the presidential elections and conducting preliminary surveys.

The agency reports that the Florida governor's team is seeking support among Republican colleagues from Iowa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and other states. Bloomberg experts named Desantis as Donald Trump's main potential rival.
Experts consider the current governor of Florida to be well-known enough not to need to start an election campaign right now, and also note his ability to raise money.
Ron DeSantis was a supporter of Donald Trump's nomination for president in 2017, and could compete with him in the upcoming presidential election in November 2024.
Donald Trump officially announced his intention to run for president “to make America great again”... during a speech to his supporters in Florida.
Current President Joe Biden, despite his team's assurances of his intention to participate in the 1960s presidential election, said that there was no firm decision on this issue.
Hundreds of demonstrations against pension reform will be held in France on Saturday
The fourth day of mass protests against pension reform is being held by French trade unions on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, French media reported.
After a slight decrease in the number of protesters last Tuesday compared to the first two “days of mobilization”, trade unions hope to bring more protesters to the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who were unable to participate in demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect from 600,000 to 800,000 demonstrators across the country, including 90,000 to 120,000 in Paris, the media write.
On February 7, 757,000 people took part in actions against pension reform, according to the French Ministry of Internal Affairs.
The largest trade union association, the General Confederation of Labor (CGT), announced 2 million demonstrators.
The CGT also estimates that 400,000 demonstrators took to the streets in Paris on Tuesday.
Police say there were 57,000.
On the previous day of protests, January 31, the number of demonstrators was 1.27 million, according to police estimates, and 2.8 million, according to trade unions.
The next mass protests are scheduled for February 16.
As reported, on January 10, French Prime Minister Elisabeth Born presented a draft pension reform developed by the government, which provides for increasing the retirement age from 62 to 64 years.
It is expected that the established retirement age will be gradually shifted from 62 years to 64 to three months per year, and this process will last until 2030.
The new regime will be applied starting with generations of French people born in or after September 1961.
During the 2022 election campaign, French President Emmanuel Macron announced his determination to carry out pension reform before the end of his second presidential term.
On February 6, the French National Assembly began considering the government's draft pension reform.

Progress MS-21 depressurization occurred on the ISS: 12 February 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos announced the depressurization of Progress MS-21, which was prepared to undock from the ISS, Kazinform reports with reference to TASS.
“The contour of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship, which is scheduled to be sank on February 18, has been depressurized, confirmed telemetry data received by the MCC,” the press service of Roscosmos reported.
As noted, it is currently isolated from the total volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being clarified; it did not affect either the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo ship or the further ISS flight program.
Sergey Krikalev, Executive Director of Roscosmos for Manned Space Programs, commented on the situation.
“The cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months, leaked the coolant from the thermal control system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to our ship (Soyuz MS-22 - approx. TASS) in mid-December,” he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with Soyuz came to the conclusion that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to ensure that there are no problems during the next launches.
“We need to conduct an in-depth analysis to make sure that this reason does not apply to similar structures at future launches.
This is the main task we will face now,” he said.
According to the Executive Director, an analysis will be carried out in terms of preparing the ship for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used to assemble the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the Soyuz MS-22 ship's damaged radiator.
“The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some systematic error,” Krikalev added.
The Executive Director clarified that a commission began its work on Saturday, which will analyze all possible causes.
“The ship was supposed to be undocked and launched from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz MS-23 spacecraft - approx. TASS), so there are serious consequences for the actions of the crew, on the work of the crew... From this point of view, this will not affect the program,” Krikalev said.
The Progress MS-21 truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle on October 26.
Two days later, it docked to the Poisk small research module of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The ship delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA named the place of depressurization “Progress”
The depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo ship on the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was announced by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during talks with the ISS crew, broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant is completely out.
“This morning we had a refrigerant leak from the thermoregulation system into space, the refrigerant leak stopped,” said the representative of the American MCC (quoted by Interfax).
Previously, due to depressurization, the Progress circuit was isolated.
Roscosmos reported that cosmonauts are not in danger.
Progress MS-22 docked to the ISS today, February 11, and will be launched from orbit, according to plan, on February 18.
John Kirby, Strategic Communications Coordinator at the US National Security Council, refused to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.
He told reporters about this at a briefing and was broadcast on the White House YouTube channel.
Kirby noted that he “has nothing to announce about additional points of travel” by the American leader to Poland.
The day before, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre announced Biden's visit to Poland from February 20 to 22.
According to a representative of the administration, during the trip, the US President will discuss bilateral cooperation with the Polish leadership, as well as collective efforts to support Ukraine and strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities.

A fitness expert talked about outdoor training in winter to lose weight
A fitness expert called walking in winter a great way to lose weight without intense exercise
Fitness expert Anthony Yeung talked about effective outdoor interval training for weight loss.
His words are quoted by the Eat This, Not That portal.
The specialist called active walks in winter an excellent way to reduce weight without intense exercise, as well as improve cardiovascular health and psychological health.
“For the first five to ten minutes, walk at a normal pace to warm up your body and joints.
Then walk as fast as you can for one minute without running.
One minute at a normal pace,” Yeung explains.
Three approaches need to be taken.
Then the specialist advises doing lunges or squats with weights for 15 seconds, and then walking at a comfortable speed for another 45 seconds.
You need to repeat this sequence five times. Then Yeung suggests alternating between an active step (two minutes) and a quiet one (one minute) three more times.
You need to complete the walk with a five-minute walk at a quiet pace and several stretching exercises.
In total, this workout will require 35 minutes in the fresh air.
Earlier, Maxim Babenko-Kudryavtsev, Master of Sports in Athletics, gave advice on choosing equipment for winter jogging in a comment to Lente.ru.
“We will need thermal underwear, moisture-wicking clothes, special lightweight but warm hats.
Running shoes in winter are characterized by denser materials, a higher platform and sole protector,” said the athlete.
On February 17, the Central Hall will host a creative evening for an Orthodox writer, historian, screenwriter, member of the joint venture of Russia.
Writers, screenwriters and scientists will take part in the evening.

The head of Serpukhov checked the content of the MKD
Sergey Nikitenko, the head of Serpukhov, made a working tour of the territories.
Together with representatives of management organizations, he inspected the maintenance of apartment buildings and residential buildings.
The addresses from which most requests from residents were received were under the strictest control.
- Many comments are fully justified and relate primarily to cleaning entrances and maintaining public areas.
Serpukhovichi themselves do not stand aside and are actively fighting the problem of vandalism, especially common in terms of graffiti.
We will work out the issue taking into account the Safe Region cameras,” said Sergei Nikitenko, the head of the municipality.
Attention was also drawn to the replacement of post cells, light bulbs, the installation of wires in boxes, and the untimely removal of garbage from container sites.
As soon as possible, management companies must solve all their tasks.
The Deputy General Director of Russian Railways invited the Governor of the Irkutsk Region to explore new sales areas
The Irkutsk Region needs to continue to develop alternative sales routes, except for the Far East.
This includes both the domestic market and Western ports, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by Alexey Shilo, Deputy General Director of Russian Railways, at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year has shown, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the companies' logistics services constantly interact with our “related companies” (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal price conditions for transporting their products under new schemes,” said Alexey Shilo.
The Governor noted the importance of stable product shipments; the Irkutsk Region is one of the richest regions in the Russian Federation in mineral resources and has significant reserves of coal and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises in the region are engaged in coal mining.
The instability of export shipments has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that the Irkutsk Region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Realizing the importance of the Irkutsk Region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to support traffic volumes.
If there are additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market, we are also ready to provide assistance in this area,” said Alexey Shilo.
Konstantin Zaytsev held a meeting with activists from the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo
On behalf of Igor Kobzev, Governor of the Region, Konstantin Zaitsev, Chairman of the Government of the Angara Region, worked today in the villages of Granovshchina and Khomutovo, Irkutsk District.
In the village of Granovshchina, the Prime Minister got acquainted with the work of a new educational institution, the Granovskaya School, which was opened in September 2022.
The facility was built as part of the federal project “Modern School” of the national project “Education”.
Eight school blocks house: classrooms, a dining room, a catering unit, an assembly hall, two gyms, club rooms, a library, administrative rooms, bathrooms, public recreation, and a medical unit.
240.8 million rubles were allocated from the federal budget for construction, more than 512 million rubles from regional funds and more than 72 million rubles from the municipality.
In addition, a regional subsidy was allocated for the purchase of equipment in the amount of 64.2 million rubles.
After opening, in addition to children from the village of Granovshchina, children from the Urikov school, which was undergoing major repairs, studied at the school.
The classes are taught by more than 100 teachers, of which almost 90 are subject teachers.
In 2022, the school was allocated a bus purchased by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation under the federal program.
The overhaul of Khomutov Secondary School No. 2 began in 2022.
Primary school students were assigned to Khomutov School No. 1, and high school students study in the second building of school No. 2.
According to the repair plan, the roof, utilities, windows and related elements will be replaced here, the facade will be repaired, and the interior decoration will be carried out.
An important component of the overhaul is the reconstruction of a heating station with water heating, instead of which dry heat was used.
The cost of all works is more than 80 million rubles.
Repairs are in the final stages, problems with connecting to power grids - it is necessary to increase capacity, and work is underway with the power supply organization.
In addition, Konstantin Zaytsev held a meeting with citizens in Granov and Khomutovo, some of whom were sold by developers illegally connected to power grids.
It was decided that the network company will organize a personal reception next week to legally resolve these issues.
- Very often, the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes arbitrarily connect houses to nearby networks, and this is the reason for cutting off the power supply.
Therefore, now grid companies in those territories where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue,” Konstantin Zaitsev emphasized.
Anatoly Prokopyev assessed the effectiveness of state support measures for UOBO peasant farms
Anatoly Prokopyev, the head of the UOBO, visited three peasant farms in Ekhirit-Bulagatsky District today.
Yulia Madayeva, the head of a peasant farm in the village of Kapsal, received a grant to develop her farm as a novice farmer in 2014.
One of the main activities of the farm is the production of livestock products.
Every year, the number of livestock is increasing and the gross production of meat and milk is increasing.
Later, thanks to state support, it became possible in 2019 to participate and win a grant in the form of subsidies for the development of a family dairy farm.
Today, the farm has about 150 cattle, 60 of them cows.
In addition, they grow crops and sow annual fodder crops here.
Thanks to the activities of Viktor Katanaev's peasant farm, the Kharyashino area in the village of Kulunkun has been transferred to the category of settlements.
The farm grows and fattens dairy cattle.
In 2014, a grant was received to develop a family dairy farm for 60 animals.
Today, the farm has 150 cattle.
They have also been growing potatoes here for many years.
The head of the peasant farm tries to create all the necessary conditions for the team to work and live.
The farm now has an entire village.
Anatoly Prokopyev took personal control of the construction of two km of road from Kharyashino to Ust-Ordynsky.
The main activities of Stalin Mogzoeva's peasant farm in the village of Otonkhoy are raising cattle and buffaloes.
In 2020, the farm participated in the competitive selection and received an AGROSTARTUP grant for the development of a meat farm.
These funds were used to purchase a tractor trailer, two balers and a mower.
The head of the farm annually increases the number of livestock and increases gross meat production.
In addition, peasant farms sow annual fodder crops on an area of 40 hectares.
Stalin Mogzoeva plans to open a feedlot.
Following a visit to three farms, the head of the district noted that state support measures are effective, necessary and necessary.

The crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the first time in decades to deliver humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alijan border crossing point on the border between Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to victims of the earthquake.
Turkish and Armenian media write about this.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating 1988 earthquake, the Turkish Anadolu Agency notes.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicines, water and other emergency packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, Ankara's special representative for the Armenian-Turkish talks, Serdar Kilic, said.
He expressed gratitude to Ruben Rubinyan, Deputy Speaker of the Armenian Parliament, and Vahan Kostanyan, Deputy Foreign Minister of Armenia.
“I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the region affected by the earthquake,” Kilic wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vahan Hunanyan, in turn, said that trucks carrying humanitarian aid crossed the border across the Margara Bridge and are heading to the region affected by the earthquake.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu Agency cites other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border crossing was last used to supply humanitarian goods to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating 1988 earthquake.
At that time, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was supplied to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, more than 25,000 people died in Turkey and Syria from Monday's devastating earthquake.
On February 11, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that 21,848 people died in Turkey.
The Syrian side reported 3,553 dead.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are mainly overshadowed by Ankara's refusal to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Yerevan and Ankara have recently made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for third-country nationals as soon as possible.

Russian mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter Islam Makhachev received a prestigious award from the Absolute Fighting Championship (UFC), winning the Submission of the Year Award for his early victory in a duel with Brazilian Charles Oliveira.
Submission of the Year.

And I beat the most dangerous fighter on the ground.
I know I deserve this award.

In particular, he said that he was impressed by the player's performance at the last World Cup.
According to him, the 22-year-old midfielder will be a great boost for the Blues, as he can play in different positions.
“Fernandes is Makelele plus Lampard.
If you want him to play as Makelele, he can play very well there.
This guy also has a good scoring sense, a good shot from outside the penalty area, so if you need him to play under a striker like Lampard or Essien, he can do it, “Crespo told British media.
Let us remind you that Enzo Fernandes moved to Chelsea for 121 million euros.
At the 2022 World Cup, he played 7 matches, scored 1 goal and made 1 assist.

Prediction for the Club World Cup match Real Madrid vs Al Hilal on February 11, 2023
On February 11, Prince Mula Abdullah Stadium in Rabat, Morocco, will host the final of the Club World Cup.
Real Madrid and Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia will meet for the trophy.
The game will start at 10:00pm Moscow time, and matchtv.ru and Match! Soccer 2".
BETCITY analysts consider Blancos to be huge favorites: you can bet on Real Madrid's victory in regular time at odds of 1.28, the probability is about 77%.
Nominal guest success is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even for a draw, a noticeably lower quotation of 6.10 (15%) is offered.
Do you believe that teams won't find the strongest team in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1000 rubles on a “peaceful” result will bring 6,100 rubles if you win.
You can bet on Madrid's triumph, taking into account extra time and a penalty shootout, for 1.14, while Al-Hilal's market is for 5.80.
The Saudi Arabian team overcame two rounds on their way to the final, beating Wydad in a penalty shootout and Brazil's Flamengo in regular time (3-2).
You can bet that the underdog will at least not lose to the Europeans in 90 minutes in 3.90 minutes.
Analysts are looking forward to a large number of goals: a total of over 2.5 goals is available for 1.53, TM 2.5 for 2.60.
Blancos are clearly superior in class to the opponents, whose roster, according to the Transfermarkt statistical website, is only 39.6 million euros.
For comparison, Real's roster is valued at 849 million euros.
In addition, to Al-Hilal's dismay, Madrid's chief striker and current Ballon d'Or winner Karim Benzema will recover by the final.
But even without the Frenchman, Real Madrid are performing effectively at this tournament: they defeated Egypt's Al-Ahli 4-1 in the semifinals.
The Arabian matches were also quite bright: in the quarter-finals they drew 1:1 and won the penalty shootout, and in the semifinals they scored a dramatic 3:2.
Recommended bet: Real Madrid and TB 2.5 win for 1.76.
Guberniev said that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
Famous TV commentator Dmitry Guberniev said that midfielder Pavel Mamaev has decided to end his playing career.
“Now it will be possible to cast a bust in the hero's homeland.
He made a big mistake and most people will remember him not as a football player, but as a delinquent football player.
But he's still a long way from Kokorin.
Because no one could lose their potential like Kokorin.
For all his talents, Mamaev was periodically visible.
I can only wish him good luck and realize himself somewhere else,” Metaratings.ru quotes Guberniev.
Khimki was the 34-year-old midfielder's last club.
The Moscow Region club did not renew the midfielder's contract in the summer of 2022.
Previously, Mamaev played for Torpedo, CSKA, Krasnodar and Rostov.
Mamaev is the champion of Russia, a three-time winner of the Russian Cup and a two-time winner of the National Super Cup with CSKA.

A tanker with a diesel engine from a ship previously flying the Russian flag was not allowed to enter the port of Spain
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine under the Spanish Ministry of Transport banned Maersk Magellan from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel ship, which was flying the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
“The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development banned entry to the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel on the Maersk Magellan ship under the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it carries comes from the Cameroonian flag ship Nobel, which until July 1, 2022 sailed under the Russian flag,” the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with EU legislation, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag since April 16, 2022 or changed its flag after February 24, 2022.
The Ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed.
The Ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships are prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the Black Star vessel flying the Maltese flag, which was carrying cargo from a ship flying the Russian flag, was denied access at the port of Barcelona.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, the US and the UK imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.
Since December 5, 2022, the price ceiling imposed by unfriendly countries for maritime oil supplies from the Russian Federation has been in effect.
At that time, the ceiling on Russian oil was set at $60/bbl.
The EU has also had an embargo on maritime oil supplies from Russia since December 5.
The problems that pregnant Russian women have with entering Argentina explained
According to the expert, against the background of the influx of people wishing to have a child in Argentina, the country's authorities have begun to monitor more closely the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
Difficulties with pregnant Russian women entering Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This was reported by “Lenta.ru” with reference to Viktor Kheyfets, Professor of St. Petersburg State University, editor-in-chief of the magazine “Latin America”.
According to him, no country supports this practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transit point, not a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practices.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the court will decide to grant an Argentine passport to parents after obtaining a residence permit.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and left immediately, citizenship may be denied.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the expert pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship under the “law of the soil”, that is, if a person was born on its territory.
An Argentine passport allows visa-free visits to 170 countries, including EU countries and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke the residence permit of Russians who received a document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the reasons for the trip.
Russia predicts the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs
In Russia, citizens' interest in fitness services is recovering, which allows market participants to expand their businesses.
This year, the country may open more than 400 new facilities, mostly small-format ones.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, and their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to “Kommersant”, at the same time, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8,600 clubs in Russia.
According to the newspaper, most of the new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
Olga Kiseleva, President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, told the publication that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
Elena Silina, President of the NFS, noted that since 2020, there have been more club closures than discoveries every year.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 per cent.
At the same time, independent analysts provide different figures.
According to Kontur.Focus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main activity of “fitness center work” has increased by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but it began to recover back in 2021.
According to 2GIS data, there are 4,500 fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over a million.
Russians have begun to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
At the end of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis indicators by the end of the year.
A management company from Kirov was deprived of its license
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region revoked the license for entrepreneurial activities to manage apartment buildings issued by the management company Zabota.
In the Kirov Region, by decision of the Regional Arbitration Court, a license to carry out entrepreneurial activities to manage apartment buildings previously issued to the management company Zabota was revoked.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but came into force only in February 2023.
The arbitration tribunal revoked the “manager”'s license for ignoring the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate several times.
Currently, all facilities that were managed by “Care” have been excluded from the register of licenses for entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64,800 square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The Kirov administration knows that they were left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor's office about the current situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the Governor of the Kirov Region, Alexander Sokolov, set the task of the State Housing Inspectorate to liquidate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, as there are too many of them.
The Kirov Communists questioned the legality of the governor's demands.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the Federal Antimonopoly Service could have taken the same position.
Antimonopoly officials allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to verify the legality of the actions of the head of the region.

At the same time, they must be decorated in certain colors and have a specified image.
Packages are purchased at the expense of PVZ owners, if this obligation is not fulfilled, they are fined 10,000 rubles for each violation.
Previously, Wildberries customers accused the site of debiting funds from cards whose details were previously removed from their personal account.
Buyers fear that this is associated with high security risks.
The support service, in turn, explained that this is provided for by the user agreement.
As follows from it, the company has the right to debit money from deleted cards without notifying the customer if payment from others does not work for one reason or another.
Commenting on the situation, the company said that settlements with customers are made with the permission of customers, and there can be no leakage of bank card data.

My daughter and I came to apply for a pension.
They received them cordially, explained everything was clear, the documents were scanned, the application was filed, and they told how to make an appointment for subsequent appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and security are greeted culturally and respectfully.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although it would be nice to buy another water cooler.
We came twice, everything is fine!
I wish all employees peace, prosperity, good luck and a decent salary at this difficult time for everyone!!!
It's just a great place!
After a long walk along the beach, there's nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine waiting for a scallop salad (which tastes amazing!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A nice cash register employee asked me to make me 200 or 300 ml of coffee with herself or in the hall.
I asked for 300 ml in the gym.
They give me a plastic cup in a couple of minutes.
I wanted to be in ceramics, so I wanted to be in the hall.
They made it to me.
I'm asking why it's in a cup and not in a cup.
The girl replies that they say they do not have 300 ml cups.
Is this how a person can think of it?
Ask yourself or in the gym, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or a disposable cup.
Get an answer in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Clarify the volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
To confront a person with the fact that there are no cups of this volume.
Here, they say, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Zelena Okolica in my memory.
It is doubly noteworthy that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink my coffee the way I wanted. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the Green Okolica Cafeteria and Zelenaya Okolitsa sides of the same coin or organization not related to each other?
If unrelated, understanding emerges.
If they are related, why did a food and trading company known in the city for its service and quality descend to the rhetoric of a stall at the Kazansky railway station?
The rhetoric is because, let me repeat, this is the third time such an incident has happened to me.
I don't rule out that it's not just me that's happening.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I was under the impression that she was acting on a whim.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please write down the actions for your employees in this case, even if you are trying to use the service.
We like the circus very much; we have been going there since we were children.
I saw numbers with Nikulin Y. himself.
And now with children and nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, and so do the programs.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
You can see the arena from almost anywhere and the backs in front of those sitting in front do not bother you.
The circus is very intimate and family-friendly!
this time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a magic room and more animals.
It's a pity that you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby anymore.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
Overall a very nice place!!
I wish you prosperity and please us with your rooms!!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, he chooses good places for building residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to see the complex, when there were no walls yet, so that we could see everything live, although no developer offered us how many apartments we looked at.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The buzz is the gentle sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks seem boring and short for me.
The longest ones are on sector e, there are even less.
But overall, the atmosphere is great, there are many different cafes and bars, so a fun ski mood is guaranteed!
Great master Peri!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the cabin is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, cloakroom and water.
Disgusting service.
This is the second time I come to pick up my order by the time it is ready, which is indicated in the application, and I have been waiting for my order at the windowsill for more than 30 minutes.
Such a service is unacceptable in business today!
The “care” response is we're trying.
At the checkout, even without an apology, it's just that it's not our fault, it's a program.
You did not find any other technical ways to contact your regular previously loyal customers.
Impotent people are “trying”, but business should work.
Thank you all, we're all leaving.
We will not order more from you, let alone recommend it.
A spoiled mood, waiting for guests, an apology from the hostess are not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
I expected to receive the car in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border between Lithuania and Belarus (Lithuania complied).
As a result, I am very pleased with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, and all necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge are available.
Among the shortcomings, we can single out too little space; the bathroom has a terribly small shower.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and there is not much place to dry things, we had to take a dryer from the owners and shove it instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
And so, in general, a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean and spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
The prices are reasonable.
There are wines and beers available for those who want to drink.
I recommend the center of Moscow
A wonderful place with very courteous staff, we will definitely come again.
The property has all the necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
The rooms are well maintained and have all the amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we took a walk during our visit to Kaliningrad.
I liked it very much, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In winter, there are many natural slides for children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We constantly shop here, the prices are low and the quality is up to par!
Very helpful staff, will advise and answer all your questions)
I recommend this store to everyone to visit! ❤️
The location is convenient for anyone.
It's normal for me personally.
They serve quickly if any of the visitors are not stupid.
It's convenient to record.
The staff is attentive, they will advise, guide and advise even if they are not on reception days.
It's basically fine.
Great guys!
Thank you so much!
Everything was done quickly and promptly, the prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought the remote would be ejected, and they were so smart enough to do everything for me.
Many thanks to the young guys!
Ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours on March 8.
After 6 hours, the flowers were brought in a package, as if they had been stolen (barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the site and the color was not at all what I ordered.
I decided to count and it turned out that there were even 20 tulips.
The support in WhatsApp responded to my indignation about the color and number of colors “apparently mixed up the color”.
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
I think this is an extreme degree of audacity and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent an application to the tax office that I was refused to issue a check.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I would not recommend anyone to contact this entity.
For more than 10 years I have been going to master Samira to dye and cut my hair.
I would like to cancel Master Samira's professionalism, she does a great job, and I am always happy with her work.
She always listens carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I safely recommend this master to all relatives and friends.
All her works are always top notch!!! '
A huge thank you to Master Samira 😍
Welcome to this gaming club, I can say the prices are excellent, there are a lot of gaming computers, drinks and food are also available.
Of the minuses, some keyboards are broken, buttons fly off, if you take “normal gameplay”, then computers do not pull well :(
So score 4 🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
My son goes to his group to work out, and my mother goes to a fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super attentive, the coaches are professional.
They organize themed holidays for children, monitor cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and study.
A 6-year-old child is already good at taking a blow, a strong physical training.
Recommended for children, moms and dads)
The best craftsmen!
Irina is just gold!!
She does the work efficiently, carefully, and clarifies everything.
You can always talk to girls about something!
It was the third time!
I'll never regret it!
Finally I can grow my hair after bleaching!!!
Vita also studies color.
Therefore, she will soon be able to combine blon with keratin!
And your hair will thank you 🥰🥰
Master receiver Elena Polyanskaya is a very sympathetic master, she clearly explained everything that is included in routine maintenance.
She also provided all possible assistance during the repair of my car.
As well as thanks to Master Valery Ushakov for his attentive and professional work.
I was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out efficiently.
The only thing that confused me when signing up for maintenance was the insufficiently correct information on the work regulations; when you came to the maintenance, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Administration staff.
It took a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve the real estate transaction, the employees were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, although they could refuse, as this is not their responsibility.
Thank you so much!
Very sincere people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, I did not regret coming to this hairdresser! 👍
Master Nahida made an impeccable highlight, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it to everyone ❤️
I liked it very much in the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Restored for the 800th anniversary, everything inside is stylish and clean.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on a tour, it's also great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly wonderful collection
We have known Olya for more than 3 years, and we use the services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya is developing in her favorite business, constantly learning new things and expanding the space for four-legged animals, which only causes admiration and trust.
We always leave our dog with peace of mind.
Daily video reports will be picked up/taken away by zootaxi if necessary.
They will also bring clean and tasty food)
generally a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for your care and personal attention to our pets 🐕💜
The Syty Moose restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
Delicious meals are prepared.
The menu is varied.
Before visiting, it is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
Nice well-maintained zoo.
Smaller than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
There were 300 rubles for an adult on weekdays, 170 rubles for a schoolboy.
There were few people, they enjoyed walking and looking at the animals.
The anteater impressed)
By the way, he was not seen in Moscow.
There are a couple of reasonably priced cafes on site, the toilet is clean and free, and we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend it 👍
The salon is top notch!!!
I am very pleased with the services of cosmetologist Natalia Kuznetsova, I only go to her.
I do various facial cleansing - both hardware and mechanical.
I am 100% satisfied.
Master of his craft 👍
Everything tells in detail about the characteristics of the skin, I chose cosmetics that care for my skin type, just perfect.
Now I go happy and beautiful!!!
Thanks to Natalia!!!
A great club with a huge space, a swimming pool, a sauna, a hamam and great trainers!
Among the drawbacks, there are a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker rooms.
It feels like they come to the club like a public bath!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting at 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I give a top 3 only thanks to my first visit, when I got to a consultant, if I'm not mistaken to Timur, but I may be mistaken.
I designed everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything is clear, my son also decided to issue a card, and alas, the consultants are busy with their business, the clients are waiting, the consultant approached my son as a result, who ended up in the meeting room several times, having fun discussing something, as a result, my son left without formalizing anything, the consultant said, well, you don't want it as you like, since I was present at this I was surprised at the meeting.
The new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and this attitude is the same.
It is a pity that the first impression was lost, now we are visiting another branch, and the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to pellets), the staff knows its range and helps in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim woman and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are located near the subway, there is even a small parking lot.
We recommend it!
I was in September and celebrated my birthday.
Basically, I liked everything about the service and the quality of the food: the prices are low, the portions are medium in size, so you can eat or order them again.
The only complaint is booking a table.
When I ordered, I indicated the number and everything I needed, and then the bot immediately called to check the phone.
Nothing more.
When I went to the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been booked.
We were lucky to have free seats and we were able to accommodate us.
And so, in fact, it is a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
I recommend it!
Went to clean up last weekend.
This is the first time I see such organized staff who were as sensitive as possible to many of my questions and suggested how and what should be done for further dental treatment.
I heartily recommend it, the only clinic where they don't want to heat up with money in my memory.
Good shopping mall.
We have it all!
A large range of goods.
A variety of stores.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
Don't go to this store again.
we bought a washing machine, told us we were out of town, so we'll take it ourselves.
the manager in the hall said where to go to the warehouse, when asked “will they load”? said yes.))
they took it out in the warehouse without a box, when asked why? they answered that this is how everyone loads.
When I insisted, they put in two strips of penoplex, like it will do!
they refused to load it into the trailer, they say it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery)))
When she said that then I would cancel the order altogether, they said “whatever you like, we don't care”, and eventually one went down to get down the ramp and help his father shove the car into the trailer.
this is the first time I have encountered such boorish service.
Good shopping center Clean tidy. A large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a “Cosmic” cinema and an entertainment center for children “Nevidalia”.
There is a large Lenta Hypermarket on the ground floor.
Convenient, large parking lot convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and household goods.
A varied range of products, reasonable prices, courteous, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help you with the choice and advise you.
There is something for everyone.
Good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very good and the place is nice.
I advise everyone to never make the wrong choice. The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be great.
I recommend visiting)
We express our gratitude to Marina Sentinel, who was our funeral agent.
When she came to us on call, she took care of all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was in touch all the time and informed us how things were going.
Thanks to her, we spent a loved one with dignity.
Everything was formalized and clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, well aware of the condition of her loved ones, gave advice on how it would be better and simply sympathized with us in a human way.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thanks for everything.
Flattered by the many good reviews, I turned to RemStirmash and I was appointed Master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for service.
We discussed everything and set a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call from the master in the morning and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complicated application (how is that? but where is “completely free?”) and, if he can, he will appear after 6 pm instead of the scheduled 2 pm.
We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but in 2 hours.
What are these tricks?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all the planned tasks are on the side!
In short, the clever craftsman Ivan arrived and fixed the breakdown, for which I thank him.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening observations did not meet expectations at all.
First, there was a short lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, the children went to watch several times, the adults were crowded and could not let others see it.
The objects we looked at through the telescope were the size of an ordinary star and can be viewed for free without a telescope.
The girl did not answer the questions very clearly, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600 rubles.
The stunning place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
Sit down after eating 2-3 meals for two (very large portions) + a cocktail, about 2500 rubles 👌
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequilla, for example, Macho Boracho, I highly recommend trying it.
The price is 420 rubles for 0.5 liters.
In general, the restaurant itself has very tasty cuisine, I don't know about others, but I really liked it, I advise my friends to go there)
Great store, I've been buying goods from them for a long time, since the very opening.
Good quality goods.
I bought a mixer, five years have passed, and it is working properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when they were renovating the global apartment, they took everything they needed right here.
Great gas station!!!
It is very convenient, there is also a guard between the center and the side of the region, in general it is convenient)!
The gas quality is good, I have been refueling twice a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is excellent!!!
Eagles do not cheat on cards and for cash, by volume.
I liked the store!
You can choose any model, at a reasonable price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help you choose.
I took a laptop for my daughter to study, because her laptop was covered.
We helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! 👍
He works as a sommelier.
he helped me choose wine, because it's hard to figure out such a large menu on your own.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting and charming Vasily; there are not enough such people in Moscow.
I ate walleye - it's magical, respect to the cook.
Children's menu is like everywhere else: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. Mine ate pizza, it's FIRE here!
Adults appreciated truffle, and children appreciated ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - this is a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling and friendly.
We enjoyed it.
WB's brand new pick-up point is conveniently located.
Working hours, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week and holidays.
There are fitting rooms inside the PVZ.
It's a very good place.
Real professionals work here who are always ready to help.
There is also a group and chat in WhatsApp for informative communication.
Fast delivery.
I am glad that you can immediately look at the product and try it on.
It's great to be close to home.
A great, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that is stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, and there is a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Easy check-in, private parking at the entrance.
Solid 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different shows.
Today we attended the play “The Frog Princess”.
At the moment, this is the best of children's performances.
It was very interesting, there were a lot of dolls and special effects.
Even a 14-year-old son just went for the company and said that it was a very good performance.
My husband and I vacationed for 10 days in January 2023.
The vacation was a success on “5", I liked everything!
Let me start one by one:
On the day of arrival, they called us, asked what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price was 850 rubles), arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, we let us pass the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, arranged quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator — this is a big plus!
The double room is spacious, the floors in both the room and the bathroom are warm (unheated), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two chairs), panoramic windows (in building 5).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a lady's table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, towels and linen are changed at your request, but if you do not ask for a change, they still change them on the 4th day, the linen is of good quality.
The area is well-groomed, there are benches everywhere, clean paths, and beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus takes you to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
The public transport stop is 5 minutes away.
Friendly guys in the dining room will always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but whoever is going for what, we were perfectly satisfied with everything, and the choice and quality, there were always fish and chicken and meatballs, etc., vegetables for garnish every day, our pastries are delicious, more than 4 drinks, grain coffee, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, but cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 °C, it was sunny.
I liked everything and really had a rest.
There is a desire to come again and in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the pool will not be put into operation and the gym in any way.
Thanks to all the staff of the resort for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to “Flight” since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She likes everything very much, the coach praises it) this is the most important thing.
We are going to see Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I never thought my daughter was so flexible!
While wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to visit this promising place - and it was right!
Prices are very affordable, and incredibly delicious pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, not even a crust remains.
Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend:)
It just so happened that I was admitted to Tomarov hospital with blood pressure and a high heart rate.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, window sills, furniture and doors are cleaned.
The food is healthy, but great!!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they bring tea and a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, everyone puts both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While the drip is standing, they will come in and ask about how you feel...
Previously, I had a chance to do a heart ultrasound, but this is the first time (unfortunately, I don't know the doctor's name, young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Claudia Fedorovna!
A true professional: attentive, competent, gives an exhaustive answer to any question; she chose the dosage and medications that normalized both blood pressure and heartbeat, which she could not previously achieve after consulting other doctors.
Many thanks to the head physician Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thanks to the medical staff, nurses, and chefs!
When visiting customer service, the impression was good.
An administrator met in the hall.
Competent and courteous specialists promptly and patiently help customers with all questions asked.
The specialist assisted in submitting the application and explained my question.
For a small store, there is a very good selection of products.
There are convenience foods, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, and various small things.
It works around the clock, which is very convenient, and the staff is always friendly
It's great when there's a place in town where you can ride from the mountains.
The lifts are yoke and on weekends, of course, there is a 40-second descent and a 5-10 minute queue.
But overall, it's cool to immerse yourself in the positive atmosphere and winter, even if the roads are dirty and damp.
I contacted the service to repair the iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted master Alexander directly, who explained all the details of the repair and immediately outlined the price limits.
Thank you for the renovation, everything was done efficiently.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show everything and tell you everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was touched and focus was lost.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The bug was fixed as soon as possible, everything is working properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is a pleasure to have a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are affordable.
If repairs are needed again, I will definitely contact you!
It is large, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical sites, the condition requires close, prompt and high-quality attention from restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to creators, not owners
Great w/c
Responsive concierges, garbage is cleaned, clean and beautiful on site, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the subway by public transport
We have opened a good, cozy place to relax in our district.
There are all the shops you need.
A killer and varied food court.
The tables are located in cozy areas.
There's no crowding.
Well, we visited, tried it...
The interior has nothing in common with an Italian cozy cafe...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like the dining room.
Pizza... well, whoever has not tasted tastier will like it, I thought it was kind of faceless.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter always stands behind you and almost always looks your interlocutor in the face.
We were not comfortable.
Connolly, yeah, yeah, are delicious.
We will not come here again and recommend it to our friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best artist I've ever had my hair cut and painted with.
She does everything very carefully and efficiently, I am happy to visit her, and I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also only take my daughter to Lena.
The cabin atmosphere is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We are from Nizhny Novgorod, we broke down on the way, kind people from Katresurs quickly reacted and helped!
Respect and prosperity to you, I wish there were more such good people!
And the server is clean and good there!
We came to Sergey Chigrakov's concert.
Great concert venue, great sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the scheduled concerts this year.
A quiet place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music plays on weekends and holidays!
The staff is nice and helpful!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The score is the highest, I love this place ❤
The park is in the city center, very easy to get to.
The park is clean and has space for both children and adults.
But there has been no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field, which, unfortunately, is not well maintained.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
A spacious hall, a clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is friendly.
I did not get into bad products.
Often promotions and discounts.
I'm glad to be close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We visited the bar twice, liked everything, friendly staff, delicious food and most importantly, great music, DJs know their job.
The only thing is that the soloist of the band “Hands Up Band” disappoints for the second time.
Not only does he not sing very well, he also reads the lyrics of most songs from his phone, I was especially impressed when they were songs by the band “Hands Up”.
This is somehow illogical (performing at the Hands Up Bar, in the Hands Up Band band).
We rested in early March.
Good hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of his birthday, they gave a room with a view of the Kremlin.
The room is cleaned every day.
Refill water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
Breakfast is just a blast.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order a meal from restaurant to room, pay 20% on top of the service.
The restaurant's prices are slightly overpriced.
Three plus to taste.
The water park was included in the price of accommodation.
The water park itself is not the best in Russia.
But the massage therapist was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
An employee at the entrance did not even help open the door seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this in order to keep the brand.
A great place to get together with friends for a steam bath.
A large and comfortable steam room, billiards, an outdoor pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
The workshop is up to par!
In a short time, I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husbands and 1 wife).
It's all right.
The quality of work is at its best.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
Great basketball school!
My son has been walking for 5 months and he really likes it, he looks forward to every training session.
An individual approach to children, interesting activities, a warm and sincere atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I order online myself.
Great store location.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
A good AV store is a convenient location, a large hall, a good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I often visit - I'm happy with everything!
Good pool!
I'm specifically talking about the “frog”, the child likes our coach Anastasia Vitalievna very much and is professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, and there are hair dryers!
I love bakeries, cupcakes, service, croissants, breakfast and coffee is always on top.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout did not make coffee until I reminded them, did it, it's impossible to drink, the aftertaste of spoiled milk stinks and left, decided not to finish drinking and just left.
Last time I had long black hair in my coffee, replaced it.
Please be more careful, as I'm not a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows come here!
Victoria perfectly corrects, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of both hair and skin, so that the paint lasts a long time.
You can't make better eyebrows!
Thank you so much for my mom's organized move!
Moving is always a huge stress, but everything with your company went very clearly, quickly and efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is top notch.
We have been treating teeth with the whole family for a long time in Novodent.
Recently, my 8-year-old son's teeth were treated, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because appointments are by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I'm not a fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something harmful only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat has a lot of toppings.
And I don't understand why, but it never leaks for me.
Often, when you finish eating shawarma, you don't eat the bottom anymore because there's a lot of water sauce, in short, whoa... but not here.
That's why you guys are the best 🙂
Good teaching staff.
The canteen always serves fresh food.
Interesting lessons at the school museum, various events are held during the school year
Nice store, courteous staff, good assortment.
However, the big disadvantage is that the goods that are imported are apparently destroyed right on the trading floor.
Sometimes there is little space to walk between rows, and it's also not very pleasant when the goods are right on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a comment to the organization than to a specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict splendor that is cared for with care.
I enjoyed the concert twice, largely due to the atmosphere of the House of Culture.
While we were waiting for the start in the hall, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really a public event.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I accidentally came to this online auto parts store.
I called, indicated the wincode, said wait)
After about 10 minutes, they called back and offered several options.
Since the personal worker did not save money and asked me to order a good LUK clutch kit.
After another 5 minutes, they called back and said that it was good news for you.
If you do not take the entire basket+disc+survival, but take the LUK basket+disc kit and the LUK squeezer separately, it will be 2,000 rubles cheaper, which could not please you.
After picking up the clutch, I went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, I found that I still need a flywheel and the faster the better.
I already knew where I would go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment on call (for the first time I also paid upon receipt).
The next day, the flywheel was in hand.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I am happy that everything came quickly and went to a meeting.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year party was a success, but with nuances.
I booked a double table, it turned out that they seated me in a 4-seater.
But it doesn't matter.
It's just weird they didn't warn me.
The kitchen is four, the fish failed at all.
To be honest, a presenter with competitions made at a school-level powerpoint is not very good.
BUT when it comes to music, it's perfect.
The atmosphere was at its best.
Everything else seems like nit-picking.
Thanks for the event
I am leaving my review with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital No. 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This facility employs only people who know and love their jobs, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OPB unit and in the maternity ward, and in the post-natal ward.
But I would like to express special thanks to Kotlyarova E.Y., who is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., a midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help at the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart and for your great professionalism.
Great store.
A wide range of balloons, always fast ordering and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment on recommendation.
The food is amazing, there are no programs, the waiters are a little cheeky, but we were in a great group with the kids and celebrated an important event and were friendly.
There was no fiery supply to the plateau, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for good food.
