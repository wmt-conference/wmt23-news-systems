The number of people infected with rabies increased in northeastern Thailand
Dr. Tawichai of the 9th Disease Prevention and Control Office revealed on 2/9 that rabies infections have increased in northeastern Thailand over the past few months, and the total number of infected people has risen to 74.
Entering this fiscal year (October last year to September this year), a total of 74 people have tested positive for rabies in Surin and Buriram prefectures in the northeastern part of the northeastern region, 67 people and 7 people, respectively.
It is said that all of them have been vaccinated with the rabies vaccine in the past.
The doctor is calling on people to be vaccinated with the rabies vaccine with their pets, and not to touch the saliva of animals suspected of being infected.
Rabies infects humans not only from dogs but also from cats and bats.
When a person becomes infected and develops symptoms, almost 100% of people die, but death can be prevented by vaccinating before the onset of the disease.

The business site was established in 2011 with the mission of sending fishery products for feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
While fishing plans have been carried out in excess, in recent years they have supported farms in Kiyotsu City, such as procuring farming supplies.
However, what the office supported this time was not Kiyotsu City, but a farm in Kagamigusuku County, which is adjacent to the city.
Moreover, I decided to help the “division” of Park Chung Farm, which is said to have the strictest conditions in the county

FUJI develops a system to prevent abandonment accidents and experiments with in-house vehicles | The Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic information of Aichi, Gifu, Mie, Shizuoka
FUJI (headquartered in Chiryu-shi), which manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent “being left behind,” such as children being left behind in cars.
When a motion sensor is attached to the car and human movement is detected, a notification is sent by phone or chat.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration test with a shuttle vehicle at our facility.
Protect the safety of children while painful accidents due to abandonment also occur.
Currently, a demonstration experiment is being conducted with 2 shuttle vehicles from the English conversation after-school “TERACOYA THANK (Terracoya Sunk)” for children operated in-house in Chiryu City.
Motion sensors that detect the movement of people from the temperature difference between people and their surroundings are installed at 3 places on the ceiling inside the car.
When the vehicle engine is turned off and the movement of a person is detected after a fixed period of time has elapsed with the door closed, a warning notification is automatically sent.
By linking information with the state of the engine or door, false positives are prevented as much as possible.
Warning notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to making a phone call to a number registered in advance, it is displayed on a computer or smartphone chat.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and care has been taken so that mistakes such as missing out do not occur.
The demonstration tests will continue until around the end of February.
Section Chief Kamiya Ikko of the Innovation Promotion Department Section 2 pointed out that “during the experiment, peripheral issues other than the system also came into view.”
For example, it is said that they were able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
I can put effort into it, saying, “If we can expand our solutions.”
The reason for the development of the abandonment prevention system was the successive shuttle bus abandonment accidents across the country.
There was a suggestion from an employee with young children to see if there was anything they could do to protect the safety of children.
Development was decided to make use of know-how such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors cultivated through FA (factory automation) related businesses.
The ease of use of FUJI's abandonment prevention system sells.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to a shuttle vehicle, we aim to lower the hurdles of introduction and spread it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization while seeking cooperation from nursery schools, kindergartens, etc.
[Editorial] The start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shin-Osaka, which was initially scheduled for fiscal year 2023, has been postponed, and town development west of Tsuruga within Fukui prefecture has begun to be affected.
In Obama City, where the new station will be established, the detailed location of the station is not shown even now, and urban planning, including surrounding maintenance, is at a standstill.
It seems that it will take a long time to formulate the plan, and publication as soon as possible is required.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station scheduled for Obama City will be the only new station to be developed west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Railway Construction and Transportation Facility Development Support Organization indicated that the approximate location of the station was within a radius of about 2.5 km centered around JR Higashi-Obama Station.
They were aiming for the winter of '22 to confirm the detailed station location and route.
In Obama City, business related to the bullet train with an eye on the opening of Tsuruga and the opening of Obama in the future began in earnest in fiscal year 21.
The number of businesses will be further increased in the initial budget for fiscal year 22, and they are planning to proceed with town planning that anticipates the location of the new station being announced.
However, the detailed location of the new station has not been shown even now.
The city has invested 3 million yen in this fiscal year's budget as a project to examine land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station and formulate a basic plan, but it is expected that it will not be executed.
City planning centered around a new station “takes time for citizens to reach consensus” (city officials).
There is an example of Echizen City at a newly established suburban station within the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but it can be seen that it takes a considerable amount of time to put together an overall plan.
There is concern that the later the announcement continues, the shorter the preparation period until opening, and the impact on surrounding maintenance will occur.
There is a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga before the location of the new station.
Citizens' groups in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted signatures requesting the blank withdrawal of the extension plan to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in October last year.
In the Ishikawa prefecture political world, there have been a series of movements to return the route settings that have already been settled to square one, such as calls for a reconsideration of the Maihara route due to the postponement of construction commencement, and it is difficult to say that the neighboring prefecture is a monolith by any means.
The way the citizens of Obama accept the postponement of the start of construction is relatively calm, but there is also concern that future momentum will be affected if the location of the new station is unknown and the opening period remains uncertain.
Mayor Matsuzaki Koji has a policy of continuing request activities to the country for the early opening of all lines, but the voices of regions along the line calling for the start of construction as soon as possible would be essential.
The country and neighboring prefectures and municipalities cannot move due to indifference that “the bullet train will pass (west of Tsuruga) someday.”
I want the enthusiasm to keep raising my voice.
The chocolate section for Valentine's Day where tasting has been revived for the first time in 3 years = 2/9 at the Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
Ahead of Valentine's Day on February 14, while the storefront price of chocolate rises due to soaring raw materials and packaging materials, sales in the high price range are strong for “reward chocolate” for personal use, family, and friends.
Retail stores and confectionary stores in Fukui prefecture are trying to capture customers with products that bring local colors, luxury, and commitment to materials to the forefront.
The Seibu Fukui store (Fukui City) opened a special sales area at the 6th floor event hall on January 25.
Until the 14th, they sell 450 varieties from about 40 brands, including 10 confectionary stores in the prefecture.
Chocolates made with local sake from Fukui and sandwich products with fresh chocolate etc. between cookies are said to be popular.
According to the person in charge of the store, the over-the-counter prices of most products have risen by about 10% compared to the previous year.
As for this year's trends, “There are many products that have brought out characteristics, such as being particular about materials and giving a sense of luxury to the packaging. As a trend among consumers, there is a tendency to buy for themselves and their families and enjoy eating and comparing them.”
Despite the headwinds of price increases, it is said that sales in the high price range are strong.
⇒An average increase of 25 yen per tablet due to high prices
The person in charge said, “We are trying to create a sales floor where people can enjoy the event called Valentine's Day itself.”
In addition to selling recommended sweets that change daily from January 26 at the same store, they also resumed tasting for the first time in 3 years.
The Western Confectionery Club (Club) (headquartered in Ichihontanaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai-shi), which manufactures and sells Western confectionaries, first introduced the original chocolate “KISEKI (Kiseki)” series, which was jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate manufacturer at the end of last year, into the Valentine's Day sales season.
They are particular about cacao beans and are characterized by their fruity flavor with reduced bitterness, and are sold for 1,000 yen for 3 pieces and 3,000 yen for 9 pieces.
Ryoma Takakura, director and purchasing manager of the company, said, “While the culture of in-law chocolate is gradually fading, there is demand to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine's Day. We will aim for differentiation by increasing the added value of products.”
⇒How to get chocolate from women... ask a question to a popular AI chatbot
On the 9th, an office worker woman in her 20s (Fukui City) who visited the Seibu Fukui store selected products, saying, “I originally loved chocolate, so I got a job and was able to get money, so I want to buy it as a reward for myself.”
An office worker woman in her 30s (same) who bought in-law chocolate said, “It's painful that the price increase extends to chocolate, but since it's once a year, I want to give it to my family and people who usually take care of me. However, the number of people handing it over may decrease.”
Products using Fukui plums and prefecture-grown midi tomatoes = 2/9, Fukui Prefectural Office
Seven-Eleven Japan announced on 2/9 that it will sell 6 products, including new products using ingredients produced in Fukui prefecture, such as sweet shrimp, at 339 stores in the 3 prefectures of Hokuriku from the same day.
As a project commemorating the 1st anniversary of the conclusion of a comprehensive cooperation agreement on prefectural administration in general, the appeal of prefectural production is promoted.
In addition to the four new products of shrimp miso ramen and tsumire soup using sweet shrimp landed in the prefecture, salad using prefecture-grown midi tomatoes, and cream puffs made from Habutae mochi and bean paste, they also handle Fukui plum rice balls and sauce katsudon.
It is scheduled to be sold until the 20th.

On the 9th, Deputy General Manager Akutsu Tomohiro of the company's operations headquarters paid a courtesy visit to Governor Sugimoto Tatsuji.
Governor Sugimoto, who tasted the tsumire soup, said, “The sweet shrimp stock comes out well and is delicious.”
The person in charge of the company said, “I would like to continue developing products using products produced in Fukui prefecture in the future.”
The castle ruins of Ushigahara Castle, which is said to have been built in preparation for the battle with Heisenji Temple = Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
The Inuikawa (Inukawa) district of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, once had a large-scale Ushigahara manor house.
Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built halfway up Mt. Nabetoko in the district to prepare for the battle with Heisenji Temple, which was in conflict with manors during the Kamakura period.
It appears in the military chronicle “Taiheiki.”
There are no materials left about Ushigahara Castle, but the following content is written in “Echizen Ushihara Jito Suicide” in Taiheiki volume 11.
Aikawa Ukyo Tokiharu (Aikawa Ukyo no Suke Tokiharu), who was an official of the Kamakura Shogunate, was dispatched to Ono as a jito.
In 1333, the Rokuhara Tandai established in Kyoto to monitor the Imperial Court and control western countries was overthrown by Ashikaga Takauji, and the Kamakura Shogunate was further destroyed by Nitta Yoshisada.
When Tokiharu's retainers heard the news that Rokuhara Tandai had come to an end, they immediately ran away, and only about 20 people remained.
The monks and soldiers of Heisen-ji Temple broke in through that gap.
When Tokiharu flooded his wife and two children into the river, he followed suit and committed suicide.
⇒The impregnable castle where Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu stood together
The “Association to Improve the Inui Side” made up of local residents published the “Inui Side History Story” in 2014.
Tokiharu's sad story is introduced in comics so that even elementary school students can easily understand it.
Kitagawa Masao (75), who was involved in the publication, said, “I want local people to know about familiar history and pass it on to future generations.”

The road leading to the trailhead is in winter, and cars may not be able to pass due to snow.
Meeting to improve the dry side
A total of about 220 households within the Inui district of Ono City joined.
In the past, “Trisetsu on the Inui Side,” which introduced burial mounds, historic sites, and places of interest within the district, was published.
The roadside station “Rennyo-no-Sato Awara,” which is under development in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture, will open on 4/22.
In anticipation of the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Awaraonsen Station in the spring of 2024, it is expected that there will be approximately 360,000 users per year as a new regional development and tourist base in the northern part of the city.
The main food and beverage and retail facility at the station is a steel-framed single-story building with a total floor area of 975 square meters.
The total site area of the roadside station, including the parking lot and the Nagisa (Nagisa) Children's Park, etc. is 8137 square meters.
Rest areas and tourist information centers will also be set up at the facility.
Electric bicycles can be rented, and shower rooms are also available.
The two parking lots accommodate a total of 66 small cars and large vehicles (including 3 for people with disabilities).
Mayor Morinotsugu of the same city made it clear at the regular press conference held on 2/8.
At the food and drink corner, they sell parfaits made with fruits from the Sakai Northern Hills and Tomitsu Kintoki pie.
We are working on menu development that uses plenty of local ingredients, such as rice with eggs made with fukuji chicken and autumn/winter limited dishes using eels from Kitagata.
Currently, about 60 businesses are members of the direct sales office “Shipper Council.”
The product lineup of processed products such as bento boxes and side dishes, and agricultural and horticultural products such as saplings and plants will also be enhanced.
At the souvenir corner, in addition to exhibiting and selling works by artists residing at the Kanazu Creative Forest Museum, they also handle confectionaries, alcoholic beverages, traditional crafts, etc.
⇒In the ranking of roadside stations, “Minami Echizen Sankairi” is number one in the Kinki region

At the press conference, Mayor Mori stated, “We will restore energy and vitality to the entire area of Awara City, promote it, and lead to improvements in the lives of local residents and regional revitalization.”
A cat-shaped meal serving robot introduced at the “Rock Salt Aged Jingisukan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store.”
Adorable facial expressions etc. are popular with family customers = Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui prefecture, which is suffering from labor shortages, there is a growing movement to introduce serving robots that carry food to audience seats.
In addition to being useful for saving labor in store management and “contactless” customer service to prevent infection with the novel coronavirus, the robot's adorable facial expressions are also popular with family customers.
There are voices from restaurant managers and stakeholders saying, “It is difficult to secure employees and part-time jobs at regional restaurants, and meal serving robots will become even more popular.”
“Jin, Jin, Genghis Khan ♪”.
While playing light music, the robot with the cat's face displayed on the screen places food and runs smoothly through the restaurant.
When they arrive at the audience table, they talk to the customer, saying, “I brought the food you ordered.”
The “Rock Salt Aged Jingisukan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store” in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City introduced a cat-shaped serving robot in August 2022.
When food ordered from a customer is placed on a robot waiting near the kitchen and the table number on the screen is pressed, it runs autonomously to that table and delivers it.
It has built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice functions, etc., and responds when customers touch it, and the expression of the cat's face reflected on the screen is also rich.
The “Bonta Group,” which manages the same stores, etc., has introduced meal serving robots at 2 stores, including the same store.
President Toshiyuki Saito says the reason for the introduction is “labor shortage is the biggest,” and emphasizes that it is part of productivity improvement through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but it is said that it has been reduced to 21-22% with the introduction.
Robots also have the role of collecting plates that customers have finished eating, leading to an increase in the efficiency of cleaning up after cleaning up, and they also add that “families and children are delighted, and there is also an advertising effect.”
The yakiniku/hormone pot “Rokken Hoshiyama Fukui Store” in Arakishinbocho, Fukui City also introduced a serving robot in August '22.
President Hoshiyama Eifuku of Seongsan Shoten, which manages it, said, “Even if you recruit employees or part-time workers, they don't come easily. I thought it would be absolutely necessary to resolve labor shortages,” he says about the introduction process.
At the Fukui store, it is operated by separating the zone where employees serve meals from the robot delivery range, etc.
It is said that the lease fee for a robot is about the same as the wage for one part-time job.
In order to save labor, in addition to robots, stores are incorporating order systems using tablet terminals, and self-checkout is also under consideration.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, “customer service” at restaurants etc. was 6.94 times the ratio of effective job offers by job type in 22/12, making it an occupation with a high sense of labor shortage.
The person in charge of Net System (Fukui-shi Takagi-chuo 2-chome), which is responsible for sales agents for serving robots, says, “Labor shortages at restaurants in the prefecture have become serious, partly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and there are many inquiries about introducing robots.”
President Hoshiyama analyzed, “Securing employees will become even more difficult at rural suburban stores in the future, and I think meal serving robots will spread.”
[Editorial] Echizen Town has created an ending note and distributed it to the townspeople who wish.
It is said that it started when the “Okuyami Handbook,” which covered the procedures necessary when a relative passed away, a writable inheritance list table, family tree, etc. was published two years ago, and there were many people who came to pick it up for themselves.
Courses on how to write ending notes and organizing during life are also often held in various parts of the prefecture, and it seems that “end of life” is completely established among the citizens of the prefecture.
The ending note for Echizen Town is 35 pages long.
Starting with a review of one's own history in 5 chapters, I will write my current state of health and asset status, future nursing care, hopes for end-of-life care, requests related to funerals and graves, etc.
There is also a column for spelling things you want to do for the rest of your life and messages for loved ones.
It would be hard to write that there are 35 pages, but you don't have to fill in all of them.
What would you most like to write to your family and the people around you?
The key is to be clear about your goals.
A variety of notebooks for different purposes are commercially available at bookstores, etc., and it is said that you should feel free to start writing from where you can write.
Comparing it to job hunting, it is said that the term end of life was coined in 2009.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that “death comes suddenly,” and the number of people preparing for their own end of life and end of life has increased.
It's been over 10 years since then.
The novel coronavirus disaster that struck the world has not subsided even now.
Prices have risen due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, etc., and electricity prices have jumped to unexpected prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current high prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, there used to be funeral expenses, nursing care fees, grave management, etc. that could be shared between siblings and relatives, but now it's an age where only one child is not uncommon.
Also, although life expectancy has greatly increased compared to a year ago, it is a dilemma where the risk of dementia and nursing care increases as people get older.
I would like to keep in mind that this heightened social unease is also behind the fact that the end of life was transient and established without ending.
Anyway, it's probably everyone's wish that they don't want to put an excessive burden on their partner or children.
“Be yourself at the end of your life” also seems to be a popular keyword in the ending notes, but don't get too alone.
Instead of secretly writing my wishes and requests, I want to talk to my family at least once and prepare peacefully for that time.
Prime Minister Kishida Fumio (second from the right) and Minister of Education Nagaoka Keiko (3rd) take a commemorative photo with the people involved at the elementary school they visited.
At the graduation ceremony, they expressed the idea that it is not necessary for students, faculty, and staff to wear masks in principle = 2/10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture
On 2/10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology solidified a policy stating that “it is basic not to wear” for students to wear masks at graduation ceremonies.
The junior high school principal of a large school said, “It's actually difficult to keep a wide distance between students, and I'm worried about how to respond. There are also students who feel uneasy about removing their masks,” she reveals.
In response to reports about wearing masks at graduation ceremonies, it is said that this topic has also been raised among teachers.
Meanwhile, one elementary school principal said, “If the country decides, they won't wear it. If chorus is excluded, isn't it realistically possible?”
At this graduation ceremony, there is also a movement to seek mitigation of countermeasures at some schools in the prefecture, such as admitting participation of current students who had refrained from participating and resuming alumni singing.
Within the prefecture, prefectural high schools are scheduled to hold ceremonies in early March, and public elementary and middle schools are scheduled to hold ceremonies in the middle of the same month.
The idea is that prefectural councils and municipal councils will wait for an official notification from the Ministry of Education to decide on a response.
Also, cautious voices were heard about the fact that the Ministry of Education has solidified a policy not requiring people to wear masks in school education activities in general from the new semester this spring.
The elementary school principal said, “Children are also puzzled by the response of suddenly not having a mask from one day. It is a natural trend to first decide that “you are free to wear it,” and then gradually the number of children who take it off increases.”
× × ×
On 2/10, in line with the new government guidelines for wearing masks, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided not to require wearing a mask in school education activities from April.
As a general rule, there are no masks in choral singing, physical education classes, and club activities.
Infection control measures in accordance with the current hygiene management manual will be sought during the 2022 school year, and precautions etc. from April onwards will be disseminated to the Board of Education and school sites in the future.
Graduation ceremonies for elementary, middle, high schools, universities, etc. are based on implementing measures such as ventilation, etc., and that alumni, faculty, staff, and participating current students do not wear masks even during the year 22.
Nagata Yasushi cutting an examinee (left) with scissors praying for success = Hair Atelier Rim in Tsuka-cho, Echizen-shi, Fukui
Every year during the exam season at the beauty salon Hair Atelier Rimrim in Tsuka-cho, Echizen-shi, Fukui prefecture, they cut test takers using scissors etc. to pray for success.
It is said that it is well received by examinees, saying “confidence has come out” and “I was able to face the exam calmly.”
Nagata Yasushi, the representative director of the same beauty salon, has seen and heard students opening textbooks while waiting for a cut or expressing a sense of anxiety about taking the exam during the cut.
So in 2014, I started a cut to pray for success, saying “I hope it helps even a little bit.”
⇒Summary of the last day of national and public university applications
Every year at the same beauty salon, they ask scissors and combs to pray for success at Kazusosha in Wakatake-cho in the same city on the first day of work.
Around 80 people get cut every year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, it is said that there are various employment tests, driver's license tests, etc.
I'm giving you a pencil to pray for success.
⇒Mama Ogi “To You Who Challenge Your High School Entrance Exams”
A man (19) who received a cut in 2021 and successfully passed active duty at the University of Tokyo said, “I was happy that the feeling of support was conveyed. I used the golden pencil I received for the exam, and my feelings were excited.”
The book “Dear Prime Minister, 'Breakwater of Life' from Tojinbo” is a book self-published by the NPO “Collection of Essays That Resonate with the Heart and Editorial Office”
“Dear Prime Minister, From Tojinbo, the 'Breakwater of Life'” I self-published my 10th book with this title.
Newspapers from all over the country have picked it up, and many readers have received their impressions.
The purpose of publishing this book was to share with everyone what they heard directly from suicide plotters about “social/structural” environmental issues about the causes of suicide in Japan, and to create a “comfortable society to live in.”
We patrolled rocky areas to prevent suicide for 18 years and 10 months at the waterfront of Tojinbo in Fukui prefecture, which is called a famous place for suicides, and continued support activities until they discovered and protected suicide plotters and started again.
This book is a compilation of issues we have heard from the 784 people (as of 2/6) who have been protected so far, and appeals on the following 7 items to the Prime Minister about national policies necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are “life saving” activities.
(2) “Human rights violations” are piling up behind the suicide.
(3) A person who commits suicide is a victim of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens living outside of their jurisdiction coldly by treating them as “outsiders.”
(5) Even if a person with a mental disability such as depression is drugged and committed suicide, it is treated as an “accident.”
(6) “Obligations to consider safety” in high-risk areas for suicide have been forgotten and are moving towards commercialism.
(7) The part of the doctrine of emerging religious groups that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of threatening an opponent by telling future curses and making them provide money or goods is extortion.
Shouldn't religious groups that carry out this criminal act of “fraud/extortion crime” be made public and eliminated?
Therefore, in the comments received from people who have subscribed to this book, we are receiving comments that are too much for us, such as “I'm moved by the strong mentality of the people working on this activity,” “the appearance of this former police officer is a reference within a police officer,” or “it's a living bodhisattva who supports someone like one's own family even though they are so many others,” etc., and I will introduce a part of my impressions here.
When I saw the pictures in the newspaper article, I began to burst into tears saying, “What are you thinking...”
Right now, I've heard that the number of people cornered by the COVID-19 pandemic is committing suicide is increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone seems to be that person.
I want it to be a society where people are happy to live the lives they have received.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude to all the staff who gave their heart to the people who had so much pain that they wanted to die.
I think this activity is an activity that overuses both mind and body, but please take good care of yourself and continue speaking out from now on.
Thank you very much.
Kashiko
I hope that all of our readers will also become gatekeepers of life in the community.

Shimada Kenji, who takes pictures of capybaras every week and posts photos on SNS = 2/1 at the indoor facility “Happijan” at Asuwayama Park Amusement Park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
There is a man in the city who takes pictures of capybaras at the indoor facility “Happijan” at Fukui City Asuwayama Park Amusement Park in Fukui Prefecture every week and posts them on Instagram.
Various thumbnail images are lined up in a row in the post, such as the moment they yawn with their teeth peeking out of their big mouths, and figures lying down and basking in the sun.
They have over 10,000 followers both domestically and internationally, and they play a role in making many people aware of the appeal of hapijans and capybaras.
⇒Shizuka Kudo posted traditional vegetables from Fukui Prefecture on Instagram
The man is Kenji Shimada (38), an office worker living in the city.
Dissemination on exchange sites (SNS) began in 2021/3.
Capybaras are among the largest members of the group of mice in the world, and they are good at swimming because they have webbing between their fingers.
Since it opened in '18, Happijan has raised a total of 3 animals, 1 male and 2 females, so you can observe and feed them up close.
Mr. Shimada learned about capybaras 5 or 6 years ago.
It is said that they were shocked when they watched a video of them leisurely soaking in a hot spring, saying, “What is this animal.”
I was drawn to the charming, human-like expressions and gestures.
After that, I heard that they would be raised in hapijang, and I was looking forward to seeing them up close.
I started taking pictures in earnest about 3 years ago when I bought a single-lens reflex camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of capybaras, and don't miss out on shutter opportunities, such as the sight of them shaking their bodies and draining water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram has risen to about 830, so much so that I look back, “You took this many pictures.”
It seems that Onoyamato-kun comes up and screams “kyuru-kyuru,” probably because he memorized Mr. Shimada while he was still going there.
Shimada's love for capybaras is only deepening, saying “they're cute and I'm happy.”
They also enjoy interacting with capybara lovers from all over the country through SNS, such as showing each other their best shots every month.
Mr. Shimada, who also visits zoos in nearby prefectures to see capybaras, smiled, “I want to continue taking pictures and disseminating information, mainly at my home, Mt. Asuwa.”

Toba City Seeks Double Payment Refund of Child-rearing Household Benefits - Ise Shimbun
[Toba] Toba City announced on the 10th that there were erroneous payments of a total of 600,000 yen to 12 people in 11 households for child-rearing household life support special benefits (other households) for the Reiwa 3 fiscal year.
The city will apologize to the target person and explain the circumstances, and will also seek procedures for return.
According to the city, it was discovered due to indications from parents of target children who confirmed past payments on Reiwa 5/1/27.
It is said that when checking all 182 people in 79 households eligible for payment in the same year, it was found that the benefits paid on Reiwa 3/7/20 were paid in duplicate to 12 people in 11 households.
The city pays 50,000 yen per person as a benefit to children under high school students in households exempt from residence tax.
It is said that data obtained by extracting target children was received from an outsourced computer company, but it is said that they were double paid because the staff in charge misunderstood that high school students were not included and added to the data.
The person in charge of the City Childcare Support Office says, “We will take it solemnly and make every effort to restore trust by taking all possible measures to prevent recurrence, such as re-checking data.”

2023.02.10 - Iwaki Minpo Co., Ltd.
It's snowing again.
It's not a cold wave coming from the north, but it seems to be an effect of the southern low pressure moving eastward through the Japanese archipelago.
It's been a short time since I experienced the abnormally cold on 24-26 last month, and I still can't let my guard down ▼ Even with the same cold, it will be even more bearable for the people of the Republic of Turkey, which was hit by a major earthquake.
The building fell down in an instant.
Up to now, together with neighboring Syria, more than 20,000 people have been killed, and even now many people are left behind in the rubble ▼ the same country known as a pro-Japanese country.
The beginning of this is the disaster of the warship Ertugrul, which was dispatched to Japan by the Ottoman Empire at the time in Meiji 23 (1890).
The fact that residents of Kushimoto-cho in Wakayama prefecture in the field area helped and cared for the crew has been introduced in movies and novels ▼ About 100 years after this accident, Turkish aircraft were dispatched to rescue Japanese hostages by Iraq that occurred on the eve of the Gulf War, and they are reporting their gratitude.
Anyone who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.
The situation calms down, and I want to keep an eye on it until reconstruction and restoration.

Bellino Hotel Subsidy Fraudulently Received Prefecture and City Accommodation Support Business Has Already Been Fully Refunded | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
The prefecture and Ichinoseki city announced on the 10th that Bellino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yamame in the same city) had carried out inappropriate use for about 1 year from October 2021 in their respective subsidy grant projects that discount lodging fees for travelers.
When people who were not eligible for discounts stayed, discounts were applied through name loans etc. by employees.
It has also been confirmed that many employees use lodging facilities that are not in line with the business purpose of “stimulating tourism demand.”
The full amount of 7,231,000 yen of benefits received due to improper use etc. has been returned by the 6th of this month, including voluntary investigations by the prefecture, city, and hotel side.
Subsidies were fraudulently received: the prefecture's lodging discount “Iwate Travel Support Project,” which was implemented in response to the spread of the novel coronavirus infection, and the city's tourist accommodation facility emergency response project “Ichinoseki Lodging Support Discount.”
The period was from 21/10/18 to 22/10/10 (the Ichinoseki lodging support discount is 22/9/30), and as a result of the investigation, 95 cases of inappropriate use not covered by discounts, such as not being in the target area or not vaccinated, rose to 587,000 yen, 1239 cases of use not in line with the purpose and purpose of the business, or 6644,000 yen.
When the prefecture's business contractor was proceeding with the settlement procedure, it was confirmed multiple situations where the user of the accommodation discount and the person in charge of acceptance on the hotel side were the same person.
Inappropriate use was discovered in a detailed investigation by the prefecture, and the city that obtained such information also confirmed the facts.
The city's business has already ended, and registration for prefectural business was also removed on December 2 last year.
In response to the interview, Representative Director Dobashi Michiaki of Bellino, who runs the hotel, said, “I'm sorry for the inconvenience caused to everyone in the community, the prefecture, city, and many people. I'm very sorry. It is a hotel where everyone in the community is there, and I want to restart from scratch and work to restore trust,” he said, and they plan to hold another compliance (compliance with laws and regulations) training session for all employees.
Chiba Takahito, promotion section chief of the prefectural tourism and promotion office, said, “It's really regrettable. Once again, I would like to encourage compliance with rules and the establishment of compliance, and call for proper use in line with the purpose of the business.”
Mayor Sato Yoshihito announced a comment saying, “It is truly regrettable that there was improper use of the business at lodging facilities in the city.”

The restaurant Kinshuko at the station on the same road, which offers “Yuda dam curry” (same 1200 yen) and “Nishiwaga whole ramen” (same 900 yen), etc. was closed on Thursday to ensure holidays for staff, but it is said that there were voices of disappointment from visitors.
In response to this, the ramen only business, which can handle even a small number of people, started on the 9th.
Of the restaurant's menu, it was decided to focus on selling 4 items: soy sauce (soy sauce) ramen, soy sauce pork noodles, miso (miso) ramen, and dantan noodles.
Dantan noodles, a new product that coincides with the opening of “Menya Nishiki,” is based on “yukikko miso,” which is made from soybeans and sun-dried salt from Nishiwaga, etc., and uses green onions, western bracken, minced meat, chili peppers, etc. produced in the town.
There have been many orders since day one, and we will consider offering items other than Thursday in the future.

Introducing the Ancestors of Plant Research, Hayaike Mineyama Collection Materials and the City General Cultural Properties Center Special Exhibition [Hanamaki] ｜Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
The special exhibition “People Who Introduced the Flowers of Hayachemine - A Brief History of Hayachemine Botanical Research -” which takes up the ancestors who laid the foundation for botanical research on Mt. Hayachemine, which is known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, is being held at the City General Cultural Properties Center in Osaka-cho, Hanamaki City until the 12th.
It collects 124 materials, such as valuable specimens collected by our ancestors, and introduces the footprints of our ancestors involved in botanical research on Mt. Hayachi.
Plant research on Mt. Hayaike began with Russian plant researcher Carl Johan Maximovich (1827-91), who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Sugawa Chonosuke (1842-1925) from Shiwa Town, who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovich.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to walk freely in the country because he was a foreigner, asked Sugawa to collect, and continued his research for 3 years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa also supported research even after Maximovich returned to Japan, leading to the presentation of “Himekozakura,” “Japanese Prickly Pear,” and “Prickly Pear” unique to Mt. Hayaike.
After that, the modern plant taxonomist Makino Tomitaro (1862-1957) presented “rhododendron,” “black clover,” and “rhododendron,” “rhododendron,” and “rhododendron,” and “Japanese hornwort,” which he discovered and named by climbing Mt. Hayachemine himself in 2005 (same 38), based on products collected by local researchers.
From the materials on display, it can be seen that valuable alpine plants have been revealed by many researchers.
Also introduced are Sugimura Matsunosuke (1874-1948), the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School, who was doing plant research, and Tamagawa Shichiro (1914-88), who served as a curator at the Osako Municipal Mountain Museum and was also involved in the publication of “Plants of Mt. Hayachi.”
Curatorial researcher Yoshida Sohei of the same center said, “There is a lot of research accumulation in the background of the name of each plant on Mt. Hayachemine, and there is a connection between people. It is possible to trace the connections between researchers that spread from rural areas to the whole country.”
The exhibition consists of 4 chapters, and chapter 1 focuses on the beliefs and history of Mt. Hayaike, and chapter 2 also focuses on the characteristics of Mt. Hayachi as seen from a geological perspective based on investigations by Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundation of Japanese geology.

The fast ball that we are proud of shined even when the ball changed.
Lotte's Sasaki Roki (Ofunato Takashi) made her first pitch on the 9th by hitting a seat at the Ishigaki Camp in Okinawa, and threw 30 balls with a ball used in the World Baseball Classic (WBC) to mark 160 kilograms.
With 2 hits against 6 hitters, he said, “There were a lot of harvests. The folk ball is slightly better than during the strengthening game last year,” he exuded a sense of fulfillment.
The 160 kilogram was measured 2 degrees, Fujiwara got stuck and made a foul, and Yasuda made a niguro.
Matsukawa, who received the ball, calmly assembled the pitch led by the pitcher with the slider and was impressed by the good finish, saying “a really strong ball was coming, and the batter was inserted.”

The high-profile strong team will pitch in the practice game with Yakult on the 15th (Okinawa/Itoman) as the next step, and they are scheduled to throw around 40 balls.
“I want to be able to show more accuracy and overall cohesiveness of the fastball,” he continues down to the details.
Idlib province in northwestern Syria damaged by the earthquake = before dawn on the 9th (provided by local residents, jointly)
[Gaziantep (Southern Turkey) Joint] It was a major earthquake with the epicenter in southern Turkey, and according to authorities in Turkey and neighboring Syria, the total number of confirmed deaths exceeded 21,000 people in both countries on the 9th.
Amid the severe cold, rescuing survivors from collapsed buildings etc. has become more difficult over time.
An intense search was carried out in the disaster-stricken area.
On the 9th, for the first time since the earthquake occurred on the 6th, the United Nations brought goods into the disaster-stricken province of Idlib in northwestern Syria through the Turkish border.
Idlib province is the last base for dissidents opposing the Assad administration in the Syrian civil war, and there were concerns that international support might not be sufficient.
Rescue operations continue at disaster-stricken sites in both countries by using heavy equipment, etc., but they have been difficult.
It is said that there are many people still buried in rubble, and there is a high possibility that the death toll will increase further.
According to the Turkish authorities, 17,674 deaths have been confirmed in Turkey.
Together with the death toll of over 3,000 people in Syria, it is a disaster that surpasses the Great Earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which killed more than 17,000 people in 1999.
Miyako City has a policy of taking independent support measures to subsidize energy expenses such as electricity, gas, gasoline, etc. of city operators struggling to secure profits due to soaring fuel and prices.
Voluntary financial resources will be invested as an emergency measure to support regional economies in a tough environment.
The target is businesses in all industries (excluding agriculture, forestry, fishermen, electricity, gas supply companies, etc.).
It is a requirement that the profit margin for the business year that ended just before has decreased from the previous fiscal year.
As for the subsidy amount, the upper limit is 1 million yen per business operator in the direction of providing one-half of the increase compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year for 6 consecutive months between April 2022 and March 23.
It is expected that about 800 people will receive benefits.

About 70 people and 4 rescue dogs.
Team leader Yamamoto Hideaki said, “The situation at the scene is pretty terrible. It was a scene that reminded me of the Great East Japan Earthquake. Helping each other in times of trouble is the relationship between Japan and Turkey.”

Discuss renewable energy introduction and targets Amami Airport 2nd Decarbonization Promotion Council | Society/Economy | Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
The promotion council that discussed the decarbonization of Amami Airport = 9th, Kasari-cho, Amami
The “Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council” (Chairman, Ando Takashi Prefecture Oshima Branch Office Construction Section Chief, 13 members) composed of prefectures and airlines that use the airport held the 2nd meeting at the same airport on the 9th to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at Amami Airport (Kasari-cho, Amami City).
All members of the committee attended, including online.
Opinions were exchanged for setting decarbonization targets and introducing renewable energy, mainly solar power generation.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set an overall target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at each airport by 46% or more (compared to fiscal year 13) by 2030 for “carbon neutrality,” which realizes zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In response to this, the council held its first meeting in November last year, aiming to formulate plans ahead of the other 6 remote island airports within the prefecture.
The 2nd meeting, like the first one, is not open to the public except at the beginning.
According to Chairman Ando, who responded to the interview after the end, the airport's greenhouse gas emissions were confirmed at the meeting.
It is said that discussions were carried out in line with the guidelines of the Ministry of Land, Transport and Tourism in order to set targets and introduce renewable energy.
According to handouts, the standard CO2 emissions from airport equipment and vehicles in fiscal 2013 were 1476 kilograms (excluding aircraft).
Of these, emissions from lighting, air conditioning, etc. from 7 facilities such as airport terminal buildings account for about 90% at 1321 kilograms, followed by aviation lights at 84 kilograms and airport vehicles at 71 kilograms.
The council will proceed with discussions on targets to reduce emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Chairman Ando said, “Now is a passing point. The direction of the committee members is the same, and I would like to thoroughly compile the draft interim report first,” he said.
From now on, a promotion plan will be formulated after listening to opinions on the draft interim report at the 3rd meeting and the draft final report at the 4th meeting.
The flow of attracting people to the island “Upside Down Real Estate” Okinoerabu branch office opened, people who want to rent a house are looking for landlords | Society/Economy | Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
Opening event that deepened understanding of “Upside Down Real Estate” through talk sessions etc. = 8th, China-cho
[Okinoerabu Directorate] The Okinoerabu branch office opening event of the real estate web service “Sakasama Real Estate,” which visualizes the thoughts of people who have challenges by renting vacant houses and vacant stores, etc., and recruits landers, was held on the 8th at the community space “entaku” famous in China-cho.
The management company explained the outline of the service through a talk session.
Representative Director Okubo Masahiro of Tsuginova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), which is responsible for branch office management, said, “I hope by carrying out this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we can create movements and flows that attract people throughout the island.”
Contrary to normal real estate procedures, upside down real estate is a system where information on the person you want to rent is disclosed, the lender contacts you, and if an agreement is reached, each person makes a contract.
It was operated by On-Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture) as a demonstration experiment responsible for discovering potential vacant houses and building relationships through vacant houses, and the service began in June 2020.
It is the 7th branch office to be established and the first in Kyushu.
This is the first remote island in Japan.
About 20 people participated in the event, including staff from On-Co and Tsuginova, government office staff from both Wadomari and China-cho, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the circumstances of establishing the branch office, saying, “While movements to attract people from outside the island are becoming active, I thought that if vacant houses and vacant stores could be utilized, the town and island would become even more exciting from there.”
“I want to connect with people who have properties on the island and people who want to do something, and help them proceed with that initiative as many as possible, even if it's just one case,” he said.
Representative Mizutani Takeshi of On-Co pointed out the precautions for management, saying, “It is necessary to cherish each vacant house one by one and discuss what the local people want to do with this area, what kind of people they want to come, what criteria to choose based on, etc.”
They called on the islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information, saying “the deeper the connection between people, the more information is gathered.”

Mercari applies the amount of money sold to purchases, so I don't think it's that convenient.

Does the NSR250R flash when operating the turn signal with the key ON while the engine is not running?
If the battery is normal, when the key is turned on, ACC, that is, accessories, is energized, so turn signals, brake lights, etc. will turn on.
It can also be a horn.
However, after starting the engine, the voltage rises, so I feel better.
Can DDR4 made by ADATA and DDR4 made by Samsung be mixed?
It's a laptop.
In principle, if the pin arrangement, voltage, frequency, etc. standards match, they can be used together.
If it's just a difference in frequency, it's also designed so that it works according to the slower side, but depending on the thing, that area didn't work well, so it's definitely not okay.

If that's the case, isn't it 300,000 or something?

It's a lie that you've been registered unless you've entered various things from here, so you can ignore it.
Is this thinning hair?
It is a “split” in the hair due to the hairstyle.
If you continue to do this kind of hairstyle, it's easy to get thinning hair if you brush your comb or brush the wrong way, so be careful.
If you don't brush your hair the wrong way, it's hard for your hair to thinning, though.
If you don't like seeing your scalp, changing to a hairstyle that won't break your hair will solve the problem.
Is this Dunhill wallet real?
If it's purchased at a famous department store such as Takashimaya, it also comes with a warranty card, so there's no doubt that it's authentic, but isn't that the case??

Didn't the inexperienced teacher who is an adviser to club activities participate in club activities when they were students?
If your club activity advisor is inexperienced, it's because there are no other experienced people (including those already in charge of advisors for other club activities), so it doesn't necessarily mean you didn't do club activities when you were a student.
I'm a high school student.

Is there something fun?
I was living alone.

It was fun.
Humans are accustomed animals, so if every day of fun continues, that state becomes a daily routine.

Why am I such a bad guy
Well, it's probably because I'm comparing myself to someone really good.

it's bad!

I don't want Korean style!
Chinese soba from an old cafeteria in the city!

I like that kind of ramen too.
Hida Takayama ramen, Kitakata ramen, etc. are light flavors.

・Travel time from home to work

・Do you have any work experience
・Why didn't you choose this job
・The day and time of the week you can enter the shift

I think so.
I don't remember getting the flu for 50 years or more after becoming a member of society, but 5 to 6 years ago, when I had my antibody levels measured by the city, I had sufficient antibody values.
Also, I didn't remember getting the vaccine, but I think I probably caught the flu before I knew it and developed antibodies before I knew it.

Once the lymph nodes are swollen, how many days does it take to heal?
I think it depends on the cause of the swelling
If you have a cold or other infectious disease, I think you'll catch it once your cold has healed to some extent.
If the swelling is so severe that there is pain, etc., the teacher said that it won't heal unless you take antibiotics, so it might be better to go to the hospital once.

When the temperature of the air is changed, the outdoor unit rotates to make the heat exchanger work, but if it's just blowing, there's no need for that, so the outdoor unit doesn't matter.

I'm looking for a gaming router that doesn't support Wi-Fi 6 and has a good reputation for wireless LAN
Construction can't be done due to various circumstances, so I know full well that it's not that meaningful unless it's Wi-Fi 6, so on top of that
If you know anything that sounds good about this, please let me know.
I look forward to working with you.
It's harder to find products that don't support Wi-Fi 6 now, so
It's also normally compatible with uncompatible devices, so I think a Wi-Fi 6 product is fine.
Did the Tokaido Shinkansen slow down in Yamashina when it arrived in Kyoto?
Naturally, it has decelerated right before Yamashina.
The distance between Kyoto and Yamashina is only 5.5 km.
If you were driving at a speed of 280 km/h, it's a distance where you would arrive in 1 minute to 1 minute and a half.
Why don't many people pour mayonnaise on yakitori even though it's delicious?

Please let me know if you know.
It's not on sale.
Their last CD single was the 51st [theme song] which was released on 9/22 (Wednesday) last year.
It has risen to Oricon's highest ranking of 2.

What I like is Natural Lawson.
Do you eat convenience store sweets?
I like pudding and jelly, so I eat them here and there (^^)
workouts
Is it better to do weight training before or after a meal
If you train in a state where your energy is depleted (on an empty stomach), you lose muscle
If you take nutrition (mainly protein) after training, it's easier to grow muscle
So, if you do it seriously, you'll need both supplementation before training and supplementation after training
But if you choose between before or after, I think it's better to train after eating
Like it on Facebook, Instagram, etc.! It's also great for friends who don't give it to me! will you do it?
If I think I'm good, I'll do it.
“Likes” aren't mutual, and I think they'll always do that post or information if they like it.
I have absolutely no interest in whether others like it or not.

Please tell me about the economic effects of shortening working hours.
According to reports from companies that have implemented reduction in working hours, there are many cases where employees tried to improve work efficiency on their own due to reduced hours, and the company's performance also improved as a result.
As business performance improves, salaries also increase, and holidays also increase, so consumption also increases, which also has an economic effect.
Does increasing the air pressure in automobile studless tires have anything to do with driving on snowy roads
If I increase the air pressure, will fuel efficiency increase slightly
Is it useless if you don't raise it quite a bit
I think rolling resistance will improve
Studless tires are low pressure tires, so if you set them to high pressure, snow won't bite, burst easily, etc., so there's nothing good about them.
I've never received a single best answer.
How can I get the best answers?
I'm not aware of it, but I get it from time to time.
First, answer the person who is seriously asking the question sincerely. Standing in the other person's shoes, thinking about various things, and answering.
I'm wondering what kind of response would be best for my partner.
That also means it can be the best for the questioner.
For your reference.

I've been to several different dentists until now, but when I'm sitting on that treatment chair, there are teachers and dental hygienists talking from a slightly oblique back.
I'm at a loss as to whether it's better to look back, but I also think it would be disrespectful to look back all the time because of the tight posture and still face the front..
Is there anyone who understands?
What's going on?
Not only dentists, but also barbers and perm shops talk while facing the front.

It's vegetable juice.
It also depends on how you store it.

About Instagram
I (the general public) currently have about 10,000 followers, but if someone I don't know sees this, wow, would you think it would be amazing?
Or don't you think anything else?
What is it like?
I think that's amazing.
It's a miracle for the average person.
I think they were doing something special.
There was a problem and it was a setback
It's hard to get time to exercise, so I bought one to try relying on popular compression innerwear.
My body shape is H175m W80kg and I bought a size L.
It's pretty hard to wear at first, but once you get used to it, I think it's fine.
I've been using it for a few days, but now I'm using another compression innerwear due to a problem.
Problem 1: If your arm circumference isn't quite slender, the tightness around the edge of the sleeve (just your upper arm) is too tight and you get a bit congested, and it's itchy.
2. Discontinued use due to 2 or more problems with loose lower abdomen.
It's pretty tight when it comes to comfort, but there's no problem sleeping while wearing it.
Great for people who fit
S was fine even at 158 cm and 50 kg.
But it didn't suit me, who has a big skeleton and is muscular.
Buttocks etc. are not three-dimensional, so there are strange gaps and it's easy to fall down, so it doesn't fit well.
I felt like I had to pull it up all the time.
I think it would be nice if it was someone with a body shape like a stick.
Do you think it's safe thinness in terms of thickness?
It didn't feel like it was henna-wrenching or tearing, and I was able to make it feel refreshed by being able to boot even with knee-high boots that fit perfectly.
It's wonderful
As for my upper body, I didn't want to show too much skin, but I came across them when I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit.
The top is stylish, with a lace-up back view and a one-point mark on the hem.
I'm happy to be able to choose between wearing a bikini underneath or shorts over it in 2 ways (^.
^) It just arrived, and I just tried it on and it wasn't in water, so I don't know the durability or what it would feel like if it got wet, but the sewing was beautiful, the fabric was solid, and I thought this price was a bargain.
There was no wire on the bust part, but when I touched it, it seemed like there was a properly hard core at the bottom of the pad.
However, it doesn't hurt even when you wear it, and it fits your bust properly, so I think it looks good even when you move.
Did they change the model from Pat no to ARI?
(^.
^) I'm looking forward to getting into the water from now on ♪ Thank you ♪
It's a bit big at 45 kg 156 cm in size.
The raincoat is made of thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but since the manufacturing method is solid, I think it can be used for a long time.
It comes with 2 rain visors to keep my face from getting wet.
There was no problem with the strength, and I was able to use it safely even on my bicycle in the middle of a storm.
There were no tears after use.
I carry it in a compression bag in a compact state.
Really, it was a product that exceeded my expectations at this price.
I was able to install it safely.
I attached it to the CLA 180 shooting break in the 2016 model.
The installation method can be done even by an amateur if you read the instructions on YOU Tube.
Note that if you loosen the Torx screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I dropped one and went missing.
After that, if you use a type with a tapered tip, such as a radio pliers, etc. when pinching the gray connector between the brown and reddish-green wiring, the plastic will break as shown in the photo, and you will not be able to attach it.
When I called support, they mailed me a new cable the next day, and it's a company with very good support.
When I tried again, it worked well when I applied force all at once with wide pliers like the one in the picture in the manual.
When I put the last main unit back inside the car, it took a bit of work to store the wiring, but somehow I was able to install it.
Once attached, you can watch DVDs, TVs, and navigation systems while driving without any problems.
If you order it at a dealer, it costs over 80,000 yen, and at specialty stores it costs over 40,000 yen, so I think it's a very cost effective product.
Below the price
To be honest, I don't know why it's so highly rated. First of all, the cotton inside is poly, but it's cut inside the cushion and there are fluffy parts and squishy parts. It seems that it's already worn out, or rather, there are few cotton overall, and I thought I tried using it, but I think products that have an integrated head and body pillow part may fit or not fit until you try them out. For me, I don't think the separate pillow and body pillow will fail I bought it for 3600 yen at a time sale this time, but I want to return it. I just reflected on the fact that I should be more wary of reviews with 5 stars in the first place
It's impossible, it's impossible
Item arrived.
I was allowed to use it right away.
There is no problem with the feeling of use, and you can pump milk properly.
However, there are times when I feel that the sound is a bit annoying and the power button doesn't respond well.
I can use it without problems, so I don't care, but those who are interested may be concerned.
It's not super quiet 😅 If you use it in the middle of the night, you might be a little careful.
Also, I was worried about whether the attached tube and the part that connects to the machine would fit into the tube, but it came in a push shape 😂 It's lightweight, so I think it's easy to carry around!
You need a knack for whipping...
I'm not sure if it's the worst compatibility with my hair type or if it's a problem with the performance of this shampoo, but it doesn't foam at all with normal usage.
(The shampoo I've used until now has foamed without problems even when used normally), and here is the solution I found ↓ ① First, pick up a smaller amount of shampoo than normal and let it blend smoothly into the entire hair.
(At this point, it doesn't foam at a level where not a single bubble appears) ② Rinse your hair once, then pick up an appropriate amount of shampoo and let it blend into your hair.
(Now it finally foams normally) Well, in short, I'm washing it twice lol The volume of the shampoo itself is pretty small, so the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo for the first time as much as possible... I'm satisfied with the effects of the shampoo itself.
It's clear that I bought a shampoo that was so expensive, but clearly there was a feeling that my hair felt better to the touch.
However, my honest impression is that I wasn't satisfied with the overall review.
It's a pity that the Quattro Botanico series was only used by facial cleansing goods...
Even though the capacity is small, being forced to wash twice is poor cost performance.
Also, considering the scent that doesn't seem to be popular with everyone, I'm going to give this place a slightly stricter rating of 2 stars.
Assessment is difficult
There are negative positives, so it's difficult to evaluate.
Just use a blade cleaner to clean the front side of the blade.
I think the original blade matches well with a razor with good accuracy.
Position: As intended, dirt on the blade, such as sebum, soap scum, etc., can be removed.
If the sharpness deteriorates due to that dirt (only on the front side), it will last a long time.
Negative: The life span of the Smoother is drastically reduced.
If the cutting edge is coated, such as titanium coat, ceramic coat, etc., the coating will peel off easily.
(If you use a shaver about 2 to 3 times, the coating will almost peel off, so I think it's better to use this cleaner afterwards.
Be careful with razors that say don't wipe the edge of the blade.
) There are times when you can substitute fall prevention rubber (anti-vibration rubber) that you put under furniture etc. used to prepare for earthquakes, so I'm wondering if it's about cost performance.
※The life span of the razor I've used has increased by 20 to 30%.
Determining when to throw away a razor blade is difficult, but I think it's when the blade is damaged by shaving and the edge of the blade becomes rattled.
In that sense, I think it's a good product because it can prevent loss of sharpness due to dirt.
(It's just that sharpening with a cleaner has no effect. (There are times when it feels like it has been sharpened, but it seems that it feels like a small amount of rust has been removed.)
Being caught in a TV commercial...
I saw an elderly woman's face pull up quite a bit after applying it once in a TV commercial, so I bought it.
When I actually tried using it, the texture was slightly firmer than a normal gel, so I use it after wiping it off with pre-lotion.
At first, it's sticky and I don't like it, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will unexpectedly get into your skin.
There was almost no stickiness after entering, and it felt like my skin was adhering to my hands.
After all, the lift up didn't work like TV.
I felt a sense of firmness all at once.
Since I have super dry skin, this alone is still not enough, and I've been using it since I used a certain Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It feels just as moisturized.
I was expecting it because I was wondering if it would cover sagging pores, but it's not covered.
Try using one bottle and see if it works, and if so, I think a repeat would be a good idea.
The work of putting it together must have been difficult, but...
It is labor compiled by looking back on the statements made by politicians in the past few years.
As I read it, I'm somehow convinced that that statement at that time was ah after all.
However, when considering its value as a reading material, it is a delicate matter whether it can be said that the “fact-checking” that the authors call is necessary and sufficient.
To be honest, I'm not interested in reading it.
I thought about a lot of things, but I felt that the major drawback of this book was the “method.”
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call “fact” here is forever true.
I felt that the people themselves were aware of the fragility of “fact-checking” (let's call it the possibility of disproof), and it was quite suspicious from the way they wrote it.
It makes me feel a bit bleak when the current Japanese journalists' perception of “facts” is at this level.
It seems that there are many people who recommend it, but it may suit those who want at least some knowledge about the content covered in this book.
If there are readers like the reviewers who are interested in the current “fact-checking” carried out by the Japanese mass media, I don't think this book would fit.
For people who don't improve their scores in mock exams.
At my school, politics and economics are printed, and the class format that feels like you're studying while being forced to do it was really boring, and before I knew it, I started to hate politics and economics.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
This year's center with a current high of 3.
Since I bought it in March, I chose this as my study partner for 1 hour to and from school.
First impressions are all there is one word that is easy to understand.
You've reached God's realm, haven't you?
When I finished 1 lap and took past questions, my average was 40 at the time, and my average was 70.
As a matter of fact, I was surprised.
It stretches to the point where you think you've eaten something strange.
I was able to feel firsthand that what can be obtained from this reference book is improving not only knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also by synergizing with my own abilities and improved motivation for studying.
Thank you so much for letting me meet you.
Crime prevention
I experienced two entrance picking attempts 8 years ago, and I have taken crime prevention measures.
This is a replacement for the camera I bought 8 years ago.
I used to use the infrared irradiation 30m type (other company).
Another person wrote about this product, but the distance that can recognize faces at night is about 5 meters.
I agree.
It just arrived and I haven't even made any settings, but I'm at the stage where I compared how the cameras looked and checked for bugs.
The image quality is much better than the camera from 8 years ago (of course).
I displayed it in 4 parts on a 32 inch monitor, but if I set the shooting size to the maximum, there is no problem.
There are no problems with the product so far.
Those who are considering a level where facial recognition can be performed on conditions other than crime prevention may be particularly dissatisfied with night photography, but at this price, it's the best!
I'm for crime prevention measures, but I'm not even requesting facial recognition.
Because if you wear a mask or mask, you won't understand (especially at night).
Professional burglars (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
It seems that even if it is small, it can distinguish between high-performance cameras and recordings.
On the other hand, I'm in trouble if I'm not a pro.
Nonetheless, recent burglaries are bold and clever, so instead of relying only on cameras, I recommend using them together with various crime prevention goods.
For example, it's a white solar LED garden light that you can get for around 1,500 yen at a hardware store (the latest one is super bright and comes with 6 units).
Since it's solar, there's no electricity bill required, but since it doesn't light up until morning in the winter, it also has 3 100V human sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30 meters at which human figures could be recognized.
Also, for daytime crime prevention, if you think that the threatening effect will fade because the camera is small, I think a cover with ingenuity is necessary.
I have a “24-hour security camera in operation” sticker on it.
This is an original product from the security camera manufacturer I used before.
It is more effective on manufacturer products than attaching things sold at hardware stores.
The place to apply it is an intrusion path for thieves that would not be able to be covered by camera photography.
In that sense, I wanted stickers this time.
Also, the manual for internet settings is difficult to understand, so I chose it as negative.
If there are any deficiencies after setup/setting, I will add them.
I sympathize so much that it becomes painful to read
If you were born in 1982 in Japan, your social situation may be slightly better than her, but the situation that is far from equal is still going on just because the Equal Employment Law for Men and Women has been enforced.
As I read on, painful memories of surviving discrimination as a member of society came back to life, and it became stifling.
It depicts the suffering not only of Korea and Japan, but also of all women trying to live not as women but as human beings in feudal societies.
Isn't it time for women alone to at least stop the emotional confrontation and stand shoulder to shoulder to confront this society?
Dramas that make you think “men are the worst”
The story of the main character who was sexually abused by his biological father when he was a child.
Naturally, they continue to drag on those wounds even when they become adults.
The guys that come out are all the worst.
The main character's husband, who is good-natured and seems like a family, is also the worst in a sense.
There are spoilers ↓ It's a development that makes men feel frustrated, such as ignoring the main character's younger sister being DV from her husband even though they know, and that sister-in-law finally gathered courage and came to the police to sue her husband, but the main character's husband, who is a police officer, gets through.
The protagonist's old mother, who is pretending to be a fool, knows the fact that her husband (the protagonist's biological father) was killed by her daughter, but she doesn't know that (publicly, her biological father's death was a drug overdose).
In short, it seems that after the death of the raped father, she never made her daughter receive counseling, so it's natural for the main character to go crazy.
Does the main character's daughter want to hear about her grandfather, who died so much?
Are you curious about the old man who died so young?
in a drama? There are too many.
A few years ago, it was reported that many people died when the heatwave struck France died, and there were many French people who “can't be picked up because they are on vacation” even when hospitals and facilities contact their daughter and son, and the Paris morgue was full.
These people are “dry.”
I watched the husband and daughter at the end of the drama, and I felt that it was “dry” after all.
French ones are completely different from America, etc., and there are many scenes where the absurd part gives a good finish, but I watched a relatively large number of scenes where I thought it would be better to cut this while fast moving forward.
Professional boundaries
If the precise calculation and an unexpected accident that still cannot be read were involved in someone's life, they were probably prepared that it was worth betting on their own, even if they had calculated it from the beginning to some extent.
The script that embodies the drama that shakes such a fine heart, as she fights against her own conflicts that are not shown in public, and how far she deceives her surroundings in order to pass through her own beliefs, was amazing.
Even if you add it to that... Jessica's acting is really amazing.
No matter what you look at, there's nothing wrong with it.
It really is a professional job.
Feeling of use It then broke down
I've used 3 units until now, but this item broke down in no time, either in a good sense or in a bad way.
What led me to choose this product was that I used the first 2200 milliamp built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out at 200 degrees 5 minutes 3 sessions.
The USB port on the second device is defective.
Charging becomes impossible.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problems up until now, but after reinserting the battery about 15 times (I used the battery as a charger so that the USB terminal wouldn't break), the contact got worse, so it became difficult to turn on the power.
Press the lid to turn on the power.
If you are an IQOS user, I think there are people who have experience with it.
those are the symptoms.
As stated in the notice, the batteries do not use batteries other than those included.
The claws and catch parts look like they have been carved out, so there doesn't seem to be any bends.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought one without the Starry logo at the same time I returned it, but I will describe the comparison with this one.
They look the same size.
The same goes for chambers and draws.
This LCD is prettier.
Maybe newer than without a logo.
This vibrator is modest.
It's like a smartphone vibrator.
Without a logo, the vibration of the vibrator or rather the sound is loud.
A cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese, but...
The attached items are slightly different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
Without a logo, it hardens like steel wool.
It's roughly like that.
I think Starry would have been better, but if it breaks down quickly, credibility will be lost.
I wanted to exchange it, but since I was only able to choose to return it, I went ahead with the procedure even though it was troublesome.
It's just ear rubber, but it's ear rubber
This flat rubber really doesn't hurt.
It's the best mask of the same type I've used so far in terms of how comfortable it feels on the ears.
Even with flat rubber, it may be twisted, and the twisted chopper part may rub against the base of the ear, causing more pain than round rubber, but I think this product is not only soft to the touch, but the length is also just right and made to be less likely to be twisted.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, and not only does it fit, but since there is an appropriate space between the nose wire and the lower side placed on the jaw = in front of the mouth, it's hard to feel stuffy.
There are times when it's because it fits the size of your own face.
I don't know if it fits everyone in the same way, but if you don't think any of the smaller sizes are good, I think it's a good idea to try them once.
When I opened the outer box, it was in vinyl with a center slit like a box tissue, but when I took out the first one, the ear rubber on both sides got caught and it was hard to take it out, so I reduced it by 1 star by that amount.
The dealer's response is 1 star
The price and taste are perfect, but even though the date was specified, I was distrustful of the response of the vendor that ignored it and sent it.
Other than this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
I always buy on Amazon, so I know the delivery staff.
Since they carry particularly heavy items to the top, we took care to schedule the arrival date as much as possible, but it's a mess.
It is said that the shipping company is in trouble because of Amazon, but they are doing it thinking that there is even one thing that users can cooperate with.
I'm disappointed with the arrogant dealer's response.
But the price is cheap.
If you're considering purchasing, include disposal costs
I don't think it can be used for a long time due to many complaints.
I think it's a good idea to consider including the cost of disposal.
For reference, it seems that there are also municipalities that have centers that accept oversized garbage for free or at a low cost if you bring it in.
[Sitting Comfort] The seat surface tilts slightly to the left and wobbles even more, so it's very tiring to sit on.
If it moves even a little, it makes a loud creaking noise.
It's so loud at night that I can't use it.
This is my biggest concern, and I feel that I can't keep using it with this.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions only explain with rough pictures.
The information necessary for assembly is lacking, and there are many mistakes.
・There are people who write that they lean forward in reviews where there is no explanation about the direction of the seat surface and the pillar fixing stand when attached, but there is a possibility that the direction when the seat surface and the pillar fixing stand are reversed.
When properly attached, the height adjustment lever faces backwards on the right hand side, and the dial for adjusting the direction of the spring on the back is forward.
However, since the forward side of the height adjustment lever is more natural, there will be many people who install it by mistake.
There are no such basic precautions in the manual, and assembly is carried out while doing trial and error while looking at miscellaneous pictures.
・There is an error in the explanation of the contents. The list of contents at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who can't find the 8 x 20 mm screws that come with the 12 screws and search for them.
The 8x20mm screw is already inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to search for it in vain.
The machining accuracy is low, and it seems that there are combinations that can be inserted even with the same screw holes and screws and combinations that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, it's very difficult just to insert a screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it is conceivable that they are shipped with screws inserted like this.
Also, I couldn't find any spare screws in the manual.
[Other] The black part on the surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring and is whitish in some places, so it's better not to expect anything beautiful like the product photo.
Explanations that there are deficiencies in the manual and supplementary explanations on the above installation methods were sent to the email address registered on Amazon 2 to 3 days after the product arrived.
Originally, these things should be sent out immediately after the product has been shipped.
Since many buyers have completed assembly 2 to 3 days after the product arrives, it is a completely meaningless act.
Hmm...
I'm a big fan of thermoses and have been using the straw type thermos for over 15 years, but of all the ones I've used so far, this model is by far the hardest to use..
① The drinking spout part of the straw is made of a harder material than before, and the groove snaps right into the main body, so the drinking spout parts of the straw can't be removed at all from the main body anymore!
! My nails break when I desperately try to remove them..
② Only the tip of the drinking spout of the straw is thinner than before, so the straw brush no longer fits.
③ The mysterious part called the valve attached to the tip of the straw is thicker than a straw brush, making it dramatically harder to clean.
I'm a little shocked because I've used the straw type until now and haven't had any complaints.
Not being able to take the drinking spout out of the main body is really stressful.
The good thing is that it still has excellent cold insulation.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and wash it the next day, about 50% of the ice I put in the day before is still left.
I don't drink Hot, so I will continue to be a straw type person.
Please improve it on the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
I'm reviewing this for the first time.
(This is an impression of an amateur who bought a doll from scratch for the first time and has little knowledge of wearing doll eyes for the first time) The product as shown in the picture arrived.
When I put it on my Obitsu Doll, it's so cute and the light comes in, so I'm very satisfied.
However, when attached (entrance), it is slightly stiff and cannot be attached unless force is applied to push it in.
I think the method is different, but I put tweezers in the hole in the doll eye and pushed it in.
Regarding shipping, this is my first time shipping from overseas, so I used 3 weeks as a guide, but it arrived sooner than I expected in 8 days (Narita Airport is close).
However, I was uneasy because the shipping email was never sent.
If you look at the shipping description on Amazon earlier, it says it's still being shipped.
There was no damage or air in the eyes, and there was a lot of bubble wrap on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it's safe for the time being.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information OK even though it's an email service from overseas?
I felt doubtful, so I'll set it to minus 1.
There's no problem with the product, and I think it's a great bargain for this amount at that price.
Additional note Doll Eye 8mm model iPhone SE
Slightly small (work area is small), charging is terrible
I ordered it after seeing the size chart, but I felt it was about two times smaller than I had imagined.
It's larger than A4 size, but since the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I was thinking of using it when repairing electronic devices or making Gunpla, but as expected, it's hard to use without the B4 size.
If you use it only for soldering iron work and use a separate tray or mat for other tasks such as assembly and disassembly, you may be able to manage it.
Place tools, place parts, and perform further work within an area the size of a magazine... It's impossible.
I also thought about ordering another one of the same things and doubling the area, but since the charge was so severe during work that all the dust and cut parts stick to it, I think it would be difficult to keep using it for a bit.
Fatal Defects
After struggling with the lid of the battery box not opening, I finally opened the lid using a rubber anti-slip sheet, but when I loaded the battery and tried to close it, it wouldn't close no matter what.
It's out at this point.
Highly rated one!
Will the battery box lid close???
Plus, instead of the protective seal on the product, there was a small, bulky saran wrap on it.
could this be a used item???
The only explanation is in English, which is tightly written on a small piece of paper.
There are no illustrated explanations, and no one knows how to operate it.
Maybe it would be good for other fingers...
I found a good product!
I bought it as soon as I thought.
I use it for pinky rings, so if I don't use it a lot, it won't fit and it's a bit lumpy...
But I think it's good for using it on other fingers.
But I think he's a good idea merchant.
For the price
After all, you shouldn't be looking for quality in this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was crushed.
I felt like I put it on and the size was just right.
It may be tough for people with thick ears.
Maybe I should have bought one without a pattern.
That's crazy
The design is good, but if you put it on your hand, won't the effect fade even if you put it on your big foot?
In eastern Hokkaido during the harsh winter season...
As mentioned in other people's reviews, the heating wire is only 110 x 80 net, and the arrangement is horizontal rather than vertical.
I bought it because I wanted to warm the entire futon evenly, so I bought it because it's more expensive than a mattress type, but I can't check it at stores like famous manufacturers, so I wonder if it can't be helped.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and Zero Tori's N Warm.
Incidentally, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
It's well-made
It's small and has plenty of airflow.
Batteries can also be replaced with spare ones.
If you place it on a desk to adjust the angle, it will be fine if you do it as shown in the picture.
If it's on a smooth desk, it will blow away with your own wind power, but if you lay out a handkerchief, there's no problem.
If you use the sound outside, at a family restaurant, etc., you won't notice it even if it's “inside,” but if it's an office, it's loud and useless even if it's “small.”
It is only necessary to divide it by being a companion when going outside.
Also, for office use, even if it's “small,” the air volume is too high and it gets too cold.
It's perfect for scenes where you get sweaty on the go, run away to a family restaurant, and cool off all at once in a “big” way.
However, when you throw it into your bag, on rare occasions, the power button is pressed and it keeps spinning without you knowing it.
It would be nice if there were ways to retract the button slightly (make it collapse) or hold down the weak button on the first press.
It's an essential item in times of intense heat where lives are at risk, so it would be helpful if you could make something better.
Multi-function light speaker
It's the weakest warm color, and I use it by placing it in my bedroom.
It's better than I expected!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color with a touch type.
The white color goes well with any room, and the color light also changes with gradation, so it's beautiful.
Also, if you touch the color you like, it will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it light up according to your mood!
Since it is an LED type, you can expect a long life.
As for the sound quality, I think the level is more than enough satisfying for my ears as an amateur.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it's multifunctional anyway.
・A large speaker is attached to the top.
Bluetooth pairing is possible with mobile phones, etc., so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
・If you pair it with a cell phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
・Also, since it is compatible with microSD, it can also be linked to a computer, and music can be played as an mp3 player.
typing and piano practice
At age 66, he began challenging DTM to prevent blur.
I bought an audio interface and this unit.
At first, I was typing in, but I became addicted to playing the piano, so I spent every day practicing.
I downloaded the requested sound source, but the protection didn't work, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but since the free piano sound source sounds good, I use this for piano practice.
I think I'm glad I bought it.
There is a feeling that the appearance has deceived me.
Is the product out of place?
It's going to be a long sentence.
Since the synthetic leather of the Doshisha office chair (flip-up armrest) that was used for 4 to 5 years deteriorated and became tattered, I was considering purchasing a chair with a non-synthetic leather flip-up armrest.
I searched hardware stores and furniture stores, but there were no suitable ones.
I'm worried about not being able to confirm the actual product, but I compromised on the appearance and price of the design and purchased this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is 1 spare set of screws.
Note: The included hex wrench and screws are greasy with oil.
At first, I didn't know the oil adhering to the hex wrench, and since the main body was white, I was impatient when oil got on it.
Assembly completed in 40 minutes.
Complete and check the product.
The firmness of the flip-up armrests is different when raised and lowered on the left, the left side is heavy for raising and lowering, the right side is light, and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no way to adjust).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest has poor fixation and immediately hangs down along with a “click” sound.
The seat feels that the non-recycled high-density urethane foam is hard, and it's not comfortable to sit on (poor elasticity?
) The competition mesh on the backrest is stiff compared to other companies' mesh chairs, so if you wear light clothing, your back hurts.
As a detail, the height from the seat to the ground was 530 instead of 550 (seat height is important for height) and since the leg part that supports the caster is not made of steel, questions remain about durability.
A cushion purchased separately is placed, and the mesh fabric part seems to deteriorate (damage) quickly, so I use a towel blanket.
For me who is 186 cm 80 kg, I felt that only the fit on my back was good, but other than that, I think it's a product with a low level of satisfaction, and I also feel that it is a product with a mismatch.
After all, it might be better to look at the actual office chair and sit and buy it.
I received an Amazon email from the manufacturer saying the purchase, so should I inquire about armrests and headrests?
Under consideration.
Well, I wonder if it's something like this.
I bought a Pixela 4K tuner which was cheap without much expectation because apparently BS4K rotating to the right seems to be seen in my humble home environment.
As an experiment, I was able to watch free broadcasts with a clockwise rotation starting with the NHK BS4K, and I was able to watch them clearly on the Panasonic 4K TV I purchased at the same time.
(Sometimes images are jittery) The update came right after purchase, and since it became compatible with recording, I made a few scheduled recordings and watched them, but maybe the external device is also affected by the 2.5-inch HDD, only images stop during playback, and frame skipping occurs.
The user interface was also by no means praised, and it is divided into “4K broadcasts can be watched.”
Incidentally, it feels like only chasing and playback of the recorded program can be performed during scheduled recording, and this area is also accepted as a positive function of being able to record in 4K on an HDD.
You may be disappointed if you make a purchase with various expectations, so don't expect too much.
I hope it will improve with the update.
The heat retention function is OK
I've only used the heat retention function yet, but when I put in 2 500ml PET bottles, it became warm in about 2 hours, and it felt hot in 2 and a half hours.
I used it by placing it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car, but the fan sound bothers me when idling stops, but I don't feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the smell of chemical substances emitted by the fan that was still fresh, so I needed to open the window regularly to ventilate.
As written by another person in the review, the burrs on the part where the shoulder strap passes are severe, so it is necessary to break the burrs with a flathead screwdriver or the like.
Really fragile
Today, 2 months after I started using it, it suddenly broke down.
I liked the feel and size of the keys, but there's no point in breaking them.
I use a PC all day for my job processing images, but the volume goes to 100% without permission.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
I can't use the earphones because my ears hurt, and the volume is so loud that I don't feel like using a PC at night.
It seems that a signal is being sent every few seconds, and the volume display repeatedly appears and disappears on the computer screen.
Furthermore, since the keyboard interferes with mouse instructions, you won't be able to use the mouse freely unless you turn off the keyboard one by one.
The enter key and backspace keys also stopped responding.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's for 1,000 yen, it might be a good idea to buy it for a trial.
If you're lucky, you'll be able to use it for about six months.
Compared to other companies' 1 to 3 year warranties even in the same price range, this is a 6-month warranty.
The short warranty period shows how easy it is to break.
The product is the best, the packaging is the worst
The product comes in different colors and I love it because I love it.
I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a food stocker!
However, there was enough space for it to roll around in the large cardboard, there was no delivery note, and the packaging was terrible.
The lid had also come off when I opened the box.
I recommend the product, but it might be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the intensity, but for now
When I bought a new lid, there was no support left, so I bought it.
It plays a role in the sense of stabilizing the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, it makes a disgusting sound saying “loud... (seems to break)” if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid.
You have to choose one that fits the thickness of the lid, so be careful when purchasing.
A bag with cute paws
When I was looking for a bag to go out with my dog, I was attracted to the stylish gray bag and bought this one.
It comes fully assembled, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so I felt like it wasn't that heavy even when I held it.
The zippers also move smoothly and there are no snags.
It seems easy even when traveling for a long time.
It's very compact and easy to fold.
You can see the paw design even when folded, and it's cute even when placed.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley twirls are also comfortable to use
First of all, I fell in love at first sight with how it looked and how cheap it was! I bought it.
TSA rock has been my favorite for the past few years, and I have several others, so it's convenient, isn't it?
Also, as a master of forgetting or losing keys, I recommend number locks.
However, to be honest, I've placed the most important point on lightness, so it's fine, but if you're looking for durability or security, the zipper part is a quick week, and it's cloth, so just use a knife! If it were cut, it would break in an instant, wouldn't it?
Also, since the place where the zippers fit together is sweet, I want ingenuity that overlaps with each other.
If it's overseas, I recommend it as a carry-on item.
Anyway, I used it on my Shinkansen trip and it was comfortable.
Choosing a size is difficult...
It's hard to buy shoes because of the wide range.
Converse and Vans wear 24cm.
The MRL996 is also 24 cm.
Tough at the beginning? I thought, but once you get used to it, it's fine.
The ML574 this time was certainly tough when my sister said that 24.5 cm was tough and she let me wear it.
It felt like my little finger was hitting me.
Therefore, I bought 25cm.
When I arrived and opened it, it was big...
When I tried them on, they felt a little loose even when wearing socks.
I was wondering if I should return it, but it would be troublesome if I set it to 24.5 and it became tough, so I think I'll wear it with the insole at 25 as it is.
I bought team red and it's a bright red and it's so good!
I often wear black or white monotone clothes, so wearing these will brighten up!
165 cm, male in his 40s
I ordered the L size appropriately, but if the specs are similar to the following, I recommend the medium size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm This is a typical metabolic syndrome belly.
＜Feeling＞ In the water, the rash guard rolls up, probably because the lower back part is loose.
I'm swimming while fixing the swollen part.
Especially when you let your guard down in the jacuzzi, your metabolic syndrome and stomach are in full view.
Also, if you walk while moving up and down vigorously, you will still start to roll up from below.
＜Product Making＞ The fabric is strong and not too thin, so there's no need to worry about your nipples showing through.
At this price, I'm satisfied with this construction, but I think it would be better if you bought a smaller one.
There was a gas leak after all, but...
The Silver Colt 25 was still leaking gas, and there was also a problem where part of the tank was missing when the valve was replaced, but when I sealed the tank using [Bath Bond Q] and repaired and greased it up, I was able to hit it smoothly, but people who want to buy this Colt 25 ask someone who can disassemble it or someone who can do it, and people who don't have confidence don't really recommend it, and people who think it's okay to break it may be fun I don't know, I also bought another black Colt 25. The trick to disassembling it is to remove the left side while holding the trigger with the thumb of my left hand, and I managed to disassemble it myself without the parts flying; when assembling, I applied silicone grease to the springs and small parts and assembled it while fixing it with grease; when disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the safety screw, remove the safety screw, remove the two screws on the left body, and damage the tip of the barrel Make sure you don't get caught between the front sight and inner barrel with pliers, so if you pull it out, then if you slowly remove the left side of the Monaka structure, you can disassemble it; just don't blame people even if you fail at your own risk.
I was wondering what kind of quality 188 yen would be
You can choose between quick rotation and when torque is required.
It's light and small, and above all, I like its simplicity without any frills.
There's no rattling when the bit is attached, and I thought it would be amazing cost performance if it was 188 yen.
After that, I wonder about durability.
You may not use it that often, but I think it's a good idea to put it in your tool box.
I bought it together with the “1/4 inch hex shank magnetic quick release screwdriver knurl bit holder 60/100/150 mm” from the same seller.
There were no problems here either, or rather, it was pretty good for the price.
The controller doesn't work
The machine moves without permission, making it impossible to operate it.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but as soon as a few minutes later, it becomes a symptom that the machine moves in the wrong direction and cannot be operated.
It's better not to buy this product.
I'll warn you all for the time being.
Terrible product.
It's wired, but I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It is highly reliable and still hasn't broken even after being used for a long time.
It can also be used for PC games.
... Additional note I was able to refund my Amazon gift card by returning it as a defective item within 1 month, so I think that was a good thing.
Will this improve my calculation skills?
I think it's suitable for children who understand computation.
Wouldn't it be impossible if you weren't a child who understood computation to some extent?
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, when I give tools to my master, I slide something on the screen upward with my finger, but I tried it myself, but no matter how many times I did it, it didn't go smoothly.
In short, maybe it's easier for people who are used to DS to it to slide.?
I don't really like the illustrations of people in comics, or rather, I think that DS and the like come in because of the fun on the screen, but... for some reason I'm not familiar with them.
The calculation method is also a method of racing against time; for example, how many questions are answered correctly in how many minutes.
I understand the feeling of making them hurry for an exam or something, but... wouldn't that make them impatient and make calculations?
For some reason, I don't like the fact that a gong sounds when it's over.
Wouldn't it be okay to make the sound more comfortable even though you've been working so hard?
I feel like 6,200 yen is a loss of money with this.
If it's half the price, I understand.
I'm sorry, I ended up with 2 ☆ due to this translation.
After all, Persona's songs are great!
Persona 3 reached ED.
I played 5 halfway through.
Persona 4 has already been controlled on Vita.
What you can do hasn't changed since the previous Persona 4 game.
There's no story, so I feel like it's shorter than the previous one.
After all, the song is so cool!
Just listening makes me feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were made to HD for the first time, so I was moved when I first saw them.
Somehow Junpei looked like a handsome guy (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so it's not fresh... Thinking about that, I feel like 3 is a better deal.
As a sound game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was hard to see when the background was dark.
Since 5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, it is easy to see even when covered with a background.
There are plenty of assist functions, so I think even people who don't like sound games can play it.
If you are an expert in sound games, turning on the challenge function may make it a challenging game.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not a bonus, it's a solid 4-disc set, so if you like Persona songs, I recommend this one.
Something too bad
I liked the color of the dial in the photo and bought it, but the actual product has a bluish tinge, but it's close to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but since the pending price is cheap so far, I wonder if I can give up?
Additional note After posting the review, I received an email from the seller stating that they would apologize and exchange it for a new product.
Subsequent processing was also quick.
Despite being an inexpensive product, I think the compatibility was very good.
4 stars were added for compatibility, then gold was also purchased.
The color is almost as pictured and I think it's very beautiful.
But after all, the buckle isn't a double lock, and the difference from the explanatory photo is obvious.
That's all I'm sorry about.
It gets really heavy in the evening.
I used it on my SIM-free iPhone 7S.
In the initial settings, I didn't know how to do it after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (turn on data roaming from Settings> Mobile Communication> Communication Options), and it worked fine.
Seems like the instructions attached to the product didn't have much to do with it...?
However, the area around Gimpo Airport has been grasping 3G for a long time, probably because the radio waves are in poor condition.
When I went out into the city, it became 4G.
Sometimes communication became very heavy in the evening or at night, but if I think about it now, I may have reached the maximum limit of hundreds of megabytes per day.
Better than I thought
I used the SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, made it SIM-free and used it with Ymobile, and the condition of the Z4 got worse, so when I was looking to buy a used Xperia, I found this phone that was brand new and I could use a mobile phone that I bought.
I was using a mobile Suica, so I was worried about whether I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so I took a quick look at the iPhone 6? That's my impression.
Since it doesn't play GAME, the processing speed is no different from the Z4, and I have the impression that it is a bit faster. In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition is slow, but since I have the impression that it takes a little while to recognize, face recognition is faster, so I'm using it here.
I thought it was amazing because it looked like an iPhone. Android was also changed to Ver 9, and I was able to shop satisfactorily.
What bothered me is that there are no strap holes that can be made a little smaller ※I haven't tested compatible water resistance with a case with a strap hole, it's a bit heavy and I'm still only using a little bit, but I'm satisfied, I recommend it
