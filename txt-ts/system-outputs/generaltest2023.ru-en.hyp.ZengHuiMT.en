The July issue is traditionally surrendered during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to read the stripes when the soul is torn at Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will tell about MIFF next time ( for now I will only complain that this year the inexplicable idea that happy owners of purchased tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and completely insulting principle that no normal film festival in the world sins, has finally become stronger in the minds of the organizers), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr), and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr” Kinotavr”, which no normal film festival in the world sins), and we report on this issue.
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the title character of the Robert Rodriguez-produced film "Predators", and inside the magazine try not to miss the story about Christopher Nolan's "Inception" ( a man who, by the way, rebooted "Batman", by the way, rebooted "Batman", the magazine.   “), the most  without fools  the expected film of the summer.”
And this time we publish the first part of a rather detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here you definitely don’ t need to advertise anything specially, and it’ s a no brainer that the author of “ Suspicion” and “ Rope” is our Tatyana Alekhicheva, Boris Gleizerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Mariashinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergei Mezenov, Sergei Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alja Logunova, Chris Hew
Cornered, she will repaint herself in the black we are used to and she herself will go to seek the truth.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal woman promises to further consolidate the position of the actress in the action genre.
She will arrange one accident after another, run along the walls a la "Matrix" and as children scatter strong men in the same strict suits.
That's how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, dear, who blew up and repaired the world with the Fifth Element and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was his most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was his most stylish and flawless incarnation of Evil.
And at the same time, all together turned out to be not a boring block-buster of the American type about the salvation of mankind, but the cutest living carnival.
What did Besson do for 13 years between the Element?   " and "Adele"   I don't want to remember.
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this script-producer fuss and rare, tortured directorial performances will be forgotten.
But here is Adele.   “  hardly did anyone else know?”
When you watch this movie, it seems that 13 years in front of us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, sipped wine in a cafe across the street and composed a story about a charming adventurer.
To retell the plot ( albeit in general terms), warming up expectations, in this case sinful more than usual.
Here the whole incredible drive is that surprises await you at every turn or replica.
And all as one pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision.
ADELE'S EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADELE
The most dashing adventure movie of the decade hints that Adele's Extraordinary Adventures will begin as Amelie, rush aside Jurassic Park, continue with Indiana Jones and The Mummy, and end with Titanic.
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy's comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin starred in only three films before Adele.
The actress became famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for a César Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to appreciate the special effects, scenery or stunts, but carries him along like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: “ Forward, my reader, great things await us, great things await us. “
At the same time, Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has seen enough of old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not denying yourself cynicism and not being shy about risk-taking.
DIRECTOR: Luc Besson.
CAST Louise Bourgoise, Mathieu Ullрик, Frédéric Belle, Gilles Lelouch.
PLOT: In Paris in 1912, strange things happened in Paris.
The city was disturbed by an ancient monster, which was awakened to life by an old medium.
The fossil creature is being chased by the police, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a case not so much for the beast itself as for the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
IS GUD MARKET ON JULY 22nd.
“ Adele” .   “  The case when parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it along a new pathway.
So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster action movies, with the mentioned "Indiana Jones" ( they bowed to him here and ridiculed him), finally, with the same "The Fifth Element", finally, with the same "The Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film consists of verbal trickery, acting clowning and plot balancing act ( circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is organic and stronger than ever) .
A few words should be said about Adele herself.
It embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of adventurer, who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality as the purest courage and courage.
In the cinema, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of macho on duty or hairy romantic.
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV.
Face to face with history.
There is only a timid and comical admirer who only spins under his feet ( only his knowledge of zoology is useful) .
Therefore, an energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, completely sour Luc Besson showed unexpected creative dash, recalling that the border between the preferences of bored visitors to megamalls and highbrow regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing an adventure movie without sadness, fear and reproach.
ROOM OF DEATH.
The sealed horror with a claim to psychologism and political context in 2002, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film was destroyed by criticism, but the audience liked it and made good money at the box office, and most importantly, caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director got to the factory forging new horrors according to old patterns: Bay set out to remake all horror classics and commissioned Liebesman to do a prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ( 2006) .
Criticism again fiddled, but the audience again liked it - Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new scary", emphasizing the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, on his example, you can observe how the whole genre is rushing about in convulsions, trying to invent new ways of influencing a saturated audience: the naturalistic blood of splatters merges with the catch-up of slashers.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without the liters of blood, without the liters.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut painting Cube. The film is already made by Michael Bay.
So in the "Death Room" Liebesman was forced to take a different path: a stupid massacre or a monotonous running from a maniac, he preferred a smarter option - almost without the notorious blood, but with a psychological game and riddles, however, with a psychological game and riddles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with test subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to develop a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other.
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside.
Or try to break your cage at any cost.
Not only they are tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor skilled in wild experiments.
THE SCENE: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test at a cost of $250, but four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given to each pile of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A survival game begins, with government agents closely watching behind the glass, behind which government agents are watching closely behind us.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for an outright arthouse movie.
He can make small talk, and go with a fire extinguisher on his face, but he can't miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is circumspect and indomitable in her sympathies and is persistent.
She is hurt by her father's courtly lifestyle and openly peeps at how he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not the difference of generations or the choice of profession, it is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the girl’ s unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
Sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan together with Pavel Bardin made a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Three and a Snowflake" with Ivan Urgant "Three and a Snowflake".
The father of a growing daughter in the comedy genre was convincingly portrayed by Depardieu.
A fractional plot loops around the love affairs of the heroes, who all the time talk about psychology, and themselves, apparently, according to a witty director's find, focus on the language of gaze and gesture.
Secondary plot branches ( a girl crippled in a car accident, whom Alexei wants to marry, an athlete-drunk performed by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are drawn only dottedly.
I especially feel sorry for the line about the business of buying football players, which remained behind the scenes.
PLOT: More than anything, the soccer star sales agent is concerned about the fate of his underage daughter Nastya.
The compassionate dad himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy "with a rod."
What is the disappointment of a businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the audience of the film, the author got into the "nine": "Do not look for a problem where there is none" "Do not look for a problem where there is none". You can't be more precise.
Their resemblance simply cannot help but be striking.
In both tapes there are detachments of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who framed them, and in each company there is one beautiful girl in every company.
The heroes jump almost the same parts of the world ( both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - and here and there something full of dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind of bucks descends on the scenery from bucks to the bucket descends on the scenery.
Even the villains dressed up in expensive costumes are not easy to distinguish from each other ( they are both played by the Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there) .
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to shoot about dance battles - "The Brotherhood of Dance" - the Brotherhood of Dance.
Chris Evans was recently called to play a character from other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that came out in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - a comedy series from the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without collusion, brought different material to an absolutely identical rumbling denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action movies that evoke a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger ( comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold) .
If we have to choose between these two tapes, then "Losers" look a little prettier and obviously more victorious in terms of efficiency ( after all, the budget is three and a half times less)
At least there is Zoe Saldana, who is very good with the Baskas.
CAST Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Grace Elba, Columbus Short, Columbus Short.
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were set up by their own superiors: a helicopter with the children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were considered dead from that second onwards.
But they are alive - and intend to take revenge at all costs on the scoundrel with the languid voice who set it all up.
It's all nice, but honestly, spending an hour and a half of your life on White's painting is only worth it if you don't have any more interesting options at all.
Made from recycled, conditionally edible action movie.
A simple story about a runaway Romanian convict.
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only these data at hand, one can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without a doubt, cinema promises to be acutely social.
Of course, it will be realistic, and hardcore, too.
The likelihood of participation of non-professional actors is high.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film ( yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor) .
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were given a lecture on Bresson in the early 80s.
The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin IFF.
The script is based on a play by Andrey Valean, whose work is in particular demand among the directors of the Romanian New Wave.
Operator Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All of the above is also true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and-please understand us correctly-it is not at all abusive, but recommendatory in nature: the Romanian New Wave is in that blissful stage of development when the faith of its representatives in the methods of its representatives is used.
of his work has not yet wavered at the moment.
And this moment must be seized: only thanks to this faith can one endure the one and a half hour spectacle of the Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pistereanu ( whose history, despite the abyss separating the two cultures, can easily be seen, despite the abyss separating the two cultures) .
convert it into an exploitation a la the 70s, with a cowboy deciding to take a walk from the prison, from where he is about to leave, to the nearest saloon) .
CAST Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu.
PLOT: After serving off his four years, 18-year-old prisoner Silvius ( Pistereanu) is soon to be released, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this point on, the behavior of the young man becomes inappropriate.
An affair with a social worker Anna further encourages the guy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the picture.
What nonsense this is all?
If you want to watch, watch.
A good debut, inspiring faint hope that a decent direction will someday grow out of the Romanian arthouse.
A cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life.
The directorial debut of a man named Coffin ( Sop) and his co-author Reno is made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all Ice Ages, Horton and Robots, in particular, for all Ice Ages, Horton and Robots.
"Despicable Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn ( by the way, it makes sense to watch in the ZO), especially if you like it when different objects now and again strive to jump from the screen into the hall), tolerably written, and, most importantly, there is not a single joke below the belt, which made you shyly squeeze into the chair and cover children's ears with your hands on Ice Ages.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the blatant asexuality of the protagonist, which in turn is dictated by the reluctance to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the main collision of single fatherhood, rather harsh black humor is responsible ( which, I would like to think, we owe to director Coffin) .
In general, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who have thought through every little thing so that all categories of citizens like the film.
It's not that we want to see the heroes of a children's cartoon eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion.
PLOT: The big-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of astronautics have transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to resort to the help of children to fulfill a great plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In some advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margot in glasses, Edith in a hat and Agnes, who is comparable in cuteness only to the kitty from Shrek in terms of cuteness.
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is copied from Christopher Meledandri - they are both bald, nasal and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances Travolta's part.
A wheelbarrow rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a conditional desert, from which three pairs of good-quality boobs come out.
That's EXACTLY what happened.
By themselves, the bearers of this gift are not so significant.
The camera confidently fixes attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately report good news - the whole film is sustained in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things in female beauty and the casting was such that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of funny things happen.
"Broker", "killer" and" stripper" dig in the sand, douse themselves with water ( do not ask why), carry some kind of snowflakes and periodically are completely fierce.
The creators believe that a swearing heifer with generous forms, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and shining white teeth - it's cool to see - it's cool.
Bitchy Things is primarily focused on classic sexploitation tapes.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of Xena the Warrior Queen and The Amazing Wanderings of Hercules.
A congenial film at the Moscow box office is Trunk for Jennifer.
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty spins the balls of a bandit, a fucking punk fights with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are added to this; and the intrigue is spun through an infinite number of flashbacks.
In general, for a film fetishist, a real Klondike of pleasures is found here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang, filming this trash parody, had fun from the heart, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren't for the physical data of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from the night channel for adults ( Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes) .
CAST Julia Voth, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez.
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring to the desert the leader of the mafia, who has diamonds hidden somewhere here for a substantial amount of money hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to claw, fight with each other and periodically arriving scumbags from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and squeeze and squeeze regularly.
Along the way, it turns out that all three are not who they were at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even funnier that way.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste.
Yes, with his latest painting, Judgment Day, a robbed Mad Max for the poor, Marshall mistook a serious misfire.
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shaken confidence.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus does not shy away from a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious B-movie aesthetics.
There is in the picture both the hooligan courage of "Dogs-warriors", and the bestial cruelty of "Descent", both.
The "Marshall Plan" to cleanse the "peplum" of adhering post-gladiator film mud, in general, worked, in general, the "peplum" to clean the "peplum" of adhering post-gladiator film mud.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His legionnaires covered with battle scars ( among others, unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough men trying to marry their military duty with an overwhelming desire to survive.
The murder and piquant details of the administration of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and thoroughness.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, was directly inspired by the introductory distribution in the German forests from the now reference "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason I absolutely don't want to try to convict Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints, and without complaints: he works honestly and without complaints, and without complaints: he works honestly and without complaints, he works honestly and without complaints.
CAST: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire, are.
The remote outpost, where the centurion Quintus Diaz ( Fassbender) is serving, is ruthlessly defeated by the Pictish reconnaissance company.
Miraculously rescued, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, try to sneak away from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadist Itain ( Kurylenko) .
The subtle arthouse artist has so far managed to win back only sharply characteristic supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after "Centurion" the situation will change.
Peplum is a corrected and supplemented edition.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and severe.
Continuation of the story about schoolgirl Bella ( Kristen Stewart) and her complex relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward ( Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf bodybuilder Jacob ( Taylor Lautner) .
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald boy sorcerer, designed to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The lord of fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors to himself.
Young Aang will only be able to stop him if he learns to control all the elements, and becomes the Avatar, only if he learns to control all the elements.
Dom Cobb ( Leonardo DiCaprio) knows how to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.

But this time he will have to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there, which was not there.

The return of the iconic character of the 80s to the big screen.
Check out George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-filmmaker Anton Corbijn ( Control) for a curious existential exploration of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly comprehending human nature.
"A visionary artist on the scale of Corbijn and the magnificent George Clooney is a film union made in heaven, " boasts a studio press release.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney's life with Italy: filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo, Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Booth's novel A Very Secretive Gentleman as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the place of the English narrator was taken by the American made in the title, and from an illegal gunsmith, the protagonist turned into a simple killer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack is trying to deal with his last case and finally quit his lucrative trade, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest ( Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute ( Thekla Ryuten), with whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love with Clooney's.
"Jack tempts fate, " reads the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be the one she claims to be.
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashy hair ( the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.

The project is directed and written by Bruce Robinson ( "Withnail and Me"), whose last directorial work was a thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists for the domestic prison drama, one can not even doubt that they were inspired by it.
But you can't approach the issue of implementing the idea literally.
However, it is good at least that the heroine of the Russian picture, although a stranger, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects on their account: Lucky Gilmore, Big Daddy, Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding, Don't mess with Gohan. “
The fifth comedy, Classmates, is released in July, and the sixth, Pretender Wife, starring Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman, is in the works.
The schedule also includes a seventh film, the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, where Sandler will simultaneously play Jack and his twin sister Jill.

In the Crimea, the shooting of the international action movie Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title" Soldiers of Fortune" is taking place.

Sam Rockwell will star in the comedy Baby Jesus alongside English pop star Pixie Lotg.
Megan Fox has been fired from Transformers 3.
According to Rag Spotify, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
Nevertheless, the English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley is likely to take the place of the main character and the new lover of the hero Shia LaBeouf.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she will have accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not frighten the sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful retraining of models in actresses.
Charlize Theron (“ Monstro”), Angelina Jolie (“ Interrupted Life”), Jessica Lange (“ Blue Sky”,“ Tootsie”), Kim Basinger (“ Secrets of Los Angeles”), Jennifer Connelly (“ Mind Games”), Gina Davis (“ Accidental Tourist”) and Halle Berry's “ First Vice Miss USA 86” (“ Monster's Ball”) started out as models or starred for fashion magazines, eventually winning a well-deserved Oscar in the end.
Succeeded in acting ( also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monaco Bellucci and, which is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko, is especially pleasant.
Their high awards are clearly at arm's length.
In short, Rosie has someone to take an example from.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who deserved a special mention of the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "All die, but I'll stay" and filmed the scandalous television series "School", received the position of creative director on the MT channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, it is already planned to shoot its own series ( about teenagers or vampires) .
Germanika has also started casting new leads.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriyes and producer Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Freaks".
The main theme of the film remained the same - the provincial teacher of the Russian language Slava Kolotilov ( Konstantin Khabensky) is in a hurry to Moscow to see his bride, but is delayed to train the football team of street children.
The second storyline of the picture received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital's bride Nadia will be played by Milla Iovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third will appear - Nadia's ex-fiancé Danya ( Ivan Urgant) will appear as an additional intrigue.
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the yard team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in the filming of The Hobbit and the presence of a mass of side projects, Guillermo del Toro abandoned the position of director.
The studios are urging producer Peter Jackson to take matters completely into his own hands, but he’ s ready to agree to this step only in case of urgent need.

Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sots-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra.
Maddened by the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed at super speeds between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Pearl Hotel, where press conferences and round tables flowed, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved to match - in almost every one someone fled somewhere: confused Asians from "Gastarbeiter" Yuppa Razykov and "Another Sky" Dmitry Mamulia were looking for a missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "Live", a "Live", a fleeing bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "Live", looking for a missing grandson and wife, a fleeing bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "Live".
The same cops were happily circled around the finger by the hero of detective Klim Shipenko" Who am I? “ - which, however, was remembered by the public rather by the presence in the frame of the totally naked Jeanne Fricke.
Appeared heroes of the domestic show business and in a couple of competitive films - in the film "Elephant" Sergei Shnurov played a trucker carrying a circus animal to the slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets talked about his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film production for two "Satisfaction", where business partners called each other to the Bedouinel because of the lady. Because of the lady, the business partners called each other to the Bedouinel because of the lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr also bore a tangible imprint of the show - it was not boring at any of them.
At a round table devoted to the fate of Russian arthouse, Sergey Tolstikov, chairman of the Foundation for the Support of Domestic Cinema, arranged a picturesque quarrel with critics: “ You can even read the press articles I read in general, which I read. “ He asked menacingly to the audience.”
"I'm writing them, " the president of ERVEZS answered in confusion, "he replied in a confused manner. Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko's film "Oatmeal" was suddenly removed from the competition program - he will go to Venice: Mostra's selectors decided that an extra Russian screening was a hindrance to them: an extra Russian screening was a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinotavr did not interfere with the giants - films of large festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film My Lucky participated in the competition, competing in the spring with Mikhalkov and Virazetan on the Azure Beret.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of the former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa's picture at all - but under pressure from his colleagues, he was forced to give her a prize for directing.
The award for best debut, "Missing", went to a daughter.
A terrible film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A finely choreographed, purifying film-an experience filmed by a misanthrope with a mathematical background who calls for only one thing - start thinking - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls the films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the joy of the viewer is in the work of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult picture" Kinotavr" has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - the director's star was born.
Impeccably dressed and trimmed, programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the hole of neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, an unjust hand of punitive organs falls on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kazinan spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's useful to work not only with debutants, " producer Sabina Eremeeva triumphantly declared from the stage, taking the prize for the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull the "inner debutant" out of the luminary of domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - nowadays in our cinema bison are moving after young people.
And not vice versa, not vice versa,
A documentary filmed in such a way that it blows your head cleaner than from a similar artistic picture.
The author is also interested in a screwdriver examining an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting through a cast-iron pan - all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover and her criminal brother into a real dock oil canvas.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolai Sokolov, tries on the black-and-white stylistics of the French New Wave on the world of sleeping areas.
Let Godarov's montage moves in the story of two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, look strange, but thank you for the rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality - thank you for the rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality - thank you.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 aircraft, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granular carbon dioxide ( "dry ice"), meteorological squibs with silver iodide and powdered reagents, take to the sky during the work.
The process is as follows: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow ( depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break" the clouds coming to the city with these reagents. Particles of substances condense moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and exactly at the place where the impact on the cloud occurred.
For ten years, work has been underway on a remake of a science fiction film, in which Michael York played the main role.
Karl Rinsch was recently appointed director ( he already has a remake of Creatures from the Black Lagon in his schedule), famous for his commercials, which are famous for their commercials.
Previously associated with the project were Bryan Singer ( X-Men), James McTeague ( V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski ( Tron: Legacy") .
In the story, the hero, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death penalty, as the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to the rotoscopic fantasy cartoon of the 80s and plans to make it into a large-scale film.
The original was a collaboration between director Ralph Bakshi ( film The Lord of the Rings, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of painted boobs.
In it, the warrior Larne saves Princess Tiger and all the people from the evil ice lord Nekron.
Rodriguez promises to pay attention to the creation of inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the near future, as 1 himself plans to remake the classic giallo painting by Dario Argento.
None other than Michael Bay, the master of action, explosions and horror remakes, will return the heroes to the wide screens.
The remake will be directed by Daming Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on Day of the Dead and filmed Two Evil Eyes together in 1990
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing the script for it.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy Arthur.
“ I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the state of affairs in China,” Chen says.
“ Chinese women nowadays run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Li embodies that power."
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
This is a fluke though.
The pattern is that.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I am presenting two films here ( at Kinotavr and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE)
And in both I play a dream woman - a dream woman.
But, you know, I don't want that.   That's how the director saw me, that's how he introduced me, and it probably seems to many that I am like that in life.
The girl is a dream.
Your partner in the film Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his hero.
How did you find a common language? What is he like on the court is what?
It is absolutely not what it seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, ‘ Yes, it’ s.   it’ s not just me “ who will have to” .
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would have nothing to do without us.
And we had this contact literally within minutes of meeting each other.
We are great, I'm not afraid of this word, we became friends.
I told him about all my fears, about all my worries, that I was afraid that I would not succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and help.
We talked a lot.
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And so at the premiere, we watched the whole film holding hands.
How was the shooting in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city where I came for the first time.
I have never had a tour there, neither on vacation, nor as a child I did not come there when I was a child.
This city has a special magic, its own character, its own charisma.
And this is a city that you want to return to.
It has its own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always has time everywhere.
It turns out that it was easy for you to play in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which many, frankly speaking, did not expect, frankly, to expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you to get?
You know, I'm a non-professional actor.
And I am a very, by nature, trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I, in fact, entrust myself to his hands and I want to be a test from which they will sculpt.
I understand perfectly well that I can see from the outside, and, again, I ask for hints and talk to the director for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and very clearly and accurately explains what he needs.
And then, after long hours of rehearsals, we come to the organics you are talking about.
And how you worked with the director of the picture Klim Shipenko?
I got high from everyone, the cameraman, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because it's such a pleasure to work with crazy people.
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly such a situation here.
Do not sleep, do not eat for days - and still, even thunder, even hail.
And if something did not work out, it was a disaster, and something must be done urgently to make it happen.
In this atmosphere of madness it is very easy to work in.
And it seems to me that when people are so shifted to the point of morbid fanaticism in what they are doing, it cannot fail, because too much energy is expended, too much energy.
What scenarios are you giving up on?
What are the criteria for selecting the material with which you will work?
I don't want stupid things, stupid dialogues, films that don't say anything, carry nothing.
I don’ t want to work for the sake of just appearing on the screen once again.
Do you have any suggestions, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no concrete proposals or plans at the moment.
I'm not the kind of person who paints charts.
The script came, it interested me, today this premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are almost continuously going on in Moscow: the American film festival "Amfest", "2тогgo\", the other day " 2-t-1" will begin, followed by the British film festival" British film festival".
And here's the interesting thing: half of the acquaintances are constantly discussing that someone needs to be boycotted, and someone needs to be supported, for some reason, well, sorry, very vague reasons.
At the same time, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed by a terrifying-looking Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The last thing you want to grumble about is this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall to look at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, then they will still be shown to you.
And in the room, meanwhile, we have no pixels: " Throne: Legacy"( continuation of the classic picture of virtual reality), " Let me in.

SOCIAL NETWORK
The history of the creation of the Facebook network is over.
David Fincher's new film is, first of all, a story about a paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, quarreled five friends and made its creator, 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, the youngest billionaire in recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the lead role is as great as our conflict genius, an emotionally isolated social exile with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of anger at the world around him, partly out of sporting interest, and partly simply because THIS is "cool."
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network become apparent from the very first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg talks in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica ( Mara) at five minutes: the ringing, tough dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength here and do not soften until the very end: the ringing, tough dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin are gaining momentum already and do not soften until the very end.
The same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained( with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins, actors who were different from each other played actors.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other with the help of computer graphics.
At the same time as Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara landed the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR David Fincher.
CAST: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ernie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: Gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a turn from the gate on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook grows in popularity, relationships with a few companion friends begin to unravel and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays a role: warm, sunny in places, even cozy in the dark, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate litigations.
Outside of the flow of incessant discussions, there isn't much going on in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to pull even an extra paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What also attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher to this not-so-generous story details.
After viewing, there is a strong feeling that the "Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic device.
Just twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing much the same thing, only on a larger scale, with cosmic egos and big deals.
Now that the daily solvency has become even higher, politics is no longer implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin ( Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend ( Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with now.
The Winklevosses ( Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, stomp their feet: who said that the rich, beautiful and athletic cannot also be smart.
( This line amuses Fincher especially. )
If desired, The Social Network could well have turned out to be a black comedy from The Social Network.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his business is positive or negative.
And that his invention would entail social consequences.
He is a swindler.
Or a cunning manipulator.
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if it contains even the slightest hint of something like this is the same.
But it won't even be necessary here: in their version of history, it doesn't matter at all.
"What is it like to feel beautiful? “ - asked in the song Tre VeaNez “ WaBu Woz'te A Vsp Map”, which precedes the credits.
The hero does not know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is part of a lost online generation that has little idea of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully made character drama about the high-profile Internet-era trial.
At the beginning of the XVII century. when Ivan Susanin lived, the surnames of people of humble origin had not yet really begun to appear.
They used the name "such-and-such, such-and-such a son" to avoid it.
That is, in the course there were patronymics - nicknames for the father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of remarriages of the father, they used the matronym - a nickname after the name of the mother.
Susanin is just such a case: " Ivan, son of Susanna"
The serfs of small landowners really did without surnames for a long time - why is it when you have 20 souls and everyone is constantly in sight?
But the owners of many thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames to their peasants.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already in the beginning of the XVIII century. had surnames all over the place, legally.
In the 19th century. even the small landowners did not keep the peasant on the ground, but let him go for a share - let him earn a trade and pay the owner's wages.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where he had to enter his surname.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released for a share in Central Russia.
So, they already had surnames.
Criminalists from the capital flew in to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk.
Forensic experts of the central office and employees of the forensic expert center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the gas explosion in the house on Linear, 39, the NGS reports, NGS reports, the NGS reports.
According to investigators, the defendants, Irina Urbakh and Yevgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictitious Mezhregion Mezhregion organization, examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked sloppily, and overcharged for their services, the agency says, citing an informed source as an adult.
On the eve of the tragedy on Linear Street, a man and a woman visited three apartments of house No. 39, where plate hoses were changed.
So, in one of the apartments, they put a water hose instead of a gas hose.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, a gas-air mixture leaked and exploded in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially, the second partially, collapsed.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which killed 13 people and killed 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of a house explosion in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk themselves.
In St. Petersburg, it was possible to avoid sea surge flooding.

Specialists were able to prevent flooding thanks to the closure of the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg increased sharply due to bad weather in the city.
Sea surge flooding was prevented due to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd in a row, the St. Petersburg edition of Neva reports. The Turks are turning.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but due to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water remained at around 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters higher than the lower threshold of the level of dangerous flooding ( from 161 to 210 centimeters) .
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can again navigate the Gulf of Finland.
It should be noted that the situation with the water level is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This prevents flooding that may follow an increase in wind.
In Turkey, 8 people were arrested in the case of deficiencies in collapsed buildings.
In the Turkish province of Shanliurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with construction defects in buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake in the Turkish province of Shanliurfa.
As Armenpress reports, this is reported by Habertürk.
More than 20, 000 people died as a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, killing more than 20, 000 people.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939, it is noted.
The 7.7 magnitude quake was followed by hundreds of tremors that were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.

The probability of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its reduction.
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following the meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have recently occurred.
On the one hand, the conditions of foreign trade have deteriorated noticeably - prices for Russian oil have decreased.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment slows down, but budget spending grows.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks have generally increased.
"Therefore, this year the probability of a rate hike exceeds the probability of its reduction.
The expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation, " E said. Nabiullina is what she says she is actually saying.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, the rapid unwinding of consumption in the face of elevated inflationary expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken, they weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of workers and a lag in labor productivity growth from wage growth.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate are increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0- 9.0% per annum for 2023, with an increase of 7.0- 9.0% per annum. and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024,
" This does not rule out the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its likelihood and scale have decreased.
On the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some rate hike may be needed in order for 2024 to happen. Inflation met the target of close to 4%, "the head of the Bank of Russia concluded, "the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds ( UIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.

If a retail mutual fund contains more than 10% of blocked securities, then the management company must allocate them to a separate closed mutual fund before September 1, 2023, when the management company has them to allocate to a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be issued units of the new fund in an amount equal to the units of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed-end fund.
For funds with a share of blocked securities less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets to a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is being introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the event of the sale of such securities, management companies are obliged to pay at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment shares on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement from the Bank of Russia.

Austria is once again tightening controls on its border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people remain at the border in cars waiting to cross to the Austrian side.
Thus, this becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already gone through the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on existing agreements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to stay in the country where the request has been made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is required.
Vienna's decision to tighten inspections follows a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the commonwealth's borders.

The somnologist named the causes of sleep problems.
Somnologist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about the foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As noted by the specialist, sleep problems often arise from products containing caffeine.
First of all, we are talking about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa content.
Their use before bedtime should be limited, because they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "torn", which means that they do not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop using caffeinated products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, there are difficulties with falling asleep.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as superficial sleep and frequent night awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends avoiding spicy foods in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy foods contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For a healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to comply with the external temperature regime: the air temperature of 18-20 degrees is optimal, but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, heavy food should not be abused before going to bed, because it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and usual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to the sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.

Problems encountered by pregnant Russian women with entry to Argentina were explained by the company.
According to the expert, against the background of an influx of people wishing to give birth to a child in Argentina, the country's authorities began to more closely monitor the entry of foreign citizens into its territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and residence permits for themselves, and then leave.
It is reported by "Lenta". ru" with reference to Professor of St. Petersburg State University Viktor Heifetz, editor-in-chief of the magazine" Latin America"
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transit point, and not into a final destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision to grant an Argentine passport to parents after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and left immediately, citizenship may be denied in the provision of citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians, especially among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by "right of soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens up the possibility for visa-free visits to 170 countries, including the EU and the UK, the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke the residence permit of Russians who received a document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the motives of the trip.
Russia predicts the opening of hundreds of new fitness clubs in Russia.
In Russia, citizens' interest in fitness services is recovering, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mostly small-format ones, may open in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to "Kommersant", at the same time, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and quick payback.
Such data are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community ( NPC) .
President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators Olga Kiseleva in an interview with the publication noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
President of the NSF Elena Silina noted that since 2020, every year there have been more club closures than openings.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent over the past three years.
At the same time, independent analysts cite other figures.
According to the "Contour" Focus, "in the past three years, the number of organizations with the main type of activity "fitness center" has grown by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry has suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but back in 2021, it began to recover.
According to 2GIS, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over a million.
Russians have begun to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.

As Silina noted, if the trend can be maintained, the industry will return to pre-crisis levels by the end of the year.
The license of the management company from Kirov was taken away from the management company from Kirov.
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region revoked the license for entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings issued to the management company Zabota.
In the Kirov region, by decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license to carry out entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings, previously issued to the management company Zabota, was canceled.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but entered into force only in February 2023, but entered into force only in February 2023.
Arbitration deprived the "manager" of its license for the fact that the organization several times ignored the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all objects that were managed by Zabota have been excluded from the register of licenses for entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand. Square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The Kirov administration knows that they were left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor's office about the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set the task for the employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to liquidate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, since there are too many of them.
The legitimacy of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov Communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could be taken in the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The anti-monopolists allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.

Photos from February 2023
A beautiful place, especially in summer, around the sculpture of a mammoth gazebo with barbecues.
On the territory there is not a large park where you can walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the first floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Opening hours are from 10- 00 to 22- 00.
In the store you can drink coffee and have a snack with fresh pastries.
There is a small parking lot from the shopping center.
Friendly staff.
Delicious coffee, a large selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh baked goods😍😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Convenient cafeteria area is the convenient cafeteria area.
Came here with my daughter to register for a pension.
We were welcomed, everything was clearly explained, the documents were scanned, the application was issued, how to make an appointment for subsequent appointments was told about the future appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and security are met culturally, respectfully, and respectfully.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although it would not hurt to buy a cooler with water more.
We came 2 times, everything is fine, everything is fine.
I wish all employees peace, good luck and a decent salary in this difficult time for everyone.
Just a great place to be.
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine waiting for a scallop salad ( which tastes simply incomparable) .   )
I highly recommend this wonderful place.   ))
A nice cashier asked me to make me coffee with her or in the hall, 200 or 300 ml, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
After a couple minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to use it in ceramics, that's why I wanted to use it in the hall.
They made me with myself.
I ask why in a cup and not in a cup.
The girl answers, they say, they don’ t have 300 ml cups.
That's how it fits into a person's head.
Ask with you or in the hall, t. it's the same as a whole one for yourself to determine the technology: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
Get an answer - in the hall, t. it's the same as a whole one in a cup
Clarify the volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
Put a person in front of the fact that there are no cups of such volume.
Here, they say, a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in the Green Outskirts in my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of the plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I want to drink coffee the way I want. I asked her myself.
A number of questions arise.
1 Cafeteria Green Outskirts and Green Outskirts are the sides of the same coin or organizations that are not related to each other in any way.
If unrelated, there is an understanding.
If related, why did the food and trade enterprise, known in the city for its service and quality, condescend to the rhetoric of the Kharik at Kazansky Station?
Rhetoric because such a case, I repeat, has happened to me for the third time.
I do not exclude what is happening not only to me.
2 The cashier has instructions.
I got the impression that she was acting on a whim.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please describe the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to enter the service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw numbers with Nikulin Yu himself.
And now with children, nephews now too, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, the programs too.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
You can see the arena from almost any point and the backs of those sitting in front of you do not interfere with you.
The circus is very intimate, family.
this time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a little upset.
Lots of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a room with tricks and more animals.
It is a pity that now you can not take pictures with animals in the lobby.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And in general, a very pleasant place.
I wish you prosperity and please us with your numbers.
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes, and chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, they invited us to see the complex, when there were not even walls yet, so that we could see everything live, although how many apartments we considered and not a single developer offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort.
The most thrill is the gentle sparse forests, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks as for me are boring and short.
The longest ones are in sector e, there are even less.
But in general, a great atmosphere, many different cafes and bars, so a fun ski mood is guaranteed.
Excellent master Peri.
She did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the salon is clean and pleasant and the salon is pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, wardrobe and water, good service, friendly staff, there is a wardrobe and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come for an order by the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application, and I wait at the window sill for more than 30 minutes for my order at the window sill.
Today, such a service is unacceptable in business.
Answer service" care" - we are trying to try - we are trying.
At the checkout, even without apologies, it’ s just that we’ re not to blame, it’ s a program, but it’ s a program.
Neither to call to warn, no other technical possibilities of communication with regular previously loyal customers you have not found.
Impotents " try", and business must work, but business must work.
Thank you all, we all disagree, we all disagree.
We will not order more from you and even more recommend it.
Spoiled mood, waiting for guests, apologies from the hostess are not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car ( Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization organization.
I expected to get the car in 3- 3.5 months ( as agreed), but in fact it took 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus ( Lithuania performed)
As a result, I am very pleased with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and a normal human attitude.
Thanks again.
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm ( even very), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary utensils, all the necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge are available.
Of the shortcomings, perhaps too little space can be identified, there is a terribly small shower in the bathroom.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and there is nowhere to dry things, I had to take a dryer from the owners and shove it instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
And so, in general, a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There are wines and beers for those wishing to drink.
Center of Moscow, I recommend it.
Wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again again.
The territory has all the necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
Well-repaired rooms with all amenities.
Beautiful and aesthetic place, walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I liked it very much, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov park and landscape.
In winter, there are many natural slides for kids) .
Very cool tobacco and hookah store)
We buy here all the time, the prices are low, and the quality is at the level.
Very responsive staff, will prompt and answer all your questions) .
I recommend this store to everyone to visit. ❤️
The location is convenient for anyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They serve quickly, if any of the visitors are not stupid, if they are not stupid.
By appointment is convenient.
The staff is attentive, they will prompt, direct, advise even if they did not come on reception days.
In principle, it is normal.
Great guys.
Thank you very much.
Everything was quickly done, the prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought the remote control was thrown away, but they did everything to me so cleverly.
Huge thanks to the young guys.
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery 2 hours on March 8th.
Brought flowers in a package after 6 hours, as if stolen ( barely enough paper to wrap the flowers) .
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the website and the color turned out to be completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count and it turned out that there were an even number of 20 tulips.
Support in WhatsApp to my indignation about the color and number of colors answered" apparently confused color"
The next day I wrote again and was offered a 15% refund.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of arrogance and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax office about the fact that I was refused to issue a check to me.
Rospotrebnzoor and the court are next in line.
I do not recommend anyone to contact this organization.
More than 10 years I have been going to see Master Samira, for coloring and cutting hair

Master inspector Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, she explained clearly everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
Also, during the repair of my car, she provided all kinds of assistance.
And also thanks to the master Valery Ushakov for attentive and professional work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out qualitatively.
The only thing that confused me when recording for maintenance was insufficiently correct information on the work regulations, when appearing for maintenance, the regulations were explained more clearly.
I would like to express my gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
It took a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve the real estate transaction, the employees were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, although they could refuse, since this is not part of their duties.
Thank you very much.

And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection.
We have known Olya for more than 3 years, we use the services regularly.
During this time, we have seen how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged animals, which only causes admiration and trust.

Great club with huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hammam and great trainers.
Of the minuses, a huge number of pensioners are in the pool and in the locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club as a public bath.
A special emphasis is placed on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting from 19:00, there are a lot of people.
I put a three, and then only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken Timur, but I can be wrong, but I can be wrong.
He arranged everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything was intelligible, the son also decided to draw up a card, and alas, the consultants are busy with their own affairs, the clients are waiting, the consultant approached his son in the end, to whom everything is up to the light bulb, several times he disgusted6 in the meeting room, discussing something fun, in the end, the son left without filling out anything, the consultant said for forgiveness, well, whatever you want, as you want, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised, I was surprised, because I was present at this meeting, I was surprised, I was, I was, the consultant, at this meeting, I was, the consultant, and, as you would like, as you would like, as you would like, since I was present at this meeting, was, I was surprised, I was, I was
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It is a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good ( the fabric is resistant to the appearance of puppets), the staff knows their range, they help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim girl and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are located near the metro, there is even a small parking lot, there is a small parking lot.
We recommend it.
I was in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I liked everything in terms of service and quality of food: prices are low, portions are medium-sized, so you can eat, or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of a table.
When I ordered, I indicated the number and everything that was required, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone to check the phone, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone.
Nothing further.
When I came to the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table had not been booked.
We were lucky that there were free seats and we were able to be accommodated.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
I recommend it.
Went for a cleaning on a recent weekend.
For the first time I see such an organized staff, who treated many of my questions as reverently as possible, suggested how and what is best done for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I heartily recommend, the only clinic where they do not want to heat for money in my memory.
Nice shopping mall!

A large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops and shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
not a foot in this store anymore.
we bought a washing machine, they told us what's out of town, so we'll take it ourselves.
The manager in the hall said where to drive to the warehouse, to the question "will load" said yes i got spoiled on that and a few other things )
in the warehouse they took it out without a box, to the question why they answered that this is how everyone loads
when I began to insist, they stuck two strips of penoplex, like that will do
They refused to load into the trailer, they say it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery)))))) .
when I said that then I would refuse the order at all, they said "yes, whatever you want, we don't care, " in the end, one still condescended to go down the ramp and help his father stuff the car into the trailer.
This is the first time I have encountered such boorish service.

We express our gratitude to the Sentry Marina, who was our funeral agent.
Having come to us on call, she took care of all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was in touch all the time and informed us how things were going on.
Thanks to her, we spent a loved one with dignity.

He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Flattered by a lot of good reviews, I turned to RemStirMash and the master Alexander was assigned to me.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for service.
All discussed and appointed time - 14 - time. 00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complex application( it is like it is from the master) . whereas "and" are completely free.

We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that instead of Alexander he can come, but after 2 hours, he will come, but after 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all the planned things on the side, all the planned things on the side.
In short, the sensible master Ivan arrived, fixed the breakdown, for which he is grateful, thank you to him for this.
So don't fall for empty promises and don't waste your time doing so.
Evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
At first there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then they looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, the children climbed to watch several times, the adults crowded and could not let others see it.
The objects that we looked through the telescope were the size of an ordinary star, so without a telescope you can watch for free without a telescope.
The girl answered questions not very accessible, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600r is for.
A stunning place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The average price tag is average.
Sit, having eaten 2-3 dishes for two ( portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 r👌

A sommelier works.
he helped with the choice of wine, because in such a large menu it is difficult to figure it out on your own in such a large menu.

All buildings have an elevator - this is a big plus one.

The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in building 5.
Everything is clean, change towels and linen at your request, but if you do not ask to change, they still change on the 4th day, the linen is of good quality, the linen is of good quality.
The territory is well-groomed, benches everywhere, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
There is a minibus to and from the beach every 30 minutes for every 30 minutes.
It is 5 min to public transport stop.
Friendly guys in the dining room will always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but here who goes for what, everything suited us perfectly, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and meatballs or so on. P.S. , vegetables for a side dish every day, pastries are delicious themselves, more than 4 drinks, coffee beans, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, but only cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 C°, sunshine.

Nice atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend:)

And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped, and doors are wiped.
The diet is dietary, but excellent, but excellent.
I was surprised that at 7 in the morning they bring tea with a sandwich ( bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, pre-breakfast, pre-breakfast, so to speak.
The nursing staff is sensitive, every single person puts both intramuscular and intravenous injections.
While the drip is standing, they will come in and ask about their well-being.
Previously, I had to do an ultrasound of the heart, but for the first time ( unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man) .
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Claudia Fedorovna.

In the lobby, the administrator met.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently help customers with all questions asked.
The specialist assisted in submitting the application and gave explanations on my question.
For a small store, a very good selection of goods is very good.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, chemicals for the home, various trifles, and trifles.
Works around the clock, which is very convenient, always friendly staff, which is very friendly.
It's great when the city has a place where you can ride from the mountains.
Ski lifts and on weekends, of course, the queue gathers 40 seconds descent and 5-10 minutes queue.
But in general, it's cool to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are dirty and damp.
I turned to the service to repair the iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the subtleties of the repair and immediately outlined the price range.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done qualitatively.
The masters are very pleasant in communication, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was touched, the focus was lost, the focus was lost.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.

Large-scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires close, prompt and high-quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the keepers, but rather the owners.
Excellent w/o
Responsive concierges, garbage is removed, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to bus stops, schools and shops, etc.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport.
We opened a nice, cozy place to relax in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
The food court is killer and varied in terms of food.
Tables are located in cozy areas.
There is no crowding.
Well, we visited, tried it.
The interior has nothing in common with an Italian cozy cafe.
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, as in the dining room.
Pizza.   well who has not tried it tastier then he will like it seemed to me somehow faceless.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter always stands behind your back and your interlocutor, on the contrary, almost always looks in the face.
We were uncomfortable with each other.
Connolly, yes, they are delicious.
We won't come here again and I won't recommend it to my friends.

The staff is nice and helpful, and helpful.
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine.
Highest rating, love this place❤❤
The park is in the center of the city, it is very easy to get to it.
The park is clean, there is a place for both children and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field, which unfortunately is not very well maintained, unfortunately not very well maintained.
But there are still more pluses in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is cordial.

Often promotions and discounts.
I'm glad it's close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We were in the bar twice, I liked everything, polite staff, delicious dishes and most importantly - great music, DJs know their business.
The only thing is that the second time disappoints the soloist of the Hands Up Band group.
Not only does he sing to put it mildly not very well, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from the phone, it was especially striking when these were the songs of the Hands Up group.
Somehow this is illogical ( speaking in the Hands Up bar, in the Hands Up Band group) .
We rested at the beginning of March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms, nice rooms.
In honor of my birthday, they gave me a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
Breakfasts are just a dump of the head.
There is a mini bar with insane prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant to the room, pay a 20% service charge on top of it.
The restaurant is slightly overpriced.
It tastes like a C-plus three.
The water park was included in the price.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: no goodbye, no good road: no good road.
The employee at the entrance did not even help open the door seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this in order to keep the brand.
A great place to get together with friends for a steam bath.
Large and comfortable steam room, billiards, outdoor pool, karaoke shopping.

Everything is fine.
The quality of work is top notch.
Special thanks to the master for the careful attitude and quality of work.
Wonderful school of basketball
My son has been going for 5 months and he really likes it, he looks forward to every training session.

A good AB store is a convenient location, a large hall, a good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness.
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I often happen - everything is fine.
Nice pool.
I'm specifically talking about the "frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalievna really likes the child and professional very much.
Locker rooms are clean, water is warm, hair dryers are available.
I love cupcake bakeries, service, croissants, breakfasts and coffee are always top notch.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout didn’ t make coffee until I reminded them, they did, it’ s impossible to drink, it stinks and the aftertaste of spoiled milk remains, I decided not to finish drinking and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, they replaced it and replaced it.
Please be more attentive, after all, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here.
Victoria perfectly corrects, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually, all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of both hair and skin, thanks to which the paint lasts a long time.
It is better not to make eyebrows better.
Thank you very much for the organized move of my mother.
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman.
I will recommend your company to all my friends.
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been treating teeth with the whole family for a long time in Novodent, especially in Novodent.
Recently, the teeth of an 8-year-old son were treated, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
No long waits, no queues at all to. reception by appointment by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I'm not a fan of shawarma, BUT when you want something harmful only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat, lots of stuffing.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows with me.
Often, when you finish eating shawarma, do not eat the bottom as there is a lot of water sauce there, well, in short, Fu Yu, in short.    , it's not here but, it's not here.
That's why you guys are the best 🙂.
Good teaching staff
The food in the dining room is always fresh
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held during the school year.
Nice store, polite staff, good assortment, good assortment.
However, a big minus is that the goods that are brought, apparently, are destroyed right on the trading floor.
Sometimes there is little space to pass between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are standing directly on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a remark to the organization, and not to a specific store.
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict splendor, which is reverently cared for.
I got a double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the house of culture.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that it was really going out.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I stumbled across this online auto parts store by accident.
I called, indicated the vincode, they said wait) .
After 10 minutes, they called back, offered several options, offered several options.
Since the car personally did not save money and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit LUK.
After another 5 minutes, they called back and said that good news for you was good news for you.
If you take not the whole basket + disk + squeeze plate, but take LUK set basket + disk and separately squeeze plate LUK, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
Having taken the clutch, I went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it was found that the flywheel was still needed, and the faster the better, the better the better the flywheel was needed.
I already knew where I would turn), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by call ( for the first time I also paid upon receipt) .
The next day, the flywheel was on hand.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I am pleased that everything came quickly, that we went to a meeting.
I will definitely recommend and contact costomers. the store
The New Year's party was a success, but with the nuances.
I booked a double table, it turned out that they put me in a 4-seater.
But no worries are they.
It's just weird that they didn't warn you.
The kitchen is four, the fish did not succeed at all.
The presenter with contests made at the school level power point, to be honest, not very good.
BUT when it comes to music, everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was high.
Everything else seems to be nagging.
Thank you for the event.
I leave my review, with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 g. Chelyabinskaya.
This institution employs only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God, who work.
Both in the OPB department and in the maternity ward, and in the department after childbirth.
But I express special gratitude to Kotlyarova E. Yoo be gud gurl. , this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarange N. B , this is the motherfucker in the family.

It's a nice shop.
A large assortment of balls, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional staff.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers, always fresh flowers.
We visited the establishment on a recommendation.
The food is amazing, there is no program, the waiters are a little cocky, but we were in a great line-up with the children and celebrated an important event, we were friendly, and we were friendly.
There was no fiery supply of the plateau, the children were waiting for them.
You can safely go for good cuisine.
