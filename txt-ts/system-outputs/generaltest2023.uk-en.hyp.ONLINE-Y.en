Because these are our names...‚Äù
‚ÄîLetter from the occupation.
Kherson.
‚ÄúNatasha, we are holding on with all our strength.
It feels like they are afraid.
Very afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat several times that they are big, that they are strong and we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and it turns in our head - how are you, with @–∫–∏, afraid if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat this greatness.
How you are not sure of yourself.
It's like sexual intercourse with an impotent, who needs to endlessly repeat that he is strong, that he succeeds, try very long and stubbornly for him and at the same time think when this painful bullying will finally end.
We repeat this in order to save us all.
Because it is very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless body with a machine gun.
Because then, when this evil spirits are driven out of our land, we will need to improve the city.
Whoever we talk to now, everyone has the same words.
Words that there is a smell of rot in the city.
We will probably need a lot of detergents to just wash sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time. Because everything that these inhumans touched has the smell of rot.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were big.
Three healthy men undressed her and left her on the street, forbidding anyone to approach her to help.
For three hours she was undressed on the street and only loudly said:
‚ÄúDon't come to me, my kids.
Do not put yourself in danger.
Please!
We will still have a lot to do with you...
Then!
And more.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It is even difficult for me to invent that they do not steal.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting from children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because they constantly put up postcards in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the Armed Forces.
And when they are close, the Kherson people will deal with evil spirits with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they are in a hurry.
And we will wait.
Let's wait.
We will clasp the teeth, clench our fists to numbness in the fingers and wait.
Because we have something to wait for.
To be once and for all.
And none of this evil spirits is left.
And then we will pass the city.
Long.
Natasha, let everyone know that Kherson is Ukraine!
And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names...‚Äù
The author written for obvious reasons is not specified.
But I need communication. I have quite something sour. I know that few people want to communicate with sour people, but still I do not lose hope
How satisfied are you with the accommodation?
Do you need help?
Do you work in the same specialty as before you left the country?
These and similar questions are now reflected by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs in the framework of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
Conclusions will help to better know their situation and plan the most effective help.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
Anyone who has provided functional e-mail when requesting humanitarian assistance will receive an invitation to research (from –∑–∞–ø—Ä–æ—à–µ–Ω–Ω—è@click4survey.cz).
The questionnaire is filled out by everyone only once!
Filling out the questionnaire, you will help a lot to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation!
TECHNICIAN IN PRODUCTION
, MECHANIC IN PRODUCTION
We manufacture electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics or modern medicines ‚Äî none of this would have happened without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues in our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities to both recent graduates and seasoned professionals.
I want to say a few words about this.
There is a great desire to gather with the residents to discuss important, exciting issues, but the meeting is prohibited by law, because there is a war in the country.
I would be grateful for the good advice and any help in my quest to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are strength.
Together we will overcome all adversity.
Together we will win.
So get in touch.
I will listen to everyone.
I will be infinitely glad and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the terms of payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all Ukrainian refugees who arrive, without any additional conditions (only temporary protection visa is required), are entitled to first aid payment of 5,000 kronor.
In order to receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation ‚Äî be considered unemployed, have no property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice as follows:
1 Ô∏è ‚É£ The first payment of benefits will cease to be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily reusable meals and hygiene supplies, he will not be able to claim the payment of 5000 kronor.
The authorities will begin to believe that basic assistance was provided in kind (housing, food and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and there is no need to pay money.
This measure is designed to solve the problem with gypsy refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for financial assistance.
2 Ô∏è ‚É£ Only those refugees who prove the immediate need (lack of work, etc.) will still have the right to cash payment of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth assistance.
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå as in the first paragraph, only those Ukrainians who were not provided with free housing, daily reusable meals and hygiene supplies will be able to receive cash assistance;
üìå the applicant must actually live in the territory of the Czech Republic.
This is necessary to stop the practice of ‚Äútourism for help‚Äù, when a refugee lives in one country, and comes to the Czech Republic for several days solely for money.
According to the law, each foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the change of residence within three working days after the move.
If the address in the application form for the payment of benefits does not match the address specified in the database of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she really lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the payment of benefits will be denied.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion crowns on the payment of humanitarian aid.
And today I was engaged in the whole day digging up defensive structures, and the whole city is digging in, some not very joyful forecasts for the near future.
Honestly tired, it is very difficult to organize such a process
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, for this someone needs to organize equipment and people, and I am the head of the village, then these are my duties
All utilities are involved, and we also turn to farmers, they have excavators and tractors.
We must unite, because otherwise we will not overcome the katsaps
There is a lot of propaganda for people to despair and weaken resistance
Honestly, I have not yet taken a shovel in my hands today, I hope that I do not have to
My children put girl stickers on my phone case so that I did not forget that I was female
What happens if the bill is passed?
‚òòÔ∏è A government commission will be formed from representatives of the Office of the President, some ministries and business associations, which will quickly review the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
‚òòÔ∏è The Commission and other executive authorities will review all permits for doing business in most areas by the end of the year.
And they will offer which of the permits or procedures should be removed.
‚òòÔ∏è The Cabinet of Ministers in the accelerated mode will remove all ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù permissions and procedures.
Without any public discussion, behind the doors!
‚òòÔ∏è It will not matter whether the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers contradict the current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of economic activity, which can harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
‚òòÔ∏è Regulation of business by the state will take place on the principle of ‚Äúone new permit - minus two old ones‚Äù.
Regardless of whether it makes any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
‚òòÔ∏è In the behind the doors, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents on permits or procedures in the field of environment.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc. will be at risk!
‚òòÔ∏è Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We will not even know how and who changes the by-laws, until the final decisions are made.
‚òòÔ∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the possibility of influence are business associations.
Bill No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
The tight deadlines for the revision of permits, the non-transparent procedure, the absence of any criteria for decision-making ‚Äî this is a move somewhere to the east, not to the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the appeal
They told her, Babo, the Russians came to the village; grab your cat and climb into the bead.
But she refused - what am I, old mare... Save the children and girls, I will move here already... The woman goes down into the cellar, sows cucumbers, rolls away a tub of trash, a bunch of troughs; There are doors - iron bolts and silver locks.
And behind the door someone rattles in chains.
I did not think - says the woman - that I would live.
Seventy years - and again a rod.
Go ‚Äî just not the city, because cursed, you will bring us ‚ÄúPutin Kaput‚Äù closer.
The cat hisses, glass cracks in the windows.
Tanks are rumbling and stuck between houses.
Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Good afternoon, go to the mail and confirm your identity through the ‚Äúcheck-in‚Äù, then upon confirmation you will be given a code, and this code must again be indicated in the registration on the Internet and you are ready.
Be sure to have a bank card registered for the person who wants to receive cash assistance, another is not suitable.
I did this to an acquaintance also indicated that some key was needed, but when she survived, I waited in the government there she was told why she came because it was already registered.
She was also shown, in this application, that she needed some key, but in fact, she was already registering
help me too, the application was submitted online on May 5, but it is not fashionable to understand whether to go to the labor government or wait
it is written that you will receive money on the card after processing your application, but writes that the identity is not confirmed, the system gives an error through the banking system
Good afternoon, dear Mrs. Angelino!
I want to express my point of view regarding the use of ‚Äúin‚Äù /"on‚Äù in relation to the word ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù.
The use of this term in recent decades has become a serious political issue.
Russia's current war against Ukraine has been prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy
Thank you for the interesting exercises and tasks, for a clear explanation of grammar, pleasant communication.
We are especially grateful for the technical support of the training, first of all, for the textbook, which allowed us to understand what was sometimes not learned in the lecture.
These three months laid the foundation of our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will become even more fruitful!
We wish the entire creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness!
In his productions he popularizes world classics in Ukrainian, among them ‚ÄúLolita‚Äù (V. Nabokov), ‚ÄúPerfumer‚Äù (P. Suskind), ‚ÄúSin‚Äù by M. Kotsyubynskyi, ‚ÄúLetter of a Stranger‚Äù and ‚ÄúWild‚Äù by S. Zweig, etc. (etc.).
The works that he incenates are not easy to perceive, require the investment of soul and heart.
The author deliberately leads the audience to deep feelings and tears.
In his opinion, tears are cleansing, this is the way to the recovery of modern man.
He has a number of awards.
In 2005, he received the title of ‚ÄúPeople's Artist of Ukraine‚Äù, Laureate of the National Prize of Ukraine. Taras Shevchenko (2007), but most of all Mr. Mykhailo appreciates the attention and love of the audience, and they reciprocate him.
Connoisseurs of Mr. Mikhail's talent hope that at the end of the war they will hear his saxophone playing again, see his unsurpassed ability of reincarnation, will be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art
Minerals of Ukraine
According to their origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic.
Therefore, their placement is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
The fuel minerals that are mined in our state include: coal and lignite, oil, natural gas, peat, oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully provides its own needs for coal and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is experiencing an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we have a rational economy, an acute shortage can arise in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polessa.
Since the mid-1990s, it has been used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, farms, glass, porcelain and faience, food industries.
Various chemicals are also obtained from peat, in particular acetone, phenols, paraffin, fodder, yeast.
There are considerable deposits of combustible shale in Cherkasy and Kirovograd regions.
The geography of the location of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, therefore they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as to the marginal foothill deflections.
Coal.
94.3% of the coal deposits of our state are coal.
Ukrainian coal is of high quality.
Due to the high content of carbon in it, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine there are deposits of the best grade of coal - anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of the coal is coking.
After special processing, it is used during the smelting of cast iron and steel.
According to the explored coal reserves, Ukraine ranks VIII in the world and 1st place in Europe, and in terms of production ‚Äî 11th place and III place, respectively.
The explored coal reserves in Ukraine are about 50 billion tons.
The forecast reserves are about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write ‚Äúmessages‚Äù on shells that are dropped on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
Thus, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called on the stage of Eurovision to save the soldiers blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol ‚Äî and the next day the Russians wrote on the shells ‚ÄúKalush, as you asked! #–Ω–∞ Azovstal‚Äù.
On the missiles with which the Russian military fired at the station in Kramatorsk on April 8, 2022, it was written ‚ÄúFor children‚Äù.
Then 61 people died from shells with a cynical inscription, among them 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared in the First World War.
In World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to enemies.
It then helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions that the Russian military leaves on the shells are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they do not like Ukraine's political course.
Russia needs to be stopped so that such ‚Äúmessages‚Äù do not fly to any other country!
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing greeted us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
‚ÄúWe carry insulin, it needs a temperature regime - it cannot heat up.
Is it possible to pass the control in an accelerated mode?‚Äù
The border guard allowed us to stand at the beginning of the queue, even the trucks gave way.
Lvov
The city of Lion lives.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body ‚Äî an endless stream of people.
People from all regions of the country found refuge and a sense of security here.
Someone goes further to Europe, someone returns home, someone stays.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the dict-clogged windows of the cathedrals.
She envelops monuments and sculptures with white canvases.
But the war is not heard in Rynok Square, where thousands of voices are heard at the same time, it is not heard in coffee shops and in bars where people continue to live.
Yes, life subsides earlier ‚Äî at 11 pm life hides from curfew.
But it is: when at 9 pm we were sitting in a cafe and declared an alarm, it was heard only from a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpen
We made the way to Kyiv through two of the many martyrs ‚Äî through Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities whose air smells of hope.
Despite the pain, people come back and rebuild their lives.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
(Shards of shells or automatic queues?..)
On the shuttered balcony there is a stretched Ukrainian banner.
Near the front door there are holes, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And at this front door, three are ringing in.
They clean, rebuild, build a wall and with it a new life.
And in the park two blocks below, a mother and a child walks.
I can't help but ask myself, ‚ÄúDid their dad survive the shootings of men in Bucha?
Is he walking with them?‚Äù
At the exit from Irpen there is a cemetery of cars.
These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and which were ruthlessly shot by the Russian occupiers.
This cemetery has already become the object of a kind of ‚Äúpatriotic tourism‚Äù.
If you go deep and stand surrounded by autoskeletons, you can feel a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow air, it seems that it can be cut with a knife.
And it has already been weeks since the death of passengers...
If you look through the holes in the car hulls, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.
And in one of the cars - an abandoned bicycle, in the other - a warm children's overalls.
Somewhere a booklet with instructions for using the airbag was not burnt.
Remains of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
We pass on, look back at the city for the last time ‚Äî and I come across the same bridge under which frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, but it was on these broken plates that the Ukrainian military carried a baby in white.
This baby in white jumpsuit probably survived.
But is there a chance that the child who wore clothes abandoned in one of the cars also lives?
On the torn bridge sits a man, a camera over his shoulder.
Just sitting and looking at the abyss between Kiev and Bucha.
He does not take pictures, but only looks.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge, and thinks: how is it?
‚ÄúHappy holiday!‚Äù - the man exclaims to us joyfully. - ‚ÄúHappy City Day!‚Äù
On May 29, military Kiev celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Mykolaiv
Hero city, outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A front-line city that the occupiers still can not capture.
And we believe that they will not be captured ‚Äî the city is at war and lives.
At the corner of the streets, at every second intersection, there are neatly folded tires and Bandera lanes.
Evening Nikolaev is now incredibly quiet ‚Äî noise, against the background of which the city lived, a verse.
No votes, no cars in the evenings.
And at night it is extremely dark.
Light masking for safety.
People live ‚Äúby candlelight‚Äù, more precisely, with flashlights of mobile phones.
At home, we turn on the lights only in the kitchen ‚Äî quickly and when needed.
Grandma covered the windows with heavy blankets, through which light does not break through.
There is a hunting rifle near my sister's crib.
‚ÄúAt hand from the 24th,‚Äù says the father.
With air alarms and sounds of explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement.
But not every time.
Even in the frontline city, it is very difficult to live in constant alarms.
When then to live?
The Russian army is 30 kilometers from the city, shots from ‚Äúpeony‚Äù reach the Oktyabrsky district, cover Kulbakine.
Several times he flies close to my relatives.
To the next block, across the street from us.
Grandma's neighbors - the grandmother took out the windows, the children took them to their place, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of Ingulsky and Central districts.
Life goes on.
A siren howls on the central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple is sitting on a bench, talking about something, calmly discussing it.
A cyclist passes by them.
Looking back with dad ‚Äî what are we going to do?
‚ÄúWell... Let's have a coffee?‚Äù
So we sit on Sobornaya Street (former Soviet, by the way) in the park near the monument to St. Nicholas.
And what else to do?
To be honest, when the siren catches you by surprise on the street, there is often no place to hide, there are no open bomb shelters or cellars nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every Mykolayiv.
On the lawn at the entrance lies a huge trident - once from the ornate Regional State Administration.
Now in the place where the trident was flaunted, there was an empty ‚Äúnothing‚Äù.
Just like in the place of the office of the head of the Regional State Administration and a dozen offices around.
The rocket landed clearly on Kim's table.
War takes on a completely different outlines when it is not in the news, but under our feet.
I go through the corridors of the Regional State Administration, and with each step the crunch of glass is heard.
There are numerous documents scattered on the floor - someone submitted requests and applications, but now it does not matter.
On the table of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag.
There is a flower on the bedside table.
They took her home, transplanted her, even if she lives.
We met the guard, who was on the post on March 29.
Survived.
‚ÄúThey darned, sewn up,‚Äù he points to his head. ‚ÄúAlready at work.‚Äù
Only journalists can get to the Regional State Administration.
Together with us are a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, live broadcasts, interviews.
According to official data - 36 dead.
It is ‚ÄúSeptember 11 in Nikolaev‚Äù, ‚Äúmonument to the Russian measure‚Äù, the press attach√© of the regional head comments.
The Nikolaev regional state administration is only one of the wounds on the body of Nikolaev.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even when Denmark helps to restore the regional administration, the Nikolaev people will always see in it a terrible emptiness.
Russia has launched a new ‚Äúgas war‚Äù.
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transmission system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, in May ‚Äî to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline.
Official Berlin expects that Russia will cut off natural gas supplies by this route in July.
Russia also used such blackmail in Ukraine in 2015.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians within two days.
Gas has always been for Russia not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West is paramount.
Financing of the Russian economy is a contribution to the Third World War.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to quickly diversify gas and oil supplies.
But in order to become energy independent of Russian energy, the EU needs time.
Meanwhile, Putin's regime intimidates Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and lack of heating in homes.
European countries, especially dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may experience a shortage of it.
But this crisis will stimulate a more frugal attitude towards natural resources and increased energy efficiency.
Europe wins when it abandons Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
Temporary discomfort is worth experiencing so that the next generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia is burning crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses incendiary shells that destroy ripe crops of grain and oilseeds.
By this, Russia causes the spread of hunger in the world.
Due to the Russian war, the number of people in the world suffering from food shortages could increase by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, Russians steal already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, block sea exports.
The destruction of the agrarian potential of Ukraine is another manifestation of the military aggression of the Russian Federation.
So Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world!
The Ministry of Digital Transformation launches an innovative hotline format ‚Äî Diya.Business virtual center.
Internally displaced persons from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registration of their own stay, business registration, employment and assistance.
Therefore, the Diya.Business virtual center is launched in order to provide all the necessary answers in a remote format until Ukrainians can return home.
It's scary how you should be afraid of every important day, and more than ever you know neither the day nor the minute what may come
Good afternoon, Hanno, can I ask you to call the pediatrician back and ask when the next time you can come to get vaccinated for Darus.
It should be tomorrow, I can't come because I need to replace the battery in the car, it will be by the end of the week.
A neighbor brought a cable and we charged from Marina's car.
But on the panel of the car writes, you need to replace the battery.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia has to bring it from Ukraine, and then I will replace it
I will try to start a car tomorrow, if it works, we will go ourselves, I will leave my grandmother in the car and I will not turn off the engine.
If I do not start, then I will write to you and you will come for us
It is very uncomfortable for me to disturb you, to distract from work.
Well, let's go with you at 11:45, so as not to take risks.
‚ÄúThe war is not over yet, and the fate of our new neighbors is also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escaping to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure journey they embark on together to land them in haste loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all adults, who still do not quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
Stories of children for whom the only memory of the house is a toy that they could cling to during the many hours spent in crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, ‚Äúhighlight the organizers.
At the end of each trip, return to a safe home.
But this trip is different, more terrible.
This trip did not end even after more than eight months.
Return home is expected.
The theme of war is omnipresent, so our march may seem superfluous.
On the contrary, in the face of increasing antipathies and hostile sentiment in society, which are fueled and exploited by the populists, we want to point out that involuntary travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in a poetic way and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
Now they are part of it.‚Äù
Despite such a painful theme, the parade still managed to be bright and encouraging.
This was done by craftsmen and craftswomen who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, wagons, houses and amazing birds that shine.
The parade took place from Kampa to Watslavak, and at each stop a huge performance was played, the drama of which was developed by Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
‚ÄúIt was very important for me to keep the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians are facing now,‚Äù says the playwright. - Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects normal life, which is interrupted by an air attack.
Glowing birds are the first to come to rescue - they cover their wings first of all, children.
And after a recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of protecting wings becomes even more effective.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song is spread in a column.
And all creatures returned to life: sunflowers, and motanka, toys and even houses.
Such symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who helped and help Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we can overcome this difficult path and security will reign in homes.‚Äù
Wife sends her husband to the market for snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, the man meets friends and gets into a binge for three days, of course, without coming home.
Finally, on the third day he remembers snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
Thought to tell his wife why he was gone so long.
The doorbell rings, spills the snails on the floor, the wife opens, he, driving them with his hands, says:
- Well, from come!
We go in, we go in, we go...
Our editorial staff spoke with Ukrainian refugee Marina, who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.
‚ÄúNow I am trying to realize myself as an artist,‚Äù said the Ukrainian woman.
Anxiety, insecurity, fear, worries for relatives.
In a conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, there is a confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she found herself with her children.
But the woman believes in her strength and tries to adapt to life in Prague, without giving up the thought of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague
Marina is from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children - a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect at the Nikopol State Institution.
‚ÄúBy education, I am an architect of buildings and structures, graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Before that, she studied at an art school, graduated from the lyceum with a degree in ‚Äúartist-designer‚Äù, - said Marina.
And everything was fine, but on February 24 her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians who fled from the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina, without thinking, left Ukraine with her children.
The shelter for the woman was Prague.
‚ÄúOf course, a new city, big, crowded... A new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs tell me.
Knowledge of English and sign language was also useful to me.
In addition, I do not hesitate to ask the Czechs for help and have never felt any aggression from them.
Thank them for that,‚Äù shared Marina.
According to her, in solving issues related to the search for housing, visa and insurance, submission of documents for benefits, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the kindergarten
Having received a visa of tolerated stay, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
‚ÄúOf course, I want to find a job in my specialty.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they shrug their hands...‚Äù, - she said.
‚ÄúWe were not taken to the kindergarten, because there are no places.
They say that it is necessary to look for adaptation groups for children, and where they are, no one specifically knows.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She sought to help me with finding a place in the kindergarten for children, calling a number of different authorities, but...‚Äù, - continues Marina.
‚ÄúIn general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and naughty.
I can't say that children disturb me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to calmly attend Czech language courses.
One day I went with the little ones to classes in Czech, so they played a little, and then began to behave restlessly.
I, like a normal mother, was distracted, could not study normally... If there were language courses for adults with children or with children, someone was during her studies... But my daughter is so attached to me,‚Äù the woman sighs.
‚ÄúOf course, together with our children we go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which the Czech Republic is very grateful,‚Äù added Maryna.
When children sleep, Marina is engaged in self-education, teaches Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine
Once Maryna looked at vacancies on the Internet and saw the announcement: ‚ÄúAs part of the initiative of the Association ‚ÄúSpolek Zaedno‚Äù with the support of the EC Delegation in the Czech Republic ‚Äú12 Stars for Ukraine‚Äù, we organize a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints.
Only the creative imagination is required of the participants...‚Äù
Marina could not help but take advantage of this opportunity.
‚ÄúI gathered the courage and applied for participation.
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we painted all day.
Before that, I did not sleep, worried.
In addition, I have not taken a brush in my hands for six years,‚Äù the Ukrainian woman said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, including 12 paintings ‚Äî works of Ukrainian artists.
‚ÄúThe themes of the paintings were free, but we still agreed that we would use Ukrainian themes in our works ‚Äî we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.
Therefore, blue-yellow colors prevail in the collection of paintings,‚Äù added Marina.
The event was attended by 30 applicants, of which only 12 were chosen.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic will take place in Prague with their participation.
‚ÄúThis is how it happens in life.
All your once acquired knowledge and skills can be useful, and even support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic,‚Äù said Maryna.
‚ÄúNow I am trying to become an artist.
Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
But we have to do something...‚Äù the woman said.
Marina owes the Czech Republic for hospitality and cordiality, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine.
In the south of Ukraine, active hostilities continue.
Residents of temporarily occupied and front-line settlements continue to travel to safer areas.
On September 1, the school year began in Ukraine.
In institutions located in regions remote from the front line, the training started in full-time format.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will need a lot of time to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia started.
However, Ukrainians do not expect better times, but have already begun to clear their cities and villages from Russian garbage, rebuilding infrastructure.
Kyiv region took a blow in the first days of a full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital in a few days and seize it.
These towns and villages survived active hostilities, atrocities of the Russian army, and in some places ‚Äî occupation.
In early April, the Armed Forces completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksandr Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after the active hostilities and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public space.

Any response to the aggressor country from the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia began a new stage of this war ‚Äî informational.
Russia is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce support for Ukraine from the international community.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces to fight the aggressor, and thus become accomplices of the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization in its report noted: the Ukrainian military is arranging positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure.
At the same time, she ignored the fact that we are talking only about objects from where the civilian population is completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to information attacks of the Russian Federation!
Remember: Russia attacked Ukraine, seizes its territory, kills and murders civilians, destroys cities and villages.
Russia is guilty of the war, it has no right to any action on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and knock the enemy out of the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine stand up against Russia on all fronts!
I am sure that every person in the world has ever dreamed of their ideal home.
Believe me or not, I am no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.
It would be next to the beach and had a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I will definitely be happy to live in the heart of picturesque landscapes.
My house would be a two-story cottage with a wonderful exotic garden in front of the house and there would be many different flowers and fruit trees.
I will also have a garage for my car.
By car, I will be able to go to work, shop or just travel with my family wherever our eyes lead us.
In my ideal home there will be at least six rooms: a bright and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, an office with a workplace and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with bedside tables and dressers.
In the office there will be many interesting books in bookcases.
The living room will be the most visited place in the house, where the whole family could get together, share the news or just have fun.
That is why there would be a large sofa with small cushions, several armchairs, a wardrobe, a huge TV and a long built-in aquarium.
In addition, my ideal home would have an attic where we can make a home theater or entertainment room.
Behind my house would be a pool with a few hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we could do exercises every day to keep fit or simply practice different team sports such as volleyball, basketball, football, etc.
My ideal home would be big and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I would love to live in it.
But this is just my dream... I have to make it come true.
Hi, how many men should there be so I know which room to cook? Is she alone?
I gave the letters to you as a secretary
Yes, of course, I also ask how many of them to know where to put them
Clearly, you tell me right away what I would know

Also tell me how you can send a parcel to Ukraine the daughter-in-law should give birth on the 6th and probably needs our help she is now left alone at such a time I cannot leave her without support then my only granddaughter
Products, diapers.
I just go to save on June 6.
I was released from the birth care for only 10 days.
I did not have time to buy everything for the child.
There is no bed yet, clothes.
So they should know I hope that they will find the main thing not to panic because now I do not know what to do I am ready to go and search myself, but I will not be allowed to Donetsk there now heavy fights and I do not know how difficult it will be with the search
So the last words that I heard from him are that I am a worker and it's good that I took my sisters and brothers that they were idle
I have to hold on to children is that they hold me they are my hope and the support in me besides them has nothing for me they all I am happy that I have them
My whole body is stiff. I do not feel anything good at all that at least I can walk with me there has not been such a thing yet
So thank you I can't go there today another time I need to calm down and gather thoughts of thoughts a lot

FC ‚ÄúMinai‚Äù claims that this is a fresh photo from the last training after the fight with the Russians
In Antalya, Turkey, at the training camp, there was a conflict between the players of the Ukrainian football club ‚ÄúMinai‚Äù from the Premier League and the Russian ‚ÄúShinnik‚Äù.
The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams accidentally settled.
Initially, Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict that occurred on February 13.
Then the fight was confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC ‚ÄúMinai‚Äù, the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
As if one of them was drunk and clung to a hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
‚ÄúThe fight really took place, but already on the floor where the Russians stayed, and in equal ranks.
The number of victims on the part of Shinnik only confirms the fact that the Russians are also ‚Äúthrowing‚Äù theirs,‚Äù the statement said.
The club says that after the end of the fight, the Russians continued the fight among themselves, the local police had to intervene.
‚ÄúBefore the start of the meeting, the main requirement of FC ‚ÄúMinaj‚Äù to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to settle Shinnik,‚Äù the statement said.
Football journalist Roman Bebekh, who was one of the first on Twitter to report the situation, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player who defended the employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that the Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Telegram channel Baza writes that representatives of ‚ÄúMynaya‚Äù approached the players of Yaroslavl ‚ÄúShinnik‚Äù and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian anthem.
The Ukrainians denied it.
‚ÄúThe quantitative advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our boyfriend.
The Yaroslavl people stood up for him and defended.
There were five or six people, there were many more Ukrainians,‚Äù a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
‚ÄúYaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, among the injuries - a dissection of the lip, a fracture of the toe and a suspicion of bruised ribs,‚Äù Kommersant writes.
‚ÄúI do not understand where Ukrainians could come from in the hotel, because when we booked a hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine,‚Äù Shinnik CEO Sergey Kulakov was indignant in a comment to journalists.
Subsequently, Kulakov told the Russian agency RIA Novosti that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but stressed that they were not evicted, they decided to leave themselves.
How Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian lose weight.
And what is the cure for diabetics
7 minute (s) ago
Injections that are gaining popularity help to lose up to 15% of weight, but have many side effects.
In Britain, retail pharmacies will be allowed to sell Wegovy weight loss injections, which are used by some famous people, in particular, Elon Musk.
The main component of Wegovy is semaglutide, which helps to cope with obesity in type 2 diabetes.
Elon Musk and Kim Kardashian, who have a large audience on social networks, confessed to its use.
The drug is also popular among famous bloggers and Hollywood stars.
Semaglutide and other drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes can indeed promote weight loss.
By acting on specific receptors in the body, they suppress appetite and slow down the digestion of food.
As a result, a person is less likely to experience hunger, is more likely to be saturated and consumes fewer calories.
However, experts warn that this is not a quick solution and not a miracle cure that helps to lose weight without any effort.
Treatment takes place under the supervision of a specialist and is supported by diet and physical activity.
Like any medication, Wegovy can have side effects.
Among the most common are nausea or indigestion, bloating and gas.
In addition, rapid weight loss can lead to loss of fat on the face and, in some people, to sinking cheeks and the appearance of new wrinkles.
Doctors called this effect ‚Äúface Ozempik‚Äù, from the name of another drug for the treatment of diabetes, which is also taken for weight loss.
Doctors advise taking Wegovy for no more than two years.

In some parts of the front, the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to restore previously lost positions and gain a foothold there.
This was stated by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhny during a conversation with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States General Mark Milley.
According to Zaluzhny, the most tense situation today is in the Donetsk sector, where Russians carry out up to 50 attacks every day.
Fierce fighting continues in the area of Ugledar and Maryinka, where, according to Zaluzhny, the Armed Forces of Ukraine reliably hold the defense.
‚ÄúDespite the constant pressure of the enemy, we continue to control Bakhmut and take measures to stabilize the front line around this city,‚Äù Zaluzhny said.
In a conversation with General Millie Zaluzhny, he shared concerns about Russia's use of sea surface drones, which poses a threat to civilian shipping in the Black Sea.
Russian troops after the capture of Soledar continue to squeeze the ring around Bakhmut.
Now this city is the main target of the army of the Russian Federation.
The head of the Russian Ministry of Defense Sergei Shoigu said on February 7 that the situation near Bakhmut for his troops is ‚Äúdeveloping successfully‚Äù.
On February 11, in the evening construction of the General Staff it was said that Russia was strengthening its grouping of troops in the Liman and Bakhmut directions.
On the evening of February 10 and on the night against 11, Russians attacked Ukraine's critical infrastructure in several regions.
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, only from six o'clock on Friday evening until midnight Ukrainian air defense destroyed two dozen ‚Äúshaheden‚Äù, which the Russians launched from the east coast of the Sea of Azov.
On February 10, Russia launched a new missile strike on Ukraine.
As a result, there is destruction in the capital and many regions.

EU will tighten sanctions against Russia on the anniversary of the invasion - DW - 08.02.2023
The European Union on the anniversary of Russia's full-scale military invasion of Ukraine will introduce new sanctions against the Russian Federation.
This was stated by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, speaking on Wednesday, February 8, with a government statement in the Bundestag on the eve of the extraordinary EU summit.
Scholz promised that the EU would support Ukraine ‚Äúfor as long as necessary.‚Äù
The Chancellor noted that Germany is one of the countries that provide Kiev with the greatest financial support.
‚ÄúIn the supply of weapons and ammunition, we are also far ahead of everyone in continental Europe,‚Äù he added.
At the same time, Scholz criticized ‚Äúpublic bidding under the motto: battle tanks, submarines, airplanes - who will demand even more‚Äù.
According to him, only the Russian president and his propaganda will benefit from such discussions and disagreements.

Metzola urged to give Kiev fighters and long-range weapons - DW - 09.02.2023
The President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metzola, during a meeting on Thursday, February 9, during which President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky spoke, called for the provision of aircraft and long-range weapons to Ukraine.
‚ÄúEU member states should quickly consider, as the next step, providing the long-range systems and fighters you need to protect the freedom that many take for granted,‚Äù Metzola said.
According to her, the response should be proportional to the threat, which is very serious.
‚ÄúUkraine is Europe, and the future of your nation is in the European Union,‚Äù she said, addressing Zelensky.
Zelensky: Ukraine will not allow Russia to destroy the European way of life
Zelensky, in turn, also noted that Ukraine is already on its way to membership in the EU.
‚ÄúWe are getting closer to the European Union.
Ukraine will be a member of the European Union.
Winning Ukraine is a winning member of the European Union,‚Äù Zelensky said in his speech to MEPs.
He also noted that Ukraine, together with Europe, is defending itself from ‚Äúthe most anti-European force of the modern world‚Äù.
‚ÄúThey are trying to destroy the Ukrainian European way of life by total war.
But for what?
To destroy the European way of life after the Ukrainian European way of life as such.
For each of the 27 elements of the European way of life, 27 countries of the European Union.
We will not allow this,‚Äù the President of Ukraine stressed.
Zelensky will ask to speed up the supply of weapons
The day before, DW reported that Zelensky had arrived in Brussels to get the support of the European Council and speed up the provision of critically needed weapons to Ukraine.
As the source of the publication from Zelensky's advanced diplomatic team recalled, during Zelensky's visit to the United States at the end of December last year, Kyiv received ‚Äúan agreement on the transfer of Patriot anti-aircraft missile systems to Ukraine and significant financial support, for which Congress voted.‚Äù
‚ÄúTherefore, the President of Ukraine expects similar results when he personally goes to other capitals,‚Äù the interlocutor said.
At the same time, the diplomat noted that, ‚Äúof course, such decisions are not a matter of the European Council, but the decision of the member states.‚Äù
Zelensky is expected to voice Ukraine's weapons needs during the summit of the European Council and communicate personally with each of the 27 leaders of the European Union member states.
According to the interlocutor, Ukraine needs first of all long-range artillery systems and a lot of ammunition.

Russia launched a major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW - DW - 09.02.2023
Russian troops launched a major offensive in Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatovo-Kreminna line in the west of the region has increased markedly over the past week, analysts said in a February 8 report.
It also notes that geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvoryny northwest of Svatovo.
The Armed Forces do not allow the Russian Federation to achieve significant success
According to experts, the involvement of significant units of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces have not yet allowed Russian troops to achieve significant success.
ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full momentum, the Russian command has not yet commissioned parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division (1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was transferred to Luhansk region in January after deployment in Belarus.
‚ÄúAlthough Russian forces in the Luhansk region now have the initiative (in the sense that Russian forces are setting the terms of battle, ending the period of the Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final climax on the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions,‚Äù the report said.
According to analysts, this climax is likely to create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces that they can use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning report, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the troops of the Russian Federation, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive actions in five directions: Kupianske, Limanske, Bakhmut, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Avdiivka and Novopavlivske in the areas of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Marinka and Ugledar.

SpaceX has restricted the ability of the Armed Forces to control drones through Starlink - DW - 09.02.2023
Advisor to the head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Mykhailo Podolyak on Thursday, February 9, called on the American company SpaceX to decide whether it supports Kiev in the war unleashed by Russia.
Thus, he reacted to the information that Elon Musk's company limited the ability of the Ukrainian military to control drones using the Starlink satellite Internet system.
‚ÄúCompanies have to decide for themselves: either they are on the side of the right to free life and Ukraine - and then they do not figure out how to harm; or they are on the side of the Russian Federation and its ‚Äúright‚Äù to kill, seizure of territories,‚Äù Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

Starlink should not be a weapon
The day before, SpaceX chief operating director Gwynn Shotwell said that Starlink, which the Ukrainian army actively uses in countering Russian aggression, ‚Äúwas never intended for use in the form of weapons.‚Äù
‚ÄúHowever, Ukrainians use it in an unforeseen way, which is not part of any agreement.
We know that the military uses it for communication, and that's okay.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes,‚Äù the director was quoted as saying by Reuters.
In particular, commenting on the use of Starlink by the Armed Forces of Ukraine to control drones, Shotwell noted that SpaceX could ‚Äúlimit their ability to do so.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere is something we can do and have already done,‚Äù she added.
What measures the company took, she refused to clarify.
SpaceX ‚Äútraded‚Äù with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX gave Kiev free Starlink systems to provide the population with the Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX told the US Department of Defense (Pentagon) that it could no longer continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over the issue.
At the time, she estimated the funding needed by the end of 2022 at $120 million, and over the next 12 months at about $400 million.
The issue of securing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, and in the European Union, but soon the owner of the company Musk said that SpaceX withdrew its request to the US defense department to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Relations with Germany develop in waves - DW - 09.02.2023
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky believes that relations between Berlin and Kiev against the background of Russian aggression are developing ‚Äúin waves‚Äù - they have ‚Äúups and downs‚Äù.
He voiced this position in an interview with the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, published on Thursday, February 9.
‚ÄúBy nature, I am a fast man.
Others act more slowly, which may also be due to their bureaucracy,‚Äù Zelensky said, adding that in the conditions of war Ukraine does not have weeks or months, and people's lives depend on the development of the situation every second.
Revitalization with air defense
The President of Ukraine noted that at some stage Germany's ‚Äúconservative attitude‚Äù has changed and he received the support of Chancellor Olaf Scholz.
‚ÄúThen I finally received support from Steinmeier (German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier - Ed.), with whom I had difficulties before, especially because of the so-called ‚ÄúSteinmeier formula,‚Äù Zelensky said.
He stressed that ‚Äúgood work‚Äù had been done, which allowed the relationship to be changed.
‚ÄúWe received IRIS-T air defense systems, for which I am very grateful to Germany.
They saved many lives,‚Äù the President of Ukraine said.
According to Zelensky, Berlin managed to increase the pace of production of these systems.
Earlier, Germany promised to transfer three more IRIS-T complexes to Ukraine in 2023.
Braking with tanks
However, the debate around the supply of Leopard battle tanks to Kiev has returned relations with Germany ‚Äúto a difficult phase,‚Äù the President of Ukraine said.
He called the discussions ‚Äúemotional and complex.‚Äù
‚ÄúI have to force him (Scholz - Ed.) to help Ukraine and constantly convince him that this help is needed not for us, but for Europeans,‚Äù Zelensky explained.
Categorical about fighters
After the Allies, including Germany, agreed to supply Kiev with battle tanks, discussions began on the transfer of fighters, which Ukraine insists on.
Here Scholz took a categorical position: Germany would in no way transfer combat aircraft.
At the same time, the Chancellor continues to assure that his country will support Kiev ‚Äúas long as it is necessary.‚Äù
He made relevant statements after a meeting with Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron on February 8, and before the summit of leaders of the European Union countries on Thursday.

have already put forward a new premiere - DW - 10.02.2023
The Moldovan government, together with Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilica, resigned.
This decision was made after consultations with the country's president Maya Sandu, Gavrilitsa said on Friday, February 10.
‚ÄúAfter a year and a half in government, it is time to announce my resignation.
We came to power in a crisis government and pursued a policy of development, anti-corruption and integration into the European Union,‚Äù she said.
According to her, during the work, the government ‚Äúfaced energy blackmail‚Äù.
‚ÄúThey thought we would surrender and act like previous governments that betrayed national interests, but that was not the case. We worked in a continuous crisis mode‚Äù, - said Havrylytsia.
She did not specify the reasons for the decision to quit, referring only to the lack of ‚Äúsupport and trust at home.‚Äù
Sandu thanked the Prime Minister ‚Äúfor the huge sacrifice and efforts‚Äù, also noting that Gavrilitsa headed the government during the crisis.
‚ÄúDespite unprecedented challenges, the country was managed responsibly, with great attention and dedicated work.
We have stability, peace and development - where others wanted war and bankruptcy,‚Äù the Moldovan president said.

Secretary of the Security Council may become the new prime minister
In accordance with the law, the Cabinet of Ministers will continue to perform duties until the oath of office is taken by the new government.
To replace Gavrilica, Sandu has already offered her security adviser, the current secretary of the Security Council of Moldova and the former Minister of Internal Affairs of the country Dorin Recan.
His candidacy must be approved by the parliament, in which the majority is the party ‚ÄúAction and Solidarity‚Äù.
Havrylytsia was her representative, so voting for Reƒçan should not be a problematic issue, AFP said.
Recan has already stated that he plans to continue to seek Moldova's membership in the European Union.
According to him, the priorities of the new government will be ‚Äúorder and discipline, the breath of new life in the economy, as well as peace and stability,‚Äù writes Reuters.
Due to Russia's war against Ukraine, Moldova faced an energy crisis in 2022.
The country twice experienced a complete power outage across the country as a result of Russia's strikes on the Ukrainian energy system.
In addition, Russia has significantly limited gas supplies to Moldova and repeatedly threatened to completely stop them.
Chisinau called the decline in supply volumes a political decision not related to payment issues.

In Turkey, almost 171 thousand tents have been laid out in the region affected by tremors.
According to official data, more than one and a half million blankets were transferred to the crash site.
At the same time, in Syria, representatives of the NGO White Helmets, who are carrying out a rescue mission in rebel-controlled regions, complain that they lack support.
On February 10, a White Helmets spokesman said that only two small international teams of volunteers who did not have rescue equipment had arrived in the region to provide assistance.
In addition, according to him, the region does not receive any humanitarian assistance from the UN.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which operates in London and reports on events from the rebel-controlled northern regions of Syria, noted that one batch of UN aid arrived in the region the day before, but it lacks shelter tents and equipment to clear up the remains.
About 3,000 White Helmets volunteers have been involved in rescue operations in northern Syria.
According to them, the group was able to save almost three thousand people.
The bodies of about two thousand people were found, more than 3.3 thousand people are considered dead.
More than 10 thousand were injured.
The most powerful earthquake since 1939
Early in the morning of February 6 in the southeast of Turkey, as well as in the north of Syria, there was a powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.8.
This earthquake was the most powerful in almost a century of observations.
The last tremors of such force Turkey experienced in 1939, when about 33 thousand people died.
In less than 12 hours, the southeast of Turkey was shaken by a second powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.5, which was also felt in Syria and Lebanon.

The decisive round of the presidential elections takes place in Cyprus - DW - 12.02.2023
In the Republic of Cyprus on Sunday, February 12, the second, decisive round of presidential elections takes place.
He received former Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulidis and former Permanent Representative of Cyprus to the UN Andreas Mavroyanis.
Conservative politician Christodoulidis received 32 percent of the vote in the first round, his rival in the second round, Mavroianis, who is supported by the left, gained 29.6 percent, ahead of the leader of the ruling party ‚ÄúDemocratic Union‚Äù (DISY) Averof Neophyte.
The DISY party, after the defeat of its candidate in the first round, could not decide on whom to support, which made the results of the decisive vote even more unpredictable, the AFP agency notes.
The President of the Republic of Cyprus, which has been a member of the European Union since 2004, is elected by universal vote.
He forms and leads the government of the country.
The winner of the current election will hold the post of head of state for five years and become the eighth president of Cyprus.
Cyprus was divided into two parts in 1974 as a result of a coup supported by the Greek junta and subsequent intervention by the Turkish army.
In 1983, the Turkish-occupied northern sector of the island proclaimed itself the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Ankara.
The latest talks on an attempted reunification of Cyprus ended without results in 2017.
Only Greek Cypriots take part in the elections - about 560 thousand people.
Residents of the unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus do not vote on them.

Energoatom reported a new threat to ZNPP - DW - 12.02.2023
President of Energoatom Petro Kotin called the reduction of water by Russians in the Kakhovka reservoir a new threat to the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant (ZNPP).
‚ÄúThere are a lot of threats at ZNPP.
The decrease in water in the Kakhovsky reservoir is a new added threat,‚Äù Kotin said during a briefing at one of the nuclear power plants on Sunday, February 12.
He noted that on the evening of February 11, the reservoir level is 13.8 meters at a normal level of 16 meters, ‚Äúso that the station receives recharge for its generators, for turbine condensers and for security systems.‚Äù
‚ÄúIn recent days, we see that the level has stabilized and slightly increased, as it reached 13.7 m, 13.6 m,‚Äù Kotin quotes ‚ÄúInterfax-Ukraine‚Äù.
He explained that the Russians who control the locks at the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant began to discharge less water, at the same time the tide at the top of the Dnieper increased.
The President of Energoatom clarified that under such conditions, the cooling pond at the ZNPP is sufficiently filled and there is still enough water, but if the reservoir level drops to a critical point, this, according to him, ‚Äúwill be a big problem for ZNPP‚Äù.
Kotin stressed that the critical level will be 12 meters, emergency - 12.8 meters, and expressed hope that the international community, with the assistance of the International Atomic Energy Agency, will not allow a critical situation.

Israel to strengthen campaign against Palestinian attackers - DW - 12.02.2023
Israel plans to intensify its campaign against Palestinian attackers in East Jerusalem and the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday, February 12.
‚ÄúToday, the government is gathering to prepare for an even broader response to those who commit terrorism,‚Äù Netanyahu quoted Reuters as saying.
Such a statement followed the deadly attack in East Jerusalem.
Attack in East Jerusalem
On February 10, a 32-year-old Palestinian drove into a crowd of people at a bus stop, killing three Israelis, including boys six and eight years old.
According to media reports, the attacker was discharged from a psychiatric hospital shortly before the incident.
Police shot and killed a man at the scene, and arrested and interrogated family members of the Palestinian.
Israeli law enforcers opened doors and windows in the home of a Palestinian family.
The next step after sealing may be the demolition of the attacker's house, writes AR.
Just one day after the attack, another Palestinian was shot dead during a confrontation with Israeli settlers in the West Bank.
Meanwhile, in the Gaza Strip, Palestinians fired a rocket towards the Israeli border on Saturday night.
The Israeli army said the missile was intercepted, reports dpa.

The security situation in Israel and the Palestinian territories has been extremely tense for several weeks.
The Israeli army conducts almost daily raids in the West Bank, which led to repeated clashes.
Since the beginning of this year, 45 Palestinians have been reported dead during them or in their own attacks.
In addition, as a result of Palestinian attacks in 2023, nine Israelis and a Ukrainian woman were killed.
According to human rights activists, about 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 2022, making this year the deadliest in these territories since 2004.
At the same time, over the past year, 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks on Israelis, writes AR.
Israel conquered the West Bank and East Jerusalem in 1967.
Today, more than 600 thousand Israeli settlers live there, says dpa.

Greek Foreign Minister visited Turkey - DW - 12.02.2023
Earthquakes in the border regions of Turkey and Syria have led to a cautious diplomatic rapprochement between Turkey and Greece - long-standing opponents, writes on Sunday, February 12, dpa.
On the same day, the Foreign Ministers of the two states Nikos Dendias and Mevlut √áavu≈üoƒülu held an unexpected meeting, at which, as the cameras of Greek television recorded, even hugged.
Greece was one of the first to help Ankara
√áavu≈üoƒülu thanked Dendias for making Greece one of the first countries to provide immediate assistance to Turkey after the disaster.
He added that both states will try to start a dialogue again and solve their problems.
‚ÄúGreece's assistance to the Turkish people does not end there,‚Äù said the head of the Greek Foreign Ministry.
According to him, Athens ‚Äúwill do everything‚Äù - at the bilateral level, as well as within the EU - to help Turkey.
Dendias became the first EU foreign minister to visit the disaster area.
Several Greek rescue teams are working in the Antakya and Hatay region.
A New Beginning in Bilateral Relations?
Political commentators and columnists in the Greek press have been expressing the hope for several days that Athens's assistance to Ankara could be a new beginning in relations between the two countries.
Both NATO members have already demonstrated solidarity with each other during the powerful earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999.
This aid, known as ‚Äúearthquake diplomacy,‚Äù helped then achieve a certain d√©tente.
Conflict over islands
Athens and Ankara have been arguing for decades over sovereign rights in the Aegean Sea and the eastern Mediterranean.
Ankara questions Greece's sovereignty over a number of islands in the eastern Aegean ‚Äî Rhodes, Lesbos, Samos and Kos.
Greece seems to be violating international treaties by maintaining a military presence there.
Athens justifies the stationing of troops on the islands by the threat of numerous landing craft on the Turkish west coast and the right of each state to self-defense.
Read also: Greece and Turkey on the verge of armed conflict?
Turkey almost daily reinforces its claims with a flyby of fighters over the Greek islands.
And in recent months, the country's leader Erdogan has repeatedly threatened to invade the Greek islands.
Warming of Ankara with Armenia
Against the background of the tragedy caused by earthquakes, there is also a warming of relations between Turkey and Armenia.
Ankara opened a closed crossing for more than 30 years, through which trucks with humanitarian aid from Armenia passed for victims of the disaster.
In addition, Armenia reported sending two rescue teams to Turkey and Syria after the earthquake that occurred on February 6 and killed more than 33 thousand people.
Relations between Ankara and Yerevan are strained due to historical reasons - about 1.5 million Armenians were victims of systematic assassinations in the Ottoman Empire during World War I.
As the successor to the Ottoman Empire, Turkey admits to having exterminated several hundred thousand Armenians, but refuses to define it as genocide.
Meanwhile, the Armenian genocide was condemned, in particular, by the United States, Germany and France.
The land border between Turkey and Armenia was closed in 1993.
Against the background of the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh and Turkey's support for Azerbaijan, the situation only worsened.

NATO discusses further support for Ukraine - DW - 14.02.2023
A two-day meeting of NATO defense ministers began in Brussels, during which on Tuesday, February 14, a meeting in the so-called ‚ÄúRamstein‚Äù format is also held.
On the agenda of the event is further building up support for Ukraine in the war and increasing the rate of ammunition production.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said before the meeting that NATO should provide Ukraine with the weapons it needs ‚Äúto win this war.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe see no sign that President Putin is preparing for peace, we see the opposite, he is preparing for a new war, new offensives and new attacks,‚Äù he quoted Reuters as saying.
‚ÄúThis is a war of attrition, and therefore a battle for logistics,‚Äù Stoltenberg added, referring to Ukraine's need for more weapons and negotiations on the possible provision of combat aircraft to Ukraine.

During the meeting, ministers are expected to approve long-term guidelines for the Alliance's defence planning.
‚ÄúAllies will discuss investing in defense, as well as how to protect our critical infrastructure,‚Äù Stoltenberg quoted Interfax-Ukraine as saying.
What to expect from the ninth ‚ÄúRamstein‚Äù
On this very day, the US-led Contact Group is meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels to discuss urgent needs for Ukraine, in which the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksiy Reznikov takes part.
Also, the head of the Ukrainian defense department will join a special session of the meeting of NATO defense ministers.
‚ÄúMore than 50 countries participating in the Contact Group are united with you in this struggle for Ukraine's sovereignty and self-defense,‚Äù Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin wrote on Twitter, posting a video of the meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart.
The Ukrainian military-political leadership previously expressed hope that at the next meeting of Ramstein partners could decide on the provision of Western-style combat aircraft and long-range missiles.
Kyiv also expects that as a result of this meeting, the Allies will announce the exact number and timing of the provision of tanks to Ukraine.

Ukraine wants a ban on the tour of Russian artists in the EU - DW - 14.02.2023
Ukraine collects data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine or work in institutions and organizations funded from the state budget of the Russian Federation to include them in the new package of EU sanctions.
This was announced in an interview with DW by the Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Galina Grigorenko.
Culture as a weapon of Russia
According to Grigorenko, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
‚ÄúCulture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum very clearly says that the exhibition projects of the museum abroad are their special operation,‚Äù says Grigorenko.
In her opinion, now dialogue through culture with Russia is impossible.
Therefore, often Ukrainian artists refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
Recently, the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called ‚ÄúDPR‚Äù in the Donbass.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour
However, according to Grigorenko, this is not enough for those representatives of the culture of the Russian Federation who support Putin's policy, still manage to tour in Europe.
‚ÄúIn order to officially cancel such tours, you need to have names on the European sanctions lists,‚Äù says Grigorenko, adding: ‚ÄúWe are working to ensure that cultural figures of the Russian Federation who promote Russian narratives outside Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible on the territory of the EU to officially ban their economic activities, in particular the holding of concerts.‚Äù
According to Gryhorenko, the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group at the Office of the President of Ukraine are dealing with this issue in Ukraine.
As previously reported, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9 noted that he asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at a summit in Kiev.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.
Ukraine has its own sanctions list of cultural and media figures of the Russian Federation, which contains more than 300 names.

US ready to sell HIMARS, ATACMS missiles and other military equipment to Poland for $10 billion
The US State Department approved the possible sale of military equipment and services to Poland in the amount of about $10 billion.
This was reported by Voice of America correspondent Jeff Seldin with reference to the Pentagon Agency for Defense Cooperation (DSCA).
This is primarily about launchers of the highly mobile artillery missile system M142 HIMARS with ammunition for them, ATACMS missiles, GMLRS bombs, as well as other military equipment.
‚ÄúSuch an acquisition should support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by enhancing the security of a NATO member, which is a force for political stability and economic progress in Europe,‚Äù the agency said in a statement.
According to the Pentagon, Poland intends to use the acquired equipment ‚Äúto modernize its armed forces and expand its capabilities to strengthen domestic defense and deter regional threats.‚Äù
In general, Poland has submitted a request for the purchase of the following equipment:
- 18 M142 HIMARS launchers;
- 468 sets of the HIMARS boot device module;
- 45 Army tactical missile systems M57 (ATACMS);
- 1514 capsules of the GMLRS guided multiple launch missile system (M30A2, M31A2, XM403);
The agreement also includes missiles, communications equipment, spare and repair parts, batteries, laptops, publications and technical data, personnel training and equipping, system integration support, engineering and logistics services of the US government and contractors, training, sensors, and other related material and software elements.
According to Bloomberg, the new equipment is in addition to the launchers purchased by Poland from the United States in 2019, which have not yet been delivered.
Warsaw also invited rocket launchers from South Korea, - the publication informs.
NATO Secretary General urged the United States to be ready for a long war of the Russian Federation in Ukraine
The possibility of sending fighters to Ukraine for protection in the war against the Russian Federation is not removed from the agenda, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said during a press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
‚ÄúThe first step in providing advanced aircraft is to have soldiers or aviators capable of using them.
This is a process that takes some time.
We started this process today, - Sunak said about the previously announced training program for Ukrainian pilots in Britain.
- Nothing is removed from the agenda, and our leadership in this matter is something that we all together should be proud of‚Äù.
Sunak also announced that the previously promised Challenger 2 tanks will arrive in Ukraine as early as ‚Äúnext month‚Äù and said that Ukraine ‚Äúshould never again remain vulnerable to attack‚Äù, and also called for ‚Äúarming Ukraine in the short term, but strengthening Ukraine in the long term.‚Äù
According to him, the UK agreed to expand its training program, which trained 10,000 troops over the past six months, and promised, according to CNN, ‚Äúto speed up the delivery of our equipment‚Äù to ensure Ukraine's achievements on the front lines in the coming ‚Äúdays and weeks, not years.‚Äù
President Zelensky during a press conference expressed gratitude for the support of Ukraine: ‚ÄúToday it is clear that we have the support of the United Kingdom.
Thank you to all the people of Great Britain, thank you for these 350 days of unity.
Also, speaking about the training program for Ukrainian pilots, he reiterated the call for the provision of Western fighters to Ukraine and added that he ‚Äúheard from the Prime Minister about the desire to provide fighters‚Äù to Kiev.
The Russian embassy in London has already said that Britain's decision to provide Ukraine with fighters will have ‚Äúmilitary-political consequences‚Äù for the whole world.
Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Twitter that Kiev continues to talk to Western partners about the possibility of providing combat aircraft: ‚ÄúI spoke with Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Gukstra to coordinate our international moves as a full-scale Russian invasion approaches the year mark.
I thanked for the latest decision on tanks.
I also raised the issue of the F-16.
We continue our dialogue with the Netherlands and others on combat aviation.‚Äù
Air Force spokesman Yuri Ignat said in a comment to CNN that Ukraine would need dozens of Western combat aircraft to win the war against Russia.
At the same time, observers say that the West has a short period of time to help Ukraine with new military equipment before the start of the expected new Russian offensive in the spring or even in February.
According to some estimates, the Kremlin is already trying to resume a major offensive in Ukraine since the beginning of January.

Vaccination is hindered by ‚Äúpolitics and profits‚Äù
The Director-General of the World Health Organization ‚ÄúI said on Sunday that unless countries effectively use existing tools to combat the pandemic, it will not be possible to end it.
‚ÄúThe pandemic will end when the world decides to end it,‚Äù said Tedros Adan Ghebreyesus, speaking at the World Health Summit, a global forum held in Germany.
‚ÄúWe have all the necessary tools - effective healthcare tools and effective medical instruments.
But the world has made bad use of these tools,‚Äù Tedros said, addressing participants from 100 countries around the world.
Obstacles to meeting the WHO target of vaccinating 40% of each country's population against coronavirus are ‚Äúpolicies and profits,‚Äù said the WHO chief, ‚Äúnot production.‚Äù
‚ÄúCountries that have already reached the 40% target, including all G-20 countries, should give up their place in the vaccine delivery queue in favor of COVAX and the African vaccine acquisition fund,‚Äù Tedros said.
COVAX is an international collaboration initiative created to distribute the COVID vaccine fairly.
Ghebreyesus also stressed that no country can end the COVID-19 pandemic separately from the rest of the world.
‚ÄúAnd no country can protect the health of its own people without cooperation to protect other peoples.
Together!‚Äù - said Gebreyesus on the social network Twitter.
A WHO official also called on vaccine manufacturers to ‚Äúprioritize and fulfill their contracts with COVAX and AVAT [African Vaccine Acquisition Fund]‚Äù and become ‚Äúmuch more transparent about what is going where.‚Äù
Avat is an African Union initiative aimed at ensuring access to COVID-19 vaccines across Africa.
The official called on vaccine manufacturers to ‚Äúexchange know-how, technology and licenses and give up intellectual property rights.‚Äù
Earlier, Curren Attiah, a writer for The Washington Post, called on the US administration to share with the world the ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù of the Moderna vaccine.
‚ÄúThe US administration has trumpet about the vaccines it has donated around the world.
But when a rich country resorts to donations in the form of vaccines instead of spreading knowledge, it is not good-hearted philanthropy; it is supremacy.
The poorer countries did not ask for charity in the form of vaccines; from the beginning they asked for a just opportunity,‚Äù the columnist noted.
‚ÄúWe are not asking for charity,‚Äù Tedros said, ‚Äúwe are calling for smart investments in global recovery.‚Äù
As reported by Voice of America, earlier this year, the Biden administration called for the waives of patent protection for COVID-19 vaccines.
Such a refusal should, according to the plan of the US administration, allow poorer countries to produce drugs analogous to patented vaccines.
The pharmaceutical campaigns, the EU, etc., opposed.
In August, pharmaceutical companies Moderna and Pfizer announced price increases for their coronavirus vaccines.
The Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University said on Monday it had recorded 243.7 million global COVID infections and nearly 5 million deaths worldwide.
According to the university, almost 7 billion vaccines have been administered.

Polish President Andrzej Duda said that the decision to send F-16 aircraft to Ukraine would be ‚Äúa very serious decision‚Äù, which ‚Äúis not easy to make.‚Äù
This was stated by one of Ukraine's closest allies in an interview with CNN on the background of discussions of new arms supplies to Ukraine.
According to CNN correspondent Laura K√ºnsberg, in Warsaw, in an exclusive interview broadcast on Sunday, President Duda said that sending F-16 aircraft would create a ‚Äúserious problem‚Äù for Poland, because, the Polish air force has fewer than 50 aircraft, and the Poles themselves ‚Äúare not enough... and we will need much more.‚Äù
Duda also stressed that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have a ‚Äúvery serious need for maintenance‚Äù, so ‚Äúit is not enough to just send a few aircraft.‚Äù
These remarks by President Duda came amid discussions of new arms shipments to Ukraine, including Western tanks and antiballistic missile systems from older times.
Poland is one of Ukraine's closest allies, and Warsaw has persistently persuaded its NATO allies to send Patriot installations and Western-made tanks, such as German Leopard tanks, to Kyiv.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky undertook an unannounced European tour this week, during which he called on Ukraine's Western partners to provide it with the means to fight Russia in the air.
In London, President Zelensky called combat aviation ‚Äúwings of freedom‚Äù to Ukraine.
Zelensky repeated the same message in Paris and Brussels.
In his speech to members of the European Parliament, Zelensky said he was ‚Äúvery grateful‚Äù for the assistance provided, and hoped that the next negotiations on providing Ukraine with aviation will also be successful.
‚ÄúI have heard from some European leaders about their readiness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation.
Now I have a number of bilateral talks, we will raise the issue of fighters and other aviation.
Therefore, we continue our work here in Brussels,‚Äù Zelensky said.
As the Voice of America reported, last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country is ready to transfer its F-16 fighters to Ukraine in ‚Äúfull coordination‚Äù with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Vopke Hukstra said his government would consider Kiev's request for an F-16.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied supplying F-16 aircraft from the United States, but Western experts believe that these aircraft could come to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that previously weapons, which the United States refused to supply, eventually ended up in Ukraine if it was agreed to be transferred by European NATO allies.
Ukrainian military started training on Leopard 2 in Germany and Poland
CHISINAU, Moldova (AP).
On Monday, the Moldovan president announced Moscow's conspiracy to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country ‚Äúat the disposal of Russia‚Äù and disrupt its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maia Sandu's briefing came a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that his country had intercepted plans of Russian special services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by representatives of Moldovan intelligence.
‚ÄúThe plan for the next period involves the involvement of saboteurs with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothing, who will resort to force, attack some state buildings and even take hostages,‚Äù Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
‚ÄúThe purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, change the legitimate government of Chisinau to illegitimate,‚Äù Sandu said, ‚Äúwhich would put our country at the disposal of Russia and stop the process of European integration.‚Äù
She promised: ‚ÄúThe Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed.‚Äù
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic with a population of about 2.6 million people, has tried to forge closer relations with its Western partners.
In June last year, she received the status of a candidate for the European Union, the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, the Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service (SIS) intervened in ‚Äúseveral cases of organizing criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence‚Äù.
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a member of NATO, has faced a number of problems.
Among them are a serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply reduced gas supplies; rapid inflation; and several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed airspace and debris that was found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another wartime missile in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said Russia wanted to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the intelligence services contained what it called instructions on the rules of entry into Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
‚ÄúI assure you that government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control,‚Äù Sandu said.
She said that the Moldovan parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service, as well as the prosecutor's office ‚Äúwith the necessary tools to more effectively deal with risks to the country's security.‚Äù
The president added that the plan would ‚Äúrely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups,‚Äù and continued the names of two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Vladimir Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.
Last year, both men were sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom.
Last fall, a series of massive anti-government protests organized by the populist, Russia-friendly Shor party also rocked Moldova amid the energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday came after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.
That same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Rechan, as successor to Gavrilita.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, US State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that ‚ÄúRussia has supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova for years, which often involve the use of corruption in the form of weapons to achieve its goals.‚Äù

I would like to talk to you personally, but we are at home.
Darya's ear hurts, then we went to the hospital today. So we are treated until Thursday.

Stories from the war: ‚ÄúGrandmother with a red flag‚Äù threw him away when she learned about Bucha
An employee of the Center for Strategic Communications found the same woman.
üîª A living symbol of ‚Äúpro-Russian Ukraine‚Äù, a woman who, according to Russian propaganda, ‚Äúboldly opposed the nationalists‚Äù, is actually grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only supported her with products, but also protected from the anger of ordinary Kharkiv citizens.
üîª Anna Ivanovna explains that she came out with a red flag to, as she thought, the Russian military, so that they ‚Äúdo not defeat Ukraine‚Äù.
And in the aggressor country, her motives were distorted, which is why she now feels like a ‚Äútraitor‚Äù.
üîª She is currently in one of the city hospitals in Kharkiv with her husband.
üí¨ The military urges not to despise the old woman.
‚ÄúNow that Anna Ivanovna received a mine from the Russians, and help from the Ukrainians, her grandson is fleeing in Poland, when she learned about Bucha and everything else, she threw that red flag away,‚Äù says a commvode from the pseudo Cadet.
The enemy creates conditions for an offensive on Nikolaev and Kryvyi Rih ‚Äî construction
The Russian military conduct hostilities to reach the administrative boundaries of the Kherson region and create favorable conditions for the offensive on the cities of Nikolaev and Krivoy Rog.

Literally: ‚ÄúTo increase the pace of the offensive operation, the command of the armed forces of the Russian Federation continues to take measures to strengthen the strike potential of its troops.
Arms and military equipment removed from storage in the Western, Central, Eastern military districts and northern fleets are transferred by rail to the areas bordering with Ukraine.
Details: In the Volyn and Polessk directions, the enemy did not conduct any active actions.
There were no significant changes in the situation in these areas.
The designated units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in Brest and Gomel regions.
There is a threat of missile strikes by the enemy against military and civilian infrastructure facilities throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as the enemy's provocations on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine.
We give up Soviet weapons and switch to NATO models ‚Äî Zaluzhny
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Valery Zaluzhny held a telephone conversation with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces
Zaluzhnyi's direct speech: ‚ÄúWe also discussed with my American colleague the promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will complete.
I also informed General Millie about the difficult situation in the east of our country, in particular in the Izium and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, keep occupied borders and positions.‚Äù
‚Äî The one who invented this hellish summer was clearly unintelligent! - complained Wild and stretched out her arms in front of herself, as if she wanted to reach the ghostly coolness.
‚ÄúYou say the same thing every time,‚Äù Warta indifferently remarked, stirring the ice in the cocktail. ‚ÄúIn autumn - because rain and drizzle, the herbs rot.
In winter ‚Äî because it is cold and the potion freezes out.
In spring, it's raining again...
‚ÄîI would sit in my Carpathians, ‚ÄîWarta indifferently jerked her shoulders.
Although she did not particularly like the city.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and bustle.
The girl liked to imagine familiar streets calm, quiet and greener, as a hundred years ago or before.
But there is no magic that would allow us to return to the past.
- Phah!
You say this! - The wild woman slapped her palm on the table - and the vases with flowers timidly turned green. - If you would sit for a week in the meadow of my grandmother Rutmer with her teammates, you would pray for every passing truck, just to be taken away from there to any city.
Unless you loved to weed the beds from morning to night, sort out herbs, hang them under the ceiling and at the same time sing old orders.
For the dragonfly was stubborn with a horn, that without words, none of my potions will be as it should be.
And wait, I have not yet remembered about whipping up all the rags at night!..
Yes, where there, our Belarusian, you would die, even a week would not have passed!
Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù life, and that they like such ‚Äúwork‚Äù, that this is their conscious choice and the like.
But if you start to really understand this topic, it becomes scary...
Now there is a particularly acute problem with the involvement of Ukrainian women in prostitution.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea of legalizing prostitution... because of this, I did not treat him very well.
I think that it is necessary to adopt the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of ‚ÄúSwedish model‚Äù there.
At the same time, not a woman is ordered, but a client.
Women are helped to get out of this ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù, and to make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees at all.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything anymore.
Men should also think about what they buy - ‚Äúpleasure‚Äù or violence...
There is a need for something else... you can see me where the nearest optician with a doctor to write a prescription for glasses.
And the frame needs to be bought, high-quality... I looked at some sites with frames, then I was pleasantly impressed - it is cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $300 for them, the frame was average (or even lower).
I do not know what frames are in stores, but prices in online stores are quite normal.
But, as for some cosmetics, I can say for sure that it is more expensive here.
Soup is much.
We have multifocal lenses in glasses very expensive (this when compared to our average wages).
Given the budget of our family (especially the fact that it is necessary to rent housing), then $300 for glasses, then a rather high amount.
Doctors did not offer you an artificial multifocal crystal?
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then lens intolerance began, a year after that I wore hard lenses, a strong allergy to almost all cosmetics began.
For 4 years I have been wearing glasses constantly, I wear lenses very rarely.
Yes, I also read that cohid affects vision.
Also after 40 years there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than 1000 dollars, then very expensive.
Yes, glasses are now fashionable.
I asked one doctor why he did not wear lenses or would not make a laser correction for himself, so he replied that glasses are stylish)
For a pensioner with a pension of 1500 UAH - this amount is unrealistic
I now have glasses mask wrinkles
Yes.
My mother has little work experience.
She did little work: first small children who often get sick, then looked after her grandmother... so the state gave her a minimum pension.
The father receives 3800 hryvnia, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8000 hryvnia and all these funds had to be paid for rent.
In good times (before the coweed) there were premiums, but with the onset of quarantine there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
Therefore, many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for a family or to buy a picture, but then contact with the family is lost...
Yes, there are advantages.
But my husband as he has a day off, then he goes to the apiary)
Goodnight
According to the order from the date of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until the restoration of control over these seaports.
It is pointed out that the adoption of such a decision is due to the inability to service ships and passengers, to ensure an adequate level of safety of navigation and environmental protection during Russia's conduct of hostilities in these regions, which threaten the life and health of people.
The Russian Federation uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
According to the Ukrinform correspondent, Reuters writes about it, referring to the statement of the British Foreign Ministry.
‚ÄúThe British Foreign Ministry on Sunday said that Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation on social networks about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including the UK and South Africa,‚Äù the report said.
It is noted that the Foreign Ministry reached these conclusions on the basis of an expert study.
‚ÄúThe ministry said this study exposed exactly how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign aimed at manipulating international public opinion on the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers,‚Äù Reuters wrote.
According to the study, the troll factory ‚Äúused Telegram to attract and coordinate new supporters who later acted against Kremlin critics, bombing them with comments in support of President Putin and his war.‚Äù
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
‚ÄúTraces of the operation were found on eight social networks, including Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok,‚Äù the statement said.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Tras said her government has already ‚Äúwarned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadow troll factories to break into our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war,‚Äù Tras concluded.
Ivanna, now I will explain to you.
You have such a hair structure that all hair is almost the same length.
Very few short layers.
To achieve the most smooth result, you need to either do hair thinning.
But this will greatly affect the density of the hair.
That's why I didn't do that.
Or do the coloring of the roots to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I also did not paint the roots.
Therefore, the transition can be a bit abrupt.
I can fuse the transition for you, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be painted to your color, so when the hair grows back you will not notice the difference.
About the quality of hair.
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
Hair can become drier, this is normal because it is blond.
Without loss of quality, such a blond can not be made.
If you do the right hair care, the condition of the hair will return to normal.
Please write what kind of Matrix care you use.
Perhaps for blond he is weak.
We can sign up for free toning to make a smoother transition.
This photo also has a rather sharp transition.
Because a large percentage of blond in the root zone.
Please write when you could drive up so I can take a look.
If we do tinting, it will take about three hours.
A lot of positive things from what I do at my job.
I help people - this is the most important thing and I wanted it.
Let it be in this way, but it is a help to people to whom almost no one in the world helps and will not say ‚Äúgood day‚Äù with a smile of heart.
I found on the Internet today excellent basic lessons of learning the Czech language.
In the morning I clean the rooms where the homeless sleep, at this time I am alone and the doors to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons with headphones and repeat after the lecturer.
From the outside, I speak to myself, but it's good that at this time no one sees or hears me üòÖ I think an hour a day I can learn the language like this.
So another huge positive of this work is learning the language in headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ
Over the past 100 years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
The longest period of peace lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Russia borders with 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
Most of the modern territory of Russia at one time was occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural background of the Russians.
The cult of invasion and raids has been a success throughout the history of Russia: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then 20 years of Putin's regime.
These cultural features have shaped state institutions that cultivate policies of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of the war of conquest because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet fully felt the consequences of economic sanctions.
The standard of living in them has not deteriorated so much as to provoke mass protest movements within the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand increased sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within!
Russia poses the threat of a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military is shelling and seizing nuclear power plants on the territory of Ukraine.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was de-energized.
They fired from tanks and took control of Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also recorded over South Ukrainian NPP in the Nikolaev area.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits the attack of nuclear power plants.
Hit by a rocket, overheating of the reactor or spent fuel due to failures in the supply of electricity and water can lead to radiation leakage.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia does not have to press the ‚Äúred button‚Äù to cause a catastrophe on a planetary scale.
Support Ukraine ‚Äî the Russian threat can only be overcome together!
Russians rob Ukrainian farmers and illegally export grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and first harvests from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a conscious policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory decided to ‚Äúexpropriate surplus crops of last year and this year‚Äù from the south of Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take seed from farmers, but at the same time require them to successfully carry out sowing, in order to then send new crops to Russia.
Prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, he threatens physical violence.
Russia repeats the Soviet policy of mass robbery of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
Thus began the Holodomor in 1932-33 and the destruction of private property on Ukrainian lands.
Under the guise of a ‚Äúliberation war with the Nazis‚Äù, Russia in particular provokes hunger in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods!
And demand that your country abandon any cooperation with Russia!
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine take children hostage.
They force their mothers to find out the locations of the Ukrainian military, for refusal they threaten to kill children.
People are pushed to a tough choice: to lose children or to become traitors to the Motherland and be punished for it.
The Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine Lyudmila Denisova has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated amendments to the legislation ‚Äúto organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbass.‚Äù
Call on your authorities and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children!
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I do not like their indecision.
Due to the fact that NATO does not cover the skies over Ukraine, thousands are dying.
More than 50,000 civilians have been killed.
However, without Western weapons, we would be powerless, but I have to say that they come in insufficient numbers and with a delay.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think that this is beneficial to the alliance itself, because with NATO weapons and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe
Did you know that a Ukrainian was invented how to recharge the ‚Äúone-time‚Äù nlaw anti-tank complex?
I think the Americans will knock down these warheads at the launch stage
The Russians deserve all the worst and the worst that can be imagined.
Therefore, to some extent I am happy with what is happening.
Because this war has not been going on for 4 months, it began around the 15th century, I do not remember exactly now.
But all these hundreds of years there has been an attempt to make us our slaves.
One generation does not have time to die, as another is born and takes a fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have returned to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state
In general, it is wild for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the transience of events, I did not even have time to comprehend, reflect on the very fact that there is a war going on and what it means to me
It's super here, but you need to learn the language and go to work, I will not be able to sit on the maintenance of the Czech state, but the problem is that my husband does not want me to sew constant quarrels to work.And I will have to return to Ukraine or we could stay but he will do everything so that we go backward.Very difficult situation
He doesn't want us to live here is his answer
So he is glad that we are here, but in order to stay at home all the time, I myself took the children to school and to swim, I ask that we stay here after the war, and he says that we will immediately go home, he will not make us documents
I probably myself will not be able to leave if he does a long time, and he may not give permission to take children to the Czech Republic
Prolonged beating
When the war is over, I want to learn to be a hairdresser and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic if he does not want to, then surely he will have to go to a lawyer.Now it is too early to do something.But here he clearly told us that after the war we immediately go home.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine he said that he would take us))) Well, now I know the truth
Yes. thank you.let's get out of the situation, the main thing is that the war is over!!! everything will be fine.!!!
No, at the moment he has no one for sure. I think the reason is that children in the Czech Republic want a lot of things in the Czech Republic ask him to go to Mac Donald's for toys, scream, run around the house.And he is brought to peace that no one bothers him and does not ask for anything below.And here we arrived and everything annoys him and he needs to spend money on us and he is very economical. It is better for us to live in Ukraine.
Outside the train window, plentiful grayish rain, birch trees and spruce trees, sprinkled with black and white confetti forty, creepy waterways and merchandise trees flawed.
Comrade Operationist Orlrv lay on a narrow Spartan bed, familiar to him, because it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed in his house.
He unfolded a simple set of the seconded person - rye bread and lard, wrapped in a gray rag.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and was unpretentious in life, he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simply, because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he leaned over the old skewered bag and carefully took out the crystal dome with two palms, which sparkled dimly in the gray light of the middle stripe.
- What do you have, comrade? - the young cadet, his neighbor, asked frightened.
- Rarity, - with tenderness, unexpected for himself, said Comrade Orlov, securely placing the skull on the compartment table, - such, you see, a thing... Very interesting and flammable thing.
This, you can say, my friend...
Yes, I watch work on 5 sites.
But unfortunately I find work for men, for special education.
I do not know the Czech language, I am a teacher of young children, I am not an engineer and I do not have a driver's license.
And also a big question to find housing.
This is my first time abroad and I just don't know what to do and how to act.
I have not been able to find a job for a month, I just cleaned the same house.
I understand that the situation in Prague is very difficult, so I don't even go there
Here I have problems anywhere üò≠ I am abroad for the first time, I do not know the language and I am completely alone.
I and 20 other people were fired by the agency after 3 weeks of work.
I can't find any more work.
I ask people, look at sites - nothing
In this village I attend a course.
One lesson per week on Tuesday
Unfortunately, now the situation is such that I have to hold on to free housing while it is available.
And watch work somewhere nearby.
Or find a job with accommodation.
I don't see any other options ((
I don't want to just sit because housing won't be free for long.
I understand
I don't want to take money from you.
I don't want thoughts about lazy people from Ukraine to influence others.
I just want to find a job and a room to live in an ordinary city, not in the capital.
The difficult road from Ukraine for three days and a big city where someone else's speech scared me very much.
I did not come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save lives.
I just need a job and a room.
Do you know someone in small towns?
I can take care of children, cook food, clean, work in the garden...
I know how to sew, I have learning to sew on a sewing machine.
I sewed custom bedding and some clothes.
Perhaps there will be such work.
I know how to do it!
I huddle and send greetings to all! üôèüèªü§óü§óü§óüíêüåû
I am very glad to read you!
We now have an air alarm again (((
More than 100 missiles flew to Ukraine today üò°
Today I worked with the wounded, it was difficult to concentrate.
All thoughts were at the child's side.
Jan studied at home...
Everything will be Ukraine!
We give away this evil spirits!
In the surgical department, my colleagues and I volunteered
Sometimes it covers of course))))
Then I clean, cook, communicate))))
For this is my house, my land!
Congratulations to all, everyone!
I remember everyone and thank you for your understanding, support and love! üôèüèªüíêü§ó
Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the issue of withdrawing or not withdrawing the association of Russian psychologists of European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is central.
I will give an analogy.
If in the sandbox one child takes a toy from another child, then most likely adults who watch the children will try to reconcile the children and for some time the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox begins to hit another's face with a spatula, then such a child is isolated for a long time, and no one will play with her.
I also liked the analogy of one Russian colleague-psychologist about the fact that when someone from a neighboring apartment kills someone, the entire apartment building is not put in prison.
Among Ukrainian psychologists there are many discussions about the exclusion of Russian associations from European ones, many feel how painful they cannot withstand communication with Russian psychologists.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to work with several psychologists from Russia I know and share knowledge in order to treat clients' injuries on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and I have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack by Russian troops on Ukraine, and who, at their level, are trying to do many things to develop universal values in Russia.
Therefore, I am definitely in favor of a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia the war is supported by 5-10% of the population, and the rest of the figures in opinion polls are drawn by propaganda.
My wife left her native homeland Ukraine because there is a war going on there.
The wife had a good job and no matter how much war she never left her home.
In order not to sit in the Czech Republic on the neck of my wife, my wife is trying to earn money, because once in 2009 she received a certificate of completion of masseuse courses in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money whoever they can.
Now the only problem is to learn Czech.
The wife teaches and works languages and earns herself and her child for food, kindergarten, bus ticket, mobile services for clothes.
And at this time I am defending my homeland.
Thank you for supporting people who understand this.
I thank the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine in a difficult time. üá∫üá¶‚ù§Ô∏èüá®üáøü§ù‚úä
I want to thank you for giving you the opportunity to advertise my wife for the provision of massage services in your community.
The wife earns money on her own because she does not want to live for the taxes of the Czech people.
thanks
Sincerely grateful to you.
It really helps my wife make money for her family.
Okay, I'll give it to my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of Ukrainian people.
Some people smile at my wife's announcement, but my wife offers her services.
My wife in Ukraine was a nurse, I work in the police, but the war divided us.
It is good that my wife wants to work and earn money and does not expect help from your republic.

Supervision of students in class, during breaks and at school events by school staff.
Safety conditions during your stay in the gym, on the playground and in professional classes
Distance Learning Rules
If this is not possible due to the introduction of an emergency measure or the introduction of quarantine
personal presence of students at school, the school provides interested students with distance education.
If the distance learning method is ordered in a school (classroom), students are required to do so in this way.
The most important safety rules
For school and school activities, in particular, it is prohibited to bring things that threaten health and safety
weapons (including knives), drugs (drugs), cigarettes and alcohol.
It is forbidden to smoke and use alcohol or other drugs at school at school and at events.
I really need a person who could act as an interpreter in a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen.
So now we are dealing with an insurance company to fix the car.
Insurance invited a person who, during the technical inspection of the car, can translate from Czech into Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa.
Can you help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific paper based on statistical analysis of the body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a single population.
In addition, I also have experience in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in the research of the Kharkiv Center for Bat Rehabilitation as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped to monitor the bat populations of Kharkiv region, as well as organize wintering for bats, which were disturbed by people in the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation that is important to me.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to get acquainted with scientific works about tardigrades, observe their vital activity under a microscope and communicate with scientists who study them.
So the option of studying these and other microscopic organisms in greater depth is also of interest to me.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees ‚Äî the analyst from the expert
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU ‚Äî this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milo≈° Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.
She provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
About 500 thousand arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such strong support from their neighbors ‚Äî Poland and the Czech Republic ‚Äî and will thank you tirelessly!
How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, the editors of ProUkraineNU asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Refugee Centre in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has offices not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians
The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the life of the Czechs.
There are long queues in labor governments, a significant increase in prices in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees?
The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.
It was foreseen.
Poland has said in recent months that there will be such a huge problem.
Even in Ukraine, they were less prepared for what would happen, and in Poland they were actively preparing.
For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine before the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.
In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.
I heard that they smiled about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very balanced: to prepare even before the beginning of the war for all these events.
I note that extremely large funds were allocated from regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing from the bombing, from the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance in logistics ‚Äî movement through the territory of Poland.
From Ukraine to Poland there are special trains, including medical ones, for the wounded and sick.
These are airplanes that move through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to the EU countries.
I have had experience working with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as anyone might think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, the fare for Ukrainians has been canceled.
They can travel free of charge on trains and public transport.
In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to get free of charge to the places where they plan to stay.
The second issue is the residence of refugees in facilities provided by local self-government bodies.
For the most part, these are closed school small stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
There is organized free meals, free medical first aid.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for several days, and already there on the spot they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
The large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw became very active, where now whole Ukrainian quarters have been created.
The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they managed to collect objects from the Embassy of the Russian Federation that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes have been in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone there.
Polish local authorities nationalized this, let's say.
I took it in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings, which can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
There will be supplied water, electricity, they are insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step ‚Äî the Sejm passed, and the Senate approved the law on fugitives from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free aid for medicines to Ukrainians.
You just need to write an SMS, get a code on the phone.
And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, get free medicine in Poland.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age.
Various funds are common, including Caritas, Red Cross, which give packages of food, chemistry, clothing.
As the Poles say: ‚ÄúNiespotykana skala‚Äù.
That is, ‚Äúan event that has no analogues.‚Äù
Such a huge openness.
For the Polish state, this is a huge expenditure.
The European Union has not yet allocated a single euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
Language problem.
Questions start from polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot give advice without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems, diseases.
The second problem is schools, where students of especially high school students also do not give themselves advice at all at all at all at all, cannot understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children not only have a good command of English, but in general their level is higher than the class in which they fall.
This is also interesting.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine, here it is much more difficult to master this work.
As a lawyer or accountant, I do not know of such cases at all.
Doctors now appear in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on legal grounds.
A language problem is often the reason that prompts families, after a few weeks of being here, to go back home.
There are a lot of such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are returning.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military actions.
Here they did not get used to it, did not find work.
Where they live, conditions do not meet their needs and accordingly they will be more comfortable returning home.
This is also one of these problems that has occurred in recent weeks.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed
According to the Ambassador of Ukraine, significant changes have occurred in the Czech Republic.
If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians defending their country.
How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?
There is a similar situation in Poland.
Here, all television channels often cite the statement of the President of Poland Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolensk.
When there were events of Russia's attack on Georgia, along with President Yushchenko and other state leaders, he was in Tbilisi.
There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression certainly will not stop in Georgia, and then maybe Ukraine.
Then there can be the Baltic countries, it can reach Poland.
That is, if he had foreseen it.
In fact, Ukrainians now defend Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.
Poland and Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly.
The threat is seen in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that war may also knock on our door.
Therefore, the attitude has changed to the positive.
The Ukrainian flag, the Ukrainian anthem now in Poland is not a ‚Äúsong of nationalists‚Äù or any enemies.
Of course, there are small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they are in every country.
But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.
The claim about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians constantly insist that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
This in Poland is perceived simply with laughter, because these so-called ‚Äúnationalists‚Äù turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political subtexts.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those segments of society that still doubted some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives as it is now in Ukraine.
They constantly talk about people from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously considering their own security.
Russia is afraid that it will hit with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How is Poland's government and society reacting?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.
The military contingent increased.
Now in Poland there is an additional recruitment of territorial defense troops.
That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
It is tangible for citizens that the state is preparing for such events.
Among this, a new law on the defense of the fatherland was recently adopted, where the budget has been significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.
The requirements for recruitment of military personnel have been changed, many points that are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert in the analytics of the future.
Your predictions have become a reality in Syria, you warned of an attack by Russia.
What can you say from the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for a nuclear strike, I don't believe much.
But there is such a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well.
It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.
Note, I would not want this, but this is the worst case scenario.
A blow of low power, but so that all television channels show this ‚Äúfungus‚Äù.
To be seen from Poland, the Baltic States.
In this case, the Russians expect that there will be an escape and loss of combat capability of NATO troops.
Positive scenarios are related to the exhaustion of the physical and financial Russian troops, the problems of Putin's entourage, the oligarchs who are currently suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.
We have facts of the fire of hydroelectric power station on Sakhalin, certain evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.
Such problems of a regional nature will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.
We also have tendencies of peaceful settlement of war.
Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.
This will last as much as possible until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas
The Czech Republic is discussing a possible termination of gas supply.
This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How did this affect Polish citizens?
Since I am an analyst, I predicted that.
I just turned off the gas in my house beforehand.
My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will experience rising prices.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely prices for all resources will begin to rise up.
Different avenues to certain alternative sources are now being sought.
In addition, we already have several companies that carry liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland.
As for oil, we have a bright factor that the Prime Minister of Hungary is actually cooperating with Putin.
Now there will be a purchase of gas stations in Poland, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe abandoned Russian energy, it would be the loss of Russia's source of funding for its troops.
Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish Media
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to Polish media.
What does the Polish media say about it?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has greatly increased.
And this growth is estimated as unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in the city, which is in the zone of military operations.
That is, the president's actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.
They show that the Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused to receive military and financial assistance in order to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.
This is not heard here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.
It does not fade or fall.
This is the most important thing, that is, there is no image loss.
In fact, the image of Ukraine holds, and this is very important.
Good morning.
Sorry to bother with my problems again.
I am very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you.
Yesterday they tried to come to something, but the attempt was in vain.
The mother-in-law's girlfriend who helped find this apartment joined the conflict.
She said that she was not looking for her for us, and if something does not suit us, it is we who must leave and she will make it so that it is the mother-in-law, and not us, who stays here to live.
Unfortunately, none of them think for a child who is used to this place, considers it their home, and in 3 months there are already 6 houses in the change.
I am very sorry, I could not even guess that such a situation would happen
Once again, I'm sorry for giving you trouble.
And in relation to the bed, the situation looks strange.
We discussed this issue with my husband before I wrote to you that the bed is not needed.
He was coming here to see me and to the baby and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law herself decided that he would sleep with her in the room and she wanted to spit on his opinion and desires.
I am very ashamed in front of you, your husband, Sharka and Jan, the landlady.
You tried so hard for us
Understood.
I thought it was going on for a long time.
Do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andrew's treatment, to do it at least until the end of summer?
Perhaps you need a certificate for Andrew that he is sick.
In Ukraine, a disability would be prescribed with such a diagnosis..
And since Inna does not go to kindergarten yet, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the home
I understand, then it would be good to go tomorrow with you.
I will make a barcode for myself and Andrew
I am worried that they will stop giving humanitarian aid to him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a lot of time.
Can you advise anything?
I also wanted to ask, did you get money for the medicines you bought for Andriy?
The handle mount falls out.
It is short, so you need to be very careful not to lose it.
Only 2 servings were sold today.
The apricot is over.
I poured the mango.
Mango does not go very well.
Most wanted apricots.
Now they take more vanilla, because they do not like mangoes.
Norm, gone mango.
But it started to creak again üò≠
Actively began to take ice cream and it can not cope üò≠
Tomorrow there will be black currant
Today, the mango will definitely end, and the black stench
I'm all shaken üò≠
He freezes again, creaks.
Hadnes on 4.0.
As soon as people actively take, he does not let ice cream out at all.
üò≠üò≠üò≠
Just the turn becomes for ice cream, it begins to give out such nuances and people go further.
It freezes.
If one ice cream is not there, it will creak and rub the piston.
And vanilla in mango can not be poured.
Magdalena can come tomorrow at 8.00?
It is necessary to wash the ice cream.
Today the ice cream is over and tomorrow it has a different taste.

Leonid Kravchuk first president of independent Ukraine
I believe that there was a dictatorship because people just left Russia and still could not really understand they like to be an independent country or they want to be an autonomous Republic of Russia
when there was an independent Ukraine there was already Kiev, but still in the Soviet Union there was the city of Kharkov from 1912 to 1934
I can not say that there were any other interesting events, but if at first there was democracy it was much better and surely now we were in the European Union
