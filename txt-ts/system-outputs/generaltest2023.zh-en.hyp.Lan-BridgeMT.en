4.1 Overview
The characters included in this document are encoded in single-byte, double-byte or four-byte.
The single-byte part includes all 128 characters from 0x00 to 0x7F in GB/T 11383-1989.
4.3 Double-byte part
The double-byte part includes all graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, CJK Unified Ideographs in GB/T 13000 and some graphic characters.
The characters in the double-byte part are according to Appendix A.
The graphics, code positions and functions of ideographic description characters should comply with Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 unifies the encoding of Chinese characters used in China, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and other countries and regions.
Chinese characters with unique abstract glyphs are assigned separate code positions; Chinese characters with the same abstract glyphs from different sources are assigned shared code positions.
Encoded Chinese characters are called CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-byte part
The four-byte part includes 66 CJK Unified Ideographs in GB/T 13000 that are not included in the above-mentioned double-byte characters (9FA6-9FEF, excluding 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB), CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension E, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F and characters of minority languages that have been encoded in GB/Work 13000.

5 Overall structure
In the main text, numbers prefixed with 0x are in hexadecimal, and those without 0x are in decimal.
In the appendix, all encodings are in hexadecimal, and all other numbers are in decimal.
The single-byte part uses the encoding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using the code positions 0x00~0x7F.
The double-byte part uses two eight-bit binary bit strings to represent a character, with the first byte code positions from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the second byte code positions are 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte part uses the unused 0x30 to 0x39 in GB/Work 11383-1989 as the suffix for expanding the double-byte encoding, with the encoding range from 0x81308130 to 0xFE39FE39.
The encoding range of the first byte of the four-byte character is 0x81 to 0xFE; the second byte is 0x30 to 0x39; the third byte is 0x81 to 0xFE; the fourth byte is 0x30 to 0x39. That is: 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; 0x81318230 to 0x81318239 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.

DESCRIPTION: C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, Hii (compilation), (assembly) MERE (linking).
The suffix of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default settings:
gcc considers preprocessed files (.i) to be c files and sets c-style links,
g++ considers preprocessed files (.i) to be c++ files and sets c++ style links.
The suffix of the source file indicates the type of language and subsequent operations:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i Preprocessed c file; compilation, assembly
.ii Preprocessed c++ file; compilation, assembly
.s Assembly language source program; assembly
Assembly language source program; preprocessing, assembly
.h Preprocessor file; usually does not appear on the command line. Other suffix files are passed to the linker. Usually includes:
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), linking is always the last step.
During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, unrecognizable file names (including specified .o H tag files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order of the command line.
Options must be given separately: de ' is completely different from `-d -r '.
Most ` -=E : and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno- name).
Only non-default option formats are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly specify the language of the following input file as language (instead of the default selection obtained from the file name suffix).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option is encountered. The optional language
Turn off any explicit explanation of the language, so process the files after the file name suffix based on RE AS E `-x' option).
If you only operate part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking), you can use the `-x' option (or file name suffix Ah) to tell geo where to start, and use the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note that some option combinations (such as `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces the source file name suffix with `.o' and `.ec' tag file name. You can use the -o option to choose another name. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option -S F What's the matter.
The target file is ready.
Stop after compilation, do not assemble.
Use pipes instead of temporary files between different stages of the compilation process, because those system assemblers cannot read data from pipes, GNU assemblers do not have this problem, assemblers can accept C "dialect": support ANSI standard C programs.
This will turn off some features in GNU Cc that are not compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as keywords such as unix and vax that indicate rare use of ANSI trigraph features, and despite the use of (note: all standard libraries are available in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, typical examples are almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding freestanding environment does not have standard libraries, the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website)
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', handle it in C style --- that is, do not specify the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameters are empty.
The section list is deleted from here in an attempt to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual, we have deleted the details, so when the content is outdated, people will not HERI.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the `-traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing assignment to this.
He and the `-Ethis-is-variable' option have the same effect.
-traditional-cpp tries to support some aspects of traditional Cc preprocessor.
Especially the content mentioned above about the preprocessor, but does not include other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of `$' characters in identifiers (only for C++).
You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of `$' symbols.
(GNU C++ allows `$' symbols by default on some target systems, but not all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from ant type to enumeration type (only for c++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code for template declarations (only for c++), by generating only one copy at the place where they are defined for each template function.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files using templates.
When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instances are of external type. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved through typedef, which refers to each required instance.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-external-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions (except constructors and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; in this case, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to be of different types.
The value of such an expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows assignment to this (only for c++).
After merging the user-defined free storage management mechanism into c++, the assignable `this' seems outdated.
Therefore, by default, assigning to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation valid through the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, like unsigned char.
Various machines have their own default char types. It could be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned char when depending on the sign of the data.
But many programs have been written to use just char, and they expect it to be a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine for writing the program).
This option, and its opposite, make such programs work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If no `signed' or "unsigned' modifier is explicitly declared, these options are used to define signed bitfields or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bitfields are signed, because they inherit from basic integer types, such as int, which are signed. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in the writable data segment, without special treatment.
This is for compatibility with some old programs, they think changing string constants is a very bad idea, the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The Impact of COVID-19 on the Drug Market
Its impact may be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, this disease has overwhelmed healthcare services, bringing them to the brink of collapse, and the restrictive measures implemented by governments have caused serious disruption in the global economy.
The impact of this pandemic on the drug market is still unclear and difficult to predict, but it could be profound.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit the acquisition of precursors and basic chemicals.
Traffickers, unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.
The changes brought about by COVID-19 are unprecedented, but some lessons can still be learned from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances, and the pattern of use shifted towards injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments around the world cut budgets related to drugs.
If governments respond to the current economic recession in the same way, interventions to prevent drug use and related risky behaviors, as well as drug treatment services, may take a heavy hit.
In addition, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may decrease, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Some countries have a large amount of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and these countries are expected to be most directly affected by drug trafficking activities.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger transport almost everywhere, activities supplying drugs through commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, trafficking activities using the dark web and cargo mail may increase.
In the long run, economic recession and related lockdown measures may disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment rates and lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable are more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug-related diseases, and turn to illegal activities related to drugs - whether production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation, provide services to vulnerable populations, and recruit new members to strengthen their ranks.
As government response capabilities decrease, these changes may quickly take root and become the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market Growth
Population growth patterns partly explain market expansion
Drug use is increasing worldwide, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of the world's population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, it was estimated that there were 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
Over the past twenty years, the growth rate of drug use in developing countries has far outpaced that in developed countries.
This to some extent reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Teenagers and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries grew by 16%, while in developed countries it decreased by 10%.
Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug market
Whether in developed or developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.
Part of the reason for the overall increase in drug use is the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas - currently more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where the trend towards urbanization is more pronounced.
Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest. Globally, drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs like cocaine are more firmly linked to wealthier regions of the world.
Similarly, within countries, drug prevalence rates are higher among the affluent social classes.
However, those with lower socioeconomic status have a higher rate of transition to drug-related diseases.
Data from a few countries suggest that harmful drug use patterns and diseases are associated with low income.
These patterns seem less common in wealthier social classes.
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have always been associated with an increase in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide to lose their jobs.
COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of the drug market. The pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illegal crop cultivation, either because of reduced control by national authorities or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of economic crisis.
The COVID-19 related restrictions have led to a reduction in air and land transport, and sea trafficking may have increased as a result, with lower interception risks at sea and larger quantities than air or land smuggling.
There have been recent reports of cocaine shipments being sent directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity Enhanced
The occurrence of non-internationally controlled substances is stable, but new types of potentially harmful opiates are increasing, making the drug market increasingly complex.
In addition to plant substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.
Member countries have about 500 new active substances on their domestic markets each year.
Most of them are currently stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opiates.
Although the total number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
In the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, new psychoactive opiates accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this number had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive opiates are fentanyl analogs, whose efficacy and harm have been proven, causing overdose deaths in North America and other regions, but to a lesser extent.
In North America, some fentanyl is used as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and some is used to manufacture counterfeit medicinal opiates.
Some evidence suggests that there is also a phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive substance stimulants in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce stimulant effects.
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched in vulnerable groups
A single type of new psychoactive substance has almost never formed a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
22 countries have reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most countries identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals forces drug manufacturers to innovate. Many chemicals used as precursors to synthesize amphetamines, methamphetamines, and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers are always looking for alternatives, not only substances with looser controls, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade control, the so-called "specially designed precursors".
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: according to reports, in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia prompted a rise in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation seems to have changed from 2008 to 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by the Russian Federation authorities has dropped by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opiate use has significantly decreased.
But the stimulant market seems to be thriving.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methoxymethcathinone and a-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now ubiquitous in the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities report that the number of secret processing points for the production of various illegal drugs has surged, more than doubling in two years, increasing to 152 processing points in 2018.
Methamphetamine market growth in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison, and other institutional staff had already revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to "phenethylamine" and tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that cannabis was harder to obtain than "phenethylamine" or methamphetamine.
Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered multiple methamphetamine processing points, and the Bureau of Narcotics has expressed concern about the large imports of pseudoephedrine preparations - methamphetamine processing points use these preparations as precursors.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production seems to have started in 2014.
Since then, the amount of methamphetamine seized has been steadily increasing.
But the amount seized in the first half of 2019 - 657 kilograms - was a sharp increase compared to the previous year.
Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan in other countries also indicate that the country's production is rapidly increasing.
Policy Changes and Trends
Most jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis is legalized have seen an increase in cannabis use.
Canada, Uruguay, and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions where non-medical use of cannabis has not been legalized.
In Colorado and Washington, the first two states in the United States to pass legislation, adult non-medical use of cannabis has increased, especially in the past month and daily or almost daily use, which has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that since 2011, cannabis use in Uruguay has increased, with last month's use almost doubling.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is frequent and regular use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also shows that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is the reason behind the global plunge in cannabis seizures the legalization of cannabis?
In 2018, global cannabis seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, due to a 84% decrease in North America over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world during the same period almost doubled. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of new psychoactive substances seems to have a deterrent effect, but it is still difficult to assess the effectiveness of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances.
Countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use.
In some other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased after domestic legislation.
Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets. Opioids for pain management and palliative care are mainly provided in high-income countries, with uneven distribution across regions.
In 2018, over 90% of all medically available opioids were in high-income countries.
About 50% in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low- and middle-income countries accounts for 88% of the global population, but consumes less than 10% of medically available opioids.
Barriers to accessing opioids for medical use are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of drug addiction. In 2018, about 35.6 million people had drug addiction.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by research in high-income countries, where individuals' adverse socioeconomic trajectories - not just their status at a given point in time - are associated with the risk of drug addiction.
Drug addiction can also exacerbate socioeconomic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be related to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, diverse sexual orientation groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug addiction, or encounter problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the loss of healthy life years due to disability and premature death, the harmful effects of drug use on a wider social impact have increased over the past 10 years.
From 2007 to 2018, the global Disability Adjusted Life Years attributed to drug use increased by 17%.
The increase in Disability Adjusted Life Years associated with liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, was particularly high - up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited global data suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
However, in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs.
Although drug use can lead to crime, in some cases, this link can be partly attributed to various mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is already a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, can potentially be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the presence and degree of violence depend less on the amount of trafficking than on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.
Latest Trends
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, with opioids posing the greatest harm.
It is estimated that in 2018, 192 million people used marijuana, making it the most widely used drug globally.
In contrast, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the associated harms of opioid drugs are often overlooked due to fewer users.
Of the estimated 167,000 drug-related deaths in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug use, 50% were caused by these substances.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Tramadol; in North America, it is Fentanyl. These two regions have little in common in terms of economy, demographic data, or general drug use patterns, but both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada has also reported similar results, albeit with lower numbers.
Part of the reason for fentanyl-related overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of Tramadol has seen significant growth.
In this region, there are an increasing number of patients with Tramadol use disorders receiving treatment.
In 2017, the global seizure of Tramadol significantly increased, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.
However, in 2018, after India passed a new law to regulate Tramadol, the global seizure volume dropped to 32 tons.
The crises in these two places are driven by simple manufacturing and low production costs, as well as a lack of international regulation for Tramadol and many fentanyl-like substances or their precursors.
The crises in these two places are exacerbated by the fact that these substances are supplied in both the legal and illegal markets, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.
Stimulant use is on the rise
The stimulant field is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are seeing increased use in their main markets.
In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, about 27 million people used amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, and sometimes both increase and decrease to meet the same market demand.
COVID-19 increases the risk for injecting drug users
It is estimated that in 2018, about 11.3 million people injected drugs, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.
Over 1 million injecting drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million have hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug use, half of whom died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most injecting drug users with hepatitis C have not yet been treated.
The shortage of opioids caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to substitute with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injecting or inject more frequently, more harmful methods of use may emerge.

EU Summit Argues Over Refugee Policy, EU Official: Bottlenecks at Every Step of the Reception Process - China News Network
EU Summit endlessly argues over refugee policy, EU official: there are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process
[Global Times special correspondent in Belgium, Niu Ruifei] According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit that day, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, stated that EU leaders agreed to implement stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The report said that this move by the EU is a response to the growing concern about the problem of illegal immigration in Europe. Now, the core issue for the EU is that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported.
According to summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize a large amount of EU funds" to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and its member states are endlessly arguing over issues such as the payment of fence costs.
Von der Leyen repeatedly stated that EU funds will not pay for related costs.
But some member states' diplomats said that if the EU could share part of the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
The European Euractiv website stated that EU officials admit that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process. Limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries. The EU's refugee reception system is in a near "permanent crisis".
According to estimates by the European Commission, the EU's Schengen countries received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.
At the same time, the EU recorded over 330,000 illegal entries last year.
Against this backdrop, the summit also reached an agreement on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants based on the court decision of another member state.
In addition, the report said that EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of safe countries", which will pave the way for the EU to formulate a common list.

"US Escalates 'Chip War', Severely Damaging Global Semiconductor Industry - China News Network
Recently, the US has shown signs of escalating its "chip war" against China - first, under pressure from the US, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then, foreign media reported that the US government is considering severing all ties between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order restricting US investment in sensitive Chinese tech industries... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US has been relentless in its efforts to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the US has never ceased its efforts to suppress China's "core" development, precisely suppressing the supply chain of China's semiconductor industry on one hand, and building a "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain alliance on the other, aiming to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it's wooing South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or establishing a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, China, or establishing a semiconductor industry chain "small circle" through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework", the US is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the US by introducing politicized, camp-based, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, thereby making up for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintaining its advantageous position in the global chip industry.
However, the US's high-profile "core tactics" against China are also "hurting the enemy a thousand, self-harming eight hundred".
Recently, the well-known US chip manufacturing equipment supplier Panlin Group announced that due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography machine giant, ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.
According to US media analysis, after the US government brutally suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have been deeply affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves, etc.
The so-called US suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has long been formed.
According to professional estimates, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross national borders more than 70 times, reaching 100 days in total.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially advanced process technology, and heavily relies on East Asia.
Even if the US strongly guides the advanced chip supply chain towards regional development dominated by the US "small circle", the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are hard to change.
The US's strong "reshaping" of the "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain has severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of all countries in the world.
In recent years, the US has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introduced the "Innovation and Competition Act", the "2022 US Competition Act", and the "Chip and Science Act", using technological hegemony to consolidate its own technological leading advantage; it has "carrot and stick" approach towards allies, enticing chip manufacturing companies such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the US, striving to ensure the US's global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the US has indeed caused trouble for China's chip industry and related industrial development, reaping real benefits.
But in the long run, the US's hysterical suppression has forced China's chip industry to continuously break through, causing it to lose the huge Chinese market, and will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and innovation ability of US tech companies, damaging the development of the global chip industry.

First Batch of Personal Pension Wealth Management Products on Sale, Minimum Holding Period Can Be Only 360 Days - China News Network
First batch of personal pension wealth management products on sale
Seven products from home institutions are available, with the shortest holding period being only 360 days
Personal pension wealth management products are finally online.
On February 10, China Wealth Management Network released the first batch of personal pension wealth management products, and seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, ABC Wealth Management, and China Post Wealth Management officially went on sale.
So far, the "shelf" of personal pension accounts has finally gathered four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
It is reported that the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all public net value open-ended products, including 5 new products and 2 existing products. Except for one mixed product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income products.
Beijing Youth Daily reporters saw that among the 5 new products, 4 are from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which are fixed income products, with the shortest holding periods of 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, respectively. The corresponding performance comparison benchmarks (annualized) are 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, 5.25% - 5.75%.
The remaining new product is "Postal Bank Wealth Addition·Hongjin with a minimum holding period of 1095 days No. 1", which is also a fixed income product, started fundraising on February 10, and ended fundraising on February 19, with a risk level of two.
Among the two existing products, one is ABC Wealth Management's "ABC Tongxin·Lingdong" 360-day technology innovation RMB wealth management product, which is of mixed nature and has a risk level of three.
The other existing product is "Postal Bank Wealth Addition·Hongjin with a minimum holding period of 365 days No. 1", a fixed income type, which started fundraising on December 30 last year, officially operated on January 4 this year, and the accumulated net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the State Council Office on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions", the funds in personal pension fund accounts can invest in financial products including bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and public funds.
The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the CBIRC formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
The "Measures" stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products and other personal pension products through personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice, clarifying that the personal pension system was implemented in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Shijiazhuang, Xiong'an New Area, Shanxi Jincheng and other 36 pilot cities and regions.
By the end of 2022, the number of participants in personal pensions was 19.54 million, the number of payers was 6.13 million, and the total payment amount was 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only launched three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public funds.
Now, after the personal pension wealth management products are gathered, how should investors choose?
Experts from BOCOM Wealth Management Product Development Department said that compared with other personal pension products, the pilot stage pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products have three characteristics.
The first is stability, with a more robust risk management mechanism, more stable investment strategies and concepts, and the implementation of independent custody by non-parent third parties.
The second is long-term, the term of the pension wealth management products in the pilot stage is all 5 years and above, the next step is to issue personal pension wealth management products, the shortest holding period is in principle 1 year, encouraging holding for more than 3 years.
The third is inclusiveness, the product purchase threshold is low, the starting point is generally 1 yuan, some are as low as 0.01 yuan, and the rates of custody fees, management fees and other fees are more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long term, high interest rate, and high safety, and are suitable for people with weak risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risk and can accept stable returns; while personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not guarantee principal or income, have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are higher, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

Fitness Industry Should Overcome Trust Crisis - China News Network
Another large gym "explodes"?
Recently, the issue of member rights protection in Zhongjian Fitness, a well-known fitness organization, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the organization's bankruptcy and absconding caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the organization responded, promising to strive to protect the legal rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was calmed.
Some fitness organizations have operational problems in some of their stores, temporarily closed, consumers could have calmly waited for the problem to be solved, why was the first reaction of many members "something is wrong"?
Behind the storm of fitness club member rights protection is the deep-seated issue of industry trust crisis.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepayment model, and "earning money from users who don't come" is the underlying logic of their development.
By pre-selling membership cards to obtain cash flow, constantly opening new stores, it seems to be able to cycle, but in fact, it is robbing Peter to pay Paul, unable to form a stable profit model.
Negative industry information such as gym absconding is frequently reported, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the market perspective, gyms are certainly a good business with "money prospects".
Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always attracted capital attention.
Multiple data show that the heat in areas such as cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, and the market continues to recover.
Specific to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the deepening of the concept of healthy living, there is much to be done in the development of the fitness industry.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some organizations are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, just out of the crisis, and blow the horn of opening up new territories, and invest all the financing funds in the construction of new stores.
Admittedly, affected by the epidemic in recent years, many organizations have withdrawn, the industry has reshuffled, and powerful companies choose to increase their acquisition efforts and re-layout selectively, which is not a new opportunity.
However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a stable and long-term path, the industry must change the traditional model and change the business strategy.
Only by being steady and steady, and re-establishing consumer trust and security, can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared with building new stores to seize the market, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to calm down and optimize services, and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, we must rely on services to retain users.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to "user orientation", to focus on user needs, and to focus on service quality upgrade.
Secondly, we must rely on digital transformation to enhance user experience.
For example, the currently popular Internet gym model, which allows users to pay per use and choose their own venue.
At the same time, body data and exercise data can be effectively used, and social needs can also be met, achieving a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without personal trainer sales, no huge annual cards, users' worries about fitness organizations "running away" have been reduced, and trust has also increased.
In addition, we must actively explore diversified formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from single service to scene consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entrance for consumption. Sports supplements and fitness equipment needed for fitness and other peripheral products may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

"Price Difference Compensation" Reappears in Nanjing Real Estate Market - China News Network
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangzi Evening News/Zi Niu News reporter discovered in an interview on the 10th that the "price guarantee agreement" that has not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing real estate market. A real estate project located in the Jiangbei New District claims "price difference compensation". If the discounts of other properties before the delivery are greater than the previous discounts, the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
There are not a few conditions for the "price guarantee agreement"
This real estate project located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. Mr. Sun, a house viewer, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the real estate project last weekend.
The picture he sent to the reporter shows that the developer of the project promises that for those who purchase properties between February 1 and February 28, from the date of signing the purchase and sale contract to the delivery of the corresponding property, if the discount of other properties in the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous purchase (limited to other unsold commercial properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type), the developer can change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun said that the property consultant said that this is actually a "price guarantee agreement", the purpose is to let buyers feel at ease, not to worry about the developer's price reduction promotion, "Now I'm afraid that it will reduce the price after I buy it, I don't have time to make a fuss at the sales office, and it's really upsetting if I don't make a fuss."
Many homebuyers believe that although the "price guarantee agreement" is to give homebuyers a "reassurance pill", the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a just-needed house in Jiangbei, said that the price-guaranteed properties must first be of the same type, and must be in the same building and the same unit. The properties that buyers can compare are few, so the "threshold" is quite high.
Some homebuyers believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that additional concessions will be given during sales, and it is not easy for buyers to "defend their rights".
Whether to retain homebuyers remains to be seen
The reporter learned from Nanjing Online Real Estate that the project received sales permits for a total of 252 units in two buildings in November last year. The unit areas are 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average price of full decoration sales permits is 39843 yuan/square meter.
However, more than two months have passed, and the online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the project is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%. Among them, there are 128 units in Building 8, and the number of unsold units is 113. There are also 44 unsold units out of 124 in Building 7. The total number of transactions in the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.
Market insiders introduced that the "price guarantee agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate project on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched a "price guarantee plan" to attract homebuyers. The specific content was "The company solemnly promises that if the discount of the project expands within one year, the company will refund the difference to the old owners."
Subsequently, in April 2011, nine real estate projects in Nanjing also promised "price difference compensation" for some properties.
"The real estate market is warming up, and it needs a 'cardiotonic' at this time.
"Mr. Shen, a senior operator in the Nanjing real estate industry, said that the "price guarantee agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate companies.
He believes that developers need more confidence than homebuyers today, and the launch of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually to boost their morale.
As for whether it can retain homebuyers, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds. It remains to be seen at present.
Multiple Data Decline, Taiwan's Economy Starts the Year Poorly - China News Network
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11th (Reporters Zhao Bo, Huang Yang) With "five consecutive months of decline" in export trade volume, the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for the manufacturing industry has been contracting for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has seen a "3" again... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts analyze that Taiwan's economic performance at the beginning of the year is not good, and the pressure to grow is not small.
According to the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's exports in January this year were 31.51 billion US dollars, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, and a negative growth for the fifth consecutive month.
The export volume of the 11 main export categories all declined compared to the same period last year.
Plastics, rubber and their products, and optical equipment had the deepest declines, with year-on-year decreases of 37.6% and 35.7% respectively.
Exports of electronic components decreased by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decrease in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits decreased by 18.3% year-on-year, the largest decline in 14 years.
Cai Meina, the head of the department's statistics department, said that this shows that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry is spreading, and the electronics industry is entering a correction period.
Statistics show that in January, Taiwan's imports and exports both fell, and the surplus was only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that the global terminal demand is decreasing, the industry adjusts inventory to suppress the willingness of manufacturers to purchase materials, and the export slump is difficult to improve in the short term, and Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year may be higher than expected.
According to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for Taiwan's manufacturing industry in January this year was 40.4% after seasonal adjustment, a decrease of 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and a contraction for seven consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, the PMI takes 50% as the line of prosperity and decline. An index greater than 50% represents economic expansion, and vice versa is contraction.
In the five components of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and employment contracted, supplier delivery times fell, and inventory contracted.
All six major industries reported PMI contraction, with the industries ranked by contraction speed being the power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), the electronics and optics industry (35.2%), the chemical and biotech medical industry (39.2%), the basic raw materials industry (42.4%), the transportation tools industry (42.6%) and the food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Taiwan authorities' "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics" announced that the annual growth rate of Taiwan's CPI in January this year was 3.04%, breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, a new high in 17 months.
Cao Zhihong, a special member of the Taiwan "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics", admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was indeed beyond expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI for January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year. Inflation pressure still exists and is still at a high point.
Looking at Taiwan's economy this year, according to reports from domestic media such as the "United Daily News" and "Yahoo Finance", experts are pessimistic.
Wu Dare, a professor of economics at Taiwan's "Central University", analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies, and the risk of debt default is rising.
At the same time, the reduction in orders leads to manufacturers reducing labor costs, affecting the labor market and family economy, and in turn impacting consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that this year's inflation situation in Europe and America has not been resolved, demand continues to shrink, and it is estimated that Taiwan's export decline will continue into the first half of the year.
Because Taiwan's economy relies on exports, it will be affected by the sluggish exports, and the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.
"An Important Engine for Global Recovery" - China News Network
"In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development."
Julio Rios, a well-known Chinese affairs expert in Spain and honorary advisor to the China Policy Watch Network, said in a recent interview with our reporter that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has calmly responded with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is steadfastly expanding its openness to the outside world, the endogenous power of economic development is constantly strengthening, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are developing in coordination.
Every year, the two sessions of the National People's Congress of China are held, where representatives and members discuss the major plans for national development and hot issues of people's livelihood, widely gathering consensus, rallying people's hearts, and gathering wisdom, adding strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and has now entered a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions, and looks forward to China's development bringing new opportunities to the world.
" Rios said that China is currently promoting technological innovation with all its strength, injecting new impetus into economic and social development, "Investment in funds, talent cultivation, policy incentives, this makes China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan".
In Rios' view, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China has both played the strengths of the market economy and the advantages of the socialist system, taking proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic base point of expanding domestic demand, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting private, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing development, insisting on innovative development, promoting employment, improving the income and living standards of the Chinese people, satisfying the people's multi-level and diversified consumption needs... China fully, accurately, and comprehensively implements the new development concept, strives to promote high-quality development, builds a new development pattern, and will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal of the "Belt and Road" initiative.
"Stabilizing and recovering the economy after the epidemic is a common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
" Rios said, looking forward to the continued role of the "Belt and Road" cooperation in improving the infrastructure level of various countries and strengthening interconnectivity in various fields, and continuing to release greater potential.

Henan Province standardizes and integrates the price of oral implant medical services - China News Network
CCTV News: Dental implants are the ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the price of tens of thousands per tooth has always deterred many patients.
Since this year, with the accelerated implementation of centralized procurement of dental implants, various places have also put the price reduction of dental implants on the agenda.
Starting from February 10, the full-process price control target for a single conventional dental implant medical service in Henan Province is 4300 yuan, and the full-process cost of a single conventional implant is not higher than 97% of the price control target.
Dental implants refer to a method of repairing missing teeth based on the lower structure implanted in the bone tissue to support and fix the upper dental prosthesis.
Reporters learned from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University that, taking a single conventional implant as an example, the price from implantation to final repair is about 16,000 to 17,000 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that in my case, it would be about 8,000 yuan, less than 10,000 yuan, basically saving half.
On the basis of the current project, Henan Province has also integrated and determined 15 oral implant medical service price items such as "implant implantation fee (single)", and uniformly formulated the price and medical insurance payment category of provincial public medical institutions, and cancelled or adjusted 20 medical service price items such as dental implant surgery.
Li Yunjie, Director of the Medical Price and Tendering and Procurement Department of Zhengzhou Medical Security Bureau: The main beneficiaries are four parties, one is medical insurance, which reduces the expenditure of medical insurance; the hospital's occupancy is reduced, and patients will increase appropriately; for suppliers, they have gained a market; for our patients, they are the biggest beneficiaries, the cost of implanting a tooth may be halved or even more.

"New Variables" Emerge in China's E-commerce Industry, How to Achieve "Content is King" in Sales?
-China News Network
China News Network, February 11th, headline: "New Variables" Emerge in China's E-commerce Industry, How to Achieve "Content is King" in Sales?
China News Finance Reporter Xia Bin
"We entered the e-commerce industry late, but from the very beginning, we realized that to stand out from the thousands of shops, content is very important.
" said Fangfang, a "post-90s" girl from Guangdong, who now operates a nourishing food ingredient shop on Douyin, making a 30-year-old offline shop "bloom" online.
Imitating the tone of old Hong Kong films and pairing it with classic Cantonese songs, opening @Fangfang's Douyin account, the exquisite videos are refreshing.
At the recent Douyin E-commerce "Finding Companions·Quality Content Sharing Session", Fangfang, as a representative of quality creators, spoke at the event, sharing her daily creative experiences and insights.
She said at the scene: "The carefully polished videos have attracted a lot of attention from netizens. Many people are interested in the ingredients in my shop and want to cook with them, which has opened up the sales channel.
"
Fangfang has made more people fall in love with the "old Cantonese taste" through her soup-making videos. In one live broadcast, she sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing food ingredients, saving her family's nearly bankrupt old shop.
"No content, no e-commerce," as short videos and live-streaming e-commerce continue to develop, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early stages of live-streaming sales, live-streaming rooms often attracted users with low-price discounts, and price advantages seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, both phenomenon-level influencers like Liu Genghong and Dongfang Selection, and many experts and merchants unknown to the public in vertical niche fields, have continuously created high-quality content that fits their brand tone, enhancing long-term operational benefits.
Gao Yaxuan, the person in charge of Douyin E-commerce's star author operations, said that in the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Douyin E-commerce, their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and their total transaction volume has also doubled.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving and vigorous author ecosystem.
" Gao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecology Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of the "new variable" - high-quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data dimension, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the e-commerce industry content ecology health index ranking in the aforementioned report, Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com are in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, which integrates e-commerce and content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (Professionally Generated Content) and UGC (User Generated Content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the scenarios for consumption and promotion, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, the stronger the commercial value, and the higher the proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption in the public and private sectors.
At the scene, Yu Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, analyzed and interpreted the report.
He stated that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumption accessibility" to the "consumption quality" stage, and high-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and focus of the new stage of e-commerce development, and paid knowledge, professional knowledge, KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC content have become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecology from the perspective of content structure improvement, to create positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve a dynamic balance with the health system index of the e-commerce content ecology.
The other is to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment from the perspective of the external ecology.
"The future e-commerce industry still needs more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to form predictions for future development stability; in addition, to provide merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, to achieve value synergy and co-creation of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and to create a healthy content ecology.

Xinhua News Agency commentator
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project, which requires overall planning, systematic planning, and overall advancement, and correctly handles a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, adhering to the correct path and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up to the outside world.
"At the opening ceremony of the seminar for the new members of the Central Committee, alternate members and provincial and ministerial leaders to study and implement Xi Jinping's new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the spirit of the 20th Party Congress, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, deeply and systematically clarified a series of major relationships that need to be handled well in practice, and provided us with a scientific methodology for vigorously promoting Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization, and relates to party governance, national governance, military governance, domestic and foreign affairs, and defense. It requires both systematic planning and the courage to reform and innovate, and continuously achieve overall advancement.
Top-level design requires a deep insight into the world's development trends, an accurate grasp of the common aspirations of the people, a deep exploration of the laws of economic and social development, so that the formulated plans and policy systems reflect the characteristics of the times, grasp the regularity, and are full of creativity, achieving a combination of long-term and short-term, top-down and bottom-up, and coordinated content.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory endeavor, and there are still many unknown areas. We need to boldly explore in practice, promote the development of the cause through reform and innovation, and we must not stick to the old ways and wait for opportunities.
The strategic issue is a fundamental issue for a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we need to enhance the foresight of the strategy, scientifically foresee the future and lead the future with the strategy; we need to enhance the overall nature of the strategy, focusing on solving major issues that affect the rise and fall of the party and the country's cause; we need to enhance the stability of the strategy, once the strategy is formed, we must persist in the long term, grasp it to the end, and do a good job.
We must scientifically grasp the dialectical unity of strategy and tactics, organically combine the principled nature of strategy and the flexibility of tactics, be flexible and adaptable, make decisions on the spot, and grasp the strategic initiative in adapting to local conditions and taking advantage of the situation.
The Chinese nation is a nation that adheres to the correct path and innovates.

(Voice of Germany Chinese Network) The Biden administration will blacklist six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in a spy balloon program this Friday (February 10).
The U.S. Department of Commerce stated that these five Chinese companies and one research institution are aiding the modernization of the Chinese military, especially in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist will find it difficult to obtain U.S. technology exports.
The list is known as the "Entity List", and companies on it will not be able to purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group's 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House indicated that it was considering taking broader measures to "expose and deal with" larger-scale surveillance activities threatening U.S. national security by China.
The balloon incident has further escalated tensions between China and the U.S., and U.S. Secretary of State Blinken has cancelled his trip to China.
On February 4, the U.S. shot down a balloon, and the Chinese government lodged a serious protest with the U.S. embassy in China, criticizing the U.S. for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and progress of stabilizing Sino-U.S. relations.
Based on the evidence from the existing wreckage and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the U.S. government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon "has a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and is a supplier approved by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding an accidental incident where a Chinese unmanned civilian airship entered U.S. airspace due to force majeure.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, she added that the relevant resolution of the U.S. Congress is purely political manipulation and hype.
China strongly disapproves and firmly opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of Commerce in charge of export enforcement, stated: "Today's action shows that we have identified and stopped China's joint efforts to use spy balloons that have violated the airspace of the United States and more than 40 other countries.
"
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he was unaware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on this information.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese) Several days have passed since the earthquake in parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is fading. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday brought great relief to the rescuers.
According to the Associated Press, in the heavily affected town of Nurdai in Gaziantep province, this family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days.
Rescuers first pulled the mother and daughter from the rubble, then found the father, who insisted on rescuing his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in harsh cold weather conditions.
"What day is it today?
" - the boy who had been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the rescuer who brought him back to the surface.

Miraculous successful rescue cases brought a glimmer of hope to the originally hopeless rescue work, but at the same time, the number of casualties is also rising.
According to official statistics, Monday's earthquake has caused more than 20,000 deaths in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be over 3,500.
Although experts say that people can survive for more than a week after being trapped in the rubble, the hope of finding more survivors is becoming increasingly slim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imaging devices to search for signs of life under the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of the rescue work has begun to shift towards helping those survivors who are in urgent need of assistance.

"Google AI Chatbot 'Answers Wrong Question', Parent Company's Stock Evaporates Hundreds of Billions of Dollars"
(Comprehensive news on the 11th)
Google's newly launched artificial intelligence chatbot Bard got off to a bad start, "answering the wrong question" in the promotional video, causing Google's parent company Alphabet's stock to plummet by 8.9% on Wednesday, breaking the $100 mark, and the market value evaporated $110 billion (about 476.5 billion ringgit), closing at $94.57 on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as competitive as Microsoft.
According to a Reuters report, Google earlier posted a promotional video of the AI chatbot Bard on social media, in which someone asked Bard, "What new discoveries about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year-old child?
" Bard mentioned in the answer that the telescope had taken the first photo of an exoplanet.
However, according to data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the first photo of an exoplanet was taken by the "Very Large Telescope" of the European Southern Observatory in 2004.
Reuters reported with the headline "Alphabet's stock plummets after Bard's wrong answer".
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "highlighted the importance of rigorous testing processes", and would combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure that Bard's responses "meet high standards in terms of quality, safety, and accurate information".
Singapore's tourism industry recovers strongly, with inbound tourists increasing 19 times compared to 2021
(Comprehensive news on the 11th) The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that it is expected that the number of international tourists visiting Singapore in 2023 will reach 12 to 14 million, bringing about 18 to 21 billion Singapore dollars in tourism revenue; the number of tourists and tourism revenue will recover to about 67% to 75% of the level before the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019; there is a high possibility of a full recovery of the tourism industry in 2024.
In 2022, Singapore's tourism market gradually restarted and recovered.
The latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that the number of inbound tourists in 2022 increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million, surpassing the earlier estimate of 4 to 6 million by the Tourism Board, and tourists have recovered to 33% of the level before the pandemic.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled 8.96 billion Singapore dollars, and it is expected that the total tourism revenue for 2022 will reach 13.8 to 14.3 billion Singapore dollars, an increase of 6 to 7 times from 1.89 billion Singapore dollars in 2021, and has recovered to about 50% to 52% of the level before the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced a grant of nearly 500 million Singapore dollars to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The Tourism Board recently announced that it plans to allocate 110 million Singapore dollars from this budget over the next two years to launch more business and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In order to make health and wellness one of the highlights of Singapore's tourism, the Singapore Tourism Board launched a call for proposals on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have put physical health at the top of their considerations.
Developing a health and wellness attraction in the Marina South area, which has the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism industry and economy, allowing tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
Chen Jianlong, Director of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in the next few years, health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products.
The COVID-19 pandemic has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
For this reason, the Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness projects to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held the first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with more than 130 various health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, Central Beach Market in Sentosa, the new "Exploring New Territories" exhibition hall at the ArtScience Museum, and the newly built open-air theater at the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Bird Park at Wildlife Reserves Singapore, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will establish industry standards for the sustainable development of the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) industry within 2023, and focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions, further optimizing the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Changi Airport has strongly recovered, with as many as 150,000 passengers received daily, about 1 million per week, which is about 75% of the level before the COVID-19 outbreak, and the number of aviation industry employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the level before the pandemic.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million tourists, which is 42% of the level before the COVID-19 outbreak, and 170,000 flights have taken off and landed, which is 53% of the level before the pandemic.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the recovery of industries such as accommodation, transportation, catering, and shopping.
The Singapore government and the tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Ke Shudan, Assistant Director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that a survey by a Chinese travel platform shows that Singapore's safety index ranks among the top three in the world, which is also one of the reasons why Singapore is popular with Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 outbreak, about 3.6 million Chinese people traveled to Singapore for vacations each year.
With China relaxing its border policy, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists this year can recover to 30% to 60% of the level in 2019.
Ke Shudan pointed out that next, the Tourism Board will closely monitor signals from China for further relaxation of outbound travel policies to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will prepare to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking forward to the tourism market in 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that as long as there is no significant economic downturn affecting public income, and no new large-scale fatal epidemic outbreaks, the recovery of the tourism industry will be faster than expected.
Kim Jong-un's intimate interaction with his daughter, wife left out in the cold
(Comprehensive news on the 11th) North Korea held the 75th anniversary parade of the Army Day on the evening of the 8th, and Kim Jong-un's daughter, Kim Ju-ae, not only attended, but also stood on the podium with her father.
North Korean official media released a video on the 9th, showing Kim Ju-ae snuggling next to her father, exchanging warm glances and whispers several times. She gently held her father's cheeks with both hands, even touching his chest, and the father-daughter interaction was broadcasted nationwide.
However, the first lady, Ri Sol-ju, could only step aside.
According to reports from South Korea's "Chosun News" and other media, Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju took their daughter Kim Ju-ae to attend the official group photo of the banquet on the 7th. Kim Ju-ae not only sat in the middle of her parents, but also stood on the podium with Kim Jong-un at the 75th anniversary parade of the Army Day on the following evening.
North Korean official media "Korean Central Television" later released a video of the parade, revealing more scenes of deep father-daughter affection.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium, the smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered to each other. Kim Ju-ae once held her father's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media footage also showed that when Kim Ju-ae and Kim Jong-un were sitting on the indoor sofa, she kept touching her father's face with her hand; when she walked hand in hand with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hand.
However, the first lady, Ri Sol-ju, could only walk behind or sit aside the whole time, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Ju-ae first appeared in public on November 18 last year during the test launch of the Mars 17 missile, her exposure rate has been increasing over the past three months, and this is already her fifth appearance at an official event.
When North Korean official media mentioned Kim Ju-ae, they used extremely high honorifics such as "the most beloved sibling" and "the noble sibling", and also broadcasted clips of Kim Ju-ae repeatedly shouting her allegiance to the Baekdu bloodline while overlooking the parade.
These signs have led outsiders to suspect whether Kim Ju-ae has been designated as the successor of the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un is pushing his middle school-aged daughter to the position of successor", but there are also views that such a judgment is still premature, and in the situation where Kim Jong-un has a son, all possibilities are still preserved.
Chongyang Q&A | How to view the US non-farm employment data for January exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, how do you view the US non-farm employment data for January exceeding expectations and future trends?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor announced the non-farm employment data for January 2023, with an increase of 517,000 non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly wages increased by 4.4% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, slightly slowing down.
In terms of total volume, there are many one-time and technical factors disturbing this data, such as returning teachers from strikes, corrections to survey statistics, updates to seasonal adjustment factors, and subsequent corrections may be made (refer to the revision of non-farm additions in January 2022 from 504,000 to 364,000), non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data shows.
In terms of structure, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still there, but the proportion is low; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care have seen a significant rebound in new jobs, and the data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
Combining the similarly exceeding expectations of the service industry PMI, job vacancies and labor gap data rebounding, and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US service industry has undergone rapid repair after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that without a recession, it is difficult to improve the supply and demand tension in the US job market.
Currently, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 years old is already close to the pre-pandemic peak.
In addition, due to the strong excess savings and consumer credit of US residents, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the job market.
The continued tension in the supply and demand of the US job market will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.
Adding to the current near-end of interest rate hikes, inflation expectations are constantly repeating, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth.
Before the data was released, the US stock, bond and foreign exchange markets were too optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Federal Reserve is shortening the pace of interest rate hikes while maintaining the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market ignores the Federal Reserve's hawkish statements, not only expecting to stop raising interest rates in advance, but also expecting two rate cuts at the end of the year.
In the case of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Federal Reserve's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and the adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some damage to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the year-on-year M2 data turning negative and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-item leading indicators, the US CPI data has entered a rapid decline stage since October, and the stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.
Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led China's first listed clothing company to transform - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Zheng Yu Xin, February 11, the WeChat public account certified by Shanshan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") announced that Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and the chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died of a sudden heart disease on February 10, 2023, at the age of 65.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. With his transfer, in 1989, Zheng Yonggang became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Shares.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Enterprise Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of Shanshan brand once reached 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Shares (600884.SH) was listed, becoming the first listed company in China's clothing industry.
Just when the clothing business was booming, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and it is not likely that Shanshan suits will always lead the trend and become the national dress of the Chinese people in the long term".
In 1999, Shanshan began to study corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what to transform, and specifically sought many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and theoretical seminars.
In the end, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that big health has a future".
After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, which was supporting Ansteel, was conducting a national 863 project. The research funding was not enough, so Shanshan and Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere", engage in the research, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and promote the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.
In 2001, Shanshan Shares realized the mass production of intermediate phase carbon microspheres, began to replace imports, and replaced Japan as the main supplier of intermediate phase carbon microspheres in China.
This is China's first lithium-ion battery negative electrode material production enterprise, realizing the localization of lithium-ion battery negative electrode materials.
With the rapid popularization of lithium batteries, Shanshan Shares' lithium battery business began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into the main business of Shanshan Shares. The revenue of the clothing business decreased year by year. Until 2013, the revenue of Shanshan Shares' lithium battery material business completely surpassed the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Shares successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established a polarizer company, Shangjin Optoelectronics. The technology content in this field is relatively high, and Shanshan's main competitors are all Fortune 500 companies, such as Samsung in South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical in Japan, and Nitto Denko in Japan.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his experience in post-investment management, "The success rate of Chinese private enterprises acquiring some high-tech enterprises internationally is relatively low. Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will consider, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, right? This is a behavior that is usually done", but Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day Shanshan successfully acquired, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shangjin Optoelectronics that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shangjin, decided to implement a one-enterprise-two-systems policy. Except for Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, Shanshan's people will not be sent to Shangjin. They will adopt an authorized operation method, and the original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management modes will remain unchanged.
ICC Xinling Information released negative electrode data for 2022, showing that Shanshan's negative electrode shipment volume broke through 200,000 tons in 2022, an increase of 100% year-on-year, with a market share of 16%, and the shipment volume of artificial graphite negative electrode materials topped the list.
In terms of polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the company's Shangjin Optoelectronics' global market share reached 29% in 2022, and it is expected that the market share will reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Shares' revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, net profit was 2.313 billion yuan, and on February 10, the stock price of Shanshan Shares was 19.24 yuan/share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan Shares stated on the interactive platform that at the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity was about 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project was still climbing.
Wind shows that Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan Shares.
Tianyancha shows that Zheng Yonggang holds a total equity ratio of 40.1% in Shanshan Holdings Limited.
The general manager of Shanshan Shares is Li Zhihua, born in 1968, who has served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Materials Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Shares Co., Ltd.
Shanshan Shares stated on the investor interaction platform on February 10 that there is no kinship between the senior management of the company and the actual controller of the company.
"Fund E-account" is here: CSRC authorizes development, all funds under investor's name can be consolidated and queried - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website
Economic Observer Network reporter Chen Shan: Is it difficult to consolidate account information due to the complex channels of fund purchase?
Always forgetting your "small treasury"?
These problems of fund investors are about to be solved.
On February 10, the CSRC announced that the "Fund E-account" APP has been launched in various mobile app stores and is undergoing public beta testing.
According to the introduction, the "Fund E-account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" query service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve the industry service pain points such as forgetting accounts and cumbersome queries for the majority of small and medium investors.
According to Wind data, as of the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, managing about 26 trillion yuan in funds; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
The account systems of each share registration institution are independent of each other, lacking a unified industry query channel.
Some industry insiders said that by the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China, which means that half of the people in the country have invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to query purchase conditions through different sales institutions, but through the "Fund E-account", they can query the purchase conditions of all sales channels, and the situation of holding funds is clear at a glance.
What is the "Fund E-account" APP?
According to related documents, the "Fund E-account" APP is a public fund industry portal mobile application developed and built by China Settlement with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, which can provide investors with a one-stop query of the off-market shareholding situation of all market public fund products.
Investors can conveniently and quickly grasp their own off-market shareholding situation of public fund products purchased through all market sales channels through the "Fund E-account", greatly improving the efficiency of queries.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through the "Fund E-account" includes: the fund account information opened at all public fund managers in the market, the trading account information opened at public fund sales institutions, and the off-market shareholding situation of products including publicly raised securities investment funds and collective asset management plans managed by securities companies with no limit on the number of investors.
Liu Yiqian, the business head of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told the Economic Observer Network reporter that investors can know all their off-market public fund holdings through the "Fund E-account" App, help them find "forgotten assets", and more importantly, it has realized the collection of all account information of comprehensive fund investment for customers, helping customers to grasp their own investment situation more timely, accurately and completely, so as to better optimize their own fund portfolio allocation and better plan their own financial arrangements.
How to register and use?
The reporter noticed that at present, the "Fund E-account" APP has been launched in Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, vivo and other mobile app stores, but the APP is still in the public beta testing stage, registration requires an invitation code, investors can contact the fund manager of the fund they hold to obtain.
A customer service staff member of a medium and large public fund in Shanghai provided the Economic Observer Network reporter with a six-digit invitation code, and told the reporter, "During the APP beta testing stage, China Settlement provides each fund manager with a certain number of invitation codes. When investors call to get them, we will provide them.
After the beta testing is over, when user registration is opened, no invitation code is needed.
"
The reporter registered an account and completed the query according to the "Fund E-account" download and use instructions related documents displayed on the CSRC official website. The whole process took only a few minutes, mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund query.
After the real-name authentication step, click the "Asset" fund binding button, all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are presented in the binding option list (accounts that can be bound), after the binding is completed, you can directly see the total assets of the invested funds and can start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E-account" only provides query services for investors and cannot carry out redemption transactions.

United States, Japan, and Philippines Reach Defense Consensus Against the CCP
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's infringement of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement stating that they will sign a trilateral defense agreement with the United States, conduct substantive defense exchanges, and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Kishida hopes that this meeting will help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis.
In early January of this year, Marcos visited China and obtained an agreement worth 20 billion US dollars.
However, after this, not only did Sino-Philippine relations not improve, but they declined.
At the beginning of this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States, agreeing to open more bases to the US military to ensure the security of the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan and is also the closest point to China.
If a crisis occurs in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from its bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States, building a "CCP confrontation arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Liyan, visits China to convey Song Tao's message: Under the 1992 Consensus, the Green Camp is welcome to visit the mainland.
Taiwan's Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan has met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People's Republic of China, Song Tao, and the Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Wang Huning.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the Kuomintang's official organization, the National Policy Foundation, praised Song Tao's message to Xia Liyan in an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, stating that as long as one recognizes the "1992 Consensus" and opposes Taiwan independence, China welcomes Green Camp members to visit the mainland.
The Kuomintang considers this a fresh development.
Xia Liyan's earlier meeting with Song Tao did not mention this statement in the news of the day.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has been clarifying its refusal to accept the "1992 Consensus" in recent days.
According to the Central News Agency today, Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan led a delegation to visit the mainland, meeting with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, the newly appointed Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, Song Tao, and the Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, Yin Li.
During the meeting between Xia Liyan and Song Tao, they discussed that the political foundation of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the "1992 Consensus" and opposition to Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the National Policy Foundation of the Kuomintang, stated in the meeting that the Kuomintang's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this is different from the previous meetings he attended.
Recently, in video conferences with mainland academia and in this conference, there was no mention of Taiwan scholars discussing military unification and the "Anti-Secession Law". Instead, the focus was on resuming exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the cross-strait situation is tense, and mainland China hopes to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the people and the communists, the other party is still willing to work for the people of Taiwan, indicating that they do not want to ruin cross-strait relations.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao to "implement the demands raised by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen)". If they cannot be resolved as a whole, they should be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang members visiting the mainland raised the issue of Chinese military aircraft and warships harassing Taiwan daily, the agricultural and fishing issues in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the Central News Agency reporters asked such questions.
Trade unions mobilize again to protest against the government's pension reform plan
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions once again launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's pension reform draft, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action in this social trend against the government's pension reform draft.
How many people respond to the rally call may affect the next steps of the union groups.
This is the fourth nationwide mobilization jointly launched by the eight major French trade unions in a month, and it is also the first time that this protest activity has been scheduled for Saturday.
Considering that for most French people, Saturday is a day off, they do not need to choose between participating in protest demonstrations or going on strike with pay cuts, so the union groups hope that today's rally can attract more people to participate.
The unions of the public transport system, the subway, and the public railway company did not call for a strike today, the public transport system should be able to operate normally, and citizens can take the bus to the rally site, and in areas where schools start winter vacation, people can start their vacation normally.
The union groups hope that more than one million people will participate in the rally today, while the police expect the national participation to be between 600,000 and 800,000, and the Paris city area may gather between 90,000 and 120,000 people.
Since the start of this protest against the government's pension reform plan, although polls show that most French people do not support the measure to postpone the statutory retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people who actually take to the streets to participate in the parade has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 gathered between 1.27 million and 2.5 million people nationwide.
And the crowd of demonstrators this Tuesday (February 7) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
The pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition, especially the radical left-led opposition groups, have submitted countless amendments, so the review process is very slow.
And the debate between the ruling and opposition parties is becoming increasingly fierce.
A member of the radical left-wing party, the Unbowed France Party, recently posted a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor on social media, which sparked protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly finally announced a ban on this member from participating in parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for this behavior.
Although this reform plan has sparked the largest social trend in France in more than 20 years, so far, although the government has made some adjustments to the draft, it has not made any major concessions.
The union is already preparing to take action again on Thursday, the 16th, and on March 7, when the reform draft is submitted to the Senate for discussion, the union also plans to organize a demonstration.
China encourages higher birth rates, urges donations of sperm in universities with high standards
On the 9th, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province, China, issued a call for donations from those with a college degree or above, or students, stating that successful donations 8 to 12 times could receive a subsidy of 4500 RMB.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message quickly became a hot topic on Weibo, and sparked similar initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing.
According to a report by the Liberty Times, China is encouraging college students to donate sperm.
Among all the universities, the threshold for sperm donation in Beijing is the highest. In addition to educational qualifications, they also require a height of 170 cm or above, a well-proportioned face, no obvious hair loss, and myopia not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province pointed out that sperm donors can receive a full set of men's health check-ups worth 1000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome tests, most people have never done it, which is of great significance for understanding their own fertility status."
The conditions for sperm donors include a height of 165 cm or above, a college degree or above or currently studying, no color blindness or weakness, and no genetic diseases or infectious diseases such as hepatitis B.
The report quoted China's Tianmu News as saying that the Human Sperm Bank of Shaanxi Province has printed promotional posters with the slogan "Paid sperm donation, unlimited glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to forward related messages, "let love pass on".
The price in Shaanxi Province is higher than in Yunnan, and qualified donors can receive 300 RMB in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of donations can receive a subsidy of 5000 RMB.
And currently, the highest known price is in Beijing, with the highest subsidy of 5150 RMB.
The last Communist Prime Minister of East Germany passed away today.
The successors of the East German Communist Party reported in a statement, "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
Thus, our party has lost an important leader.
"
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Modrow stated that he would help transform East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, due to protesters across East Germany demanding democracy and freedom, the Communist Party leaders were forced to step down.
After Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for reforms in Eastern Europe under Soviet leadership.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free election of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as Prime Minister.
Although Modrow carried out reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that occurred in October 1990.
He was also criticized for trying to reshape rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was found guilty of election fraud in the municipal elections of May 1989, but was not imprisoned.
Some say these charges were politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modrow saw himself as a reformer and wanted to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said that East Germany's achievements should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the small German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland) and received training as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a youth fire brigade leader and became a member of the Nazi militia organization Volkssturm, which drafted men aged 16 to 60 for the final struggle of the war, as the conflict was nearing its end.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a staunch Communist.
In 1949, the year East Germany was established, he returned home to find a job as a mechanic, continued to study social sciences and economics, and earned a doctorate.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young people in East Germany joined, and he rose to become the chairman of the Dresden regional party through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution, hackers supporting the protest hacked the president's TV speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted the TV speech of President Ebrahim Raisi.
The president's live TV speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, and the screen showed the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers, their name is "Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)".
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic".
According to Reuters today, Iran commemorates the anniversary of the revolution, hackers interrupt national television reports.
Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Raisi's hardline government is facing the boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their resignation, but Raisi still calls on the "deceived youth" to repent, so they can get the pardon of Iran's supreme leader.
After 22-year-old Amini Mahsa Amini died in the custody of the country's moral police in September, nationwide protests are still sweeping Iran.
Iran's security forces have carried out deadly repression against protests, which is one of the strongest challenges faced by the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2500-year-old monarchy.
As part of the amnesty for the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities released Fahad Mesami, a jailed dissident who was on a hunger strike, and Fariba Adelkhah, an Iranian-French scholar, on Friday.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty order, which included some prisoners arrested in recent anti-government protests.
According to a report by the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report said that 70 government security personnel were also killed.
It is believed that as many as 19,763 protesters were arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for voting at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On Friday night of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebration, and people shouted "Allahu Akbar!
(God is the greatest!)".
However, many people at the rally also shouted "Death to the dictator!
" and "Death to the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in all provinces.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebration, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment were displayed.
President Raisi's speech was often interrupted by the slogan "Death to America" - a signature slogan at the provincial rallies.
The crowd also shouted "Death to Israel".
Reuters said that Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, which is a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 for national security crimes.
They later put her under house arrest, but she returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah denied these charges.
A week before Mesami was released, supporters warned that he was at risk of death due to a hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of a headscarf.
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday, calling for her freedom to be restored, "including allowing her to return to France if she wishes.
"
Did the balloon incident further open America's eyes?
Strengthening restrictions on technology exports to China
According to the Wall Street Journal today, after the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials said that the aforementioned balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and will garner more political support for strengthening U.S. technology protection.
The United States claims that the balloon carried antennas and sensors used for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and now working at the New America Security Center in Washington.
"This undoubtedly adds fuel to the fire, supporting the views of the hardliners against China."
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking a wider range of actions to expose and respond to China's larger-scale surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security as well as our allies and partners.
"U.S. officials said they have informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the aforementioned balloon incident, and international coordination is crucial in dealing with the threat from China.
Emily Benso, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established U.S. House of Representatives' Special Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party may also pressure the U.S. to take stricter measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which could in turn force the White House to adopt tougher policies.
The Wall Street Journal reported that many advocates for stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The U.S. government is also developing a foreign investment review plan to examine whether U.S. investments abroad pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to roll out the plan more quickly.
Relief efforts for the Turkey-Syria earthquake continue day and night
Since the strong earthquake in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working tirelessly in the ruins of thousands of destroyed buildings, rescuing survivors buried under the rubble.
In the cold temperatures, they often call for silence, as they strive to hear any signs of life from the piles of broken concrete.
According to Reuters today, two more women were rescued from the earthquake rubble after surviving for several days.
However, the death toll from the earthquake has risen to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey is 20,665, and the death toll in Syria exceeds 3,500.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday, followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and close to the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped for 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years, and rescuers in Turkey rescued the two women from the ruins of collapsed buildings.
Another injured 55-year-old man was identified as Masallah Cicek, who was rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the cold temperatures, rescuers often call for silence, as they strive to hear any signs of life from the piles of broken concrete.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - they carefully reached into the rubble and rescued a 10-day-old newborn.
With his eyes wide open, baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warming blanket and taken to a field hospital.
Video images show that his mother was also taken away by paramedics, she was dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but conscious.
Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people were rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, and a total of 31,000 rescuers were mobilized in the disaster area.
He said that about 80,000 people are being treated in hospitals, and 1.05 million people are homeless due to the earthquake, crowding into temporary shelters.
As many people lack food in the cold winter conditions, there is increasing public skepticism about the leaders' response to the disaster.
According to Syrian state media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly his first visit to the disaster area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said that due to the state of war making relief work complicated, its stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria are about to run out.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Adiyaman province in Turkey, admitting that the government's response did not meet the expected speed.
Opponents seized on this issue to attack Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a vote on May 14, but it may be postponed due to the disaster.
Reuters said that anger over delays in providing aid and launching rescue operations could affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdogan's 20-year rule.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called a "negative campaign for political gain."
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition party in Turkey, criticized the government's response.
Critics said, "The earthquake was big, but what's worse than the earthquake is the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence.

Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi - Vietnam News Agency special correspondent reports that during his visit to the Sultanate of Brunei, on the morning of February 11, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, also known as "University of Brunei").
The University of Brunei is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, ranking third in the regional university rankings.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei officially established a cooperative relationship with Vietnam's FPT University, with the main area of cooperation being English training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese, and Korean, the University of Brunei has also included Vietnamese in its curriculum.
During the visit to the University of Brunei, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife interacted with students from the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is pleased that more and more foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, thereby actively contributing to the promotion of Vietnamese cultural characteristics and local customs to the world.

What exactly is the "object" shot down over Alaska?
It's confusing, with many speculations.
On Friday afternoon (February 10), the U.S. military once again used the most advanced stealth jet fighter F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska.
The location of the shootdown was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the U.S. military has shot down an airborne object.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed in the air near the coast of South Carolina after drifting over U.S. airspace for several days.
The Pentagon said that the second object shot down first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military while moving over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet), its size is about the same as a small car, much smaller than the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.
The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no evidence to suggest that this object is controllable.
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said on Friday that although the exact appearance of this high-flying object is not clear, it "poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aircraft."
Kirby said that this object is different from the spy balloon found in the U.S., it does not have a "payload" hanging on it.
Kirby said, "We call it an 'object' is the best description we can make at the moment."
President Biden ordered the shootdown of this object after listening to the advice of the Pentagon, he was "very cautious" when he made this decision, Kirby added.
The U.S. official description of this object can be summarized as: about the size of a small car, no joystick, no hanging device, flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But this information still can't answer basic questions, such as what exactly is this object, which country does it belong to, and what mission is it carrying out.
Many online analyses and speculations currently believe that this might be another Chinese balloon.
It may come from China like the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon floating over Latin America, they are carrying out some kind of mission at different locations.
Some people have linked this "object" in Alaska with "Unidentified Flying Objects" (UFOs).
A report in Newsweek quoted a tweet from former U.S. Representative Peter Meijer on Friday saying, "I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."
"The irony of conflating alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar conflict," Meijer said.
Meijer tweeted this shortly after Kirby confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said that Meijer is not the only one who suspects that this object is a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month, calling on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on "unidentified flying objects."
The customer service attitude of Amazon is hard for me to believe.
I guess few people will read this, but I still want to say a little bit.
The clothing we bought at the time was a zip-up hoodie, but what was finally delivered to me was a short sleeve.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon's customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested an exchange, the customer service said they would solve it, and then I immediately saw the product name changed to short sleeve, and the link I originally bought was taken down.
Then the customer service notified me to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.
Is this Amazon's way of handling it?
It's really hard to believe. The wrong delivery of the clothes is not my problem. As a consumer, I demand to get the goods I should get. I didn't make any exaggerated demands, but Amazon changed the name and said there was no stock.
This is my first long review, I hope this is not my last one.
Incomprehensible sleeves
They say it's made of cowhide, and it is indeed quite hard, but if you look closely, there are many tiny cracks in certain areas, making it unclear whether it's real leather. Moreover, the sleeves of this garment are truly incomprehensible. Usually, the sleeves of a jacket are longer than the hem, but typically only by 1-2 centimeters. This garment, however, is a full 5 centimeters longer. When the arm naturally hangs down, it should be at the position of the tiger's mouth of the palm, but the sleeves of this garment cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and returning them is also easy.
But when will the money be refunded?
The clothes are well made, but because the size is too small, I had to return them. However, after returning the goods, it has been more than a week and I have not received a refund yet?
Moreover, the buyer has to contact Quanfeng Express, which is not very trustworthy. This is the worst shopping experience I've had since buying items from Amazon!
But the store is still good, actively cooperating to urge the courier to refund in time, but the work of this Quanfeng Express is really infuriating, dragging on for about half a month before refunding. This kind of partner is going to drag Amazon down, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!
More suitable for young people.
It's a 99-second kill.
The workmanship, color, and feel of the woolen pants are all good, soft/thin and moderate, without a kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the style is slim, more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist 2 feet 5, maximum stretch size 4 feet, 1.79/80 kg wearing a bit tight on the waist.
It seems that there is no elastic band at the waist, it's quite difficult to add a loose waist.
Also, it's uncomfortable to wear close to the body.
Very good, the color is not very bright.
I just bought it and it went up by more than two hundred, what's going on.
This is the first time Amazon used the cooperative Tiantian rotten express, the first time the delivery was not at home, then I actively made two delivery appointments with the courier, that courier did not deliver, then directly returned the goods to me, this damn courier has no integrity at all, strongly suggest not to use that Tiantian rotten express again.
This time there is also a T-shirt that was returned to me, and the price has gone up by more than a hundred yuan if I take another shot.
Amazon's self-operated business should not have such products.
I bought the product when it was on special offer, the price was not low, and the reviews were also very good.
When I actually received the product, I was dumbfounded. The surface of the product was largely worn, and there were wear and tear in many other places. It was either a substandard product or a used one, I will upload pictures later.
I applied for a return, and the manufacturer's representative said it was caused by transportation after seeing the pictures. Isn't this nonsense?
How could the inside of the product be worn?
There are only two possibilities, either it's a substandard or used product, or I deliberately damaged the product and then returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but considering my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I believe such products should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Customers choose Amazon's self-operated products because they trust them. Customer win, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone will work together to improve. Thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year, and two E2s have appeared, I don't know how to deal with it?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the two groups on the right side of the receiver often showed red E2, which should be a problem with the transmitter module, right? This doesn't quite match what the Amazon website says about the transmitter module being able to work continuously for 7 years, right? I can't find after-sales service on the Amazon website, and now I don't know what to do?
It's okay.
The first purchase was faulty.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the body was also broken.
And it keeps going white screen.
It got better after it was replaced.
The exchange was quite fast, it's a bit blurry at night, the view angle is not very wide, but it's enough for ordinary home use.
The only drawback is that there is no card, I bought it myself, and I have bought a mobile phone on Amazon before.
There will be stickers on the packaging to prevent the packaging from being opened, but not this time. When buying a mobile phone, there is a sticker-like stamp that can be stuck on the warranty card, but not this time.
I don't know if it's because the things are cheaper, there is none, it's very confusing.
Waiting for the supplier's response.
The packaging has no markings, I directly called the supplier and they said that the lack of markings indicates it's genuine. If in doubt, you can send scrap materials to Johnson & Johnson for inspection. They also left their license plate number and phone number, promising to send a text message to input my information into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card on their official website. But I haven't received a text message yet?
Received the engine oil in the morning, and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
I am quite confident in Amazon's self-operated products.
The mechanic who changed the oil said the oil is clear and indeed good quality.
Because it's my second purchase.
So I am quite confident.
The delivery was super fast, the packaging had no faults, and after using this oil, the engine noise noticeably decreased.
The cost performance is good, it's hard to find synthetic engine oil under 200.
Support Xingguan, support Shengpai, effective protection for the car.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (8c caterpillar shipped as 8cm caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Admitting the mistake, but always shirking, always emphasizing that the goods are third-party and cannot constrain the third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
The size options on the page I originally purchased were 7c, 8, 9c. I felt this was a trap at the time. I called the Chinese customer service of Amazon Japan and was clearly told that 8 is 8c. But when the goods returned to China, I found out it was only 8cm. I think this is a trap deliberately set to pit Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales). Now this option is no longer available on the page.
Chinese customer service: We are very sorry for your loss. We give you two options:
1. You return the goods, and the buyer bears all shipping costs.
2. You don't return the goods, we compensate you 1000 yen.
(I calculated the account, the shoes are more than 4000 yen, counted as 200rmb, choose 1, I have no shoes, the loss is 200 yuan.
Choose 2, I have shoes, and finally compensated me 2000 yen, the final loss is 150rmb) Customer service: We have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously, and sent an email the next day, saying that I do not accept the mediation of Chinese customer service, and that's it.
I proposed: When the purchase page is 7c, 8, 9c such confusing options, the Chinese customer service told me that the commonly used codes in Japan will not carry c like this, similar to 140, but have you guys gone to other caterpillar pages to see?
There are situations where American codes and Japanese codes are mixed.
Moreover, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, which is clearly the smallest size, what does it mean to put it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know that you want to ship back to the country, so we will not compensate for your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic. I am Japanese. I still need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service. Tourists to Japan don't have the time to make international long-distance calls. So the question is, who needs to call Amazon overseas purchase Chinese phone, nothing more than people like me who shop in Japan.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just to facilitate people like us who shop overseas?
I'm not very satisfied with this purchase.
This is the second time I've bought Pampers diapers from Amazon. I once bought a box when the baby was 2 months old, choosing diapers made of imported European paper. The first purchase experience was quite satisfactory. The baby used only one diaper all night, which indeed could last for 12 hours without changing.
But this time I bought size L diapers, there are 2 packs separately packaged in a box. After opening, I felt that the paper was rather loose, which was significantly different from the imported Pampers. After using it for the baby, it was okay, there was no leakage or signs of rash.
But when it came to the second pack of diapers, as soon as I started using them, a rash appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs, which has not faded yet.
I suspect that the 2 packs in one box are not even of the same quality.
I probably won't continue to buy in the future!
Hope to pay attention to the protection of package transportation.
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen in my online shopping experience, there are no protective measures at all, no buffering foam, no package buffering layer materials, nothing.
Just a deformed box.
And the soft plastic box inside, the card box has been crushed and deformed.
I hope it's genuine and quality assured, I'm not so brave to buy things from Amazon in the future.
I'd rather pay half more domestically, for more assurance.
And the problem with product packaging, I saw comments in 2016, and now it's 2019, it's still the same.
This shows that Amazon doesn't pay attention to service feedback at all, it's far behind domestic Jingdong, Tmall and others.
Pretty, but a bit of a pity.
The color of the entire cup is one I really like, orange-red, even though I have a boy at home, I still think orange-red paired with yellow is very eye-catching.
It's a bit smaller than I imagined, but it was originally for taking out, so it's still acceptable.
I tried it at home last night, after opening the bottle cap, the distance between the straw and the cap is too close, because the position of the straw is vertically straight, so my son always has to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water, I wonder if this can be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups make the straw slanted for a reason, children's things, really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and Large Capacity
I like its lightness and large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit redundant to me, I'm not sure what to put in them.
After purchasing, I found a similar one from another brand on the overseas purchase section of Amazon, which costs less than two hundred yuan.
Fake goods, extremely fake.
Amazon sells fake goods, I'm really speechless.
Customer service said that because it's been used, it can't be returned. How would I know it's fake if I didn't use it?
Because of trust, I'm heartbroken. After all, it's a facial product. Just go to a physical store to buy it, even if it's a bit more expensive.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't look at the reviews. I have already reported it to the National Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's protect our rights together.
Broken?
Fake?
It's a tragedy anyway.
When I used the second piece, I chose the one for fine pores, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. But when I put it on my face, I couldn't stand it at all. The smell was very strong, indescribable, and it made me cough immediately. My eyes were also very painful and teary, so I immediately took it off and washed my face.
I didn't believe it and opened another one of the same kind, the smell was not so strong this time, and I'm applying it now.
In retrospect, it smells a bit like the poor quality perm solution in hair salons.
I really can't imagine, do I have to avoid Amazon's own skincare products from now on?
Unscrupulous merchants indeed.
When I made the purchase, the promotion on the page stated that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given for free with purchases over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when I received the goods. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them a screenshot of the promotion at that time. The problem is, who saves screenshots of the webpage when they make purchases? You need customers to provide evidence for the promotions you have run? Buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.
Post-use Feelings
This is my first time shopping on Amazon, and I have several impressions to share. Let's start with my feelings after using the product. Firstly, it is indeed painless and doesn't have any irritating smell. Overall, it's pretty good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, it can be wiped off easily, leaving only a small amount of hair residue on the surface, which is not noticeable unless you look closely. So overall, it's pretty good. As for the future, I need to continue observing and using it to know more.
Anyway, I think this product is really good.
Secondly, I placed the order on the 27th and received the goods on the 12th, a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery service of Amazon is also very good.
Thirdly, don't believe in Amazon's Black Friday. I placed an order on Friday, and after waiting for 2 days, the price dropped by nearly 12 dollars, which means I bought it for more than 170 (including shipping fees), giving me a feeling that they raise prices during promotions.
Customer service mentioned price fluctuations, but I've been monitoring for more than 10 days and the price has been pretty stable.
Affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, granulated, will definitely repurchase!
The paste contains granules, the refreshing feeling is just right, teeth feel smooth after use, much better than a certain second-hand east, they claim to import things, but many things do not have Chinese labels, I don't know where they wholesale from.
From now on, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to the second-hand east again.
Here's a suggestion, sometimes I can't post reviews on Amazon's app, I hope some improvements can be made to the application, it will get better and better!
Excellence has been getting worse over the years, there is no service quality to speak of!
The rubbish Excellence does not consider customer needs when placing orders, especially delivery time from 19:00 to 22:00.
Because there is an elderly person at home who is inconvenient to move around after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages at night.
As a result, they directly delivered at 12 noon without prior notice.
If the delivery time is whenever your courier wants, why bother to set a time for customers to choose?
If your own logistics can't guarantee the service, then simply stop doing e-commerce!
Let an old man with three wounds on his body get out of bed to receive the courier and also find change to pay!
There is clearly a contact number on the order!
No one has ever called to give an explanation from beginning to end!
The so-called customer service for complaints on the Excellence website is just a bunch of outsiders pretending, dealing with your complaints and then giving you a so-called reply.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I've encountered similar problems with incorrect delivery times before and tolerated it, but this time it's unbearable, it's too much!
The new book I bought was delivered with the cover and back cover reversed, such a clear quality issue and they just closed their eyes and sent the book to the customer?
Leaving a negative review will not get anyone to contact you.
Excellence has been getting worse over the years, there is no service quality to speak of!
I will not spend a penny on Excellence again.
The quality of the images is simply unacceptable.
For a book titled "Ancient Map Collection", the choice, layout, and printing of the images are simply unacceptable, with some images even pixelated to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is small-format illustrations, it should do justice to the grandeur of the medieval documents left by our ancestors in the catalog!
(And many of the images can be obtained from related industry resources in clear original files), what's the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using images at all?
! I regret such an academic spirit.
I will not comment on the text, each family has its own discernment.
Overall 2 stars.
I read this book when I was in my second year of high school, just out of boredom, thinking that I wouldn't get addicted to such a book, after all, web novels from Qidian were not usually my cup of tea.
Then... I fell into the pit.
Following the plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the early part when Ye Xiu was still in the online game, even if there were intrigues between guilds, it was not heavy because it was often made light-hearted by Ye.
As for the competition part, it wrote about the slight sadness of the changing times and the alternation of old and new (maybe I'm sentimental).
Reading the whole book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The Full-Time series' depiction of characters and emotional lines is very impressive. Some characters are only occasionally mentioned, but they leave a deep impression. Characters like Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng, who are more focused on, have a lot of fans, and characters not at the center of the writing like Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu are also very likable. In a refreshing e-sports novel, it's surprising that there isn't a character that is extremely annoying. This is a success of Full-Time in character depiction.
In terms of emotional lines, Full-Time doesn't have the common problem in web novels of having a harem of millions of beauties or rotten girls. All the characters' emotions have one thing in common: they all like the game Glory and most of them want to win honorably.
There are small plots but no big conspiracies, everyone seems so pure and cute.
This might also be why there are no annoying characters in Full-Time.
The IP of Full-Time is very big, which is also due to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of web novels, Full-Time is a good book.
It really provides some passion and a little bit of touching.
In April this year, Full-Time is going to be animated.
I've actually wanted to buy the whole set for a long time, but due to my always thin wallet, I never had the heart to do it. When I wanted to buy it, I found that there were a lot of fakes on Taobao. Actually, Full-Time recently released another version, I quite like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked on Amazon and bought a set all at once.
Next, I'll briefly talk about the condition of the books.
● The fourth book is not shrink-wrapped, but the book is new.
● The seventeenth book is shrink-wrapped but has been opened, and the texture of the book is strange, it doesn't feel as hard as the others.
● The 23rd book is the same as the 17th, but it's harder than the 17th, but very old.
● A few books are from different publishers, like the 23rd and 17th are from the same publisher, which is different from the others.
● Overall, I'm quite satisfied, 24 books in a big box, very satisfying.
The Lonely Little Lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner", but there's actually a lot of text!
I read it three times before I finished reading this book to the little ones, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat fruit juice gummies.
When I saw the plot of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a bit uncomfortable, modern city people can't quite accept such an arrangement of being eaten by animals.
In the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society, lost himself, he is no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human.
In the end, only the little lion's back is left, I don't know where he went.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion still remains in the impression of the grown-up children, and is remembered inadvertently one day, perhaps it will touch or inspire her.
High cost-performance portfolio
1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I bought a lot of their books, because they are too powerful, whether it's the choice of topics or the production itself.
This work has been released in 3 versions. The largest version is the same as the complete works of Michelangelo, both are close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and it comes with a box set of two books.
I personally think it's acceptable. Firstly, the price is cheap, and the 700+ pages are divided into two books, which are also easy to flip through as paperback; secondly, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, the paintings are the main part, and the black and white manuscripts of Da Vinci make up the majority. For readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, this version has the highest cost-performance ratio for appreciating paintings and manuscripts.
2. The commentary on the painting part is great, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper), but I don't know if it's a printing or book size issue, some shadow parts are too deep, and the details are not clear, which is a bit regrettable.
3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscript content is much richer.
The former is already a genius, and the latter's wide range of interests and high achievements cannot be described as genius.
If you could only experience half of Da Vinci by looking at his paintings before, you would be completely speechless after reading his manuscripts.
Trash, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give bad reviews, but this is genuinely trash, a waste of money. Give me a reason!
1. The time is inaccurate, it suddenly becomes January 1st, the time resets.
2. Inferior quality strap, it's not even silicone, wearing it causes wrist allergies and blisters.
3. Often can't connect to the phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection does not display, the time is 0.
6. It's not waterproof.
7. Other.
The logistics are too slow.
It showed that it would arrive on October 16th, but I didn't receive it until the 21st, bad review!
The delivery is too poor, buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfied
At first, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was okay, there was an air bag inside, the camera's three codes matched, and it could be registered on the official website, the shutter count was 0, the rest can only be tested over time.
The delivery speed is quite fast, here I want to complain about the courier, he just left the valuable item at the door and left quickly, I had no chance to open the box and check it in front of him, I'm speechless about this.
The seller has considered the customer before shipping :)
The seller is quite responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, truly considering the customer.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The screen protector fits well and is useful when applied.
The battery cannot be fully charged.
The machine is indeed good, I want to ask why it can't be fully charged the first time it is charged, the charging indicator light is always red.
Currently, I can't find an official feedback channel on Amazon, so I can only provide feedback in the product reviews.
1. On March 29, I pre-ordered this book for 31 yuan, it showed that it would be pushed to the device on March 31, at this time the book could not be previewed on the official Amazon website (because it had not been released yet);
2. The book pushed to the device on March 31 was blank, only saying "please look forward to it", and the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan;
3. I have tried repeatedly in the past two days to delete the blank book downloaded on the device and sync again, but I can't get the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" with actual content, but I see that the book can now be previewed on the official Amazon website.
I have a few thoughts at the moment
1. The issue of price is not the most important thing, the key is how to replace the blank book on the Kindle with a book with actual content, instead of always downloading "please look forward to it"
2. I probably won't buy pre-ordered books in the future, after all, if it's postponed, downloading another book with empty content seems very complicated;
3. I hope Amazon can provide a normal channel to feedback such issues, so that there is a place to feedback when there are doubts about the download or use of e-books (work orders, online customer service are all acceptable, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does it)
I don't highly recommend reading it.
I read it a long time ago, and just happened to see it, so I'll write some impressions from memory.
This book is less a collection of short stories than a collection of fragments about love in life.
The tone of this book is extremely plain, as plain as plain water. The choice of words and sentence construction pursue simplicity to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street on a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally collected together, it is titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love".
I think, this collection of short stories, and its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the eternal love in urban legends, nor just the inseparable intimacy between you and me. Love is not only the above but should not be represented by the above. Love is also a plain life like water, a boring day after day, and there is also a sense of helplessness in life, the escape from reality, and the confusion about the future.
When you read this book, you may recall the quarreling couple beside you, the tasteless marriage of people you know, and the unsatisfactory feelings.
This is exactly why I don't recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are tasteless, unless your life is stormy or sweet as if living in a candy castle, otherwise your feeling when reading it is that it's not surprising and boring.
And from the depth of thought, the daily plot does not enlighten or expand one's thinking and vision (this is different from Marquez's "Love in the Time of Cholera"), and the short fragments do not discuss any issues, such as what kind of mistakes led to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much difference whether you read it or not.
The author's ideas are more expressed through techniques and genres rather than story plots, which is also a reason why the reading experience of this book is relatively poor.
Suitable for skimming, not for detailed reading.
The logic of this book is good, but the content is not rich enough.
It explains a lot about what and why of sales theories, but it is weak in how to do it, only pointing out the direction but not giving specific methods.
Also, this book feels like it's pieced together.
Examples include both domestic and foreign ones; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and unknown people.
I don't know if the stories were compiled just for the sake of examples, but it would be more convincing if the author cited cases he personally experienced.
The terms for customers keep changing.
The title is "customer", but in the text it becomes "client".
There are also problems with typos, missing punctuation, and numbering errors in the e-book.
In conclusion, this book is a good choice for beginners in theory, but not very suitable for those who are already in sales and want to improve their sales level.
A Quick Guide to Understanding Internet Finance
This book is quite basic, it can be said to be an introductory course, it can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of Internet finance, but to understand in depth, you still need to follow the clues and dig deeper on your own.
Moreover, the book was written quite early, and it does not mention the content of Alipay and WeChat cultivating user habits through the subsidy war. I'm afraid the share of third-party payments today is not as small as mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people just bring a mobile phone when they go out to eat, and merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high bank turnover.
But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience, is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write high and mighty, but it's hard to write in a way that's easy to understand.
I admire you, and I want you to know it!
The first factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough attention and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, once a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for most people, it's hard to express their feelings verbally, even if they are filled with love, gratitude, and appreciation, they keep it silently in their hearts.
The author elaborates on five languages of appreciation in this book: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, tangible gifts, and physical touch.
I think what's important is not knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to use these five languages from the heart to appreciate and be grateful for the people around you, whether they are family, friends, or colleagues.
In fact, the closer the relationship, the more appreciation and gratitude are needed, which will make our lives better.
Learning to appreciate can also help companies retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thanks to the translator for bringing us wonderful thoughts and perspectives from abroad.
Due to differences in cultural backgrounds between the East and the West, there may be more or less differences between languages. If there is a chance to see the original version of the author, I believe there will be more gains.
Thanks again to the author, translator, and editors for their hard work!
Suspected to be counterfeit goods, please Amazon strictly review.
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it's even worse than roadside stall products, there is no gram weight, no barcode, ten bags of packaging are also loose, completely not the characteristics of qualified products; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, I have already applied for a return; it is entirely a quality issue; it is suggested that the seller should keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods; supplement: I bought Heart to Heart again, supermarket 23 yuan/10 rolls, added a few comparison photos, further verified the counterfeit of this product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further unhappiness!
Once again, I hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strictly control the source of goods.
A mediocre product, not up to expectations.
Pros:
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Pros 2: The motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are okay to use, but they do not meet my expectations.
Cons:
1. There is no charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. I guess for customers who buy a 300 yuan product, in the eyes of PANASONIC, it's a handout, with no respect.
2. There is a strong strange smell when charging, even if it's only charging for 10 minutes, you can smell a strong burning plastic smell.
After testing it in the office for 1 day, the whole room was filled with this plastic smell.
Compared to the PHILIPS product of the same price range that I used before, although it has an extra blade, the quality of this PANASONIC product really lets consumers down.
Small Package
Upon receiving the express delivery and seeing the words "E-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It's much smaller than what I bought from the supermarket, it should be size M. The packaging is not the same as the picture on the product description, probably the so-called new version.
Three stars because I blame myself for not paying attention to the product specifications. I have no objections if you sell the M size e-commerce version, but what do you mean by delivering the wrong version?
E-commerce is full of tricks, it's better to go to the supermarket when you have time.
That's it.
Don't like the taste
The child really doesn't like the taste of the toothpaste, always saying it's spicy. Perhaps a different word would be more appropriate, but for now, this is the only word in the child's vocabulary.
Bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving a bad review. Four stars then, but I won't buy it again.
Genuine product, well packaged.
The packaging is very complete, with an air bag added inside, not just a bare product as some online reviews mentioned.
The bottle's outer packaging also has a layer of plastic film as described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the day after the order was placed.
It's a genuine product, just out of stock, not sure when it will be restocked.
A frustrating shopping experience
I placed an order during Black Friday, but after waiting for a long time, I still didn't receive it. Upon inquiry, I found out that the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues around me and they all said they didn't sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, I found out that the package was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transfers, I finally retrieved the package. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was still intact. I don't know if it has been used or not. Anyway, it was quite frustrating.
Incorrect Illustration
I thought I would receive headphones like those in Figure 1, but instead I received headphones like those in Figure 2. It's one thing for the item to not match the picture, but what does it mean when the sound in the left and right earpieces is not the same?
Although the names are the same, I still hope everyone can be careful. In addition, I would like to ask the person in charge at Amazon to replace the correct illustration as soon as possible. Thank you very much.
The operating system is mediocre.
After using it for a while, overall the display is okay, I don't feel much difference, it's just that this system is frustrating to look at. The boot time is noticeably slow, and it's impossible to set it up well. The included software doesn't even need to be mentioned, and the response speed is even more average. Compared to my colleague's, it's not on the same level.
The reviews say it has a very user-friendly design, but I can't find where it's user-friendly. The design of the commonly used up, down, left, right, and back buttons on the remote control is really not commendable.
So, just treat it as a TV, and use it with additional things like a TV box.
The price drop is too drastic.
The price drop is so drastic, from over a hundred to now 99!
I have accumulated many unrated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the review content.
If I use this paragraph to review, it means that this product scores at least 85 points or above.
For inferior products, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers can refer to it when purchasing, and the merchant will also improve the product quality accordingly.
Good quality at a low price, this is enough if you're not a fanatic!
Such an affordable cable, but it should meet the HDMI certification standards. After personal comparison, it easily outperforms domestic Akihabara stuff (which is twice as expensive). The cable is thick and relatively soft, no noise in 7-meter transmission. From now on, I'll stick with Baseus for affordable cables!
The product is okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, I found that I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order. The webpage always showed an error link when contacting the online customer service, so I couldn't get in touch.
When the goods arrived, the delivery person called me. I said I didn't want it and wanted to cancel the order but couldn't. The delivery person took it back and said he would sign for me first and let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once signed for. I had no choice but to call Amazon's customer service, and they said the same thing, that signed items cannot be returned.
I have bought items that cannot be returned according to policy from JD.com and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., and the customer service always allowed me to return them. Even when the diapers from JD.com had a strong smell after opening, the customer service still allowed me to return them. But with Amazon, it's not possible.
Rules are dead, people are alive, how do your customer service handle this?
They told me either I accept it myself, or let the delivery person buy it. The delivery person already has a hard job, why should I make him pay for something he didn't buy?
Fine, I won't return it, I'll accept it myself, but I must give your service a score of 1.
I advise everyone not to waste money.
Firstly, I bought it with great expectations, thinking that the Le brand wouldn't be too bad. After receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay, and the size was decent. However, one box was mostly soft, which you can't tell from the outside, you have to feel it. When eaten, it had no taste at all, bland and flavorless. When bitten into, the fruit flesh was a dark yellow, indicating it was bad. They mixed good and bad ones for sale, and less than a third were edible. I advise everyone not to buy it. It's not cheap, and the quality is too poor!
Once bitten, twice shy, I will never buy fruit from e-commerce again!
Where is the product's anti-counterfeit label?
The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which should have been caused by a strong impact. Looking at the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is distressing, especially since it's food packaging and it's too simple. Moreover, it's an international purchase, and I didn't see any obvious anti-counterfeit labels. Opening the bottle was very easy, and the key point is that a layer of honey directly came out from inside the cap. There was almost no stickiness when opened, is this how all foreign products are?
As a person born in China, I'm a bit confused.
It should be genuine, right?
Also, when I placed the order, it indicated that it would arrive around the 20th, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe all of this is normal?
The pick-up service needs improvement.
I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that one was missed and promised to be sent later. The second appointment happened to be on a rest day. Both the website and WeChat did not indicate that appointments need to be made on working days, causing unnecessary panic. I suggest improvements for the future.
Good Shopping
Positive reviews for the products!
I still trust the products from Amazon's own operations. Now it's very convenient to shop overseas. The logistics time from buying abroad is only a few days longer than domestic. I have to say that Amazon's ability to clear customs from overseas to domestic is very strong, much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought on overseas shopping.
I hope the quality and price of domestic products can be better. Many things are produced domestically, but it's cheaper to buy them after going abroad and coming back. I hope for improvements.
Trash
Seeing such a package, I ask everyone: Don't you think it's garbage on the side of the road?
A fragile plastic package, sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag, is this responsible packaging?
I think such packaging is like trash, buying this product, the packaging is extremely simple, there are no measures to prevent damage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after receiving it, the package is completely deformed, and the items inside are also damaged.
If I just encountered one like this, I would accept it, but I bought several like this, contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return it, but I had to pay for the shipping, and then the shipping cost would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I would like to ask, I pay for the shipping with cash, and you give me a gift card in return, are you asking me to buy your gift cards directly? And I have to mail the product to the warehouse in Germany myself, isn't this a hardship for buying a product!
And I keep telling customer service, whose responsibility is it for such a problem to occur, but the customer service doesn't say a word about their responsibility, they don't even dare to take half of the responsibility, what kind of guarantee does such after-sales service have? In one word: Accept defeat! But I guess my review won't be given a chance to be published by Amazon, it will be deleted directly!
Quality is very good, 5 stars, but the logistics are very poor.
1, The quality is very good, it's a steal, the price is moderate, and it's worth more than it costs.
2, It's sturdy, made with ample materials, the welding points are solid, the surface treatment is appropriate, and the color is very good.
3, The logistics are a major flaw, I placed the order on the 3rd, and it arrived on the 11th.
4, If Amazon hadn't marked the estimated arrival time as February 7th, I might have been very satisfied.
5, But marking an expected arrival time is like making a promise to the user, and when that promise can't be fulfilled, it's hard for the user to take.
6, If you're not sure you can keep a promise, please don't make one.
7, In fact, I care a lot about the promises made by the seller.
8, So, I gave a low score.
The gold thread will fade in color.
The effect is there, but whether it's noticeable depends on the individual, or it could be a psychological effect.
One not so good point is the gold thread, which was originally designed to look good, but in reality, this gold thread will fade in color. If you move it a few times in the car, there will be some gold dust on your hands and in the car.
I hope the product can be improved.
This kind of square one, doesn't have much decorative effect, so don't put gold thread on it. It's troublesome when it falls off and dirties the car.
The items are intact, the speed is acceptable, divided into 2 packages with different packaging.
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it's just that the 2 items were divided into 2 packages, and the packaging is not the same. One is obviously over-protected, with thick cardboard attached, sealed with a layer of plastic, and the outer packaging is also easy to unpack. The other one is like a domestic express box, with a few air cushions put in, which feels a bit perfunctory.
The Eran mattress is genuinely good.
The 34CM mattress is unusually thick, you can sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is very good, whether it's the front or the back, it's quite soft, sleeping is very comfortable, and you fall asleep quickly when lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were some stains in two places due to violent transportation by the courier. Eran's customer service was very responsible and efficiently contacted to resolve the issue.
It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly marks it as self-operated, but it is actually delivered by the supplier, after-sales service is provided by the supplier, and if there are any problems, you have to contact the supplier yourself.
Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, cannot be cancelled; want to return or exchange, applied successfully on Amazon, sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier for returns.
What the hell is this self-operated product?
The product is not delivered by Amazon, Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales, the customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier", and still claims it is self-operated, too shameless, blatantly shameless, blatantly defrauding consumers!
Frustrating Experience
Previously, I bought a filter cartridge from another online store, and the filtration effect was good. Even if I used it for a day or two after the 28-day period, there was no scale.
Since the quality of the items I've always bought from Amazon has been good, I thought I'd buy from here this time. This is my first time buying a filter cartridge on Amazon, and the experience is not very good. Not only did scale start to appear early, but there was also floating small black carbon powder in the filter cartridge all the way to the 28th day. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. Very frustrating~
It's not as good as I imagined.
Compared with the power strips I've used before, the external workmanship is average, I haven't opened it to see the inside, but I hope it's as the shopkeeper described. From the perspective of ease of use, whether each independent unit is powered lacks display.
The packaging is damaged, waiting for time to test the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, the inner packaging box seems to be new, but the instruction manual does not seem to be new. I will be renovating in September, stockpiling goods, I hope it won't be bad by then. Please Amazon explain why several customers mentioned the damaged packaging, yet you can handle it calmly, thank you!
Overall not bad, there are some minor issues.
This is my first time buying a water filter jug. After reading several review articles, I felt that LAICA's cost performance was higher so I chose this one. After receiving the goods, I installed the filter according to the instructions and tried it out. Overall, it's not bad, but it seems that when pouring water, the raw water will mix with the treated water from the spout of the jug (the raw water compartment is not very tightly sealed).
When using it, you must wait for all the water to be filtered before pouring it out!
The picture is incomplete.
The picture does not capture the details of the side, the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is the first point; this bead is produced in Thailand, the place of origin is not marked, this is the second point; the texture is not marked, this is the third point; when I bought it in the UK, each item clearly had its own box, here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there are no product marks on the bead, how can I judge whether it is real or fake.
Be careful when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon's customer service is really terrible.
Two days ago, I placed an order, and today when I received it, I found that the price had dropped by 40 yuan. I spent a lot of time finding customer service, and they said they couldn't make up the difference, but I could repurchase and return the goods.
This kind of customer experience and service is a million times worse than certain treasure and certain east.
It's okay, for a beginner, it's worth getting.
The quality is passable, it can't compare with the top-notch Transformers, I've seen the price in the mall before, at least several hundred less to say, this is my first time playing with Transformers, it's okay.
The stuff is good.
The stuff is really good, it's a gift for my girlfriend. Just that I had some unpleasant experience when the courier arrived at noon when I was not in Canada. The logistics company directly put the mail in the storage box and did not send me a verification message for pickup, causing me to make two trips.
But the item is indeed good.
Worth buying.
The little monkey is cute, Amazon offers a great discount, Chow Sang Sang's official website ships directly. I placed an order the night before yesterday, and received it this afternoon, so fast.
The postal courier is also very responsible.
Awesome!
A Customer's Confession
1 Upon receiving such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, they will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then when you contact the customer service staff in the meantime, they will tell you that a specialist will handle this issue and inform you of the result.
You can never actively contact this specialist, you don't know her employee number, there is no direct contact number, you just can't reach her, only she can contact you.
3 The tragedy is that after nearly 3 days, this specialist contacted me, but I was away from my phone for a while and did not receive her call.
I waited for 2 hours but did not receive a call from the specialist. During this time, I actively contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email asking her to call me back.
4 Nearly 3 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon's handling result will be for the defective coffee machine I received!
5 There is no problem with the products of Amazon USA, overseas shopping is a good way to shop, but it is far inferior compared to the service of Amazon USA.
6 For me, all I can do is continue to wait...
Uneven Bottom
Because the reviews said it was very good, I had high expectations for this pot. When I received it, I really liked it because it was lightweight. However, I found a problem when I started to use it. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it bulges in the middle and sinks around the edges, causing the oil to run to the sides. The large fatty meat I specifically bought to season the pot produced a lot of oil, but it couldn't cover the central area and got burnt. I couldn't even season the pot properly, let alone cook normally with this design.
I don't know if I was just unlucky to get a pot with an uneven bottom. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I decisively returned it.
I cleaned the pot thoroughly before returning it, wasting half a day for nothing.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve.
This is a product with a very simple design style.
In the shape of a cube, the designer has processed the top into a slight curve.
The lines should have been very smooth.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two parts on the top, the front is the control panel, and the back is the water box cover.
The curvature of the cover and the control panel are surprisingly inconsistent, resulting in a height difference of about 2mm after assembly.
Although it looks like a very small gap.
But it can be said that it has destroyed the entire design sense.
I feel a bit sorry for the product designer.
It seems that Midea's product manager does not yet have the ability to create such a standard product.
(As for the feedback from the after-sales lady, of course, I can't ask too much, but when I heard the after-sales say that all individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought has a problem, her indifference and heavy burden of truth made me understand that I can't ask too much from Midea) On July 7, 2019, the water pump failed and the water output was small. This is the second repair, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
It's a great deal after the discount, but Amazon's fake discounts are disappointing.
Purchased a week after the baby was born, the insulation is super strong.
The outside of the pot doesn't feel hot at all, so it's not only safe from burns but also effectively keeps the temperature from dissipating.
After a night in an air-conditioned room, it can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon said there was a big discount of 320 for the anniversary event, but later found out that everyone had 249, 289, 299, and instantly felt deceived. However, after comparing with the supermarket, it's still much more cost-effective than various off-brands at the same price, and it can be carried with the car when going out in the future.
Vitamix 6300
I've been watching it for a long time, saw the 6300 on sale on Amazon US, same price on Amazon China's overseas purchase, so I quickly placed an order.
I placed the order on September 2nd, the estimated arrival was the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days early, the speed is really fast!
The packaging box is not big, it directly uses Vitamix's original packaging, Amazon is not afraid of it getting damaged across the ocean!
The machine looks quite new, the accessories are complete, but the cup shakes a lot when placed on the base, I'm afraid the cup will fly out when I turn on the machine!
I asked a friend who has a 5200, from his description it seems like his doesn't shake as much as mine.
The included recipe book is all in English, it's quite tiring to read, I couldn't find a Chinese version online, this is a problem!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer, I guess it will arrive in 3 days, I'll mess around with it then!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
It's not large at all!
The second Totes, 1. This one doesn't have an umbrella cover 2. The handle material is average 3. It clearly says Large, but it's actually a convenient umbrella for one person, it would be a squeeze for two people.
On the contrary, the one I bought from Amazon US before can be used by three people without any pressure.
I'm not feeling too good about this.
Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms with a little pressure, secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS surface of the box from getting scratched when laid flat, thirdly, inside the box is just a piece of cloth with the handle area protruding.. and so on, various dissatisfactions. Lastly, the zipper is a bit unsmooth.
PS: The wheels do feel quite good.
It's okay.
Pros: This backpack is quite delicate and looks durable.
Cons: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what's going on), a 15.6-inch laptop can't fit in (can it be a bit longer), this backpack's zipper can be locked, but they don't provide a lock for the buyer, it can't be said to be customer-first service.
Overall it's okay, I'm not sure if it's real leather.
Overall it feels okay, I'm not sure if it's real leather, so I can't blindly comment.
It can hold A4 size documents, I've put in 80 pages thick, but I guess it can't fit too thick and hard box-shaped objects (that can't be deformed).
The bag is soft, the inside pockets are also quite humanized, it's pretty good.
It's just that the one I got has a small sand hole at the bottom, I don't know if it's my bad luck or what?
I'm too lazy to bother with returns, I'll put up with it.
Overall, I give it four stars, it's worth it.
ForRoyal Sweeping the Globe Camera Strap SLR Strap
This strap is designed scientifically, hung over both shoulders, practical, and the chest area uses soft material to secure and protect the camera, unlike other quick shooters that use screws to secure the bottom and damage the camera, and it is also very convenient to take off for photography.
Terrible After-sales Service
I bought a piano a month and a half ago, it was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me the after-sales service number. Despite multiple communications, I still haven't received the part. What kind of efficiency is this!
I guess it would be even more troublesome to repair it in the future. For those who expect good after-sales service, you might as well take a detour, it's too much trouble!
There are minor defects, but the sound quality is good.
The head of the piano has a defect, missing a corner, it feels like a defective product, and there are no gifts included. However, for this price, it's already quite good, and the sound quality of the piano is also good.
Alright, the first batch of face sheets.
I've used it for a long time, except for the bass not coming out, overall it's not bad.
It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as I imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the item, all the lights were flashing, and it couldn't be used.
I requested a replacement, but it's been three days since the goods arrived in Shanghai, and they still haven't been delivered.
The delivery person doesn't answer the phone.
The courier company said that's the only contact method they have.
I can't find a place to complain on Amazon.
Without any request, a text message came saying that the delivery was delayed as per my request - this is inexplicable.
Then they mentioned some issue with the transit.
Anyway, it's a very poor shopping experience, I'm starting to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
I guess I won't be able to get it today either.
The label's adhesiveness is too poor, it's not waterproof.
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and there is no film on the surface; moreover, the label's adhesiveness is very poor, it's completely unsuitable for cable labels, it falls off very easily. Friends who bought it for cable management need to be aware of this.
The pen is okay, but the packaging is too simple, just a cardboard box, without any protective measures, and the box for the pen is stuck with a large piece of transparent tape, the tape remains on the box when torn off.
Such treatment for a six hundred yuan item, a very disappointing shopping experience.
But the pen has no problem.
I hope there will be more improvements in packaging in the future!
The quality is unquestionable, if it comes to writing, 925-25 is better.
First, let's praise the daily express delivery, air freight, super fast, and the service attitude is also very good!
I have been using 925-25, it's very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is unquestionable, the style is also very beautiful, the reason for giving four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjustment lead length is a bit shaky, personal opinion: 925-25 is more handy than 85.
Therefore, I became a die-hard fan of Amazon.
I bought it at a super discounted price, but it turns out my child doesn't like the reading pen.
I've opened it, tried to apply for a return, and they even picked it up from my home for free.
That's awesome.
I don't advocate for returns, but this kind of service is unique in China.
I hope it won't be abused.
From now on, I will buy all my books here.
The headphones are biased in sound, and there is noise.
These headphones are really trash, I don't know if it's my ears that have a problem, or these headphones are indeed not as good as before.
I bought a blue one on a certain easy purchase two years ago, the sound quality was not bad, there was no noise, the bass was also good, I used it for more than two years and it broke, so I plan to buy another one (urbeats), after all, it feels pretty good.
I saw a purple one that looked pretty good, but when I bought it and opened it today, I felt something was wrong, one side was louder than the other.
At first, I thought it was because of the sound effects of that song and didn't think much about it, but after listening for a long time, I realized that this problem is very serious, not only is the sound biased, the bass effect is not as good as my previous one, and there is some noise, is it only the purple one I bought that has this phenomenon? Or is the current headphone manufacturing process really not up to par?
A very poor review, very disappointed.
I must return the goods during the day tomorrow.
PS The appearance is not bad.
This AV amplifier is complex to set up, roughly made, and generates a lot of heat.
The sound quality will be evaluated after some time of use!
I just got the German version of the DN1080 on August 14th. The exterior workmanship is so poor.
1. The front panel and knobs are all made of plastic.
2. The audio input jacks on the back panel and the speaker output terminals are so poor, any 1000-2000 CD amplifier integrated machine you pick at random would be much better than this one.
3. The top cover is quite thin, and the area around my transformer is even dented. I had to open the box and manually fix it, the top cover and the front panel are loosely connected.
4. The whole machine is heavy on the transformer side, which makes it awkward to move.
It feels like an entry-level machine from SONY, with that kind of workmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel that Sony would be much better off outsourcing to China than to Malaysia.
5. The machine generates a lot of heat, after watching a movie in two-channel stereo for about two hours, the top cover feels about 40-50℃ to the touch. I'm not sure if it's because the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switch power supplies are more commonly used, this stupidly large transformer probably weighs about 4KG.
Sony should use active cooling silent fans inside the machine, after opening the box, I only saw large aluminum heat sinks on the tubes.

Never been disassembled.
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what's inside.
But then I thought, if I'm disappointed after opening it, it would be a waste of money; if I'm satisfied after opening it, it would be hard to put it back together, and I wouldn't feel good using it.
Forget it, let's assume Sony uses good battery cells.
As for the detailed explanation of the battery life, most people would feel uneasy looking at it.
I'm fine, having worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I'm also half a battery engineer, I can handle it.
Overjoyed
I was really unsure before buying, but as soon as I opened it and saw the packaging, it felt right!
Finally, when I touched the headphone wire, it felt incredibly flexible, the quality was too good, I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was astonished, the sound quality was actually 3D surround!
I asked in a physical communication store, similar ones are around 30, but definitely not from the Pisen brand, they are off-brands, so although this Pisen is 27, it's absolutely worth owning in terms of cost performance!
The Worst Online Shopping Experience
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but I still hadn't received the goods by October 12.
When I checked the Amazon order status, the seller did not provide a tracking number, so I couldn't find where the order was.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide a tracking number, but I didn't get a reply for two days.
Out of desperation, I called Amazon customer service, who gave me the seller's phone number. After calling the store a few times, I finally got through and was told that the package was lost, but they could immediately send me another one.
Although I was very angry, I urgently needed the computer, so I didn't say much to the seller, as long as they sent it to me immediately.
However, when I called the next day to ask if it had been shipped,
the seller said it hadn't and that it could only be shipped in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller assured me that it would be shipped after five or six o'clock. But when I called at seven o'clock in the evening, no one answered the phone.
The next morning, I called again to ask if the goods had been shipped out
and if they could give me the order number.
The seller said it hadn't been shipped and suggested that if I was in a hurry, I should order from another store, but if I could wait, it would be shipped in the afternoon.
I had no choice but to wait a long time if I ordered from another store.
So I could only ask the seller to hurry up and ship the goods.
Finally, after countless phone follow-ups, I received the computer on October 16.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know because it was purchased for someone else. I'll add more comments later.
I just bought it half a year ago and haven't used it much, but now it's already having contact issues. Can I ask for it to be repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I didn't use it much after buying it.
I only packed it for use a few times when I was on a business trip.
Recently, I found that it doesn't charge when connected to the power source. I need to manually adjust the connection between the charger and the wire a few times before it can charge.
I suspect that the interface is having contact issues. I wonder if it can still be repaired now?
Strongly suggest Amazon stop using EMS!
Five stars for the product, one star for logistics, averaging three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon would use EMS, which is widely recognized as unreliable in the industry. After all, a computer is a valuable item!
After purchasing, the order showed an estimated delivery date of the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
From Xiamen to Fuzhou, why does it take four to five days!
On the morning of the 22nd, I checked the logistics and it finally arrived in Fuzhou. I was ready to happily receive the goods, but in the evening, without receiving any calls or text messages, I checked the logistics and it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I personally signed for it!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I seriously doubted my life!
In the end, I had to run to the collection point to bring the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier mixed up the two order numbers, but it's okay since the package wasn't lost.
I strongly suggest that Amazon stop using EMS. If Amazon uses EMS for delivery in the future, I will definitely not buy again.
The goods are not bad.
First of all, I found out that the price dropped just a few days after I bought it, which is disappointing. The product itself is quite good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games. The heat dissipation is very good, but the screen has a bit of light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not good (I suggest you spend some money to add a solid state drive). Yesterday I took it to the after-sales service for a hardware check, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Win8.1 is not very user-friendly, I suggest upgrading to 10. The seller shipped quickly and answered all inquiries quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer, which is good, but it's a pity that there were no gifts.
(By the way, if you want to buy a keyboard film, don't go to a shop called E Cool Digital Center on a certain treasure. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and they don't return or exchange defective products. The boss also swears a lot, I want to expose this specifically.)
The product is very good, but the platform bureaucracy remains.
The quality of the hard drive is excellent, and the cost performance is absolutely high. It's cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you're not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I definitely recommend purchasing it.
However, I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains the same as when I swore never to use it a few years ago. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information is always that it will be delivered a few weeks later, you can never complain, it's just so bureaucratic!
I received the goods a few days ago, but the logistics information still says you will receive the goods in about 10 days!
Logistics is not worry-free.
The delivery came in this condition, not only was the packaging crushed, the packaging of the electrical appliance was also open, I don't even know if there was a switch of goods.
FYI
Haven't tried it yet, always trust Philips, hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
I looked it up online, it might be a common problem of water ingress, and there is no warranty.
Frustrating!
Now I'm using it wrapped in cling film, I wonder how long it can last?
Bought something that has been opened by others.
The tax of over a hundred for a machine worth over three hundred is indeed high, but seeing it now at over six hundred makes me feel much more balanced.
When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened. I quickly took a picture, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening it, the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I hurriedly let my husband try it before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no power at all, luckily there was no stubble inside the blade, otherwise how would I return it from so far away!
Whether it's good to use or if there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown. As the previous reviews said, the items sent out when out of stock are indeed unreliable!
The experience is above average.
It's almost top-of-the-line electric, with many different tooth cleaning modes, but few people would change modes every day.
I've been using it for half a year without any problems, brushing every day, and charging about once a week.
Brush head accessories are just as cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, other than changing colors and such, it seems the compatibility issue is due to the overseas version?
Hope to learn from the greats.
The cost-performance ratio is very high.
I have used it 3-4 times already.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It's very easy to use, and also convenient to clean.
3. You can completely DIY your haircut, which saves money.
In conclusion, this was a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeits.
I bought two packs last time, and they turned out to be two different versions. Originally, the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but one of the packs was not, it had white words. As a result, my cat had diarrhea after eating it.
I can't determine whether the source of goods from Amazon is fake, or if the goods were switched by the staff during delivery.
I will buy it again, and if it is still counterfeit, I will hold your relevant personnel accountable.
It's a horizontal bar!
The picture on Amazon shows a slash, but what they sent me is a horizontal bar, isn't this deceiving?
The effect is okay.
The cat likes to eat, this is the key point.
It indeed works.
Tight, narrow, binding feet, rubbing the top of the foot.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of Clarks, but it's a pity that this model is too bad.
Addendum: Today I compared it with the previous UN series shoe pads (I threw away the shoes but kept the pads), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it's just falsely soft.
2. My foot arch is not high, the part that rubs is about 3 centimeters forward from the highest point of the foot arch.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks overseas, only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the Clarks from my favorites.
I'll try Rockport next, if it doesn't work, I'll have to go to the ECCO physical store.
The quality control is poor, substituting inferior for good.
Firstly, it's worth acknowledging that Prime Overseas Purchase Ups is very efficient, I placed the order on the 31st and received it on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a little bit larger, with a foot length of 25 and a width of 10.5, I ordered 7.5W, it's a bit loose when worn, but I usually like to wear it a bit loose, it's just right with a pair of insoles.
Secondly, the quality control of these shoes is really disappointing, one shoe sole is damaged, the other shoe has various scratches and a pinhole, the glue strip at the connection between the shoe upper and the shoe sole is misplaced, it's obviously substituting inferior for good!
A bit regretful!
I bought it for 280 yuan during a promotion, which is quite a bargain for Asics at this price, of course, there are lower prices in the reviews.
Now let's talk about the shoes, pros: the shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well, they won't be loose.
They look great but the cons are also obvious: I usually wear size 40 shoes, this time I bought size 40.5, there's about a thumb's width of space in the front of the shoe, but this doesn't affect anything.
The shoes are quite "narrow", even though there's space in the front, they feel tight.
Another point, the shoes might not be very breathable, my feet feel hot wearing them now.
Pressing on the instep
First of all, the shoes are very well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, I have bought several pairs of Aibu from Amazon, and I have never had a problem with them not fitting, but this pair I referred to the comments, bought a larger size uk7, after putting them on because they are one size larger the length is obviously too long, but because the insole is too thick, it still presses hard on the instep, plus the walking shoes are very hard, making them very uncomfortable to wear.
If your feet are not particularly thin, I do not recommend buying this model.
If you must buy, changing the insole can solve the problem, but the original insole looks very high-end, it's a pity not to use it.
A perfect shopping experience!
Very satisfied, very fond of it, Amazon overseas purchases are undoubtedly genuine, the quality is also very good, good value for money, rest assured to buy, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and amiable, handling problems patiently and efficiently, perfectly solving worries, the accompanying express delivery to the door is very convenient and secure, the delivery master always thinks for the customers, always reminds to pick up from the express cabinet in time, thank Amazon for providing such a comfortable shopping experience to customers.
In short, our whole family likes shopping at Amazon overseas!
Absolutely negative review!
I'm speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Although it's been a long time, I still need to vent.
I bought it in a winter flash sale for less than 200, and it sat unused at home for several months.
When I wanted to use it in the spring, I found that it couldn't connect with the wristband no matter what. Both device manuals indicated they supported each other. Later, I found that the problem should be with the heart rate band, because it still couldn't connect with other devices.
I called Amazon, they told me to contact the agency. The agency asked me to send the device to Shanghai for inspection at my own expense.
Nearly half a month later, the item was returned to me in its original packaging, even the courier box was the one I used to send it!
There was no reply, receipt, or inspection report!
At least tell me whether it's good or bad!
When I called to ask, they said that if it was sent back like this, it means the device has no problem, it's good.
But why can't I still connect it? The agency's answer: that's not their problem anymore.
I'm just unlucky, I don't want to be bothered by you for a 200 yuan item.
The goods are seriously mismatched.
The goods are extremely mismatched.
The material of the headband is very good.
It's much better than Nike.
The breathability is also very good.
It's just that cap in front.
It's very thin.
Is it meant to be funny?!
It doesn't block the sunlight at all.
The reason for not returning it is because it functions well as a headband.
Although it doesn't block the sun when worn upwards.
But it's different from other headband styles.
I'll keep it for use.
The product quality is good, Amazon lacks a spirit of contract, the delivery person is very good.
I request delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon's rules do not allow delivery on Saturdays and Sundays.
It made me drive 200 kilometers from out of town to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person is very proactive and enthusiastic.
Give a thumbs up!
I tried the product briefly, it's not bad.
But I have never bought a similar product before, so I can't compare prices!
Size Logistics
The workmanship is okay, it's just that the logistics are too slow. The previous shoes were all DHL, this time Apex really... I've bought a lot of UA in China, the prices are not low, it feels like it's higher grade than NIKE ADIDAS?
Actually, they're all the same, so I shop overseas.
Size: I am 176CM tall, 68KG, my shoulders are wide and I usually wear 180, I bought M, the hem is slightly long, the rest fits well. I see some recommend size S, is their figure so slender? Or do they prefer tight-fitting? I think hoodies should be a bit loose.
The size is just right.
Chest circumference 99, height 184, weight 84 kilograms, before buying I consulted customer service and was told I should buy XXL, then I read the reviews and decisively bought L, after receiving it I found the size is just right, I almost got tricked.
The price on Singles Day is much more expensive than on Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The issue with Z's affordable goods is very troublesome!
I placed an order on the 18th, but didn't receive the goods until the 25th, it's like a snail's pace from Guangzhou to Beijing!
I bought Z's affordable goods, the description mentioned scratches, but after receiving the goods, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing!
My child didn't want to return the goods, thinking the problem wasn't big, but for such small parts, my child's grandfather couldn't find them in several nearby hardware stores!
In the end, the grandfather glued them on!
It seems that I can't buy Z's affordable goods in the future!
The quality of the toy processing is not good.
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, it's very hard to screw in the bolts, which shows the poor processing quality. I don't know how long it can be played with. Since it's something promised to the child, I won't return it.
Other reviews say that the installation is not strenuous, is it just the one I bought that has a problem?
Very average.
Is it because I'm unlucky?
The packaging is so old; the workmanship is very average; there is only one type of music and it's only 8 seconds long and then it repeats constantly; the action is just shaking its head and moving forward, with no variation.
It's not worth this price.
I need it urgently, so I won't return it.
The quality of the toy is good, but I have some complaints about the packaging.
I received the express delivery yesterday. It was purchased from Amazon and marked as shipped by EMS, but in the end, it was delivered by Tmall's express delivery. How many detours did it take? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall good?
Speaking of the packaging, it was just wrapped in a few layers of cling film, without any bubble wrap inside. When I opened it, all the parts were just lying in the empty box. Thankfully, the quality of the toy is good and there were no broken parts. However, it's much smaller than I imagined. Since it's not battery-operated, it often derails when pushed by hand. I feel that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, the design is unreasonable.
Good quality, fun.
Very fun, the components are highly precise, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is almost the same as Lego, the price is very favorable during activities.
The assembly process is quite interesting, I assemble, my 5-year-old son plays, it's pretty good.
He plays with continuous laughter~ Probably will continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The machine is new, overseas shopping is good.
I checked on Christmas, the one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the delivery is a bit slower now.
The machine is still good, all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then if you connect to the Poke Ball, you will get a Mew.
It's not bad to play, higher portability than PS4.
I have already bought Zelda, waiting for the game, try again.
Manufacturing junk, selling junk, resulting in junk service. I bought six watches to give to my children, one of which has an incomplete digital display. The time on all six watches is inconsistent, differing by several hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watches were checked for the correct time when they were stored. They replied "yes". If so, why is there such a big difference in time? It's clear that the watches are not accurate, simply put, they are inferior products. It's not that I'm being harsh, but look, they are selling products with obvious quality issues (incomplete digital display), aren't these junk?
I contacted the seller, and the seller gave a bunch of reasons, even complaining that I shouldn't have bought their products in the first place. With such products, such sellers, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future?
In short, I suggest not buying anything from this seller, because what you get is just junk.
Amazon Shipping Issue
Upon inspection after receiving the goods, it was found that:
1. The watch packaging is severely worn out.
2. The watch manual has serious usage creases.
3. The watch doesn't work, the desk lamp can't be charged either, and the time can't be adjusted.
4. Contacted Amazon customer service separately, can only ship to the United States at my own expense, and then reimburse the postage.
5. The reason for the 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.
I can only say it's passable.
The time is not very accurate, it's about one second faster every day, and it's already more than two minutes faster after only a few months of use.
I used to have a Citizen watch, and I feel it wouldn't be off by a few seconds even after one or two years.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the timer function is somewhat useless, basically not used, and occasionally it will accidentally enter the timer mode.
Solar Powered Sports Watch
Advantages: Solar charging eliminates the worry of battery replacement, features world time, multiple alarms, and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror surface is prone to scratches and dust ingress.
Cost-effectiveness: The general price in China ranges from 220-300, while overseas purchases cost around 180 (delivery time is about one week).
A very satisfying watch.
It's definitely genuine, I had it verified at the counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the craftsmanship is fine, the materials used are substantial, and it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight.

The worst shopping experience in history
On the evening of September 23, my wife's phone broke, and on a whim, I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock but not self-operated and there was no price increase (I was secretly pleased). Because it was not self-operated, the delivery was slow, and the system showed that the latest delivery would be on September 27.
My wife was very uncomfortable without a phone, so early the next morning at 6 o'clock, she asked me to think of a solution. I checked JD.com and saw that the 256G was in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I had to order another one immediately.
After buying the new one, I thought about cancelling the Amazon order immediately.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was impossible to receive the courier in the early morning. I called customer service at 7 o'clock to request to cancel the order, and the customer service replied that it had been cancelled and to wait for a text message notification.
Well, I waited patiently. At noon, I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there and had not been shipped. I immediately contacted customer service to cancel the order quickly, and the customer service replied that the operation was OK.
At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again and clearly told them that this was my third call, please cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship!
At my request, the customer service contacted the seller on the spot and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would wait until they were familiar with the system to cancel the order.
But they clearly told me that the seller already knew and would definitely not ship, so I could rest assured.
When I checked the order on Monday, it had actually been shipped. I was speechless.
Since I couldn't contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.
The subsequent handling was simply speechless, basically, I had to say a step, and then the customer service would follow up.
The order is still in the state of parcel rejection and is preparing to deliver again!
Can't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
The seller's company has received the money anyway, so it doesn't matter if they don't follow up.
In summary, I will definitely not prepay for large items in the future, this is too troublesome.
It looks very nice.

After searching online, I found that many people have this problem. I spent more than two hours changing various router settings. In the end, I used 360WIFI as a medium to fix it. During this time, I called Xiaomi customer service, but they didn't have any solutions to this problem, they just told me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another point worth noting is that I saw user comments online saying that the smallest storage card this camera supports is 8G. It can't recognize storage with smaller capacity, so please pay attention to this.
It feels okay to use, the picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor, the machine has a certain degree of heat. If it's always on, this level of heat is a bit hard to accept.

When I bought this phone, I thought about the feelings we had at the time, we could share weal and woe together, but now I can't bear to look back. Maybe that's life, there are some people you don't want to meet in your lifetime, some things you don't want to know in your lifetime, but what can you do?
How many times when I see this Samsung phone, I think of her, and the pain comes flooding in.

The Fuling-Nanchuan section, also known as the Nanfu Expressway, is the first project to be completed in the "New Thousand Kilometers" high-speed construction goal following the "Two Rings and Eight Rays" in Chongqing City. The Nanfu Expressway starts from the Nanchuan Interchange at Shuanghekou in Nanchuan District, passes through Pingqiao, Yajiang, Zili, Mawu, Hotel, Haoziba, and Longqiao, crosses the Yangtze River at Qingcaobei, passes through Lidu Industrial Park, and ends at the Ma'an Interchange in Lidu Street, Fuling District, connecting to the Changfu Expressway. The total length of the route is 55.97 kilometers, with five toll stations set up at Pingqiao, Yajiang, Mawu, Ronggui, and Lidu. The design speed is 80 kilometers per hour, with four lanes in both directions and a roadbed width of 24.5 meters. The project, with a total investment of about 4.7 billion RMB, is the first high-speed highway in Chongqing City to be built using the BOT and EPC models.
Application of System Genetics - Synthetic Biology, in the post-genomic era, synthetic biology technology uses computer-aided design, whole gene and genome synthesis technologies, to carry out artificial design of cellular signal transduction and gene regulation networks. Following genetic breeding, cell hybridization, transgenic organisms and other biotechnologies, it will become a new trend in the development of genetic engineering in the 21st century. System genetics reveals the structure, function and evolutionary mechanism of the genome, involving research in medical genetics, medical psychology and other gene system regulation, signal transduction networks, etc. It has opened up new paths for the diagnosis and drug screening of diseases such as tumors, genetic diseases, mental illnesses, aging, and for the pharmaceutical industry.
In May 1988, in order to promote investment and development in Hainan Island, the State Council issued the "Regulations of the State Council on Encouraging Investment and Development in Hainan Island" (State Council [1988] No. 26), stipulating that "foreigners from countries or regions that have diplomatic relations or official trade relations with our country, who come to Hainan Island for investment, trade, economic and technical exchanges, visiting relatives, or tourism, and stay for no more than fifteen days, can apply for entry visas temporarily at Haikou or Sanya ports; if there is a legitimate reason to extend the stay in Hainan Island or to transfer to other areas within the country, they can apply for visa extension or endorsement according to relevant regulations." At the same time, it stipulates that "Taiwan compatriots can directly apply for the 'Taiwan Compatriots Travel Certificate' at the ports of Hainan Island."

In March 1947, Colombia held parliamentary elections, with the left wing of the Liberal Party winning most of the seats. The Liberal Party had a total of 35 seats in the Senate, of which 22 were held by the left wing of the Liberal Party, while the Conservative Party only had 28 seats. In the House of Representatives, the Liberal Party won 74 seats, with the left wing reaching 44 seats, and the Conservative Party had 57 seats. Meanwhile, Gaitan was elected as the Speaker of the Senate and the National Assembly. In June, the moderate faction of the Liberal Party recognized Gaitan as the sole leader of the Colombian Liberal Party. In October of the same year, Gaitan won again in the municipal elections in Bogota. At this time, the Liberal Party members of Congress passed a resolution, declaring Gaitan as the next presidential candidate. This decision caused panic in the Conservative Party government, and the Conservative Party government fell into a crisis.

On April 24, 1865, Alexander II's eldest son, Crown Prince Nikolai Alexandrovich (1843-1865), died of tuberculosis. The 20-year-old Alexander III became the Crown Prince. Nikolai was originally set to marry Danish Princess Maria Sophie Frederica Dagmar (Maria Feodorovna) (November 26, 1847 - October 13, 1928) that year. Shortly before his death, knowing his days were numbered, Nikolai specifically instructed his younger brother Alexander to marry Princess Dagmar. Alexander promised his brother to marry his fiancée, the Danish Princess, and the two were married on November 9, 1866. They had a harmonious marriage and had four sons and two daughters.
Individuals avoid responsibility due to four mindsets: The passive mentality of children leads to some passive behaviors, such as waiting and watching, not knowing what they should actively do in their work, always waiting for the supervisor's command; Some people are overly subjective, ignoring objective facts, which leads them to not see that some things should be their responsibility; And some extremely selfish people, when faced with responsibility, will start to blame others, or use some means to cover up the truth, always appearing innocent in front of responsibility; There are also some people who always shirk responsibility, this is because they feel inferior, believing that their abilities are not sufficient to complete tasks.
The temple houses over 100 inscriptions from the Tang to the Qing dynasties, preserved in the main hall and the stele corridors on both sides of the main hall (built in 2000). The main hall contains many inscriptions from various dynastic renovations, while the stele corridors contain many inscriptions taken from other temples in Yixing that no longer exist. Famous inscriptions include the General Zhou Mansion Stele from the sixth year of Yuanhe in the Tang Dynasty (811), the Beheading Dragon and Shooting Tiger Stele from the fourth year of Chunxi in the Southern Song Dynasty (1177), and the Cloud Dragon and Wind Tiger Stele from the fourth year of Chunyou (1244) (all in the main hall), as well as the Tang Zhenyi Female Stele, Song Su Dongpo's Chu Song Stele, Song Li Zeng's Life Stele, and Ming Jingyun's Branch Calligraphy (all in the stele corridor).

In Shane Johnson's novel "Ice", there appears a spaceship modeled after the lunar module and lunar rover. The novel describes an imagined tragedy of Apollo 19: the lunar rover was transported to the moon by the Saturn IB rocket and landed at the scheduled landing site. Then, the Apollo astronauts performing the J mission landed precisely near the lunar rover with the traditional lunar module (which reminds people of Pete Conrad's landing in the Apollo 12 mission). Later, the ascent engine of the lunar module LM-13 failed to ignite, leaving two astronauts stranded on the moon - in fact, such an incident never happened in the Apollo program.
On December 6, the Guizhou Provincial Health Commission announced that mandatory nucleic acid testing at airports, train stations, high-speed rail stations, long-distance bus stations, highway epidemic prevention service points and other places has been cancelled, but "on-the-spot testing" services for those who wish to be tested will continue to be provided; For those taking subways, buses, taxis and other urban public transportation, or entering parks, residential areas and other public places, there is no longer a need to check for a negative nucleic acid test result; Long-term homebound elderly, people working or studying from home, infants and young children, and others who do not participate in social activities, if they have no need to go out, they can opt out of community nucleic acid screening; When purchasing antipyretics, antivirals, antibiotics, cough and cold medicines, there is no need to register with real names or provide a negative nucleic acid test result.
In 1999, after Li Ai won the Ford Supermodel of the World China Championship, she represented China in the world competition. Due to her fluent English, natural charisma, and good eloquence, she gained a lot of support from foreigners before the competition. Also, because of her fluent English and good popularity, she voluntarily became a liaison officer, serving as a translator for Chinese journalists. Eventually, she won the Most Media Welcome Award in the final, which is the Best News Award in the world competition. After returning to China, Li Ai chose to continue studying at a university in Guangzhou instead of directly entering the modeling industry. She even gave up the opportunity to develop abroad, so she only started participating in some related modeling activities after graduating from university.
On December 15, 2021, the Traffic Management Bureau of Shijiazhuang City Public Security Bureau once again issued the "Notice of the People's Government of Shijiazhuang City on Urban Road Traffic Management", announcing that motorcycles (including fuel and electric two and three-wheelers) are prohibited from driving within the scope of the urban third ring road (including main and auxiliary roads). Military, police, and fire motorcycles are not restricted when performing official duties.

At the time, the Bulls were celebrating joyously, and among them, a reporter asked Michael Jordan, "Does Dennis Rodman have a chance to compete with you for the NBA Finals MVP?" Michael Jordan, who is universally recognized for his competitive spirit and unwillingness to admit defeat, responded, "Without a doubt, I believe he absolutely has the qualifications. His performance is truly astonishing!" However, in the end, Michael Jordan still beat Shawn Kemp's 3 votes and Dennis Rodman's 2 votes with 5 votes to win the NBA Finals MVP, which was also the most controversial of the six times he won the NBA Finals MVP in his basketball career.
Under the arrangement of Teacher Yueying, Zhenye, who won the grand prize, was arranged by Duhu Art to enter the entertainment industry to further study acting, becoming an important role in the famous TV series, welcomed by the audience, and met her new boyfriend, idol star Li Meimao. However, the glamour of the entertainment industry led to a lot of jealousy and framing. Also, due to Hayami Masumi temporarily confining Zhenye's missing mother to promote Zhenye's movie, it indirectly led to her death, causing Zhenye to fall into the trap of an actor trying to replace her due to anger and sadness, and disappear before the performance. In the end, she was expelled from the entertainment industry for misconduct.

This parameter is only available on Pentium III processors with the core codenames Katmai and Coppermine. The processor serial number is a unique 96-bit binary number (only 64 bits are actually used), with each processor corresponding to a single serial number. Through the serial number, the entire process from production to sales use of the processor can be tracked. Intel claims that the reason for introducing this feature is "to enhance the security of e-commerce, such as only being able to use a certain bank card on a certain computer". However, it has caused strong privacy and national security controversies in many countries and regions such as China, the United States, and Europe. The public believes that this feature infringes on user privacy rights, and those with malicious intent can use this feature to track others' computers. Moreover, if Intel's serial number database is leaked, it will bring immeasurable losses. National security agencies in many countries believe that the intelligence departments of hostile countries can easily record and analyze computer activities using this feature. Under market pressure, Intel disabled this feature starting from the Pentium III processor with the core codename Tulatin, and has never used this feature in subsequent products such as Pentium 4 and Core processors.
"The Dawn: My Feelings Concert" was held at 8 pm on December 18, 1991. The venue, with over two thousand seats, was fully occupied, with young women making up the majority. The organizers deployed additional security guards to prevent the audience from approaching the stage. The media reported that the audience's support for Dawn had reached a frenzied level, and security guards had to go on stage to ensure his safety. There were several instances of chaos throughout the night, with audience members constantly walking up to the stage to shake hands with Dawn, resulting in two audience members' hands being stepped on. There were also children crying. Dawn told the audience that everyone has their stubborn moments, but he believes that everyone should be united, reasonable, and maintain a calm demeanor. Seeing the audience get hurt would cause him even more pain, and he urged the audience to shout out immediately if they were stepped on at the venue. He would rather stop the concert than sing if there was chaos in the audience. After Dawn finished speaking, the audience responded with cheers and applause. After the concert ended, Dawn left through a secret passage, with some audience members still waiting outside in the parking lot.
An article published in "Billboard" magazine in August 2021 pointed out: The fan base of the group has "through fair and square means" exploited loopholes in the charts, boosting the ranking of singles like < Butter > in the United States, helping the song to top the Hot 100 for several weeks in a row; Although the chart performance of the Hot 100 usually depends on streaming and airplay, the chart performance of < Butter > mainly comes from sales-driven (most of which come from BTS's online store, which allows fans to buy multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) and fan-led crowdfunding activities (including purchases that only count towards U.S. sales made using funds raised from the global fan base on services like PayPal); However, an article in "The Korea Times" refuted the allegations of chart manipulation, arguing that the fan bases of other artists like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande have also adopted similar promotional measures, which are neither illegal nor unethical, and fans participating in these measures are simply "globally trend-setting smart consumers".
It can be basically confirmed that the last common ancestor had genes and genetic coding, and its genes were likely composed of DNA, hence the last common ancestor appeared after the RNA world; and in its condition of having DNA, its DNA coding used the same four types of nucleotides as today, namely adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T); its DNA maintained a double helix structure with DNA polymerase, a template-dependent enzyme, and its DNA polymerase may belong to the D family of polymerases; the integrity of its DNA structure relied on a class of enzymes that include DNA topoisomerases for maintaining and repairing DNA structure; in addition, if its genetic coding basis was DNA, then these codes would be expressed through single-stranded RNA as an intermediary, and its RNA would be generated through DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and its RNA coding would use nucleotides similar to DNA, but the thymine in DNA would be replaced with uracil; furthermore, this organism would have various proteins including tissue protein folding proteins.
Ranked 10th on the Heaven and Earth Duel List, the manager of the team <Six Paths of Chaos>, Heaven and Earth is a country always in war, where warlords divide the territory, and the daimyos fight for each other's land. Even the de facto leader, the Great General who subdues the barbarians, is just a daimyo with more territories. The strength of the Tien soldiers here is the highest among the seven major countries, with an average comprehensive level of over 300. Therefore, the players who can stand here are among the top in other countries. Although they are only ranked 10th in the duel here, they are equivalent to the 5th in the kingdom. Under the temptation of Soul Selling, they led the team to attack the village temporarily without the protection of the daimyo, planning to sell the villagers as slaves, but were stopped by the bandit king Desert who arrived later. However, Soul Selling used the creation to control and attack the Desert, but was wiped out by the Desert. Later, they went to the prison and planned to stand at the top of the prison, so they attacked the Crime King, but were killed by the Crime King's Diamond Eraser until only the Hungry Ghost Dao Xihuamaru was left. Then, under the suggestion of the Crime King, they fought against Gabriella and were defeated miserably, and she was given the nickname of Nightmare.
The loader of the Ankou Team (Vice President of the Student Council), a second-year B class student in the general department of Oarai Girls High School, first appeared in Episode 1 of this series. She is a heavy military enthusiast with extensive military knowledge. She loves tanks more than anyone else and becomes enthusiastic whenever the topic of tanks or military-related subjects comes up. To make use of this knowledge, she joined Miho's team. She greatly admires Miho, who comes from a prestigious tankery family, and always addresses her as "Nishizumi-sama". She was given the nickname "loyal dog" by netizens. Although she has a wealth of military knowledge, she couldn't find an opportunity to use it. However, through continuous practice, she inadvertently developed strong survival skills. Whether it's battlefield reconnaissance, infiltration, survival in harsh environments, or outdoor cooking, nothing can stump her. Because of these skills, she was able to easily untie the anchor knot of the Shark Team's (Flint's) in the first episode of the final chapter. However, during three reconnaissance missions, she was caught twice. The only time she wasn't caught was during the infiltration mission at Anzio High School, from which she returned easily.
In May 2013, Giovanini was invited to join Eastern as a key player for the club's return to the A Division, and on December 14, 2014, he scored his 100th goal in Hong Kong in a match against his former club Standard Wanderers, securing a decisive victory. After the match, he was awarded a commemorative trophy by Eastern. He then participated in the newly formed Hong Kong Premier League with Eastern and was elected the most valuable player of the league in April and December. After the season ended, he was once again selected as one of the best eleven in the Hong Kong Football Star Election, with 17 league goals making him the top scorer of the inaugural league. For the first time, he won the highest honor in local football, the Hong Kong Footballer of the Year. However, he encountered a goal drought at the beginning of the 2015/16 season, and it was not until December 13, 2015, in an away game against Yuen Long, that he scored a goal. Later, on April 22, he was given a starting opportunity in an away game against South China, where he scored twice to help Eastern win their first league championship since coming to Hong Kong with a 2-1 victory. As a result, he defended his title as the league's top scorer with 10 goals and was again selected as one of the best eleven.
The M4 Sherman (76mm turret type) tank commander and communicator (deputy leader of the tank unit) is a second-year high school student at Sanders University. She first appeared in episode 4 of this series. She is skilled at devising various tactics and is the strategist of the entire team. However, she tends to become very emotional and easily nervous during tank competitions. During the competition with Oarai Girls Academy, her panicked and embarrassed behavior disrupted her performance, affecting the morale of her teammates. She exploited a loophole in the rules and secretly used a spy balloon to eavesdrop on information, but this backfired, causing her team to lose their advantage and ultimately lose the battle. She was also punished by Kay. When she is upset or angry, she inexplicably mentions her crush on a boy (Akio). In the movie version, she was comforted by the Rabbit Team. Although she usually has a sharp tongue and is full of cunning ideas, she is essentially naive and just a girl with a rich personality and a bit of silliness. In episode 3 of the final chapter, she fell into a trap set by the high school, resulting in the destruction of the flag tank she was in.
The activation of the achievement system also requires the character's adventure level to reach above 10 to be available. After the latest expansion pack, The Shadow Odyssey (abbreviated as TSO), officially launched in November 2008, the achievement system was divided into three types: the profession-specific system, the branch profession system, and the TSO profession system. The newly added TSO profession achievement system in The Shadow Odyssey is roughly divided into the basic profession line, four major profession branch lines (fighter, mage, priest, scout), detailed profession branch lines (warrior, knight, monk, witch doctor, pastor, druid, bard, wanderer, thief, warlock, summoner, illusionist), and profession-specific branch lines (specific to each profession). Each branch line must first accumulate 10 points before continuing to the next branch line. Except for the basic profession line, which does not have a special ultimate move, all other branches have special ultimate moves, all of which require 10 points in that branch line to unlock the ultimate move. The final profession-specific branch line has two ultimate moves, and after they are unlocked, they will each give the player a title.
Even if the revision takes effect, public holidays that overlap with Saturday can theoretically still reach 5 days per year, but this situation only occurred in 1999 (that year, the first three days of the lunar new year and the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival did not overlap with Sunday, and there was no situation where a holiday was made up on Saturday, but public holidays that overlapped with Saturday still reached 5 days, namely the day after Good Friday, Labor Day, Buddha's Birthday, the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, and Christmas). From 2011 to 2046, the maximum number of public holidays that overlap with Saturday each year is 4 days, with an average of 2.78 days, as shown in the table below (public holidays for 2024 and beyond have not yet been announced, assuming that the "Public Holiday Ordinance" will not be revised again until 2046; since the transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997, the "one country, two systems" and the 50-year unchanged period will expire on July 1, 2047, and the laws and systems implemented in Hong Kong thereafter are still unknown, so calculations for 2047 and beyond are not included).
This paradox points out that there is no limit-addable measure defined on the sphere, the value of which is equal for all mutually identical subsets (Hausdorff also proved that there is no countable addable measure that can be defined on all subsets), and the structure of the group formed by the rotation of the sphere plays a key role here - this statement does not hold on the plane or line segment; in fact, Banach later proved that for all bounded subsets on the Euclidean plane, it is possible to define an area where all mutually identical subsets have equal measures (this is also true for the length on the real number line); however, this only has finite additivity, so it is not a measure in the full sense, but for the property of "all mutually identical subsets have equal measures", this measure is equal to the Lebesgue measure, which means that two equi-decomposable open sets on the plane or real numbers have the same area.
After the exploration, New Sam discovered three jammers and recorded their coordinates. When he returned to the base, Old Sam had just found the secret room where the clones were kept. The secret room was located under the ground next to the sleeping box. Since it was only discovered when they returned, it had not been found before. The two Sams then entered the secret room and found hundreds of Sams, each kept in a freezer and not yet awakened. While New Sam continued to explore the secret room, Old Sam took a video phone out, destroyed one of the jammers, and contacted Sam's family on Earth. After the call, he found out that his wife had died years ago, his daughter was already 15 years old, not 3 years old as shown in the video. The videos sent by his wife over the past three years were actually received by the real Sam during his three years at the base. The company saved these videos and played them in order to the subsequent Sams. The real Sam had actually returned to Earth and stayed at home long ago.
Before his debut, Li Junhao once lost consciousness for 10 minutes when he fell headfirst while practicing stunts. After his debut, during the preparation period for "I'll Be Back", he had a serious accident again while practicing stunts, resulting in a severe right shoulder injury due to a ruptured tendon and cartilage. He postponed surgery for 2 years due to group activities. However, on the eve of 2PM's second Asian tour concert in Shanghai on November 17, 2012, Li Junhao injured his waist during rehearsal. After seeing a doctor, he was diagnosed with a spinal fracture. He went on stage with bandages to complete the tour. Although he persistently tried to rehabilitate and exercise afterwards, the results were not good. When performing, if there was pressure on his shoulder, he would take painkillers to endure it. Therefore, he was rated as level 4 in the military service physical examination and was not able to serve active duty. After continuous rehabilitation treatment, he fulfilled his national defense duty as a social service personnel and enlisted on May 30, 2019, and was discharged on March 20, 2021.
At the moment of destruction, the influence of the strong and weak energy stones, as well as what Kesa finally realized, the lament of the earth seen in his eyes, transformed into a traveling mage. The reborn Kesa then resolved to end the endless dream of Nefreksia, spending his life as a traveling mage opposing Nefreksia. Unfortunately, his individual power was not enough to resist Nefreksia. Over an almost endless period of time, Kesa was constantly preparing for a counterattack on the continent, while also traveling through time and space, seeking alliances with other traveling mages, in order to resist the final invasion of Nefreksia. He even went so far as to join forces with Yogmoth in the end, in order to achieve the final victory. The product of Kesa's hybrid plan, 'Gerald', who possesses Kesa's blood, led the ancient artifacts and Kahn, loaded with surpassing thoughts of hardship, hatred, love, and sadness on the Clear Sky, and finally resisted the time-space fusion of Nefreksia, and destroyed Nefreksia.
To accelerate the modernization process of school education and cultivate high-level international talents with a global perspective and international competitiveness, we have successively established cooperative relationships with more than 60 universities and research institutions in over 50 countries and regions including the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. By implementing Sino-foreign cooperative education programs, we actively introduce advanced educational concepts and high-quality educational resources from developed countries. We have successively cooperated with the Pacific National University of Russia, Portland State University of the United States, and Youngstown State University of the United States to offer undergraduate programs in architecture, engineering management, civil engineering, electrical engineering and automation. We have also conducted academic exchanges and research cooperation with the University of Iowa, the San Francisco Art University, the University of Leicester, and other foreign universities and research institutions through teacher exchange programs, student exchange programs, and overseas talent introduction. The school has appointed more than a hundred experts and scholars, including foreign academicians of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, as honorary professors, visiting professors, etc., and invites more than 50 foreign experts and scholars to give lectures at the school every year. Every year, more than 300 teachers and students are sent abroad for academic exchanges, research cooperation, inspection visits, and study abroad.
The producers are Wang Jie and Li Shixian, the album is a double CD, each containing 10 songs. "Love Mine" refers to the representative works that Wang Jie's fans like, and "I Love" are the good songs and latest songs that Wang Jie himself likes. In this album, Wang Jie switched to a low voice to reinterpret his past classic songs and other people's representative works. The market response was quite good. The first batch of 30,000 copies in Taiwan were sold out within a week, and it ranked second in the sales chart in the first week of release. It broke through 50,000 copies within a month, and the main song "I'm Better Than Him" also ranked second in the song chart. The TV announcement of "Guess Guess Guess" even set the highest ratings in 2003. The subsequent "Wang Jie Classic Charity Concert" held in Taiwan was also quite successful. However, the concert originally scheduled in Hong Kong was cancelled due to the SARS epidemic. In April, after the album was released in Singapore, although he did not go there for promotion, he achieved the excellent record of winning the sales chart for five consecutive weeks.
Some people might think that saying "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" is reversing cause and effect, and that the real cause and effect should be "more bad behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment". However, research shows that the relationship between corporal punishment and bad behavior is indeed "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children", not "more bad behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment", and this point of "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" is supported by post-hoc analysis. In addition, even after controlling for various factors that may influence children's behavior, such as parents' social status, the point that "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" still holds true. That is, corporal punishment itself does indeed lead to more bad behavior in children, and its negative impact cannot be explained by any other possible reasons. There is also research that believes that an education strategy that emphasizes both care and supervision can effectively reduce the incidence of bullying, while rejection, neglect, and corporal punishment are positively correlated with the incidence of bullying.
The original MV was released on December 14, 2012. In the MV, the Sandman is played by Melanie Gaydos. She first appears next to Richard Kruspe in his dream, plunging him into a state of agony. Meanwhile, Till kidnaps a group of orphans and locks them in a cage in the main bathroom. A female guard tries to protect the children with a shotgun, but Till defeats her. The guard alternates between young and old, but Till's age remains unchanged, symbolizing his immortality and superpowers. When guarding the orphans, Till appears in a bizarre costume. The children are then used by other band members for various examinations and surgeries. One of the surgeries involves extracting the children's tears with a syringe and then injecting them into the Sandman. She is dressed in a skirt with two children on it, indicating the relationship between tears and in vitro fertilization. When Till leaves the main bathroom, the children (played by band members) escape from their cage and the orphanage, causing Till to rip out and eat his own heart, while the orphanage is engulfed in flames.
The game company Orange launched a free dedicated server for the game Paradise on February 20, 2014, which allowed free login. The next day, the popularity of the Bahamut Paradise Hara board reached 660,000. The free server's features depend on the level of the VIP system purchased by the player, and the services provided at each level are different. Starting from September 21, 2017, an international server was launched that synchronizes updates with the Korean version. It requires a monthly fee of 660 New Taiwan dollars and prohibits all cheats. It also allows players to record and report cheating players, blocking their accounts for 7 days, or even permanently in severe cases. However, after the international server was updated to the Remastered version, the addition of the PSS cheat system made players unsure whether Orange would continue to implement this policy. Starting from January 9, 2020, the international server officially synchronized with the original Korean version and became completely free (in fact, all international servers were free to log in after the Weiton server was opened on December 20, 2019). Starting from November 8, 2017, the monthly free server permanently has an NPC instructor Bell who can quickly level up to 90. On August 8, 2019, the international server officially updated to the remastered high-definition version of Paradise R.
The leader of the Origami Alliance, Guanglong's father, has always fantasized about reaching the Elf World to dominate the entire world. After 26 episodes of fierce battles, he was knocked into the Elf World by Zhizhe, but unexpectedly arrived at the cage of the demon wolf Fenrir and was absorbed. Due to the opening of the Moon Road, the absorbed leader also came to Neo City to destroy the Earth. He absorbed a large amount of Maijia origami, and the demon wolf Fenrir officially resurrected. In order to protect the place connected to the stone tower on the moon and the central tower, he left a clone to guard it. Under the instigation of Wu Jingzhi, he absorbed the Maijia origami beast that was researched to deal with Maijia origami and returned to its original state. However, he used the moon to make the demon wolf Fenrir completely resurrected on the earth (universe). After Fenrir was fully resurrected, he once thought of resisting Fenrir from within, but he had no strength. Later, after Fenrir was defeated, he returned to his original state without a mask, but he went to stabilize the Elf World with Guanglong's mother.
This military campaign record notes that Kenshin placed Kagekatsu at the highest position among the other Uesugi clan members (Yamakura, Kamijo, Koshi, etc.), and Kagekatsu commanded the most troops in the family (originally, the one with the most troops was Yamayoshi Toyomori; after Toyomori's death in the 5th year of Tensho (1577), part of his vassal group was assigned to the fifty cavalry units directly under Kagekatsu, and incorporated into Kagekatsu's Ueda group). The vassals referred to Kagekatsu in a similar way to Kenshin's honorific title "Lord Jitsujo", calling him "Lord Nakajo". Other clan members were referred to as "Jurodono" and other common names, or were addressed by their surname followed by "dono" (Yamakura Kuniyoshi and Kamijo Masashige were Kenshin's adopted sons, but they became the heads of separate families). As Kenshin's adopted son, Kagekatsu, who received the same honorifics as Kenshin such as "Lord", "residence (Nakajo)", and "sama", was likely given a higher status.
In 1818, Sir Raffles was appointed as the Deputy Governor of the British colony Bencoolen. He firmly believed that Britain must find a strategic location that could surpass the then dominant Netherlands. At that time, trade lines connected China, Britain, and India, and trade with China in particular needed a base. In addition, the Netherlands stifled British trade in the region, and Dutch-controlled ports banned the sale of British goods, especially in Batavia, the Netherlands, where the prices of levied goods were quite unfavorable. The challenge Raffles faced was to establish a new port within the Dutch sphere of influence. However, the British ports were no longer suitable as trade centers, they were all too far from the Strait of Malacca. When large ships needed to trade with Indochina, they had to enter from the adjacent Indian Ocean, otherwise they had to enter from the distant Sunda Strait. But these were too far from the main trade hubs, and other locations returned to the original problem - too close to the Netherlands, or there were other issues.
Established on December 11, 1981, the professional baseball league was initiated by six teams: Samsung, Lotte, MBC, OB, Haituo, and Sammi. The first professional game in Korean baseball history was held at Dongdaemun Baseball Stadium on March 27, 1982. In 1986, the Smile Eagles team, established by the Korean Gunpowder Group, officially joined as the 7th team in the league, marking the league's first expansion. In 1990, the Twin Bell Group also established the Twin Bell Raiders team, becoming the 8th team. In 2011, NCsoft's application was approved, establishing the NC Dinos as the 9th team, which started from the second army as per the rules and officially moved up to the first army in 2013. In the same year, KT Corporation acquired the rights to establish a new team, named the KT Wizards, which also started from the second army as per the rules and officially moved up to the first army in 2015. Meanwhile, the KBO League also became the professional baseball league with the most teams in a single league in Asian professional baseball.
The Dakivali family originally planned to take care of Malefenlefen alone, but she kept crying (another theory is that she was born mute), refusing to drink milk or let the women of the family help her bathe. It wasn't until the family brought in the Manigai family from another group that she was willing to drink milk, and when the Tu'uligit family came to help bathe or change diapers, she wouldn't cry. Therefore, her daily life was later taken care of by these two families, with the Dakivali family responsible for providing food and bringing the girl home at night (another theory believes that the ancestors of the two families were both created by Satan Yelu using divine power to take care of her). Another family, the Vikivan, was responsible for guard duty. When the baby girl began to eat solid food, she only ate parts like the heart, liver, and hind legs. Therefore, when the tribesmen hunted or slaughtered pigs, they had to dedicate these parts, which is the origin of the tribute (vadis).
In June 2022, the Mariners were once at a record of 29 wins and 39 losses, but they pulled off the second longest winning streak in team history with 14 consecutive wins before the All-Star Game. Since then, they have never fallen out of the top three wildcard spots for the postseason. On September 30, 2022, American time, the Mariners secured their postseason qualification by hitting a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to defeat the Athletics 2-1. After a 20-year gap, they made it to the postseason again, passing the record for the longest streak without a postseason appearance in the four major North American professional sports to the NBA's Sacramento Kings (the Kings have not advanced to the playoffs for 16 consecutive years). In Game 2 of the American League Wild Card Series, the Mariners were down by 7 points after the first 5 innings, but they showed resilience and tied the score in the top of the 8th inning with two big innings. In the top of the 9th, Adam Frazier's go-ahead hit allowed the Mariners to defeat the Blue Jays 10:9. With two consecutive wins in the American League Wild Card battle, they advanced to the Division Series to face the Astros.
Japanese athlete Rie Kaneto broke the Asian record twice in the same year the competition was held, making her one of the favorites to win the championship. Despite falling behind in the first half of the final, she managed to overtake her opponents in the second half and extend her lead. She eventually won the gold medal in her last Olympics with a time of 2 minutes 20.30 seconds, becoming the third Japanese athlete to win the gold medal in this event after Hideko Maehata and Kyoko Iwasaki. Russian athlete Yulia Efimova, who had been disqualified for a history of doping but later regained her eligibility through appeal, was booed by the audience when she entered the arena, but she still withstood the pressure and won a silver medal for the Russian swimming team with a time of 2 minutes 21.97 seconds. Chinese athlete Shi Jinglin, who missed out on a medal with a fourth-place finish in the women's 100m breaststroke, was still in seventh place at the third turn, but she sprinted at the last moment to win a bronze medal with her personal best time of 2 minutes 22.28 seconds.
Stürmer began to withdraw troops from the north of the encirclement and break through to the south, hoping to reach the north bank of the Kestenoy River and meet with the relief troops. The fanatical fighters in the breakout misunderstood the Soviet army, thinking that they had surrounded most of the 8th Corps. The besieged troops occupied three villages in the encirclement to gain a favorable starting line to break through the encirclement. The 105th Armored Grenadier Regiment of the 72nd Infantry Division captured these three villages. The already weakened regiment needed to mount an attack without cover and the Soviet army had dug trenches to defend. Colonel Robert Swift, the commander of the 105th Armored Grenadier Regiment, decided to counterattack at night. According to the agreement, wearing white camouflage clothes, winter coats, and white helmets, they quietly advanced, only a few kilometers away from the Soviet defenders. In the battle, the 105th Armored Grenadier Regiment captured the ridge within a few minutes. The next evening, the 105th Armored Grenadier Regiment arrived at Komarovka in a similar manner.
According to the current official timeline, the oldest work in historical years is "Skyward Sword", and the most recent is "Kingdom's Tear" (although Nintendo has not yet included this work in the aforementioned three timelines). However, in order to meet the needs of world view and timeline depth expansion in game production, most of the plot settings in this series will be revised retrospectively, supplemented or corrected in different works; for example, the Temple of Time mentioned in the 1998 work "Ocarina of Time", the time-space gate in the temple that can travel through time, was not explained until the plot of "Skyward Sword" released in 2011, and the two works have been released for as long as 13 years apart; this kind of retrospective narrative through the timeline effectively dissects and expands the world view of Zelda time and time again, and gradually unravels the plot mysteries of the works of all generations.
Due to the dragons gradually discovering the true identities of the eight great demons and the potential dangers of over-reliance on their magical abilities, the dragons began to develop the "Peerless Avatar Talisman". This talisman, unlike the usual avatar talismans, is made in a long strip shape with different materials, and the powerful ability hidden inside can be said to be the ultimate power to restrain the ancient demons. However, after the development was completed, the terrifying monster - a multi-gene body - created by the dragons' ambition to conquer the world, turned against the fairy world due to loss of control. This beast, both huge and ferocious, and eating everything, reached a terrifying level where even the fire magic could not burn it. In the end, as a last resort, the dragons had to activate the power of all the relics, sending the entire fairy world into outer space, to destroy the beast with the intense heat of the atmosphere. From then on, the civilization and technology on Earth, and the fairy world built on the moon, gradually lost their connection.

The M26 Pershing tank commander (a squadron leader who studied in the US), first appeared in the theatrical version. She graduated from a continuation high school, and her tank is marked with a blue triangle. Like (Kyoko), her squadron only has 7 M26 Pershing tanks and 1 M24 Chaffee tank. She is also the only team leader who wears glasses. Together with the other two squadron leaders (Hime and Kyoko), they form the "Bermuda Trio". However, the three of them are not related by blood, they are just sisters in name. When the three of them gather together, they can launch a tactic called "Bermuda Attack". In the theatrical version, they discovered three people from Anzio High School scouting on the roller coaster track and ordered to eliminate these three. While going to support her own team leader, she was destroyed by the Sunflower Squadron of Oarai Girls Academy and did not participate in the final battle. In the official theatrical version of the radio drama, like (Hime and Kyoko), she is super fond of her own team leader (Arisu Shimada) to the point of being a bit overprotective.
Most digital libraries provide a window that allows for resource queries. These resources are typically hidden deep within the network (or are rarely or even not at all on the network). These resources hidden in the network often cannot be found by people using search engines. Therefore, some digital libraries create special pages or websites that allow most search engines to find all their resources. Many digital libraries often use the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) to display their resources in other digital libraries in order to obtain post-data. Many search engines like Google Scholar, Google, Yahoo! and Scirus can also use OAI-PMH to find these resources hidden in the network. Therefore, through this agreement, both search engines and digital libraries can benefit, and it can also make their relationship more closely related and achieve the purpose of enhancing the characteristics of their own websites.
After Dream Junqi withdrew from the Hong Kong Super League, Laurence was loaned to the newly formed Hong Kong Super League club Standard Haotian in July 2016, and made his debut for Haotian in the league match against Hong Kong Club on October 2nd, where he was selected to play the full match. However, Haotian eventually lost 2-3. On October 16th, he scored his first goal since joining the team in the league match against Lee Man Wanderers, which led to the opposing player Keton being sent off with a red card. As a result, he helped Haotian draw 2-2 with the opponent. On November 27th, he started in the league match against the dominant Kitchee as a central player and played the full match, helping Standard Haotian to a surprising 0-0 draw with Kitchee. In his second season of his professional career, Laurence played 15 matches in all competitions and scored 2 goals. He also helped Standard Haotian successfully maintain their 9th place among 11 teams at the end of the season. However, the team was eventually disbanded due to the issue of returning management rights.
Since the final victory of the US military on Guadalcanal in early 1943, in addition to the counterattack in New Guinea by the US-Australian Allied Forces led by MacArthur and the US South Pacific Fleet led by William Halsey, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff also decided on a plan for the US Navy to begin a counterattack from the Central Pacific in late 1943. This plan was carried out by the US Navy's 5th Fleet, and received strong support from Nimitz in terms of military equipment and supplies. Before the Battle of the Gilbert Islands was launched, the 5th Fleet consisted of at least 10 aircraft carriers and more than 7 battleships, almost encompassing all the US naval forces outside of Thomas Kinkaid's 7th Fleet and Halsey's 3rd Fleet. The fleet commander was Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, who made his name in the Battle of Midway. His air attack force - the fast carrier task force number was originally designated as Task Force 50 during the Gilbert Islands campaign, and was reorganized as Task Force 58 during the Marshall Islands campaign, and continued to be used until the end of the Pacific War.
In the "Polarized Light" timeline, after K2 ordered to act separately, M950A acted with Thunder to rescue the commander, but the two were quickly caught up by a regular army squad. During the action, M950A's legs were blown off and she could only rely on Thunder for support, and she also fell into a coma. Just as the two were surrounded by the regular army squad and were about to be wiped out, a "prototype fairy" secretly took advantage of the regular army squad being distracted by other fairies, disassembled her own body to repair and upgrade M950A. After the upgrade, M950A's strength greatly increased, and she easily eliminated several regular army soldiers on her own. After moving Thunder to a safe place, she decided to act as bait to attract another batch of regular army troops. In the end, M950A lured the troops to the underground tunnel and shot the supporting beams, burying all the regular army troops in the tunnel (including herself). Afterwards, the injured M950A crawled out of the ground with her bare hands and engaged in combat with the regular army officer.
In the end, only over a hundred die-hard fans pre-ordered the Nut TNT, and the scarce production made the factory refuse to start work. These customers also couldn't get their goods. Some media people commented that this is also a fundamental problem of Smartisan: Luo Yonghao is extremely arrogant and has big dreams, but he seems to lack a huge pool of funds and innovative technology. At first, he attracted a group of fans by relying on a kind of "Chinese craftsman's dream" ideology and language to cater to the rebellious spirit of the internet youth. Some of these die-hard fans with some ability became employees, others became consumers, but ideology will always burn out one day and the market will eventually test your technical strength. At present, Smartisan only has the ability to create or rewrite apps, and is still in the stage of a brand factory that assembles upstream suppliers' stock. The spirit of craftsmanship is reflected in the creation of the shell, but there is actually little change that can be made to the phone shell. Now, automation technology also makes the shell process of each manufacturer not much different, and other brands are not necessarily "less refined".
Before 2021, problems such as hard-to-see pop-up information tags, extremely small close buttons, disguised pages, and clickbait appeared in the startup advertisements of Chinese apps. In July 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China initiated a special rectification action in the Internet industry, which included rectifying deceptive and misleading pop-up ads at app startup, forcing the provision of personalized services (including full-screen pop-ups as redirect links, providing fake close buttons when pushing targeted ads, etc.) and other behaviors infringing on user rights. This made many platforms standardize their advertisements, but at this time, some platforms, in pursuit of the benefits of startup advertisements, created a new "shake-to-view" advertisement, considering the user's "shake" as their consent to view the advertisement and thus evading rectification. At the end of that year, during the "Double Eleven" and "Double Twelve" periods, some apps launched "shake-to-view" advertisements. Although their push notifications were random and did not appear every time for every user, they triggered too sensitively and caused many complaints.
The first level is called "Musical Memory", which is a color symbol sequence memory. Players will enter a circular stage, above which is the game's boss, a toy rabbit named Bunzo. Players must follow the sequence of colors or patterns that appear on the screen, correctly hitting the circular buttons in front of them. The boss Bunzo will slowly descend from above the circular stage. When the player hits the correct sequence on the screen, Bunzo will be pulled back to the top, otherwise, he will descend quickly. If the correct sequence is not hit in time, Bunzo will jump down and kill the player. The level has a total of five rounds. When entering the fifth round, the sequence of the screen's questions will keep changing, and at this time there will be an exclamation mark emergency stop button circling the stage. After the player presses the emergency button, the game will be forcibly terminated. The first level ends, and Mommy Long Legs gives the first train password, then lets the player leave through the ventilation duct. The first level ends.
Konev now knew that the German army was breaking out, which angered him and made him determined to fulfill his promise to Stalin not to let any "Hitlerites" or "Fascists" escape the encirclement. However, the Soviet intelligence agency overestimated the armored strength of the German 3rd Armored Army at this time, so Konev went all out. At this time, the tank brigade under the Soviet 20th Tank Army brought the new Joseph Stalin-style heavy tanks to the Kursk battlefield. Konev ordered all available armored vehicles and artillery to fire at the breakout troops, cutting off the arched enemies and scattering them. The two Soviet infantry divisions responsible for the blockade, the 206th Sniper Division and the 5th Guards Airborne Division, had been defeated by the German breakout troops. Without infantry support, the Soviet tanks had to fire at the breaking out German army from a distance. Since there were no anti-tank weapons on the battlefield, the T-34 tanks rushed into the unprotected German army, and the command units, stragglers, and medics were all attacked.
In the 187th episode of the remastered comic, he faced the Ugly President and Gum, and was nearly swallowed by Gum several times during the fight, but was saved by Pig God each time. Later, in order to protect the hostages controlled by the Ugly President's mercenary group, he asked Pig God to prioritize taking the hostages away by swallowing them and then threw Pig God out of the battlefield. He then teamed up with Tornado to deal with the Ugly President. However, Tornado was knocked unconscious by the Ugly President and hit against the wall, leaving him alone to fight with the President's "Forearm Destruction Fist" using his "Vest Grappling" but was defeated, with both hands severely damaged. The President then attacked with his "Full Body Destruction Fist". Despite being seriously injured by the hit, he still muttered, "The power of the vest is eternal and indestructible". He was then brutally attacked several times by the "Full Body Destruction Fist", and in the end, all his limbs were twisted and deformed, and he was finally thrown to Gum to be swallowed, but was later saved by Silver Fang.
The design work of the Kirov-class cruiser officially began in 1968, codenamed Project 1144.1. The initial plan was for 8,000 tons, but Soviet leaders at the time, such as Brezhnev, seemed to prefer larger vessels. Due to the favorable environment for the development of the navy, the founder of the Soviet Navy, Gorshkov, was determined. The navy's top brass was active in the ministerial meetings, and they brought out the ambitions of Peter the Great, the Tsar of the Russian Empire, as evidence. Therefore, the design tonnage of this class of ship was 8,000 tons, equipped with 6-8 missiles with a range of 150 kilometers. However, this was no different from the Kresta II-class cruisers being built at the time, and there was also the larger tonnage, gas turbine-powered Kara-class under development. Such specifications could neither accommodate a nuclear reactor as originally planned, nor pass the review of the top brass who had a special preference for larger vessels. Therefore, the plan was revised several times, and the full-load displacement was finally increased to 15,000 tons and then to 20,000 tons, finally settling at 24,300 tons.
The 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade launched a landing operation with the support of the Royal Engineers' amphibious armored vehicles (first used on the European battlefield) and tracked amphibious landing vehicles of the British 5th Attack Group. The brigade planned to use amphibious landing vehicles to cross the entrance of Brackman Bay and land near Hofdeprat, which is a complete village on the opposite side of the pocket, thus applying pressure from both left and right. Although there were difficulties in mobilizing vehicles and a delay of 24 hours when passing through the canal, the German army was still shocked by the attack and the Allies quickly established a bridgehead. The German army quickly recovered and launched a fierce counterattack; however, they retreated slowly. The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade under the 4th Canadian Armored Division crossed the Leopold Canal and attacked the Isabella lowland area, while the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division was ordered to advance south from the encircled coastal area, which opened up the land supply route to the pocket.
McGee was born in the central English city of Birmingham and moved with his family to Dubai and Abu Dhabi when he was two years old. He can be said to have been born into a sports family, having been exposed to different types of sports from a young age. His mother excelled in tennis and golf, while his grandfather, who played as a left midfielder in his youth, had served in local famous clubs such as Birmingham and Kinningham. His father had once played for the youth teams of Stoke City and West Bromwich in England. At the age of 10, McGee moved with his father, who works in the construction industry, from Dubai to Hong Kong. Initially, due to the high property prices in Hong Kong, his parents chose to live in a village house near the countryside park in Sai Kung. Soon after, McGee enrolled in King George V School. He developed a strong interest in football at the age of 11 and had the opportunity to represent the school at the age of 14. The young McGee shone brightly in school competitions, becoming a mainstay of the school team, and only began formal football training at the age of 16.
People have different views on whether the abolition or retention of the death penalty should be decided by public opinion; in practice, there have been governments that have left the decision to public opinion. California in the United States once held a referendum on the death penalty in 2012. The content of the referendum was whether the public supported Proposition 34. Simply put, Proposition 34 was "Abolish the Death Penalty in California". Therefore, if the referendum result was to pass Proposition 34, California would abolish the death penalty, but if the referendum result was not to pass Proposition 34, California would retain the death penalty. Despite the side supporting Proposition 34 spending more than six times as much on publicity as those opposing it, the final referendum result was that 52% of voters opposed the proposition, and 48% supported it. Therefore, the proposition was not passed in the end, and California continues to retain the death penalty.
At the same time, on August 18th, the Polish 1st Armored Division, commanded by Rafał Maćkowiak, with 87 vehicles, captured Hill 262 (known in French as Mont-Ormel and in English as The Mace) on the eastern front of the Canadian army. This was to prevent any counterattacks launched by the besieged German army from the east. From this vantage point, they could also overlook the road from Chambois to Vimoutiers (now the only road to escape the encirclement) and attack the disintegrating German army. The Polish army repeatedly and fiercely attacked, especially on August 20th, when the 2nd Armored Division of the SS escaped the encirclement. They attacked and broke through from Vimoutiers. The Polish army suffered 325 deaths, 1,002 injuries, and 114 missing. They were replaced by the 21st Armored Regiment of Canada on August 21st. The German army had approximately 2,000 deaths, 5,000 prisoners, and 359 vehicles destroyed.
The reinforcing rib cage made of steel bars not only serves as the engine compartment structure but also as the landing gear connection skeleton. The nose weapon bay is also made of a steel bar skeleton wrapped in aluminum alloy. Inside, there are two 23mm caliber Madsen machine guns, plus two 7.92mm caliber Madsen machine guns. These two machine guns can swing left, right, up, and down, but they were changed to fixed 8 7.92mm caliber Browning M36 machine guns. Behind the cockpit is the bomb bay, which can carry a 400 kg bomb. Generally, it carries one 400 kg bomb or 2 200 kg bombs or 10 26 kg small bombs. The bombing is the responsibility of the observer. When he bombs, he uses a bombing sight to aim. In addition, he also operates the radio and aerial camera. If necessary, he also operates the defensive machine gun. Therefore, there is a suggestion to change it to three seats, that is, to add a seat between the pilot and the observer to share the observer's work.

When external energy is injected into an energy level system in the form of an electric field, photons, chemistry, etc., and is absorbed, it will cause electrons to transition from a low energy level to a high energy level. When the photons produced by spontaneous radiation encounter these electrons that have jumped to a high energy level due to the external energy, these high-energy electrons will be induced to migrate to a low energy level and release photons (so-called stimulated radiation). All the optical characteristics of stimulated radiation are the same as the original spontaneous radiation, including frequency, phase, and direction of advancement. When the photons of this stimulated radiation encounter other electrons that have jumped to a high energy level due to the external energy, they will produce even more of the same photons, and the intensity of the light will become stronger and stronger (i.e., the energy of the light beam is amplified). What is different from ordinary light is that all photons have the same frequency, phase (coherence), and direction of advancement.
After the two arrived at the warehouse auction venue, they would often encounter some competitors who were also bidding for the warehouse at the entrance. They would try to greet the other party and make some simple social pleasantries, and ask the other party whether there were any bidders to be aware of locally. Some venues often have bidders who are willing to spend a lot of money to bid for all items regardless of cost. These bidders are usually divided into two types. One is the big bidder with deep pockets, and the warehouse of the venue is often won by him. These big players have monopolized the local warehouse for a long time, they do not want outsiders to come to the auction to bid, so they will deliberately increase the bid amount regardless of cost, trying to drive away foreign bidders. The other type is the bidding novice, who does not know how to set a maximum bid, and randomly calls out bids, causing some warehouses that were originally very low in cost to be bid up. Other bidders often give up bidding because the bidding price is called too high, and the novice himself is therefore unable to make ends meet and suffers a heavy loss when leaving.
On November 6, 1983, the ND2 type internal combustion locomotive of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, pulling the 155th passenger train from Sankeshu Station to Shanghai Station undertaken by the Harbin Railway Bureau, ran to the downline departure signal machine east of Nanjing Station. Due to the low visibility in the foggy weather, the driver could not see the signal and stopped the train to identify the signal. At this time, the 773rd freight train ran to the downline 5th route signal machine. The driver, without clearly seeing the signal, blindly crossed the signal machine. When it continued to run to the 6th route signal machine, the driver saw the signal showing a red light. However, the crew mistakenly thought it was a red light that changed after the locomotive pressed on the track circuit, so they ran through the red light and continued to run, colliding with the just-started 155th passenger train. This resulted in the death of one freight handler on the 773rd freight train, one serious injury and 30 minor injuries to passengers on the 155th passenger train, an interruption of operation for 5 hours and 57 minutes, and a disruption of the downline mainline for 84 hours and 19 minutes.
On January 3, 2017, the ancient fantasy drama "Qi Xing Ji: The Young Hero in Fresh Clothes and Furious Horses", starring Wu Lei, premiered. He played the half-human, half-demon young hero Zhan Xiongfei in the drama, which had over 1.3 billion views by the end of its run. Subsequently, he co-starred with Lin Yun in the ancient fantasy drama "Battle Through the Heavens", adapted from the novel of the same name by Tian Can Tu Dou, and played Xiao Yan in the drama. On February 3, he continued to join the reality show "Twenty-Four Hours: Season 2". In March, he joined the drama film "Shadow". On May 5, he joined the original cultural exploration program "Seventy-Two Floors of Mystery" as a regular host. On September 30, the action film "Extreme Pursuit", in which he starred, was released. He played the genius teenager Tang Dingdong, who is proficient in various high-end technologies, in the film. In the same year, he also starred in the adventure-themed drama "Sand Sea", and played the key explorer Li Cu in the drama.
Aiden's sister, Nicky Pearce's son, Jackson Pearce, has turned 10 and is having a birthday party at her house. At this time, an unknown call starts to harass Nicky. Aiden manages to take down the harasser, but he finds out that the harasser was sent by someone else. He once again asks "Badboy17" for help. During this period, Aiden receives a call from Jordi asking him to pick up someone, only to find out that the person he picked up is from the South Side Gang in Chicago, and the leader of the other party is Dermot Quinn. The person he picked up was killed by Quinn because of his failed mission. After completing the task, Aiden blames Jordi, but Jordi says that as long as there is money, he will take any task and warns Aiden that if he is picked up, he will let Morris go. Aiden has no choice but to continue to accept.
Beizhu Beicun was born in Kowloon, Hong Kong, and has been playing football in Hong Kong since he was a child. He joined Kitchee's youth team in 2007 and studied at King George V School from 2007 to 2012. During this period, he scored 22 goals and made 22 assists for the school team. Later, he helped Kitchee U17 win the third place in the Youth League Football Association Cup. He even played in the reserve group matches for Kitchee as a local player. However, because his family hoped that Beizhu Beicun would succeed in his studies and have more options in the future, he put his dream of becoming a professional football player on hold due to his studies. He went to the United States for further studies in 2012. During the two years, he played 36 matches for the school team, with 21 starts, scoring 4 goals and making 7 assists. In 2014, he transferred schools and played 18 matches with 4 starts. All the goals he scored were to help his team win in the last minute. After graduating in 2015, he went on to study at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
After the leaves of the olive kernel tree wither, they are collected and boiled, then soaked. They can be used to create the so-called "black water" in aquariums, which can enhance the mating desire of Thai fighting fish and improve their fertility. Especially in the breeding of Thai fighting fish, it has been verified that olive kernel leaves release pigments and tannic acid, which darken the water, simulating the black water environment, stabilizing the fish's mood, relieving stress as quickly as possible, adapting to adverse conditions, and enhancing the color of the body, tail, and dorsal fin. It lowers the PH value (increases acidity), and contains a large amount of tannic acid, humic acid, and folic acid, which can regulate the pH value of the water. The softening effect of the water can make the water slightly softer, but it also depends on the hardness of the original water. If it is hard, more leaves need to be soaked to achieve the same effect. Aquariums soaked with large olive kernel leaves will mold later after organisms die, so it is inferred that large olive kernel leaves should have some antifungal and preservative functions to a greater or lesser extent.
On the eve of World War II, German firearms engineers conducted research on assault rifles. Their conclusion was that although the existing 8mm Mauser rifle bullets had a range of over 800 meters, the long range was difficult to utilize in actual combat. Scopes were not commonly equipped, and most soldiers' shooting skills did not reach the level of snipers. High firing rates could suppress the enemy in close combat, but the existing rifle bullets were too focused on range. Although they were powerful, the recoil was also too great. If they were to be used for fully automatic shooting, it would be difficult to hold them steady, and the hit rate during continuous firing was so low that it lacked practicality. Therefore, there was an idea to reduce the amount of propellant in the existing 8mm Mauser rifle bullets. By shortening the length of the ammunition, not only could the recoil be reduced, but the weight could also be lightened. As a result, this shortened version of the 8mm Mauser rifle bullet was introduced in 1938. The caliber remained at 7.92mm, and the length was about half of the previous Mauser rifle bullets.
Additionally, there are dances used for special occasions, such as the "Victory Dance" performed to celebrate war victories and praise achievements, and the "Friendship Dance" for social activities between neighbors or friends. After contact and warfare with white people, there is the "Ghost Dance" calling on ancestral spirits and the souls of fallen warriors to fight together, the "Corn Dance" danced to pray for or thank for a good harvest, or the "Booger Dance" danced to ward off diseases or by white people. The Booger is considered a demon by the Cherokee people. The Booger Dance is usually performed indoors, and some invited participants wear snake masks symbolizing the Booger (after contact with white people, devil horns were added), and use pseudonyms to indicate that they (the Boogers) are not dancing to harm humans but for the sake of dancing, and after the dance, they peacefully send the Booger away.
The promotion of cat litter bucket toilets first began in the Denver school district of Colorado, a state where numerous school shootings have occurred. When emergencies such as shootings occur at school, the police will ask teachers and students to hide in the classroom until the police have finished inspecting the campus and confirmed it is safe. John McDonald, the safety officer of Jefferson County Public Schools, said this idea was proposed a few years ago when a school in the area was locked down for several hours after a shooting threat, forcing students who needed to use the bathroom to resort to garbage bags and trash cans. After a shooting threat in April 2019, the district began equipping classrooms with portable toilets based on cat litter. Diana Wilson, a spokesperson for the district's public schools, said most teachers support this decision, and cat litter bucket toilets have been added to Denver's teacher supply list along with pop-up tents and first aid kits.
After the extinction of the Barariuru tribe, the location of the tribe became a place where the Haocha tribal people planted miscellaneous grains. Today, you can still see the related ancient city ruins, but the whereabouts of its survivors are completely unknown. On the other hand, although the Karishi tribe regained independence and rebuilt their homes, they also perished under a landslide and flood caused by heavy rain. Only in the current Wutai tribe (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township) are there some people who claim to be descendants of Karishi. In addition, because he led the tribe to win the war, the descendants of Bereng, Dalapathan (also known as Druluane and phonetically translated as "Lulan"), were also called "military chiefs". They uniquely have the highest place in the old Haocha tribe, Omomos (meaning "easy to fog"), and the original chief family Kadrangilan are listed as the two major chief families.
The infection cluster initially caused by cabin crew at the end of December 2021 belongs to the Omicron variant, and the virus gene sequencing shows that they are all the earlier appearing Omicron variant strain BA.1 subtype. The infection cluster caused by the quarantine hotel in early January 2022 belongs to the Omicron variant strain BA.2 subtype. Although both belong to the Omicron variant, there are 10 different mutations in their spike proteins. Preliminary studies in the UK and Denmark both show that the BA.2 subtype is more contagious than the BA.1 subtype. The BA.2 subtype leads to a higher breakthrough infection rate in people who have received two doses and three doses of the vaccine, but those who have been vaccinated may reduce the chance of transmitting to others. The first generation of transmission in the quarantine hotel cluster has reached 12 people, showing that the Omicron variant strain BA.2 subtype is more contagious than the previous strains found in Hong Kong, making it more difficult to prevent its widespread transmission.
Lu's Branch Ancestral Hall, located at No. 15, Taying Lane, Tianfeng Community, Jiangxia Street, Haishu District, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China, is a Qing Dynasty building. It is named after being an ancestral hall of a branch of the Lu family. The main building faces south from the north, with the hall three bays wide. The central bay uses a lifting beam, and the adjacent bays use a through-bucket style, adopting a beam structure unique to the Zhejiang region: flower buckets are supported above the five beams, intersecting with the lower ends of the paired beams used in pairs. The upper end of the column is a butterfly wood, and the lower end is a hanging basket-shaped bucket. On both sides of the front porch of the hall, there is a stone stele on each gable wall, with a pair of dragon playing with a pearl decoration on the stele. They are respectively "The Family Biography of Mr. Lu Jingfu" and "The Stele of Mr. Lu Jingfu, who was granted the title of Rulin Lang and the candidate for the same knowledge of the state by the Qing Dynasty". The Lu family in Ningbo moved here from Dinghai (now Zhoushan City) during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, and had declined by the end of the Qing Dynasty. It was announced as a cultural relics protection unit of Haishu District in August 2001, the renovation project was launched in 2011, and it was completed in 2013.
During the later years of his rule, Anastasius realized that his days were numbered, and he had three living relatives. However, Anastasius did not know who was the most suitable successor. So he summoned the three relatives to a room with three sofas, one of which had a letter hidden underneath. Whoever chose the right sofa would be eligible to become the successor. However, two of the relatives sat on the same sofa, and the other sat on another sofa, but no one chose the sofa with the letter. So Anastasius came up with another idea, whoever was the next person to walk in would be the successor. The person who walked in was Justin, his captain of the guard. Although Anastasius did not expect Justin to become the successor, he was very satisfied with the result. As a result, Justin became the emperor.
At that time, the Japanese navy had been ordered to blockade the waters of Hong Kong. When the British torpedo boat squadron sailed to the waters east of the Lantau Strait, they were discovered by the Japanese navy's Fir-class destroyers and the Hong-class torpedo boat Magpie. Due to the significant difference in firepower between the two sides, Chen Ce instructed the torpedo boat squadron to line up and speed towards the Japanese ships, pretending to launch a torpedo attack. In fact, in order to reduce weight and carry as many people as possible, and to avoid the risk of torpedoes exploding if hit by gunfire, the torpedo boats did not carry any torpedoes. However, when the Japanese ships saw the aggressive approach of the torpedo boat squadron, they were fooled and took evasive action. As a result, the torpedo boat squadron escaped the interception of the Japanese ships. After passing the Guozhou Islands, the squadron turned towards Dapeng Bay. In the end, Chen Ce and more than 70 others landed at Nan'ao on the Dapeng Peninsula. Afterwards, personnel from both China and Britain quickly scuttled all the torpedo boats to prevent the landing site from being discovered and tracked by the Japanese army. They then escaped to Huizhou, Guangdong by land.
Buddhism opposes some views of Brahmanism, such as in the "Jataka Tales," where the Bodhisattva questions why the Brahma god allows suffering and evil to run rampant, similar to the problem of evil. Some Buddhist scholars also deny the existence of the Brahman god from a logical level. Therefore, Buddhism does not believe that the meaning of life comes from the Great Brahma, who is still trapped in the cycle of reincarnation. In addition, Buddhism also denies that Brahma is the origin of all things, considering Brahma as just one of the five manifestations of Nirvana. Therefore, some Hindu theologians later accused Buddhism of promoting nihilism, but Buddhism refuted this claim, believing that the root of all things is "emptiness". It is the nature of emptiness that allows all things to appear and change, and the meaning therein constantly arises with dependent origination and ceases with the cessation of conditions. Therefore, everything in the world is not meaningless, but because of impermanence, meaning cannot last forever in the world.
In his mid-career creations, apart from inheriting Dai Jin's style, he also learned from Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, focusing on freehand brushwork. At the same time, he imitated the line-drawing character paintings of Li Gonglin and Gu Kaizhi, and also studied from Liang Kai, Wu Daozi, Liu Songnian and others. His paintings became more relaxed, simple, broad and vigorous. At this time, Wu Wei was quite famous in the capital and was summoned into the palace. However, due to his rebellious nature and discomfort with palace life, and his disdain for the flattering and opportunistic upper society, he resigned from his position in the painting academy. This caused a great change in his thinking, completely reversing his youthful ambition to pursue fame and stand out. His character became even more wild and unrestrained, indulging in pleasure, which was related to the drunkenness of the wealthy at the time. At this time, he rarely painted, with works like "Portrait of the True Man of the North Sea", "Fishing in the Snowy River", and "Song and Dance Picture", reflecting the author's inner portrayal and genuine emotions observed from life.
The Camel-style fighter was developed from the same company's Puppy-style fighter, with a larger, heavier, and more powerful air-cooled radial engine that increased the power of the Camel-style from the Puppy-style's 80 horsepower to 130 horsepower. The number of machine guns on the nose of the aircraft also increased from one to two, of course, in conjunction with a firing synchronization system copied from the Germans. In order to prevent the machine gun from jamming due to the cold at high altitudes, a fairing was added. Originally, this aircraft was called "Big Dog", but due to the protruding shape of this fairing, it was renamed "Camel". This made the nose of the aircraft heavier, but the horizontal tail did not increase in size as a result, making the Camel-style somewhat head-heavy and unstable during flight. This made it difficult for pilots who were just starting to fly the Camel-style, but experienced pilots could take advantage of this instability to increase the flexibility of the Camel-style in air combat.
After more than twenty years of brilliant achievements, the national team's abnormal rapid decline in performance has been unacceptable to many fans. Part of the reason is that fans cannot accept the country's sudden drop in speed. The Greek national basketball team suffered heavy losses in the European Championships in 1999 and 2001, and also lost the qualifications for the Sydney Olympics and the 2002 World Championships. The poor record caused problems in the relationship between the team and the Greek Basketball Association. Eventually, the Greek national basketball team underwent a major adjustment before the 2003 European Championships, hiring a new coach Ioannidis and promoting a new batch of young players. This adjustment achieved some success, with the Greek team finally finishing fifth in the '03 European Championships. However, the public was still not very satisfied, because fifth place is still a long way from success.
While waiting by the Beast Titan during the Survey Corps' mission to reclaim, he went to assist after Reiner called for help. As soon as he appeared, he caused heavy casualties to the Survey Corps, almost reaching a situation where half of their combat power was lost. He then fought with the Survey Corps and the transformed Eren, easily defeating all enemies, even kicking Eren into the wall. When he tried to capture Eren, he was distracted by Armin's anchor from his vertical maneuvering equipment piercing his teeth, and after severely burning Armin with superheated steam and preparing to capture Eren again, he only found that Eren's Titan was left with a body formed by hardening. He was then captured by Eren using a blade to cut his neck, and only then did he realize that everything was a feint. He was devoured and killed by the transformed Armin, who took the power of the Titan. Before his death, he briefly called for help from his peers, but realizing that they were now enemies, he changed to calling the names of Reiner and Annie.
In August 1945, Japan surrendered unconditionally, and he returned to his hometown to run a clock shop, studying photography technology on his own. He later often went to Hiroshima to photograph the surviving "bomb victims" (victims of the atomic bomb), and from 1952 for over ten years, he documented and reported on Sugimatsu Nakamura (1909-1967), a 43-year-old fisherman. In 1960, he published a photo book "A Record of an Atomic Bomb Victim", which won a special award from the Japan Photo Critics Association. Afterwards, he continued to photograph various street protests at the time (anti-security treaty movement, opposition to the construction of Narita Airport, Minamata disease, women's liberation movement, etc.), infiltrated the Self-Defense Forces to expose the truth about new weapons development, and as a result, he was beaten and had his nose broken, requiring 10 stitches, and his home was also burned down in an arson attack. This only strengthened his determination to always stand against those in power, and he self-funded over six hundred exhibitions.
In the 11th year of Yonglu (1568), in February, the lord of Tachibana Castle, Tachibana Akizane, rebelled against the Otomo family again under the advice of Mori Motonari. At this time, Tonomo Soshin, who was in Chikuzen with his powerful followers, did not support Akizane's actions out of loyalty to the Otomo family and was killed by him. On April 6, Akizane welcomed over 8,000 people and more than a hundred warships from the Mori family led by Shimizu Munetomo. He also allied with Harada Takane, Harada Chikane and his son, and over 10,000 people including the vassals of Takahashi Akizane, such as Weifeng Weizhang, at Tachibana Castle. On April 24, the Otomo army, with over 30,000 people including Tojitsugu Michiyuki, Yoshihiro Akisato, Usuki Akispeed, and Shiga Chikamori, surrounded Tachibana Castle and its seven locations including Hakutake, Matsuo, and other castles and forts. Three months later, on July 4, the Otomo army launched a strong attack on Tachibana Castle. At this time, Akisato's team, which had few people left after a night attack on the Tachibana army and most of them were starving, distributed rice balls and boosted morale.
The eastern part is the undulating Loess Plateau, with an altitude of 1500-2000 meters, through which the Yellow River and its tributaries Wei River, Tao River, etc., flow, rich in hydropower resources. South of the Qinling Mountains is the Bailong River basin, with a warm and humid climate, dense vegetation, and an annual precipitation of about 500 millimeters; to the west of the Wushe Ridge in the western part, there are the Hexi Corridor formed by the confrontation of the two mountains in the south and north. The southern mountains are mainly Qilian Mountains, which are high and large, mostly above three or four thousand meters. The northern mountains are relatively low, mainly including Longshou Mountain, Heli Mountain, etc. The rivers in the region are inland water systems, most of which flow from south to north, including Shule River and Weak Water, among which the Weak Water basin has the largest area, with a dry climate, an annual precipitation of about 150 millimeters, and is mainly semi-desert and desert. Due to the irrigation of the melting snow from the Qilian Mountains, alluvial fans are formed at the foot of the mountains, and places in the corridor with rivers form connected oases, which are the granaries of Gansu, while the outside is mountains and deserts.
After the observatory changed to signal number one, Lau Fau Shan and Tsing Yi respectively recorded the highest 10-minute average wind speed of 43 kilometers per hour from 2:20 am to 2:50 am and from 3:40 am to 3:46 am on August 15th. This was the first time strong winds were recorded at these two stations during the storm, and it was also the highest wind speed recorded during the storm at these two stations. At the same time, the wind strength in the southwest of Hong Kong (Lantau Island and nearby areas, such as Cheung Chau, the airport, etc.) remained high, continuing to be affected by strong winds for almost a whole day. As a result, between 2:45 am and 3:45 am on August 15th, there were again 4 out of 8 designated automatic weather stations recording strong winds, meeting the requirements for signal number three. This led some citizens to believe that the observatory's change to signal number one was also too early, and it was nearly 18 hours earlier than the time when the Macau Meteorological Bureau removed the signal number three typhoon warning.
Regarding the time and location when Typhoon Hato was closest to Macau, the meteorological agencies of Hong Kong and Macau held different views. The Macau Meteorological Bureau pointed out that Hato was closest to Macau at 1 pm, passing about 40 kilometers west-southwest of the Meteorological Bureau headquarters. However, the post-event report from the Hong Kong Observatory and the positioning of Macau Meteorology and Astronomy showed that Hato passed only 20 kilometers southwest of the Macau Meteorological Bureau headquarters at noon. Some citizens questioned whether there was an error in the positioning of Hato by the Meteorological Bureau. Hato's structure was intact and tight, and there was no reorganization of the central circulation at the time, so the chance of positioning error should be smaller. From the radar map, we can compare the typhoon Vicente that hit Macau in 2012. The positioning of the Meteorological Bureau was also 40 kilometers, and the eye diameters of Typhoon Vicente and Hato were both 50 kilometers. However, the center of Hato was obviously closer to Macau than Vicente, and the actual distance of Hato might only be 20 kilometers.
In 2009, in order to cooperate with the urban environment improvement action plan of Luohu District, Shenzhen, Guangshen Railway Co., Ltd. invested more than 17 million yuan to carry out comprehensive environmental remediation along the Shenzhen section of the Guangshen Railway. The Shenzhen Railway Station and its surrounding environment were renovated, and the wall and electronic screen of Shenzhen Station were successively transformed. An additional entrance was added to the underground second floor Guangshen ticket hall, i.e., the subway transportation layer, to facilitate passengers' entry and boarding. A new electronic display screen, 20 meters long and 6 meters high, was added on the east side of the station, scrolling real-time information such as train numbers, ticket prices, and waiting areas. The east and west exterior walls, the luggage consignment hall, the luggage collection place, and other areas with a total area of 2274 square meters were renovated. The ground of platforms one and three, approximately 550 square meters, was replaced. The interior of the ticketing area for the high-speed train group on the first floor of the station was decorated.
The mechanical mule weighs less than 567 kilograms, but it can carry objects weighing 181 kilograms and travel more than 32 kilometers at a speed of 16 kilometers per hour. It can also work continuously for more than 24 hours. Currently, the mechanical mule is still in the testing phase, and its speed has reached 11 kilometers per hour, which is twice as fast as the average walking speed of humans at 5 kilometers per hour. Its power comes from a 15 horsepower water-cooled engine. It has a built-in global positioning system in its body. All four mechanical legs have springs to absorb the impact when landing. The part equivalent to the hoof is a force sensor, which, in conjunction with a gyroscope, allows its computer to control its balance. The actuators on its feet (equivalent to leg muscles) can convert the electricity generated by the engine into mechanical motion, allowing it to move forward.
After the Edo period, most areas became the territory of the Fukui Domain, and a small part of the area belonged to the Obama Domain, the Banner's territory, and the Shogunate's direct territory. After the Meiji Restoration at the end of the 19th century, the territories originally belonging to the Shogunate and the Banner were incorporated into the newly established Honpo County in 1871. After the abolition of the domains and establishment of prefectures implemented in the same year, the remaining territories originally belonging to various domains were transferred to Mikuni County, Fukui County, and Obama County. However, in the first prefecture-county consolidation at the end of the same year, all areas were consolidated into Tsuruga County. However, Tsuruga County was abolished in 1876, and the Imadate District in the north was incorporated into Ishikawa Prefecture. It was not until 1881 that the jurisdiction of the original Tsuruga County was re-established. However, the newly established county was named Fukui County because the county office was located in Fukui.
On the eve of the Demon War, Yixiao Daotian Zhenjun cut off his own antlers to support the Tianheng Mountain that was damaged by the demon god. After his death in battle, his blood turned into clear water, forming today's Clearwater Plain, submerging the remnants of the salt in the ground. A thousand years ago, after the end of the Demon War, Yanwang Emperor subdued all the demon gods with his rock spear and confined them in the Lonely Cloud Pavilion. The evil spirits left by the demon gods were cleaned up by the immortal Yaksha. At this time, only the Golden Peng Yaksha remained among the five great Yakshas. The ancestors of Liyue turned to engage in commerce, and the merchants representing seven commercial forces - the Seven Stars of Liyue, controlled the country. They managed the Qianyan Army, composed of brave and good fighters under the command of the Emperor, while the immortals lived in seclusion among the clouds. Yanwang Emperor controlled the economy of Liyue, established the ceremony of inviting immortals, and the Liyue Harbor began to take shape.
It's worth mentioning that due to the inconvenient location, the mall has few visitors. The stores inside, such as Mannings, Yoshinoya, and Café de Coral, have shorter business hours than other branches in the city. Mannings only operates from 4 pm to 8 pm every Monday, and is closed all day from Tuesday to Sunday, and it carries fewer types of goods than other branches. Yoshinoya only operates from 11:30 am to 2:30 pm every Thursday, and is closed all day from Friday to Wednesday. By 2021, all retail stores on the first floor, including the Market Place supermarket, have closed, and some children's centers have also closed. Café de Coral does not have morning or evening markets, and only operates from 11 am to 7 pm from Friday to Wednesday, and is closed all day on Thursday. Some restaurants closed in 2019, and by 2021, all restaurants have closed.
The spirit of the wind, Taiyi, successfully formed a pact with the two-headed dragon during the defense battle of Azpia city, so she can now wait for Taiyi's summon at any time and place. In fact, because she fears Taiyi's powerful strength, she is afraid of the consequences that might be triggered if Taiyi uses her true power. If she can't control it well, it might cost Taiyi her life. Therefore, she lied to Taiyi. The form she transformed into, resembling Aeliane, is not the real appearance of Aeliane. Her true form is one of the four great spirits of the Elf Queen, the wind spirit "Sylphid". Also, when she was still Aeliane, her memories and thoughts were the same as Sylphid's. After being summoned by Taiyi, she asked Taiyi to call her "Sylph".
After the end of the first season with the theme of "sound", the second season of "Kyoto Color Diary" changed to "color" as the core topic, starting from July 17, 2013, it was broadcast at 1:58 am on the third Wednesday of each month (equivalent to early Thursday morning). In addition, at the end of each episode, the first season's "Yi's Diary" segment is maintained, but the second season is a hand-drawn diary by Yokoyama to review and summarize the content of the episode. Moreover, in the program broadcast on June 11, 2014, Yokoyama announced that the second season will continue to be broadcast into the second year, and the first special episode since the start of the show will be produced. In addition to inviting Rie Kitahara, a member of AKB48, as a special guest, the special episode will have a 90-minute extended broadcast.

Born into a family of assassins, he honed his combat skills due to the family's influence. Originally, the family served the wealthy former Chinese family, the Qiuyue family. His father once fought with the Yintian family and the Nue clan to carry out his mission. However, with the death of his mother and the Qiuyue family's termination of their contract with the family, hiring other assassins instead, the Qiuyue family, in order to prevent the family from leaking their secrets, sent assassins to silence his father. This also affected him and his sister, leading to the disintegration of their family. During a time of despair, he met Mr. Natsume, who runs a loan company, in a park. He borrowed 500,000 yen from him for emergencies and to invest in himself. In order to repay Mr. Natsume's kindness, he sought him out and was hired by him, and was named by Natsume as the successor to run the company.

The Snow Mountain Witch often appears in the dark forest of Snow Mountain (the highest altitude fir forest in Taiwan). She would wave or speak to passing climbers. If the climbers respond to her or approach her, they would be bewitched, dazed, and follow her into the deeper forest, disappearing without a trace. It is said that some people who were taken away by the Snow Mountain Witch could not be found anywhere, and in the end, only their footprints were found on the cliff on the opposite bank of the stream. However, there are also legends that the Snow Mountain Witch sometimes does not immediately take away the victims, but goes to the nearby mountain villa at night to call them, leading them to follow her into the mountains and disappear. It is said that only the victims can see her and hear her voice, while others can only hear footsteps.
The improved version launched in 1998 is an export model of the tank, with the "E" standing for Export. It has a new weapon control and battlefield management system, including a new MVS-580 stabilized commander's independent sight produced by SAGEM, which also has laser rangefinding and infrared thermal imaging functions. The gun has been replaced with a SAVAN-15 sight, providing all-weather hunting capabilities (Challenger 2 only during the day). The power has been replaced with Germany's MTU MB-883 diesel turbine engine and Renk's HSWL-295TM automatic transmission. Although it is smaller in size, it is more powerful (horsepower increased from 1200 to 1500), and it allows for more fuel storage space, increasing the cruising range from 450 kilometers to 550 kilometers.

After 2010, pop music in mainland China began to rise, especially with the prosperity of China's digital music platforms, such as NetEase Cloud Music, Kugou Music, QQ Music, Xiami Music, and Douyin short videos. Various movie and TV drama theme songs, variety music shows such as "The Voice of China", "I Am a Singer", "Sons of Tomorrow", and "Mars Intelligence Agency" etc., among which "The Voice of China" has discovered many new singers. Singers who have shifted their focus to mainland China, such as Aska Yang, Julia Peng, Terry Lin, A-Lin, G.E.M., etc., have gained a lot of attention due to the show "I Am a Singer". Among them, G.E.M. has become popular throughout mainland China through this show, becoming a new generation diva in the Chinese music scene.
Later in the modern era, many traditional concepts have been replaced by high-tech modern life. The descendants of Sarutobi Sasuke and Kirigakure Saizou, however, were lured to the Kappa Temple, which is the gate sealed by their ninja ancestors, by the kappa using money. After unsealing and opening the gate, the monsters finally released their accumulated grudges from their past lives into the human world, preparing to cause a big commotion, attempting to annihilate mankind. In this critical situation, a wandering secret ninja allowed Sasuke and Saizou, who were lured by greed, to accept the assistance of the descendant Tsuruhime, and the two ninja descendants who joined later, Seikai and Jiraiya, to hide in the human world, cut off evil, hide their names, and become the highest purpose of the Ninja Sentai Kakuranger.
Lillard performed excellently this season, often scoring the winning goal for the team at the end of the game. Therefore, he participated in the Rookie Challenge on Friday, the Skills Challenge, Three-Point Contest, and Slam Dunk Contest on Saturday, and the All-Star Game on Sunday during the 2014 New Orleans All-Star Week. He became the first player in NBA history to participate in all five events of the All-Star Week. In his second year of his career, he was selected for the NBA All-Star Game. Lillard also won the NBA Skills Challenge for two consecutive years. He and Trey Burke of the Utah Jazz narrowly defeated Michael Carter-Williams of the Philadelphia 76ers and Victor Oladipo of the Orlando Magic with a time of 45.2 seconds, successfully defending their title. He became one of only two players in history to win this honor for two consecutive years, the other being Dwyane Wade, the greatest star in Miami Heat history.
However, some people believe that this is a controversial period of history. Nobushige was given the name "Danjōchū", a name that only the lord could receive, while Nobunaga was given the name "Kamizumi", a name that the lord of the Imagawa family could receive. This shows that Nobunaga's eccentric behavior before his coming-of-age ceremony was not trusted by Nobuhide and his vassals. The main castle of the Oda family was the Furutō Castle, and in order to guard against attacks from the Mikawa region, a new castle was built at Matsumori, and the main castle was moved to Matsumori, not hidden in Matsumori. Nobushige was the lord of the main castle, while Nobunaga was the lord of the branch castle. As for Nobunaga's victory, it was related to the support from the Mino region and the stalemate with Masahide. It is difficult for history to answer who betrayed whom. In addition, there should have been support troops from the Mino region, which were definitely hidden under the historical view centered on the three heroes of the Warring States period.
The twin-columned Linde ghost pen foot bract is white, with a diameter of 2-4 cm; the fruiting body is 3-8 cm high, with two columnar bodies protruding from the bract. These two separate columnar bodies bend outward into an arc shape in the middle, and then bend inward and combine at the top. From bottom to top, the columnar body gradually narrows. The cross-section of the columnar body is semi-circular at the bottom, round and convex on the inside, flatter or slightly concave on the outside, resembling kidney-shaped or lentil-shaped, and gradually becomes round at the top. The diameter of the columnar body is 1.6-1.8 cm wide at its widest part, and only 3-5 mm wide at the top. The upper part is orange-red, the top is the darkest, magenta, the lower part is light flesh-colored, and opens outward; the mucus is attached to the inner wall of the upper part of the columnar body, dark brown, and stinks; the spores are oval, 4-5×1.5-1.8 micrometers.
The onset of leukemia is a complex sporadic mechanism, a multi-stage evolutionary process, which is also the key to its carcinogenic incidence rate of only 5%. In this process, the virus first binds to CD4+ cells and activates the infected cells. The cell membrane expresses the IL-2 receptor, and then the virus DNA is formed by the action of the virus reverse transcriptase, and is integrated into the host cell chromosome to form the pre-virus; under the action of the virus tax gene, the genes of CD4+ cells IL-2 and its receptor begin to abnormally express, causing a large proliferation of infected cells. The host cells carrying the virus can transform into different cell replications due to the diversity of the virus DNA integration site, and in the process of continuous cell proliferation, the DNA of a certain replicated cell mutates and evolves into a leukemia cell, thereby forming leukemia cell replication.
The campus of Zhendan University, now the Luwan Campus of Shanghai Jiaotong University in Huangpu District, Shanghai, is divided into two parts by the North-South Elevated Road. The west area (No. 280 Chongqing South Road) still has the original library (built in 1936, reinforced concrete structure, modernist style, now a Shanghai Excellent Historical Building). In addition, the original Shanghai St. Peter's Church was also on the campus (it has been relocated and rebuilt). The east area (No. 227 Chongqing South Road) still has the original student dormitories 1, 4, and 8 (built in 1908, 1916, and 1919 respectively, now the Huangpu District Cultural Relics Protection Unit, named the former site of Zhendan College). The Health Science Research Institute of the Shanghai Institute of Life Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. 225 Chongqing South Road) on its north side was the original Zhendan University Museum (built in 1930, brick-concrete structure, Art Deco style, now a Shanghai Excellent Historical Building).
Over 100 years ago, the fearsome giant pirate group "Giant Soldier Pirates" disappeared due to the sudden disappearance of its two leaders. At that time, Carmel, who was traveling around the world, realized that if the remnants of the Giant Soldier Pirates were executed, it would provoke the giants to take revenge on humans. Therefore, she successfully persuaded the navy to spare their lives, vowing to lead everyone towards a world where all races can laugh together, and thus was called the "Holy Mother" by the world. In fact, her conspiracy with the navy allowed her to infiltrate Elbaf, regularly providing excellent talents from the children she sheltered to the navy or CP, hoping to gradually free herself from human trafficking through this trade. The current Navy Rear Admiral John Giant also became the first giant soldier in the navy because of her.
The Bigeye Tuna is one of the species in the Perciformes order, Scombroidei suborder, and Scombridae family, distributed in the Western Atlantic region, from Canada to the waters of São Paulo, Brazil. The protrusion between the pelvic fins of this fish is small and bifurcated, there is no swim bladder, and the lateral line suddenly bends downward under the second dorsal fin. Adult fish do not have black areas on the front end of the first dorsal fin, and the body is completely covered with scales. There are 12-18 hard spines on the dorsal fin, 15-18 soft rays on the dorsal fin, 2 hard spines on the anal fin, 16-20 soft rays on the anal fin, and 41-43 vertebrae. The body length can reach 184 cm. It inhabits coastal waters and migrates. It is carnivorous, feeding on fish and cephalopods, and can be used as food fish and game fish.
So far, more than 1,400 films have adopted the SDDS sound format, but only about 97 films have truly been mixed in full eight-channel sound (including dubbing, music, and other sound effects editing, etc.). The vast majority of sound studios still use six-channel (5.1) system equipment instead of eight-channel (7.1) for editing and production. In addition, SDDS eight-channel recording equipment is quite expensive, which makes many studios unable to afford to purchase and add new equipment. This also means that future development will only be available to studios with larger budgets, larger production spaces, and the ability to accommodate more broadcasting equipment to have an eight-channel recording system available.
The first event in the history of Value Engineering was the asbestos incident at the American General Electric (GE) company. During World War II, the supply of raw materials in the American market was very tight. GE urgently needed asbestos boards, but the supply of this product was unstable and the price was high. The then GE engineer began to study the issue of material substitution. By analyzing the function of the company's use of asbestos boards, it was found that their purpose was to be laid on the workshop floor where products were painted, to prevent the paint from contaminating the floor and causing a fire. Later, Miles found a type of fireproof paper on the market. This paper could also serve the above purpose, and it was low-cost, easy to buy, and achieved good economic benefits. This is the earliest case of Value Engineering application.
The lithography technique was first invented by Alois Senefelder, a Czech-German, in 1798. At that time, because copperplate printing was too expensive, limestone produced in Bavaria was used as the material for engraving prints. The stone plate was originally his tool for adjusting ink. In an accidental situation, his mother asked him to write down the laundry list, but the paper and ink around him were used up, so he had to use his prepared correction fluid (composed of yellow wax, soap, black pigment, and water) to write on the stone plate. Later, out of curiosity, he poured some nitric acid on it. Because the correction fluid has anti-corrosion components, the handwriting protruded, which marked the beginning of using stone plates for printing.
The usual cause is that some village committees in inland provinces are still held by older generations with more traditional views. They believe that matters related to family property should be mainly inherited patrilineally, and anything under a woman's name will become "someone else's" if she marries out, and other strange concepts. Therefore, they do not act according to the law, and unmarried women are especially "guarded" by the village committee and will not easily be allocated land. Many rural women also lack legal awareness and do not know how to appeal for their own rights, thinking that tradition is the norm. In fact, Article 32 of the "Women's Rights and Interests Protection Law" stipulates that women have equal rights with men in rural land contracting, distribution of collective economic organization income, use of land expropriation or requisition compensation, and use of homesteads, and both men and women are members of rural collective economic organizations.
In the final, Spain faced Italy again, their opponent from the group stage. The two teams had drawn in the group stage, but in the final, Spain transformed their "no forward formation" into "everyone is a forward", greatly increasing their offensive power. Coupled with injuries to Italy's defense, Spain repeatedly broke through Italy's defensive line. In the end, with one goal each from David Villa, Jordi Alba, Fernando Torres, and Mata, Spain defeated Italy 4-0. This score is the most lopsided in the history of the European Nations Cup finals, and Spain became the first team to successfully defend the European Cup. In terms of individual awards, Iniesta won the Best Player of the Tournament award, and the top scorer was Torres, who scored three goals in less playing time.
The MOMO3, a machine with a total length of 10 meters, a diameter of 50 centimeters, a weight of 1 ton, and a load capacity of 20 kilograms, was originally scheduled to launch on April 30, May 2, and May 3, 2019, but was postponed due to machine failure and high-altitude strong winds. It was launched at 5:45 am on May 4 from the base in Da Shu Town, Hokkaido, and stayed in a weightless environment at a maximum height of 113.4 kilometers for 4 minutes. The total flight time was 515 seconds, and then it fell into the Pacific near Hokkaido, 37 kilometers from the launch point. This was the first time a private company in Japan had completed a mission to reach an altitude of 100 kilometers. It is expected to enter the commercial market for carrying small satellites in 2023.
On January 6, 2004, at the 12th South Asian Summit held in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, the concept of a South Asian Free Trade Area was first proposed. This free trade area concept includes a total of 1.4 billion people in South Asia, including Bhutan, Nepal, India, Maldives, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The foreign ministers of these seven countries advocated for all goods in the South Asian Free Trade Area to be traded duty-free by 2016. This free trade agreement was recognized by the seven South Asian countries in January 2006. Developing countries in South Asia need this free trade agreement. In 2007, as a first step, 20% of tariffs were reduced, with a 20% reduction in tariffs each year until zero tariffs were reached in 2012. Less developed countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, and Nepal can delay the reduction to zero tariffs by three years. Although India and Pakistan have signed, they have not yet ratified this agreement.
On January 12, 2020, Beijing Tiantan Hospital affiliated with Capital Medical University admitted two suspected patients of the 2019 coronavirus disease. The 2019 coronavirus epidemic broke out in Beijing, and the city also launched a level one response to a major public health emergency on January 24 of that year. As the epidemic eased, Beijing downgraded the emergency response level to level two on April 30, and even further to level three on June 6. Local confirmed cases were temporarily cleared on June 8, but the cluster outbreak at Beijing's Xinfadi wholesale market for agricultural products on June 11 put Beijing back into a level two response state. The related confirmed cases had accumulated to 335 by July 6, with no growth thereafter. On July 20, Beijing once again downgraded the emergency response mechanism to level three, and the city has since maintained a normalized state of epidemic prevention and control.
As of March 23, 2017, Ailino defeated the Saigon Heat in the regular season with a triple-double, was once again elected as the most valuable player of the game, and accumulated 497 points to break the record by a margin of 2 points. He also broke the ABL's long-standing five-year record to become the player with the most points in a single ABL season. He was later selected as the ABL regular season's most valuable player, scoring champion, and assist king. However, Ailino was expelled from the game for the first time on April 18th during the second round of the playoff finals against the Singapore Slingers, after blocking an opponent's score and arguing with the referee over an unsatisfactory decision, receiving two technical fouls. As a result, on April 23rd, in the best-of-five finals, he helped the team win the ABL championship for the first time with a score of 3-1. He was also honored as the most valuable foreign player and the most valuable player in the finals.
After washing a transparent PET bottle, fill it with about 5~10cc of tap water and tightly cap the bottle. Shake the bottle vigorously for a few seconds to make the water vapor pressure in the bottle approach saturation. Then, open the bottle cap, insert a lit incense stick that is emitting visible smoke into the bottle for about a second, then remove the incense stick and immediately cap the bottle. At this point, press hard on the PET bottle, which is to adiabatically compress the gas inside the bottle to raise its temperature. You can see that the inside of the PET bottle is in a transparent state. Maintain this for a few seconds to allow the heat to dissipate to the outside. Then, release the PET bottle to let it rebound, which is to adiabatically expand. The temperature inside the bottle drops and due to the presence of condensation nuclei, a cloud fills the bottle. If there is no smoke from the incense stick, no cloud condensation will occur during the rebound stage. You can observe this by pressing before inserting the incense stick, or fill the bottle with water to ensure all condensation nuclei components are removed and then experiment again.
"Beyond: Two Souls" runs on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, using a game controller for operation. Players must switch between the female protagonist Jodie Holmes and the spirit entity Aiden. When controlling Jodie, it is from a third-person perspective. Players can control the protagonist to move, fight, interact with the surroundings, and converse with other characters. During close combat, the game enters slow-motion bullet time during attack and defense. Players must determine the direction of the protagonist's attack or defense to perform corresponding operations. When controlling Aiden, the screen enters a first-person perspective. As Aiden is a spirit, it can pass through objects and walls. Players can control Aiden to influence objects and people in the environment. Players must control it to help the protagonist clear obstacles, destroy or bounce off items, open doors, attract attention, control enemies, and attack.
Since the 1980s, in tandem with Taiwan's socio-economic development, folk songs have also entered a mature and commercialized period. People who started with Western music bands became the mainstream, the market was booming, and record companies were vying for supremacy. Songwriting and record production became professional and began to specialize in detailed division of labor. The two most mainstream ones were the UFO Records founded by Wu Chuchu and Peng Guohua (including the four divas Tsai Chin, Huang Yingying, Su Rui, Wang Zhilei, and well-known creators Li Shouquan, Chen Zhiyuan, Chen Lerong, Zhang Yusheng, etc.) and the Rock Records founded by the Duan Zhongyi and Duan Zhongtan brothers (including famous singers Chen Shuhua, Chyi Yu, Pan Yueyun, and well-known creators Lo Ta-yu, Jonathan Lee, Bobby Chen, Chen Huan-chang (Xiao Chong), Huang Yunling, etc.). The healthy business competition between the two companies expanded the record market, created a rich and diverse creative force, and eventually allowed the sales of single records to break through the million threshold, becoming a high-value record industry.
Tamar Herman, a columnist for Billboard Magazine in the United States, analyzed and evaluated the album, stating that "White Night" begins with "Wake Me Up," which introduces and narrates a dream-like love story. Following this is "Darling," a pop ballad set against a piano backdrop, reminiscent of the popular 2014 song "Eyes, Nose, Lips," which also features a piano melody. She praised Taeyang for exploring a variety of emotions in this album through deeply moving melodies and heartfelt lyrics, demonstrating his limitless musical ability. She also highly praised the presentation of the music videos, stating that "Darling" includes scenes that emit a romantic and lonely atmosphere from Los Angeles and Alaska, while "Wake Me Up" displays various scenes as if singing in a dream.
Xiao Yi was the seventh son of Emperor Wu of Liang, Xiao Yan. From a young age, he showed exceptional talent in literature and arts. He was able to write poetry at the age of six, and was renowned for his "triple excellence" in writing, calligraphy, and painting. His influence on Tang Dynasty poets Gao Shi and Cen Shen, as well as the "Jinlouzi", was significant. His literary creations and his role in the history of painting during the Northern and Southern Dynasties were extremely important. His historical masterpiece, "Jinlouzi", was included in the Hundred Schools of Thought. He was one of the representatives of fate calculation during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. His military strategy contributed to the quelling of the infamous "Rebellion of Hou Jing". He was adept at recognizing and utilizing talent, and he was also deeply accomplished in music, traditional Chinese medicine, astronomy, and calendrical science. His philosophical writings were abundant and he was reputed to be a nine-dan Go player. He even pioneered the art of horseback riding. He had significant political achievements in Jiangling. His knowledge was vast and profound. Considering that he only lived to be 46 and relied on auditory memory, he can be regarded as one of the rare geniuses in human history.
Job improvement is an important analysis method in human resource management and operation management. It mainly involves first understanding the responsibilities of personnel or the workflow in depth, dissecting each step and procedure of the work, and recording the nature of each segment of work, the auxiliary tools required, the operation actions, the time spent, and the related costs. Then, each project is analyzed to see if there is a necessity for its existence, whether the order should be reorganized, whether there is a new way to improve, and even to review the arrangement and planning of space configuration. Through the analysis of the details of the work and subsequent job improvements, the most suitable work schedule is redesigned to improve employee performance and job satisfaction, in order to achieve the various goals of corporate management.
Founded in 1971, the Hong Kong Shue Yan College was later registered as the Hong Kong Shue Yan Institute in 1976 under the "Post-Secondary Colleges Ordinance". However, because the Shue Yan Institute did not follow the government's implementation of the three-year university system and continued to maintain a four-year bachelor's degree program, it was unable to receive government funding like the Baptist College and Lingnan College, which complied with the government's reform requirements. This greatly limited the development of the school, which could only award honorary diplomas and not official degrees. It was not until after 2000, when the Hong Kong government supported the development of private universities and planned to implement the 334 education system, that Shue Yan Institute was allowed to offer recognized bachelor's degree programs. After passing the subject area review, the Hong Kong Shue Yan Institute was officially renamed as the Hong Kong Shue Yan University by the government in December 2006, becoming the first private university in Hong Kong. Shue Yan University remained the only private university in Hong Kong until October 2018.
The county road number in Hefei is composed of the uppercase "X" followed by three digits. The proposed (pending approval) cross-city and county (city, district) county road number's first digit is "0". The first digits of the county road numbers in Feidong County, Feixi County, Changfeng County, Lujiang County, Chaohu City, Yaohai District, Luyang District, Shushan District, and Baohe District are respectively "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9". The second digit represents the basic direction of the route, with "0" for circular routes, odd numbers for north-south directions, and even numbers for east-west directions. The third digit is written in sequence according to the starting point's township (street). The first two digits of the county road numbers in the Economic Development Zone, High-tech Zone, and Hechao Economic Development Zone are respectively "29", "89", "19", and "59".
There aren't many oral traditions left about the myth of Lulu An, it is only known that he may have originally come from the Piuma tribe (located in today's Taiwu Township, some say from the eastern Beinan tribe), and was one of the four ancestors of the Piuma tribe (the other three were Ngarhangarhan, Tauiung, Kaitjang, all his brothers). Later, for unknown reasons, he left with his wife Rhugilingan and moved westward in search of other habitable places, finally establishing a tribe in a place called Kurasa/Kurasaru. There, he and his wife had four children: Alisu, Drumetj, Ljemedj, Dravai.
The Next Generation Patrol Vessel (NGPV) plan, originally proposed by Malaysia in the early 1990s, was awarded to Germany (MEKO 100 RMN, Kedah-class frigate). The original agreement was for the first two vessels to be completed in Germany and then shipped to the Penang Shipbuilding Industry Company in Malaysia for assembly. Subsequent ships were built with the assistance of Blohm-Voss for the Penang Shipbuilding Industry Company. Two years later, the contract was amended, with the first two vessels being completed in Germany and then delivered to the Royal Malaysian Navy. The original estimated cost was 24.3 billion ringgit, with a plan to purchase 27 vessels in batches over 20 years. However, due to continuous delays and cost overruns, the construction of the remaining 21 vessels was cancelled and re-tendered. The plan name was also changed to Second Generation Patrol Vessels/Littoral Combat Ship (SGPV/LCS), derived from the design of the French La Fayette-class frigate, and awarded to the Maharaja Lela-class.
A year after the resistance forces successfully escaped the pursuit of the First Order, Kylo Ren, the supreme leader of the First Order, led his troops to continue suppressing other planets' resistance. He realized there was a massive dark force lurking deep in the "Unknown Regions" through a Sith wayfinder he found. Following the clues, he eventually found the source of this dark power in a large and gloomy building on Exegol, deep in the "Unknown Regions": Emperor Palpatine of the Galactic Empire, who should have been dead for over thirty years. This Galactic Emperor officially announced his existence to the entire galaxy from then on. Kylo Ren subsequently reached an agreement with him. Once Kylo Ren killed the last Jedi, Rey, the Sith fleet "Final Order" hidden on this planet would be incorporated under the First Order, and Kylo Ren would become the Emperor of the new Galactic Empire.
The Zengwen Reservoir is located in the Zengwen River Basin, which is 138.47 kilometers long and has a catchment area of 1,176 square kilometers. It is the fourth largest river in Taiwan. Its annual average flow is 1.6 billion cubic meters, and the dam site's annual average flow is 1.064 billion cubic meters. The Japanese engineer Yoichi Hatta, who designed the Chianan Canal in the early days, built the Wushantou Reservoir upstream of the Guantian River, a tributary of the Zengwen River, and set up a dam on the Dapu River to draw water through a tunnel to the Wushantou Reservoir for irrigation in the Chianan area. However, the water extraction rate was only 25% of the total flow (according to the Zengwen Reservoir Construction Record, before the construction of the Zengwen Reservoir, the original water usage of the Wushantou Reservoir was 330 million cubic meters). Therefore, if a dam is directly built on the main stream of the Zengwen River, the Dapu River, and it is operated in conjunction with the Wushantou Reservoir, the irrigation volume can be increased. For this reason, in 1939, Yoichi Hatta once suggested building a dam at the current dam site, but it was abandoned due to the war.
In 2006, with a batting average of 0.336, 26 home runs, and 88 RBIs, he won the Triple Crown, becoming the first player to achieve this since Lee Man-soo of the Samsung Lions in 1984. However, he lost the MVP vote to Ryu Hyun-jin, who also won the Pitching Triple Crown. Nevertheless, this established Lee Dae-ho's terrifying batting ability in Korean professional baseball. On August 14, 2010, he hit home runs in nine consecutive games against the Kia Tigers, setting a world record that remains unbroken. That year, he won the Triple Crown again, becoming the first player in the history of Korean professional baseball to achieve this twice, and won the MVP of the year.
"Xuan Zhe" is the twentieth solo album by Zhang Xinzhe, released in April 1998. It is his Chinese and English selection album released by EMI about a year after he left PolyGram. The selected songs are the essence of his less than three years at EMI. Although his time at PolyGram was not long, this period was the peak of his singing career, especially in 1996 when he won the Golden Melody Award for Best Mandarin Male Singer. These three years were also when Zhang Xinzhe's singing skills were at their most refined, whether in Mandarin, Cantonese, or English songs, he could handle them perfectly. And "Don't Tell Him", "Overdone", "Too Want to Love You", "I'm Real", "Devotion" and "Suffering" and other singles have become widely sung classic works.
From 1948 to 1952, Dalian University successively introduced nearly a hundred scholars from home and abroad, including Wang Ganchang (famous nuclear physicist, father of China's atomic bomb), Wang Daheng (famous optical scientist, founder of China's optical science), Zhang Dayu (famous physical chemist, one of the founders of China's catalytic science), Qian Lingxi (educator, founder of China's computational mechanics), Wu Shizu (theoretical physicist), Bi Dexian (electronic scientist, founder of China's radar technology), Yang Yi (ship engineering expert), Peng Shaoyi (petroleum chemistry, catalytic scientist), Hou Yufen (dye chemist), Wang Xiji (physicist), Lin Jifang (chemical engineering expert) and other famous scholars. They established eight departments, including the Department of Mathematics, Physics, Telecommunications, Electrical Engineering, Water Conservancy, Chemical Engineering, Shipbuilding, Mechanical Engineering, Metallurgy, and other institutions such as scientific research institutes.
The cosmic monster that has been fighting with Topless turns out to be evolved from the automatic defense system left by the predecessors, and the alien Buster team is the real cosmic monster. Topless is just a kind of human mutation disease. "Laluko" became self-abandoned after learning the truth and had a conflict with Nono. Later, under the leadership of Nono, the cosmic army went to explore a giant real cosmic monster sealed in a black hole, but at this time the real cosmic monster broke out of the black hole. In front of the real cosmic monster of the size of a planet, all attacks from Nono and "Laluko" could not harm it at all. Just as "Laluko" was preparing to create another black hole with Nono to launch a suicide attack on the real cosmic monster, Nono suddenly left, leaving "Laluko" in shock.
Unlike the national Duma, the departments under the political parties, the committee clearly shows that there are no political parties in the upper house. In 2001, about a hundred senators formed a relatively loose party group, almost supporting all the policies of the then President Putin. However, what was even more disappointing was that after Mironov was elected as the chairman in 2002, he dissolved all party groups. Although consensus is not the most important thing in a democratic country, it is difficult for the Federal Committee of the Upper House of Parliament to form a considerable consensus, and it is difficult to pass any resolution. The bill is easier to pass after debating with the chairman or various committees, and the members themselves are asked not to reflect the original ideology of the party in the proceedings. After the reform in 2000, the committee obviously leaned towards the Kremlin authorities, making important bills easily passed to meet the requirements of the Kremlin.
Arab geographers wrote in 985 AD about inns and hotels in the Palestine region of Greater Syria at the time, which served as rest stops for travelers. Makdisi mentioned in the literature: "The taxes levied in Syria are not heavy, but the taxes levied at the caravan stations are an exception, and the travelers in the station are subject to extremely harsh high taxes..." The taxes mentioned here refer to the tariffs levied by local government officials on imported goods and commodities. Usually, merchants on the journey would stay or rest at the station with their livestock responsible for carrying goods. Each door in the station would have guards to ensure that the merchants entering and exiting would fully pay the taxes on the goods they carried. The levied goods tariffs were one of the main sources of income for the Fatimid Dynasty at that time.

In the semi-finals, Portugal will face Wales, which includes Gareth Bale, a teammate of Portugal's captain Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid. Due to the astonishing market value of these two famous players, both reaching the billion level, this match is often referred to by many fans as the "Two Billion Battle" or the "Billionaire Men's Duel". Both teams had key players unable to play due to injuries or suspensions, so neither team gained anything in the first half. It wasn't until the 50th minute of the second half that Portugal's captain Cristiano Ronaldo scored a header from a corner kick, taking the lead. Less than three minutes later, Nani scored with a shot that seemed like a pass from Ronaldo, changing the direction of the ball and scoring. Although Wales kept attacking fiercely to try to equalize before the end of the match, Portugal held on to the situation and finally advanced to the final with a 2-0 victory.
In July 2016, Lucas returned to Hong Kong to join the Hong Kong Premier League team Tai Po, and on September 9, he scored his first goal after joining in a match against Hong Kong FC, helping Tai Po to a 2-1 victory. Later, on October 23, during the overtime stage of a match against R&F, a conflict arose due to a foul by an R&F player on Tai Po player Lee Ka Yiu. During the conflict, Lucas was praised by fans for protecting Lee Ka Yiu, who was the target of the opposing players. After joining, Lucas emerged from the ashes to become the team's top scorer, scoring 17 goals in 23 appearances in all competitions, including a goal on May 3, 2017, in the Elite Cup final that helped Tai Po equalize and eventually win 2-1 against Hong Kong Pegasus. After the match, he was named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament, further cementing his status as a key contributor to the team's championship victory.

Located between Yancheng and Guogang (Dingyan), it worships the Heavenly Mother (Second Mother). In the 29th year of the Qianlong era (1764) in the Qing Dynasty, it set sail from Quanzhou Port on the Chinese mainland, helping seafarers to cross the sea to Dagou as the ship-protecting mother. When the ship sailed into the waters inside and outside Guogang, a storm arose at night, overturning the ship. The Second Mother manifested herself and sent her golden body to the edge of the sand embankment. That night, a divine light appeared, and the villagers went to observe the situation and brought the golden statue back home for worship. At that time, a bamboo hut was built for daily incense offerings. Later, disciples were asked to practice medicine to help the world. After the restoration, the elders asked for the return of the golden statue, and in the 49th year of the Republic (1960), a temple was built and completed in the 50th year of the Republic (1961), named "Anle Palace". Due to the old and unusable structure, it was rebuilt in the 92nd year of the Republic (2003) and completed in the 100th year of the Republic (2011), becoming the territorial master of the Yancheng area.
The 9th seat of the Round Table Knights, holder of the ancient elven relic "Magic Sword of Disguise", nicknamed "Superman Magic Sword", is the puppet master behind the Kingdom of Oriana, secretly controlling the kingdom and attempting to seize the power of the Dark Rose to summon the Twilight of the Gods. After planning to fully expose himself in front of the kingdom's people, he uses the Dark Rose to try to kill all the citizens, but is defeated by Beta and Ipsylon. Along the way, he reveals the true history of the kingdom and the research report of the church's investigation, but unexpectedly, everything is in the hands of the opponent, leading to the complete failure of the plan. In the end, he swallows a piece of the Twilight of the Gods in an attempt to resist, but is still defeated by the shadow and evaporated, leaving no trace of his body. He is even referred to by the shadow as a failure like a beast. His skull is later transported to Japan, where it is recovered by the shadow and Beta, and the Dark Rose is revived, becoming the key to return.

This program began recruiting citizens to apply to become volunteers (commonly known as "cat volunteers") in 2000. Applicants need to provide information such as the application location, street name, and field conditions. The program team will meet with the applicants to understand whether they are suitable to serve as volunteer caregivers, and to answer any questions they may have about participating in this program. At the same time, they will also visit the application site for an on-site inspection to assess whether the location is suitable for the program. If the location is on private property, permission must be obtained from the property management office before the program can proceed. After passing the review, applicants can receive a volunteer certificate to verify their identity, and they are responsible for taking care of stray cats in a specific area and regularly reporting on the situation of stray cats in the area. Volunteers need to bear the costs of buying cat food, supplies, transportation, and animal medical expenses themselves.
After the War of Wrath, Morgoth was overthrown, and the Silmarils were obtained by the Valar. Maedhros and Maglor demanded the Silmarils, but Eonwe, the guardian of the Silmarils, stated that due to the various evil deeds of the sons of Feanor, they had lost their right to the Silmarils. He also demanded that the two go to Valinor to be judged by the Valar. Maglor agreed with Eonwe's statement, but Maedhros disagreed. They killed the guards and took the Silmarils, only to find that the light of the Silmarils burned his hand to an unbearable extent. Only then did Maedhros realize that they had truly lost their ownership of the Silmarils. In extreme pain and despair, he jumped into the earth's crevice with his share of the Silmarils, falling into the raging flames. He was thus consumed.
Every time a building, natural scene, painting, or natural sound appears, the narrator will recite a poem from the Windmill Poetry Society. After each poem is recited, the narrator will discuss with one of the poets or read a letter from a poet that seems to be addressed to someone participating in the Windmill Poetry Society. In order, they are Shui Yinping (Yang Chichang), discussing how the style of the poem is, what the true form of a poem should be, what state a poem should have, and also pointing out the differences between the Windmill Poetry Society and the literary world at the time. The concept and the proposal of fecal realism by Xichuan Man are somewhat similar, but it emphasizes that the Taiwan Literary Association at the time did not pay attention to Taiwanese youth who were enthusiastic about Japanese culture, and emphasized the independence of literature, which is somewhat distant from the resolution based on the imperial spirit in the literary battle decided by the Taiwan Literature Service Association in Taipei in November 1943.
Japanese scholar Ma Yuandong, based on the legend of Malas, as well as the past customs of the Shemagan tribe and the surrounding Beinan people, such as swinging during festivals, the position of the leader and property inheritance regardless of gender, which are similar to the Paiwan tribe, believes that this was the influence of the subordinates brought from the original tribe when Malas and Dugu got married, and the intermarriage and cohabitation with the Beinan tribe. In addition, some people, based on the significant difference between the number of tribal leader inheritances in the Shemagan tribe and the Zhiben tribe (when the Zhiben tribe has been passed down to the fifteenth or sixteenth generation since Xihaxihao, Shemagan has been passed down for sixty generations since Dugu), judge that the Shemagan tribe adopts the "elder extinguishes the young" inheritance system (the younger generation takes over after the elder dies, and then passes it on to the next generation of the elder), which is also very similar to the customs of the Paiwan tribe.

He Dulin's academic performance was average when he was at the National Art School, but his performance in art subjects was excellent. Because the school emphasized the professionalism of the academic hall, He Dulin repeatedly violated school rules by taking commercial performances, and was recorded with two major and one minor demerits. He was also frequently warned for often missing classes. Although the school dealt with his behavior according to the rules, knowing his family situation and based on the relationship of cherishing and loving talent, his teachers often pleaded for him to keep his student status. At the age of nineteen, as his college career was coming to an end, He Dulin received a full scholarship from the Wu Zhujie Ballet Academy in Vancouver, Canada, which is one of the best, hoping to cultivate him to further his studies in Canada.

At that time, He Dulin, who was on the verge of dropping out, was also disinterested in staying at the Art School, so he decided to take a break from school and join the military. This was an important turning point for He Dulin to become a professional artist.

Mu Agaige was not the first person born in the tribe. Long before her birth, the earliest pair of men and women in the tribe were born near a large banyan tree under a giant rock near the spring water of the current Jilu tribe. After the pair of men and women became husband and wife, they produced many descendants and formed a tribe. However, because they lacked the ability to lead the tribe, they prayed to the gods for a noble who could lead the tribe. The gods then placed a giant egg in an ancient pottery pot of the tribe through the sunlight, and Mu Agaige was born from it. However, this act of the ancestors also caused dissatisfaction among some of the tribespeople, so a portion of them migrated out of the tribe and disappeared after moving around in the Maolin area, suspected to have merged with the Paridradhane tribe of the Paiwan people.
Compared to the previous work "Ultraman R/B" which took a comedic approach, this work is more serious in nature. Compared to "Ultraman Taro", this work incorporates more elements related to "Ultraman Seven" and "The Return of Ultraman". The theme contrasted as the basis is "diversity", and it develops along the line of "aliens secretly living on Earth can coexist with humans". Unlike the new generation of hero series in recent years, this work retains the elements of a serial drama, but adopts the format of past "sci-fi unit dramas" and intersperses many new character groups. Moreover, it depicts more tragic endings in some stories.
On March 1, 2014, Galen signed with the Austrian Super League club St. Pölten, but due to lack of playing opportunities, he transferred to the Jordanian club Shabab Al-Ordon in 2015. On September 3, 2015, he joined the Cypriot First Division club Aris Limassol. However, due to the club's wage arrears, he left in December. Galen then joined the Romanian club Săgeata Năvodari, teaming up with his compatriot Lodi Gus, but unfortunately, they also encountered the same fate of wage arrears. Therefore, in 2016, he played for the Indonesian club Persela and the Finnish club RoPS, even helping the former to be selected as the best team in July. On July 26, 2017, he confirmed on his social media that he was coming to Hong Kong to join the newly established Hong Kong Premier League team, Dream FC.
At the end of August 2017, Lesao, Zodi, and Danny had lived in Hong Kong for seven years and became permanent residents of Hong Kong. In early September, they decided to renounce their Spanish nationality and apply for a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport. On October 3rd, they received the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport. On the same day, due to the withdrawal of three players from the Hong Kong team due to injuries and personal reasons, the then head coach of the Hong Kong team, Kim Pan-kun, immediately selected them to join the team to participate in international matches against Laos and Malaysia. Coach Kim Pan-kun even pointed out that Lesao, in the absence of Fatus due to injury, is a good replacement for the next two games. Lesao made his debut in the international friendly match against the Laos national team at home on October 5th, representing the Hong Kong team in the international A-level competition for the first time. He was substituted at halftime to save energy for the match against Malaysia, and as a result, he helped Hong Kong win a big victory of 4-0.
On January 29, 2022, Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission, stated at a press conference of the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism that there have been public reactions to some places where "people from low-risk areas are not allowed to return home for the New Year", "returning residents are forced to pay for centralized quarantine", and "arbitrary extension of centralized quarantine and home health monitoring duration". The comprehensive team of the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism requires all regions "not to arbitrarily prohibit people from other places from returning home for the New Year", "not to arbitrarily expand the scope of travel restrictions", "not to expand the scope of travel restrictions from medium and high-risk areas to the local city and the entire province", "not to take measures such as forced persuasion and centralized quarantine for people returning from low-risk areas", and "not to arbitrarily extend the duration of centralized quarantine observation and home health monitoring".
Episode 43: She, under the command of the new Disease Demon King, attempted to annihilate the Light Beauties. When she learned that the Light Beauties intended to take the disease demon fragment from her, she directly used the fragment to strengthen herself again. Although she became extremely powerful after the second enhancement, she was distracted by the trick of the Shimmering Angel about the new Disease Demon King, revealing her weakness. She was severely injured by the individual skills of the Grace Angel, Holy Spring Angel, and Earth Angel, and finally purified by all the Light Beauties. However, even when all the Light Beauties used the "Final Healing Baptism of the Light Beauties" to attack her, she was only on the verge of death. Under the prompt of Latte, the initial three Light Beauties learned and used the "Healing Oasis of the Light Beauties" to successfully purify and disappear her, and her remaining power was absorbed by the Earth Angel.
The results were announced after the performance, with a total of 249 tickets sold, just one short of the goal. Just as they were about to accept the reality, Akimoto Yasushi arrived in time and found a pile of notes from Yoshiyuki. He recognized the hard work of the research members and decided to buy the last ticket for 10,000 yen, successfully completing the task. This also marked a legendary chapter for Shinori in AKB. Her efforts made the whole team shine and her charisma attracted the core members of AKB's three teams: Team A's Takahashi Minami, Team K's Oshima Yuko, and Team B's Watanabe Mayu. They asked her out and invited her to join their teams, aiming to make her the center and leader of their future groups. During the competition to recruit Shinori (using the photo of the trainee to attract her to their own group), Akimoto Yasushi intervened and stated that he would decide which group Shinori would join.

When this film was first released, there were two lines of dialogue: "Guess who's coming to dinner now?" The answer was a sarcastic: "Could it be Martin Luther King?" However, due to the assassination of Martin Luther King on April 4, 1968, this line was removed from the film in subsequent screenings. By August 1968, almost all cinemas showing this film had omitted this line. By 1969, some film copies had restored this line, but in the film's released videotapes and DVDs, this line was preserved.
The single-door version NL262 with the number HKR115 was written off in 2004 due to a serious traffic accident, colliding head-on with a dump truck between Tung Chung and Ni Tou. Subsequently, with the introduction of the DB03R service to and from Sunny Bay Station, and the continuous influx of new buildings, the Discovery Bay fleet was insufficient. Coincidentally, Citybus was planning to sell some of its single-deck buses. Discovery Bay, which had a large number of MAN buses, purchased 5 NL262/R buses (formerly numbered 1570-1574) from Citybus. These buses were modified in the Citybus factory, with all seats replaced with leather ones, yellow handrails installed, the single seat next to the entrance door converted into a luggage rack, and the original Brose electronic sign replaced with a Lite Vision orange LED electronic sign. They were repainted in the colors of Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited and adjusted to match the interior tone of the fleet, serving the residents of Discovery Bay with a brand new look. One of them was also renumbered as HKR115 (now known as DBAY115).
"Dongtang Spring" ultimately produced an animation that is different from the general magical girl series. Because the target audience of this animation is school children, and to differentiate it from other animations of the same type, the characters in this work use the method of directly putting on witch costumes, instead of the then mainstream transformation with nudity scenes. It does not directly use witches as the protagonists, but ordinary human children with the secret identity of "witch apprentices". The work uses a large number of musical elements and terms, and borrows elements and names from "Sally the Witch". Before the opening song of almost every episode, there is a hint of the plot of the episode, which lasts about 20 seconds. This setting has also been continuously applied in Dongtang Spring's subsequent animations and has become its characteristic.
During the program's broadcast, it underwent several prime time schedule changes. The initial viewership was poor, with the average rating for the first two weeks being only 21 points, and it later fell to less than 20 points. For two weeks, the viewership was even surpassed by "Today's Real D" broadcasted on Asia Television's local Hong Kong channel at the same time slot, causing the broadcast time to be repeatedly postponed to 23:00 and 23:15. By the end of 1995, new characters such as Shuang Shuang, Good Aunt, Cat Poop, Li Sheng, Joan, etc. joined, and the viewership gradually rebounded, allowing it to be broadcasted in advance at 20:30, 22:00 and 22:20. In response to the premiere of Asia Television's "Goodbye Sunny Days", episodes 247-343 even extended the duration of each episode to 45 minutes (including advertisements). The last episode of that year was episode 402, which was broadcasted on December 30 (Monday).
The fictional character of Mary in novels such as Robin Maxwell's "The Secret Diary of Anne Boleyn", Rosalind Miles' "I, Elizabeth", Maureen Peters' "The Rose of Hever", Jean Plaidy's "The Lady in the Tower", Norah Lofts' "Mistress Anne", Evelyn Anthony's "Anne Boleyn", Wendy J. Dunn's "Dear Heart, How Like You This?", and Carolyn Meyer's "Young Royals: Doomed Queen Anne" have played a significant role in shaping her character.
I am playing an online role-playing game, where my character is named Blue Mountain. The character looks just like me, but with cat ears on the head and cat claws for hands. The personality is very different from reality, being very cheerful and talkative. The room in the online world is also very messy, which is a stark contrast to my silent and spotless image in reality. Currently, the only one who knows the real identity of Blue Mountain is my classmate Narita Shion. In fact, I like Goto Momoka, and it seems that in the final episode of the comic, I marry Goto Momoka. Both of us are wearing wedding rings, but the maximum time we have been in contact so far is only 12 seconds.
The Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD) is an intermediate certification designed by Microsoft for programmers. Its level is the same as MCITP, and it is tested based on specific tasks (jobs). Unlike the MCTS, which only tests programming skills, the MCPD exam focuses on the ability to design and develop the overall architecture and components of applications, since the MCTS has already tested programming abilities. Design decisions are the main focus of the MCPD exam, so it is quite difficult for candidates without considerable experience to pass the MCPD exam. Therefore, since the implementation of MCPD at the end of 2005, the number of people who have passed the MCPD: Enterprise Application Developer (equivalent to the past MCSD) is only about 1/5 of the number of MCSD (6,567 people).
Back pain is the price humans pay for walking upright. For animals that walk on all fours, the spine is like a bridge, less affected by gravity. However, for upright walking humans, the spine is like a pillar supporting a house. Chinese people often refer to it as the "dragon bone", bearing most of the body's weight and external forces. It is easy to have problems due to overload, so almost everyone has experienced back pain. According to statistics, about 80% of people have had their lives and work affected due to back pain. Dr. Gao Ming's lecture on the causes and related diseases of back pain, such as sciatica and bone spurs, addresses the modern civilization's troubles!
Continuing the plot of the previous work "Breath of the Wild", after defeating the demon Calamity Ganon with the knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link jointly began to revive the Kingdom of Hyrule. The story starts with Zelda and Link going together to investigate the miasma underground of Hyrule Castle. The two discovered the relics of the ancient civilization Zonai in the underground cave. Subsequently, Zelda and Link found the body of Calamity Ganon with a glowing arm embedded in it in the deeper part of the castle underground. This body suddenly revived as they approached, causing Link to be seriously injured in order to protect Zelda, and his weapon, the Master Sword, also decayed as a result. Zelda then fell into the collapsing ground and disappeared.
Later, Phrixus, who rode on the Golden Fleece ram Kriusomaros, finally arrived in Colchis, the eastern part of the Black Sea (a historical region in Western Asia, roughly equivalent to modern Georgia). King Aeëtes of Colchis and Aeëa (a mythical country in Asia, largely confused with Colchis) sympathized with Phrixus's misfortunes and experiences. He and his daughter, Princess Chalciope, not only warmly welcomed and took good care of Phrixus, but even treated the fleece of Kriusomaros as a precious treasure of the country. (Another version says that Phrixus and Helle arrived safely in Colchis, and King Aeëtes of Colchis warmly welcomed them). Later, Phrixus married Chalciope and lived a happy life.

It is said that once there was a famine among the Kanakanavu people. One of the tribesmen was digging for food and accidentally dug into the cave where Dabuzala lived. However, they did not harm him, but instead invited him to stay and live there for a while. They fed him cakes made from millet and taught him how to farm. When the tribesman was about to return, they gave him a bag of millet seeds (some say there were also tree beans and soybeans) and asked him to invite them to taste the new rice after the millet harvest. The Kanakanavu people then began to host them every year. But one year, for unknown reasons, Dabuzala never appeared again. The tribesmen still prepared food for them every year, which gradually evolved into the Mikongu Festival.
In 1956, Chen Wenmin founded Daming Film Company and began investing in film production. During the shooting of "Xue Rengui's Eastern Expedition", due to a conflict between director Shao Luohui and the investors, Shao left in anger. Chen Wenmin then took over the reshooting and editing work. After the film achieved good box office results, Chen Wenmin, encouraged by everyone, directed his first feature-length drama "Boundless Bird". His subsequent works, including "Bitter Love", "The Demoness Steals a Husband", "The Pitiful Daughter-in-law", "The Beggar's Daughter-in-law", etc., were all family ethics tragedies, which were very popular among female audiences and sparked media discussions. This made Chen Wenmin extremely successful, and he even had his own exclusive white tricycle for transportation.
The 2019 Clash Royale Professional League is the second Clash Royale Professional League, sponsored by Supercell. This year's competition merged the European, North American, and Latin American regions into a single Western region, with the remaining regions unchanged. Therefore, there were only three regions in this year's competition. The Chinese region began its spring competition on March 22, while the Asian and Western regions started their spring competitions on April 29 and May 29, respectively. The top three teams from each region's spring competition were eligible to participate in the WCG competition held again in China.

Ninjas who have tailed beasts sealed within them, these ninjas not only bear the responsibility of sealing the tailed beasts, but also use the power of the tailed beasts to become an important force in the ninja village. However, when using the tailed beast's chakra, they are also affected by the tailed beast (the one-tail jinchuriki cannot get a stable sleep, the nine-tails jinchuriki is affected by the negative thoughts of the nine-tails when extracting chakra), so most jinchuriki are in a state of emotional instability for a long time. In severe cases, the tailed beast may even go berserk, causing great damage to the village, causing the villagers to equate the jinchuriki with the tailed beasts, almost as long as it is the power of the sacrifice, it will definitely be discriminated against by the whole village, without popularity, and no one will care even if something big happens.

The method is to first place the beef (generally using the lean tenderloin part) in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator for about an hour. Then, peel the sand pear, cut it into thick strips, and soak it in sugar water made from sugar and water (mainly to prevent the pear strips from oxidizing and discoloring) and set it aside in the refrigerator. Then, take the not completely frozen beef from the freezer, cut it into strips like the sand pear, and add seasonings (sweet soy sauce, honey, sesame, green onion, minced raw garlic, black pepper, and sesame oil) and mix well. Then, take out the sand pear strips that have been soaked in sugar water from the refrigerator and lay them flat on a plate. Then, place the beef that has been mixed with the sauce on top, and finally, top it with a raw egg to finish.

This museum is famous for its collection of American modern art, some of which are newer than those in other modern art museums. Before the Whitney Museum was established 30 years ago, American art was quite conservative and Eurocentric. The exhibition, purchase, and education of artworks were almost all led by the American National Design Academy. Therefore, the establishment of the Whitney Museum broke the conservative situation of American art. In 1918, what started as an exhibition of the Art Club members' works was called the Whitney Studio Club. The annual exhibition attracted more and more American contemporary artists. By 1928, the membership had grown to about 800, so preparations began to establish a museum, which officially opened in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, USA in 1931.
On the evening of September 6, 2011, in the Xishan Huafu community, Haidian District, Beijing, a couple who were property owners were driving their own Buick car. Just as they were about to turn into the south gate of the community, they did not turn on the turn signal, nearly colliding with a BMW car (without a license plate) and an Audi car (Jin O00888) behind them. After an argument broke out between the two parties, the couple was beaten by the drivers of the BMW and Audi, who loudly boasted, "Who dares to call 110!" The assailants were surrounded by more than 100 property owners, and a Toyota SUV blocked their way. The two car owners subsequently abandoned their cars and fled, but were later controlled and taken away by the police. The couple was sent to the hospital for treatment, where the husband's head was stitched with 11 stitches, and the wife's head was treated and is no longer in serious condition.

When non-local residents move into the residential area planned by the player, they will initially set up small tents. After the player gradually provides services such as drinking water, food, religion, entertainment, education, health, and daily necessities, they will gradually upgrade to the highest level of civilian housing, the "luxury house". If the luxury house is upgraded again, it will become a mansion, that is, a noble house. The residents of houses above this level will automatically become noble residents. Although they will not provide labor for the player's city, the taxes paid by these houses far exceed those of civilians. If advanced services, goods, and satisfaction are provided next, they will eventually be upgraded to the highest level of noble houses, the "luxury palace".
After the split, the Greek-Bactrian Kingdom was increasingly weakened. In 168 BC, the Greek noble Eucratides I occupied the homeland of the Greek-Bactrian Kingdom and established the Eucratides Dynasty. The Greek-Bactrian Kingdom subsequently lost the western part of the kingdom, including Mulu, in the war with Mithridates I of the Parthian Empire. Later, around 145 BC, four tribes of the northern nomadic Scythians, the Asii, Pasiani, Tocharians, and Sacarauli, launched an invasion of the Greek-Bactrian Kingdom. The kingdom eventually fell around 130 BC when the Scythians captured the capital, and the king and his royal family subsequently moved south to the city of Kapisa.
With his humorous and natural writing style, he sketches out the events and characters in his works with a blend of wit and fun. He often writes with a sense of humor derived from rural storytelling, like a modern storyteller, using familiar characters and local dialects to narrate vivid life episodes. The scenes in his works, in addition to their appearance and smell, also carry a rich rhythm. When writing about crucial points, he often naturally and appropriately adds a few implicit annotations. There is passion in his cold pen, and complexity in his simple depiction, which makes people smile knowingly, while feeling the absurdity and helplessness deep in human nature. Among many Taiwanese prose writers, he stands out.
The Genting Tunnel has been subject to long-term speed restrictions of 80km/h due to disease damage (arch and a large number of cracks in the overall roadbed, and high gas concentration). On February 3, 2020, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in Qingbaijiang District, Chengdu City, with the epicenter near the Genting Tunnel, exacerbating the tunnel disease. In addition, during the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, a large number of trains were suspended, providing an unprecedented opportunity for comprehensive rectification of the line. Therefore, in mid-February 2020, the Genting Tunnel began semi-closed construction. During the construction period, ordinary speed passenger trains and CR200J EMU trains running on the Suicheng line were diverted to run on the old Dacheng line. The power-dispersed EMU trains were shortened to start from the Suining Station of the Suiyu Railway. Passenger transport on the Suicheng Railway was temporarily suspended, with only freight trains running. On April 10, 2020, the repairs were completed and normal passenger train operations were resumed.
During the battle, the Protoss originally thought that the Aiel Zerg would become wild after the death of the Overlord, but unexpectedly, there were mixed source bodies in the swarm conducting systematic tactical command, which surprised Artanis and Zeratul. Then, Amon's powerful dark power invaded the Protoss mental network - Khala, instantly controlling most of the Protoss on Aiur, including Archbishop Artanis and Executor Selendis. Because Zeratul belongs to the Nerazim Dark Templar, their people have been unwilling to connect with Khala since ancient times, so their minds were not affected by Amon. Therefore, Zeratul immediately led the team to rescue Artanis, hoping to sever the neural connection with Khala before he was controlled by Amon, but it was too late.
"The Records of the Grand Historian" records that Yelang was the largest country among the southwestern barbarians at that time, "bordering the Zangke River". During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, intending to attack the Nanyue Kingdom, he sent Tang Meng as an envoy to Nanyue and discovered that the local area produced Shu land's Goujiang sauce, which was known to come from Yelang. Therefore, he reported to Emperor Wu that they could establish relations with Yelang to control Nanyue. As a result, Emperor Wu sent Tang Meng as an envoy to Yelang, met with its leader, the Marquis of Yelang, and generously gifted him wealth and goods, agreeing to set up local county officials and appoint his son as the county magistrate. The Marquis of Yelang, considering the distance between his country and the Han Dynasty, agreed for the time being, but later repeatedly resisted the Han. This led to the famous saying "Who is greater, Han or I?", which became the origin of the idiom "Yelang thinks too highly of itself".
When the T7606/7607 T7608/7605 express trains were launched, the EMU trains had already been rerouted via the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity Railway, so this train did not need to avoid the EMU trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line. The journey from Chizhou to Shanghai only takes 7 hours and 13 minutes, but due to the lower standards of the Ning-Tong Railway, the average speed of the train is still less than 80 kilometers per hour, which is still not faster than the highway passenger transport on the same route. Furthermore, this train has a close connection with the T7776/7777 T7778/7775 trains, so railway enthusiasts have continued to jokingly call it the "Shanghai-Chizhou Super Slow". After the train was extended to Dongzhi Station, it got a new nickname, the "Shanghai-Dongzhi Super Slow", but many railway enthusiasts still habitually use the nickname "Shanghai-Chizhou Super Slow".
Traditional digital modulation and division of labor use frequency division, transmitting different information through different frequency bands. OFDM divides a whole frequency band into several sub-carriers, and makes each sub-carrier orthogonal to each other, so that they do not overlap in the spectrum, which can reduce interference. Its operation method places the signal in the frequency domain at the transmission end, converts it to the time domain through the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT), and sends it out after adding a cyclic prefix. The receiving end removes the cyclic prefix, then converts the time domain signal back to the frequency domain through the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), decoding the original transmitted signal.
Gu Jin-hui was born in Hong Kong and grew up in Tsuen Wan. He started his football career at the local club Tsuen Wan until 1983 when he moved to Eastern. In 1984, he was invited by team owner Lam Kin-ngok to transfer from Eastern to the dominant team South China, where he became a key player. During his time there, he was selected as one of the best eleven players in the Hong Kong Football Star Election eight times and was even named Hong Kong Footballer of the Year in 1987. He retired at the age of 38 and became an assistant coach for the team. On June 19, 2017, after a meeting of the South China board of directors, all executives unanimously agreed to withdraw South China from the Hong Kong Premier League in the coming season and compete in the First Division to cultivate young players. To save on football department expenses, only Gu Jin-hui, who had served South China for over thirty years, was retained.
A reporter for the Broadcasting Department, a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, first appeared in episode 10 of this series. She always carries a microphone, camera, and a notebook with the word "secret" on the cover. Although she is a reporter and cannot participate in the competition up close, she always observes the entire competition from a distance and records every match of Oarai Girls' Academy. Originally, she was a character in the column "Oarai Girls' Academy Lunchtime Broadcasting Department" in Megami MAGAZINE, but she doesn't often appear in the anime. She is mainly active in radio dramas, interviewing team captains from various schools to understand their daily lives. In the final chapter, she and her partner spread the news that the Turtle Team's (Kawashima Momo) is going to repeat a year, which also spread outside the school.
Claude Auchinleck's plan was roughly in line with Montgomery's direction, but he also had a series of contingency plans to deal with the situation after the defense line was broken, including the defense work in Alexandria and Cairo. This led to inconsistencies between commanders on whether to defend El Alamein or retreat (this issue had already arisen at the end of June regarding the defense of Matruh). Montgomery's simplification was to abandon other options and emphasize holding his chosen area at all costs, which affected his explanation of his intentions to his superiors and the deployment of some units to the front line (such as the British 44th Infantry Division), which was previously reserved to deal with contingency plans.
The Luyuan Group has successively won numerous awards and honors, including the "Zhejiang Provincial High-tech Enterprise Research and Development Center" (2005), "Zhejiang Provincial Enterprise Technology Center" (2009), "Zhejiang Provincial Enterprise Research Institute" (2012), "China Famous Trademark" (2015), "Intellectual Property Advantage Enterprise" (2015), "Zhejiang High-tech Enterprise" (2018), "Top Ten Enterprises in China's Electric Bicycle Industry" (2019, 2022), "China National Accreditation Committee for Conformity Assessment Laboratory" (2019), China Light Industry Federation's "Science and Technology Progress Award (First Prize)" and "China's Top 200 Light Industry Enterprises" (2022), etc.
If calculated in terms of a sixty-minute episode, the budget for each sixty-minute episode of FTV's "Flying Dragon in the Sky" is approximately 1.2 million yuan. FTV has filmed nearly 245 hours in total, so the direct production cost is close to 300 million yuan. In addition to the direct production costs, the TV station also has indirect production costs, including items such as studio rental, lighting use, and camera depreciation. FTV estimates that the indirect cost per episode is about 200,000 yuan. If calculated with this number, "Flying Dragon" has been filmed for ten months, and the expenditure for indirect production costs is nearly 49 million yuan. After adding direct and indirect costs, the total production cost of "Flying Dragon in the Sky" is approximately 349 million yuan.
Victoria Harbour held a 15-minute themed fireworks show called "Night of Splendor", featuring patterns such as "HK", "2009", "EAG", and "Haha Laughter". It was accompanied by a medley of Cantonese pop songs from the 1980s to the 2000s, performed by various stars. The performances included "Love All Day" (originally sung by Leon Lai, lyrics by Lin Xi, composed by Mark Lui; 2000) sung by Kenny Kwan, Vincy Chan, Yumiko Cheng, and William Chan; "Dancing Street" (originally sung by Priscilla Chan, composed by Baker/Kyte, lyrics by Lam Man Chung; 1986) sung by Han Xue; and the finale performance of "Red Sun" (originally sung by Hacken Lee, composed by Tachikawa Toshiyuki, lyrics by Hacken Lee; 1992) sung by Kenny Kwan, Vincy Chan, Yumiko Cheng, and William Chan.
The Hong Kong Observatory announced at 2:40 am that day that it had received reports from citizens feeling an earthquake. After preliminary analysis, it stated at 3:16 am that an earthquake had occurred in the early morning off the southeast coast of China, about 92 kilometers northeast of Hong Kong. The earthquake intensity in Hong Kong was rated as IV (four) on the revised Mercalli intensity scale. It also reported that it had received "felt earthquake" reports from over 10,000 citizens that morning, breaking the record since the establishment of the short-period earthquake monitoring network in 1979. Most citizens reported feeling slight tremors that lasted for a few seconds. According to the Observatory's radiation monitoring data in Hong Kong, the local environmental radiation level has also remained normal.
The first product of Scythe was the Socket A converter "PK-OCK7/EV6" in 2001, and in 2004, they launched the NAS hard disk box "Scythe Box". Today, their product line ranges from graphics cards, ATX power supplies to various storage media, adapters, etc. The key to their steady foothold in the computer gamer circle for more than a decade is that they have found a small but stable blue ocean market, which is the prosperity of electronic OEM factories in Shenzhen that can provide various rare and cost-effective computer parts in Japan. However, due to language and other factors, Japanese DIY player consumers find it difficult to connect with manufacturers in Shenzhen for purchases, and they cannot inspect factory quality and negotiate requirements. This company has taken over this part and created value in Japan.
Due to the highways connecting the areas on both sides of the coastal mountain range, there are only three routes, Guangfeng Highway (Tai 11 Jia Line), Ruigang Highway (Hua 64 Line), and Dongfu Highway (Tai 23 Line), that connect Tai 9 Line and Tai 11 Line. For the distance between Ruisui and Fuli, it is a long 64 kilometers before there is a highway leading to Tai 11 Line. Therefore, in July 1997, the Highway Bureau began the "Yuli Changbin Section Highway New Construction Plan" to solve the inconvenience of transportation. Before the road was opened, the journey took 2 hours, but after the road was opened, it could be reduced to a 30-minute journey. It can also increase local development and provide a fast emergency route for medical services.
The "Wen Kang A Urban Renewal Project" is funded by Jie Xin Industrial Co., Ltd., with Huatai Bank as the financing trust unit. The architectural design is by Wu Yuhui Architectural Firm, and the construction contractor is Jin Fuyu Construction Co., Ltd. After the renewal, a reinforced concrete structure building with 2 underground floors and 14 above-ground floors will be built. In addition to the 3rd to 14th floors being converted into apartment residents (129 units), there are also plans for a shopping mall (17 shops) and a cinema on the first and second floors. The plan is to increase the number of motorcycle parking spaces, along with 73 car parking spaces, and adopt barrier-free facilities, pedestrian walkways, corner squares, and other friendly urban designs. The entire building will adopt green building methods and is expected to be completed in 2023.
The inventor king of the Bowzock gang, he uses all the materials collected on Earth for his most interesting inventions, to help Gailamo accomplish great things. After the Bowzock gang lost to the Carranger, Gailamo angrily punished him by sending him to Earth to find a way to enlarge the Bowzock monsters. As a result, he actually threatened children to help him collect the most delicious food on Earth. Later, the yellow taro sweet jelly from a famous taro sweet jelly master's shop "Taro Long", turned out to be the secret recipe for enlarging the Bowzock monsters. Gulaqi excitedly bought all the taro sweet jelly, helping the Bowzock monsters become giant monsters, wreaking havoc on the city or defeating the Carranger. This name is derived from the homophonic name of the clutch.
In Bobo's hometown, Gloria is surrounded by a group of suitors, singing the soul song <Boogie Wonderland>. However, not a single penguin's soul song attracts her. But Bobo comes back, singing "My Way" in Spanish. Gloria appreciates it very much, but she understands that Bobo can't sing. Later, she finds that Ramon is right behind Bobo. Just as Gloria walks away, Bobo attracts Gloria's attention with the rhythm of tap dance. Gloria also gradually follows the rhythm to sing. Just as more and more people follow Bobo, the penguin elder Noah stops the scene of the penguins dancing. He believes that the reason for the fish shortage is because of Bobo's dancing, which has angered the god of singing, so he drives Bobo away.
Butterfly Bay Beach is a beach located in the Butterfly Bay area of Tuen Mun, and it is connected to Butterfly Bay Park. It is also the second longest coastline in the Tuen Mun area. Therefore, apart from Castle Peak Bay Golden Beach, many tourists often come to Butterfly Bay Beach for swimming and leisure during holidays. In addition, most residents in the area or those living in the New Territories West, if they wish to go to the beach, will also choose the nearby beach in their original area, thus saving the travel time and cost to other areas, such as the time to go to the famous beaches in the Southern District of Hong Kong Island, Stanley, or Sai Kung District, etc. They can directly go to this original area beach for swimming. The geographical location of the beach is superior and the facilities within the beach are not inferior to other beaches in Hong Kong, and even surpass them in some aspects.
The time goes back to when Campbell was brutally beaten by Cole Williams. Cole said he hadn't seen Rosa since an incident, he didn't continue the beating, he wanted Campbell to bring Rosa to him. But Campbell said he no longer worked for Rosa. However, Cole told him that he could never enter the casino in his life because he had been blacklisted. But they were willing to give him one night to catch Rosa, without any interference. So Campbell began to plan. Campbell and Jill prepared chocolates that weighed about the same as the chips. When the two were escaping, they secretly swapped the chips with the chocolates. Rosa sat in the car, feeling quite helpless, but was caught by other security guards.
Coinciding with the cancellation of the rule that Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan players are considered domestic aids in the Chinese Super League and China League One from 2016, coupled with Paul's outstanding performance in the World Cup qualifiers, he signed a two-year contract with China League One club Shenzhen Kaisa on December 31 of the same year with a seven-figure transfer fee. He also registered with the Chinese Football Association under the Chinese name Paul. However, due to injury problems, his appearances were few and far between. Finally, on March 20, 2016, in the second round of the China League One, he made his first start for the team and was substituted out in the 74th minute in a 2-1 home victory over Qingdao Zhongneng. However, ongoing knee problems prevented him from playing for Shenzhen. During this time, he even went to the Netherlands for two knee surgeries. In the end, he only played four games in his first season and was placed in the reserve team by Shenzhen Kaisa at the end of the season.
The early description of Cryptomycota is of organisms that parasitize the surface of host cells, lack cell walls, and have a morphology similar to chytrids. Their morphology and intracellular parasitic life cycle are atypical, but this classification has many drawbacks. The etymology of "hidden" implies that these organisms have long been overlooked by researchers, and it was not until the rise of molecular sequence analysis that the mystery was unveiled. However, this characteristic applies to many other eukaryotes and is not exclusive to Cryptomycota. As for whether Rozella is representative, there is room for discussion, because our understanding of the life cycle of Cryptomycota is still limited. It is unclear whether most species can have both cell surface parasitic and intracellular parasitic life forms at the same time, so the morphology and life cycle of Rozella may not be atypical.
On the morning of August 25, the National Hurricane Center began issuing tropical cyclone warnings for the islands of the Lesser Antilles; in Barbados, by the morning of August 27, there was no more fuel to be added, and local residents rushed to buy disaster prevention supplies, causing some store shelves to be emptied; in Puerto Rico, one of the hardest-hit areas by the hurricane two years ago, due to the previously predicted path passing through, the local area was on high alert, and on August 27, local Governor Vazquez declared a state of emergency, providing 360 shelters, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency sent 3,500 people to Puerto Rico for disaster prevention, dozens of flights were cancelled at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, and a local 80-year-old man died after accidentally falling down the stairs during disaster prevention; in the U.S. Virgin Islands, due to the previous forecast that Dorian's path would not affect, when the path shifted north, local residents did not have much time to prepare for disaster prevention.
A lawyer may defend anyone, even if the person being defended is extremely guilty and the evidence is conclusive. All people accused of criminal offenses, regardless of the severity of the crime or whether the evidence is conclusive, have the right to request assistance from a lawyer. However, this does not mean that lawyers are inherently evil or lack moral conscience, as this is part of a lawyer's duty. However, due to the image of some of the people defended by lawyers, the arguments used in the defense process, and the unprincipled and high-fee behavior of some lawyers, there are many jokes and satirical cultures about lawyers in society. Moreover, some of the arguments used by lawyers in their defense may involve blaming the victims. In Japan, there have even been petitions to punish defense lawyers because of the content of their defense in murder cases.
In several important competitions, Chen Ruolin would also choose this move as her finale, including: In the women's 10-meter platform final of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she chose 5253B for her last dive. Her perfect performance earned her a full score of 10.0 from four judges and 9.5 from three judges, ultimately scoring 100.30 points. Her total score surpassed Canadian player Heymans, and she finally won the gold medal with 447.70 points; In the women's 10-meter platform final of the 2010 World Diving Series in Qingdao, she perfectly completed 5253B in her last dive, earning full scores from six out of seven judges, and finally won with 448.40 points; In the women's 10-meter platform final of the 2012 London Olympics, she once again chose 5253B for her last dive, and her stable performance earned her 86.40 points, successfully defending her title with a total score of 422.30 points.
On August 24, Deputy Commander of the Central Disaster Response Center, Zeng Wensheng, instructed the Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to actively coordinate with local government needs and dispatch water pumps for disaster relief. He ordered local government evacuation and resettlement teams to continuously monitor the warning and rainfall conditions in the red and yellow alert areas of landslides, and to implement evacuation and resettlement work. For vulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly, those with mobility difficulties, and severe patients, they should be more alert and initiate evacuation measures as early as possible. He asked the Council of Agriculture of the Executive Yuan to closely monitor the supply and prices of vegetables, and to ensure the implementation of adjustment work, and to do everything possible to avoid significant price fluctuations that may occur after the flood. He especially reminded the public to take flood prevention measures at home as much as possible during the suspension of work and school, and to avoid activities such as mountain climbing or playing in rivers and streams, and watching waves in areas with heavy rain warnings, in order to ensure public safety.
Later, when Chen Manyi went to the bathroom, her phone rang. Mo Junxian checked it and found out that Chen Manyi was dating another man (presumably Hu Huaqiang). He confronted Chen Manyi about why she deceived him. Chen Manyi responded defiantly, which made him believe that Chen Manyi had betrayed him and given him false hope. He also recalled that Chen Manyi had once hidden something from him, so he felt very disappointed and angry. In his rage, he lost his rationality, pushed Chen Manyi to the ground and tightly strangled her neck until he noticed that the floor was wet due to Chen Manyi's incontinence, then he let go. He immediately performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Chen Manyi. After about 10 minutes of emergency treatment, there was still no response. He was stunned at that moment, feeling very panicked and scared. He then casually put Chen Manyi into the wardrobe and covered her with miscellaneous items to buy time to escape.
Williams Syndrome is a genetic disease that occurs when 25-28 genes in the long arm of the 7th pair of chromosomes are deleted. This condition is usually a random event that occurs during the formation of eggs or sperm; in a few cases, Williams Syndrome is inherited from parents with dominant diseases (autosomal dominant genetic diseases). The patient's unique facial features (wide mouth, upturned nose, long philtrum, narrow and small chin, bulging eyes, pointed ears, long neck, sloping shoulders, etc.) are often thought to be due to the absence of specific genes. Diagnosis is usually based on suspicion raised by symptoms (for example, heart valve insufficiency, aortic stenosis, SVAS, etc. at birth), and confirmed by detecting the ELN gene probe through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
The biggest difference between the papyrus of ancient Egyptians and Chinese paper, both made from plant materials, lies in the fact that papyrus is made by sticking pieces of papyrus together, without decomposing the papyrus fibers, and the arrangement of the fibers still retains their natural order. The uniformity and thickness of the fiber arrangement is not conducive to writing, folding, and drying. Moreover, the raw material, papyrus, is only available in the Nile River basin. The fibers in Chinese paper are neither arranged in the orderly manner of plant fibers nor in the geometric arrangement of textiles, but are arranged in a random cross pattern. With simple production and appropriate gluing and bonding, it forms a material that is both lightweight and strong, and absorbent, so it can be used for long-term preservation of information. The raw materials are also very diverse, and can utilize plants from all environments, eventually spreading all over the world.
Since most fantasy novels come from online writers, they are published on the internet as they are written, often changing their style during the serialization process to adapt to the audience (because they have the possibility to comment instantly, they are more like an audience rather than readers). These changes may cause the content of the novel to often contradict itself, but as long as the plot is well-arranged and reasonable, there is no need to specifically distinguish the category of the work, and the theme of each chapter can also be used as a distinction. If each chapter's theme is set in a fictional world and only a small amount of non-traditional plots are added, it can be classified as a fantasy novel; if the chapters revolve around martial arts and science fiction, and magic is only used as an embellishment, it is more recognized as a fantasy novel.
On February 6, 2019, the anti-war suspense drama "National Treasure's Odd Journey" in which he starred premiered, and he played Zhou Xunda in the drama; On February 21, the anti-war drama "Awakening" starring him, Cao Lei, Wen Zhengrong and others premiered on the Oriental Movie Channel, and he played the role of the gang leader Ke Ye in the drama; On March 1, the urban family emotional drama "All is Well" in which he starred was broadcast, and he played the role of Zhu Li's father in the drama; On March 12, the realistic drama "Sweet" in which he starred started shooting; On July 15, the ancient mythological drama "Love and Destiny" in which he participated was broadcast on iQiyi; In September, he starred in the criminal investigation drama "A Thought Between".
Whenever a major disaster (such as a pandemic) occurs, rolls of toilet paper are extremely likely to be sold out. Some analyses suggest that this is because Western countries or regions that admire Western civilization have a large consumption of toilet paper. Due to the uncertainty of the future development of the disaster (including the government's response to the disaster, the spread of rumors, etc.), it may lead to long-term isolation, prompting people to increase their stockpiling of various supplies. Rolls of toilet paper are large and conspicuous items in stores, and the rapid pace of panic buying can easily empty the shelves. This can further exacerbate people's panic about material shortages and fear of missing out, making it difficult for stores to restock at the same pace as people are buying.
This point is not reasonable, because good nibs are often found on high-end fountain pens and have a certain weight. Secondly, when writing, you need to press and lift the nib to create a thick and thin effect, but a ballpoint pen can achieve this just by writing on a soft material. Ballpoint pens often perform better in terms of the effects of hard pen calligraphy, and have more room for expression. However, there needs to be a certain level of understanding of different writing techniques, and the writer needs to observe more. Fountain pen calligraphy requires speed, because the water-based ink nib cannot write too slowly or stop at one point for too long. Just this point alone is far less convenient than a ballpoint pen. The only advantage of a fountain pen is that the ink color is brighter than a ballpoint pen.
The surface speed of U-boats driven by diesel engines is not high, only capable of chasing some slow-moving merchant ships, and the maximum underwater speed is less than 10 knots, usually around 4 knots (except for the Type XXI, which is equipped with a 600-ton high-energy battery pack and a streamlined hull design, allowing it to operate continuously at an unprecedented underwater speed of 17 knots for an hour). In contrast, destroyers can reach a maximum speed of 30 knots, but in actual anti-submarine operations, due to the need to use active sonar and hydrophones, the ship speed is generally still 10-15 knots. U-boats find it difficult to evade deep-sea bombs from enemy destroyers when underwater, and their lack of maneuverability is a fatal flaw of the U-boat.
Taoism is a native religion of China, its thoughts originated from the Yellow Emperor (allegedly from the Yellow Emperor School), and the earliest form of the Taoist group was the Taiping Tao founded by Yu Ji, and the Five Pecks of Rice religion (Celestial Masters Tao) founded by Zhang Daoling. They worship Laozi, the Taoist master, which can be traced back to the worship activities of the Chinese people during the primitive society, such as worshiping the sky, ancestors, and witchcraft. By the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, it absorbed the magic of immortals and formed the Fangxian Tao. Later, it merged with the thoughts of Taoism and Yin-Yang School such as "Five Elements" and "Yin and Yang" to form the Yellow Emperor School. In the middle and late Han Dynasty, it formed the Huang-Lao Tao. After the religious reforms in the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the integration of sects in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, it gradually evolved into the current Taoism.
In early June 2018, the Bureau of Transportation announced revisions to the "Road Traffic Law", and announced a 60-day public consultation from June 28 to August 26 of the same year, suggesting that the fines for some administrative violations be increased by more than 1 times, the fines for general illegal parking and sidewalk parking be increased from 300 yuan to 600 yuan, the fines for parking on yellow solid lines be increased from 600 yuan to 900 yuan, the fines for not stopping or slowing down when a bus leaves the station be increased from 600 yuan to 1,200 yuan, and the fines for illegal parking at bus stops be increased 3 times, from 300 yuan to 1,200 yuan, etc. It also suggested increasing penalties for drunk driving, drug driving, speeding, and introducing a points system.

Among these few pedestrians is a tall young man in a white T-shirt and gray trousers with an ordinary face.
Hao Ren feels that students these days are becoming less and less dedicated. When he was working outside handing out leaflets, he would never give such things to men who were obviously single. But no matter what, this kind of hard leaflet is quite suitable for fanning.
"Last two places, if it doesn't work out, forget it." Hao Ren muttered as he looked at the last two job advertisements in his hand. Fortunately, these two places are next to each other, so he can quickly complete today's "task". One of them is right in front, an advertising company that doesn't look very powerful from the outside, but the sign at the door is loud: Galaxy Media Pan-Cultural Development and Promotion Company. Just by hearing this name, you can tell it's a company that will go bankrupt within half a year. Hao Ren came here for this name, not mainly for the job, but to see what kind of extraordinary person the boss of the company that came up with such a magical name would be.
He walked enthusiastically for several hundred meters before bypassing the road barrier, then ran to the front of this advertising company with a special name under the scorching sun, and was surprised to find - this company really went bankrupt. The sign at the door was still hanging, but there was a notice of closure on the glass door, dated two days ago, and the job advertisement in his hand was from four days ago... This is a world that changes frequently. Did the company still need to recruit a few new employees to calm down before it went bankrupt two days ago?
Casually crumpling the job advertisement of the advertising company into a ball and throwing it into the trash can on the side of the road, Hao Ren looked down at the last one, and two seconds later, he also crumpled it into a ball and threw it into the same place, reflecting on whether he was blind when he screened this thing two days ago - the bus company is recruiting an office clerk, aged 25 to 40, who can endure hardship, understand computers, and those with work experience are preferred, female.
He came to the city center with this thing enthusiastically, just to see how bright the glass door of an advertising company that was still busy recruiting workers two days before it went bankrupt was. It was simply a waste of time.
Hao Ren, male, likes women, 25 years old, no bad habits, the advantage is that he is not picky about food, currently single, not many friends and relatives, living alone in the old house left by his parents in the old city area in the south of the city, like most young men, his life goal is to earn over ten thousand a month at the age of 25, marry a beautiful wife, and if possible, have a car. His parents can't be filial, so at least he has to live well enough to not disgrace his family. Now this series of life goals has been completed by one third: he is 25 this year.
This is really a sad story.
He came to the city today to find a job, but in fact, he doesn't have any urgent need for a source of livelihood: as mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lives in an old house left by his parents, and should be grateful for the family business left by the older generation, at least the house is quite big - it is a two-story old house, which has been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For many years, Hao Ren has been living by renting out the house, but because the place he lives is really remote, even so remote that he has to make several ten-year plans to wait for the old house to be demolished.
To be fair, with this stable income, Hao Ren doesn't need to find a job, but people, if they have too much free time, they will feel a bit pretentious, always feeling that they should make a little effort to open up their life path, plus the more important reason - his old house is really too remote, so remote that it is almost out of human civilization, since the last couple of migrant workers moved out of the rental house, it has been half a year since anyone came to rent the house, looking at the empty two-story "apartment" for several consecutive months, Hao Ren deeply realized one thing: unless the city planning leans towards his side, otherwise, if he wants to survive, he really has to find a job.
After studying the city planning at home for three days, Hao Ren believes that the possibility of his home becoming a business center overnight is really not great. Considering that as a big man, he can't waste himself like this, he finally decided to find a job first, at least there is income to maintain life.
How can he starve to death in the world when he used to be a hardworking good man who worked to pay for his tuition?
However, fate does not change according to people's will. He spent the whole day running around outside... and basically, all that was left was running around.
Thinking so much is useless, Hao Ren stretched lazily, decided to rest under the shade of a small park bench for a while, wait until the hottest hour at noon to find a small restaurant to fill his stomach, and then take a bus home.
Even though the economy is developing rapidly, it can still maintain some leisure and openness of a small place. He found a piece of paper to wipe the bench clean, then lay down boldly, using the leaflet with the logo of a women's hospital and a beautiful girl to cover his face to block the sun, and rested carelessly.
But just as he had just lain down for less than a minute, the sunlight coming in from the edge of the leaflet had already dimmed, as if someone had come to his side. Hao Ren was slightly surprised to reveal his face, and was shocked to find that the sky was already sunset, and a petite and slender female figure was standing next to him. This figure just blocked the sinking sunset, and because of the backlight, he couldn't see the woman's appearance clearly, he could only confirm through a dim silhouette that the other party was a slim short-haired girl.
"Oh, you're awake?"
At this time, the strange girl seemed to finally realize that her position against the light made it difficult for others to see her face, so she grinned and slightly turned her body so that the other party could see her face.
A very beautiful girl - this is Hao Ren's first impression.
This outgoing girl has shoulder-length short hair, probably likes sports very much, her skin has a slight wheat color, healthy and full of sunshine, her face is beautiful and lovely, the most noticeable are those pair of lively big eyes, more vibrant than any pair of eyes Hao Ren has ever seen, as if the whole person's spirit is about to come out from these eyes.
And behind her is a large travel suitcase that looks quite heavy.
Looking at the somewhat stunned Hao Ren, this short-haired beautiful girl burst into an unprecedentedly bright silly smile (although it seems a bit inappropriate to say so, but Hao Ren really thinks this is a silly smile), that smile is clean and pure, it seems that it is rare to see on the face of a girl of the same age these days, the other party rummaged in her small bag for a long time, finally found a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Hao Ren: "Excuse me, do you know where this place is?"
Hao Ren slapped his face to wake himself up, not caring about what this careless girl was doing, but looked down at the address on the paper... Oh my god, isn't this his own home?
Chapter 1
The faint light of dawn pierced the dark blue sky, casting a pale white glow across the vast horizon.
In Xianyu County, Wuzong Academy, in the back mountain forest, a thin young man in a loose martial robe squatted with his tongue against his teeth, concentrating all his strength on his fists, punching a thick tree.
His boxing technique was smooth, flexible, and restrained, showing a balance of hardness and softness, already showing some skill.
The young man's name was Su Yu, fourteen years old, handsome and upright, still with a hint of childishness.
His black hair fluttered, and his eyes, as vast as the stars and as deep as the ancient starry sky, showed a wisdom that did not match his age.
Three hours later, the sun was high in the sky.
Su Yu stopped punching, looked down at his blood-stained fists, and sighed softly, "I work twice as hard as others, but the results I get are less than half of those with better qualifications."
"Coming to this different world, I really don't know if it's a blessing or a curse."
Two months ago, Su Yu was in a plane crash. When he woke up, he found himself in a world called the Divine Moon Continent.
He became a student of a martial arts academy on the continent.
It took him two full months to digest the memories of the original owner.
On the Divine Moon Continent, martial arts are revered, the law of the jungle prevails, and the world is cruel and strict.
Humans practice martial arts, reaching the peak and achieving the realm of transcendence.
Martial arts are divided into nine levels, each with three stages: minor achievement, major achievement, and peak.
Beyond the nine levels of martial arts, breaking the shackles, one can become a god, a legendary figure, known as the "Saint King of the World".
The realm of the Saint King of the World is the ultimate in martial arts, the limit pursued by billions of people.
It is rumored that the Saint King of the World can move mountains and seas, ride clouds and fog, and is omnipotent.
A Saint King of the World can change the fate of a dynasty for a hundred years and is a god-like existence.
However, how difficult is it to practice in the world?
Su Yu is the top genius of Xianyu County, under the jurisdiction of Qingshan Town. At only fourteen years old, he has practiced to the peak of the first level of martial arts, becoming a once-in-a-century genius in the eyes of everyone in Qingshan Town.
But, after he was admitted to the Wuzong Academy, which is above all else in Xianyu County, Su Yu realized how much of a frog in a well he had been.
Wuzong Academy, which gathers all the geniuses of Xianyu County, enrolls once a year.
And he, among all the geniuses of Wuzong Academy, is merely at the bottom!
Wuzong Academy divides students into three categories according to their qualifications.
Golden students, excellent level geniuses, often the best in a city, suppressing the top geniuses of other cities, will receive key training from Wuzong Academy.
Silver students, potential level geniuses, in small towns, have a higher talent than others, with a little effort, there may be hope.
Su Yu is a silver student. He understands that silver students are actually those who have no hope of achieving great success in their practice, but it's a pity to give up. They are like chicken ribs, tasteless to eat but a pity to discard.
Silver students are not favored, the resources given by the academy for practice are very limited, and the possibility of standing out is close to zero.
"Su Yu, hurry back to the academy, Duke Qin wants to see you!" A hurried voice broke the silence of the mountain forest, and a middle-aged man in blue ran up the mountain, panting, with a look of urgency on his face.
"Duke Qin is not someone you can keep waiting. Come with me!" The middle-aged man in blue was impatient, grabbed Su Yu's shoulder, and dragged him down the mountain quickly, regardless of hurting Su Yu's thin body.
Su Yu bit his teeth, endured the severe pain in his shoulder, and said nothing.
The middle-aged man in blue is a steward of the academy, managing the daily activities of the students, in the words of Earth's schools, he is the dean of discipline.
Half a cup of tea later.
In the academy, there is a luxurious and elegant, dreamlike lounge.
Only core students, high-level academy, and dignitaries can rest here. Apart from these, golden students and silver students are not qualified.
This is Su Yu's first time in the luxurious lounge. An ordinary poor boy might be nervous here. But Su Yu, who was a business elite in his previous life, was a regular at five-star hotels, presidential suites, and luxurious parties. He was calm and composed, not surprised by honor or disgrace.
In the lounge, there were three people, a young man and woman, and a man with a noble and extraordinary demeanor.
When his gaze swept over the fourteen-year-old girl, Su Yu paused slightly.
She was a beautiful woman with a face as pretty as an elf, a complexion as delicate as a sculpture, skin as white as spring snow, a curvaceous figure, dressed in a spotless white dress, like a fox fairy, extremely beautiful.
However, the look she gave Su Yu was cold, with a hint of complexity.
Beside her was a sixteen-year-old boy, handsome and heroic, indescribably noble.
"Hehe, I am Duke Qin, I'm glad to meet you." Duke Qin, one of the three dukes of the Maple Forest Empire, was not arrogant at all, but extremely friendly, smiling and inviting Su Yu to sit down.
Su Yu shook his head inwardly, unmoved by the friendliness.
Those in high positions, under the scrutiny of millions of people, pay great attention to their own cultivation and image.
Just like politicians on Earth, even though they are at odds with each other, they still shake hands and exchange pleasantries when they meet, smiling all the while, only stabbing each other in the back and playing dirty tricks behind the scenes.
"I am Qin Feng's father, and I am here for his and Qing'er's affairs." Duke Qin's handsome face showed a warm smile, "I have heard everything from Feng'er, and for this, as Feng'er's father, I apologize to you."
A bitterness flashed in Su Yu's heart, the bitterness of another Su Yu's broken soul. The girl in front of him, named Jiang Xueqing, was a genius who came out of Qingshan Town with Su Yu and was also admitted as a student of Wuzong Academy.
The two were childhood sweethearts, golden boy and jade girl, a match made in heaven.
However, after entering Wuzong Academy, Jiang Xueqing, who came from a small town, was hit by the vast and bustling world and gradually lost herself in the flashy world.
With her fox fairy-like beauty, it was hard to avoid being pursued by young nobles and talented geniuses.
At first, she was able to convince herself to stick to her heart and spend the first school year with Su Yu.
But gradually, she, who understood the cruelty of the world, transformed from a naive little girl, knowing that Su Yu would have a hard future, following her, he might suffer and become a lowly person.
Finally, her inner defenses collapsed.
Two months ago, she completely cut off contact with Su Yu and became the companion of Duke Qin's son, the young Duke Qin Feng.
Although Jiang Xueqing adhered to the decency of a good girl and never overstepped the boundaries of male-female relationships, from then on, the two were often seen together, inseparable, becoming the enviable fairy couple in everyone's eyes.
And Su Yu became the laughingstock of Wuzong Academy.
Su Yu was deeply hurt, begged Jiang Xueqing to change her mind many times, even knelt down and begged, losing face, but was coldly rejected by Jiang Xueqing.
Unable to bear the great sadness and downfall of his life, Su Yu tried to commit suicide by jumping into a lake. Coincidentally, the Su Yu from Earth had a plane crash, and his soul crossed over to this pitiful and pathetic weakling.
Seeing Su Yu lost in memory, Duke Qin thought he was having a hard time letting go of his feelings for Jiang Xueqing, and sighed, "Feng'er is young and ignorant, for his mistakes, I am willing to pay compensation, whatever you want, just ask, but as a father, I hope you can make way for Feng'er, he is serious about Miss Xueqing."
Listening to Duke Qin's seemingly heartfelt words, Su Yu shook his head inwardly, this trick might fool ordinary people, but it was useless to him.
You took my girlfriend and asked me to make way? This is not an apology, it's clearly bullying!
Duke Qin seems to have a gentle attitude, but it is full of naked insults.
I ask, if it is the woman of the king, the woman of the emperor, and his son takes a fancy to her, would Duke Qin dare to let the king give his woman to Qin Feng? He dare not, because he can't afford to offend the king, he can only offend ordinary people like Su Yu!
Su Yu shook his head lightly, got up and wanted to leave. He had no lingering feelings for a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing. Even if Duke Qin did not oppress people with power, he had no intention of fighting for her.
As for the so-called compensation of Duke Qin, although Su Yu lacks cultivation resources, although he is a poor boy, although he has nothing. But, he still has an unyielding will, and he has not fallen to the point of being given alms by others.
Jiang Xueqing understood Su Yu's character, stubborn and unwilling to admit defeat. Seeing him wanting to leave, she thought he was still unwilling to give up. She gently bit her silver teeth, moved her lotus steps lightly, and her snowy eyes were like cold moonlight: "Su Yu! Please respect my choice!"
"Since it's today, I will speak out completely, I hope you can give up." Jiang Xueqing's eyes flashed coldly.
"Qin Feng is a small country duke, and he will be the pillar of the empire in the future. He can give me wealth and honor. Can you, a poor boy from the mountain village, give it to me?"
"Qin Feng is a golden student, and he will catch up with the holy king of the world in the future, standing above billions of people, can he give me a sense of security, can you, a silver student, give it to me?"
"Su Yu, accept the reality. I don't deny that you were once my affection, the most dazzling genius in my heart, but, I was too young, too simple, the real world, cruel and real, I have no choice!"
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last trace of concern in her eyes, looked at Su Yu's eyes, gradually distant, as if looking at a stranger, sighed softly: "Brother Feng is very good, as long as you promise not to find me in the future, he will try his best to compensate you, give you a few soul-melting treasures, promote your cultivation, your strength will improve, and your days in school will be much better."
After thinking about it, Jiang Xueqing took out a palm-sized, crystal-carved female statue from her sleeve.
It was crystal clear and shimmering with brilliant depth. The most beautiful thing is that the woman in the crystal statue is ethereal and beautiful, like a fox fairy, so beautiful as a fairy, so fascinating.
The statue of the woman looks lifelike, exactly the same as the owner holding it, Jiang Xueqing.
"This is the token of love you gave me, now, give it back to you, we, from now on, owe each other nothing." Jiang Xueqing ruthlessly stuffed the statue into Su Yu's hand, turned around and returned to Qin Feng's side, looking at the sky, no longer looking at Su Yu, cold and ruthless.
"Chi Yao, why do you want to kill me?"
Zhang Ruochen roared and wanted to pounce forward. The golden bed creaked and he suddenly sat up.
Realizing it was just a dream, Zhang Ruochen took a long breath and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve.
No!
That's not a dream!
How could everything that happened between him and Princess Chi Yao be a dream?
Zhang Ruochen was originally the only son of "Ming Emperor", one of the nine emperors of the Kunlun world. At the age of only sixteen, he cultivated to the perfect state of the sky with his against-the-heaven physique.
However, when he became the first person among the younger generation of the Kunlun world, he died in the hands of his childhood sweetheart and fiancée, Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chi Yao is the daughter of one of the nine emperors, "Qing Emperor".
The Ming Emperor and the Qing Emperor are the best friends, and Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao are even engaged to each other, growing up together and practicing together.
One is heroic, the other is beautiful, they can be described as a golden boy and a jade girl, and they could have become a good story in the cultivation world. Zhang Ruochen never expected that Princess Chi Yao would actually make a move on him!
After being killed by Princess Chi Yao, when Zhang Ruochen woke up again, he found that he was already eight hundred years later.
The former Princess Chi Yao, settled the chaos of the nine emperors, unified the nine countries, established the first central empire, and became the ruler of the entire Kunlun world - Empress Chi Yao.
Eight hundred years ago, the nine emperors who dominated the Kunlun world completely became the past and disappeared in the long river of history.
The nine emperors are dead, and the empress should stand.
In this era, there is only one emperor, that is, Empress Chi Yao, who rules the world and dominates all directions.
"Why did she want to kill me?
How can her heart be so cruel, or is the heart of a woman so cruel?" Zhang Ruochen's eyes were sharp, his heart was as heavy as iron, full of doubts. But, there is no one who can help him answer.
Eight hundred years have passed, and the world has changed. Except for the peerless Empress Chi Yao, who is still young and immortal.
All those old friends have turned into yellow soil and become white bones. Even the nine emperors who were once powerful have all disappeared in the world, leaving only a series of glorious stories that have been passed down for a long time.
"Squeak!"
A weakly dressed beauty in palace dress walked in from outside, looking at Zhang Ruochen sitting on the bed, with a concerned look, "Dust, did you have a nightmare again?"
The beautiful woman in front of him is the queen of Yunwu County, and Zhang Ruochen's mother, Lin Fei.
The original owner of this body, because of his weak body and many diseases, died on the bed three days ago.
After Zhang Ruochen was killed by Princess Chi Yao, when he woke up again, he appeared in this body, allowing the originally dead boy to come back to life.
What's more coincidental is that the original owner of this body is also called Zhang Ruochen. When Zhang Ruochen first woke up, he was very resistant to Lin Fei.
After all, in Zhang Ruochen's eyes, Lin Fei is just a stranger. But after three days of contact, Zhang Ruochen gradually found that Lin Fei really cared about him, almost meticulously, and when she saw Zhang Ruochen being frightened by a nightmare, she rushed to Zhang Ruochen's room regardless of the cold weather.
In his previous life, Zhang Ruochen had never seen his biological mother. It is said that she died when he was born!
Unexpectedly, after being killed by Princess Chi Yao, he was reborn in this body, and he actually had an extra mother, feeling the warmth of maternal love. "Maybe she doesn't know yet, her dust, died of illness three days ago!"
If she tells her the truth, she may not be able to bear the shock of this bad news.
Zhang Ruochen looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes softened, and he smiled slightly: "Mother, don't worry about me, it's just a dream."
Lin Fei, wearing a thin body with a red hooded mink fur, sat on the edge of Zhang Ruochen's bed, stroking Zhang Ruochen's forehead, worriedly said: "It's been three nights, you are always scared by nightmares, every time you call 'Chi Yao'. Who is she?"
Lin Fei naturally couldn't associate the name "Chi Yao" with the empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after Empress Chi Yao unified the Kunlun world and established the First Central Empire, she was known as the "Great Majesty and Virtue Female Saint Emperor", and no one dared to mention the two words "Chi Yao" in normal times.
It would be taboo. Zhang Ruochen said: "It's nothing, mother, you heard it wrong!"
Lin Fei sighed and said, "Don't ever call 'Chi Yao' directly in the future, even in your dreams. That's the name of the empress. It's a great disrespect to call the empress's name directly. Once it's heard by someone with a heart, you will be executed."
Zhang Ruochen nodded, squeezed his fingers tightly, and said meaningfully: "Absolutely not!"
In the future, I will be her nightmare.
Lin Fei looked at the frail and pale-faced Zhang Ruochen, sighed softly, and felt an indescribable sorrow in her heart.
Although he was born in the house of a prince, he had been weak and sickly since childhood. Now sixteen years old, he could still only lie in bed all year round. She feared that this would be his life from now on!
Outside, there was a sound of chaotic footsteps.
"What are you doing?"
A beautiful maid tried to stop the Eighth Prince who was barging in, but was lightly pushed by him and fell more than ten meters away. The Eighth Prince was a martial artist, his cultivation had reached the late stage of the Yellow Extreme Realm. With one palm strike, he could send a stone plate weighing three hundred jin flying ten meters away, let alone a maid who only weighed a hundred jin or so?
With a flick of his finger, he could send her flying.
The maid screamed, fell heavily to the ground, and her left arm was broken.
The Eighth Prince, dressed in a golden robe with a jade belt around his waist, was robust, with long arms and steady steps. He walked into the Jade Palace, glanced coldly at the maid, and said, "A mere servant dares to block my way, she's asking for death."
Behind the Eighth Prince, there were six guards in scale armor, tall and burly, obviously powerful martial arts practitioners, belonging to the royal guard.
Upon hearing the commotion outside, Lin Fei comforted Zhang Ruochen's emotions, then closed the door and went out.
She stared at the Eighth Prince standing outside, slightly frowning, and said, "Your Highness, this is the Jade Palace. Even if you are a prince, you can't just barge in!"
Eighth Prince Zhang Ji looked up at Lin Fei and said loudly, "The Queen has ordered that the sleeping quarters of Lady Lin Fei and the Ninth Prince be moved to the 'Zi Yi Side Hall'. From now on, the mistress of the Jade Palace will be my birth mother, Lady Xiao Fei."
Lin Fei's face changed slightly. She had expected this day to come, but she didn't expect it to come so soon.
Lin Fei gave a bitter smile and said, "Is the Queen so eager to drive us mother and son out of the Jade Palace? Alright then!
My mother said she wants to move into the Jade Palace tonight. Please, Lady Lin Fei, move to the side hall now!"
The Eighth Prince gave a cold smile and said without any courtesy, "Lady Lin Fei, there are many pitiful people in this world, but not everyone is worth pitying. Since the Ninth Prince is weak and sickly, why is he still alive?"
"He is your ninth brother!"
Lin Fei wanted to say something else, but suddenly, the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruochen was weak and had to lean on the door frame to barely stand. He stared at the Eighth Prince not far away.
His seemingly frail body seemed to contain an unyielding will. He said, "Don't beg them, we'll move now."
"Dust, why did you get out of bed? The weather outside is cold, go back quickly." Lin Fei hurriedly went up to support Zhang Ruochen, fearing that he would catch a cold.
Lin Fei looked at Zhang Ruochen's determined eyes, seemed to be infected by his emotions, and nodded with tears in her eyes.
Lin Fei and Can helped Zhang Ruochen to walk out of the Jade Palace step by step, except for the maid who was pushed out by the Eighth Prince and broke her arm.
The other servants did not leave the Jade Palace with them. Everyone could see that Lin Fei and the Ninth Prince had completely lost their power. In the Prince's Mansion, they no longer had a foothold.
They were originally servants of the Jade Palace, so now they naturally chose to stay in the Jade Palace and please the new master, the Eighth Prince.
The Zi Yi Side Hall was usually where the out-of-favor queens lived. It was very remote, with leaves all over the ground, and it seemed that no one had lived there for a long time.
The night was deep and the wind was bleak.
Sitting on the cold stone bench, Zhang Ruochen was wrapped in a coat, but still felt cold.
"This body is too weak. Only by practicing martial arts can I gradually strengthen my body.
Otherwise, even if I am now the son of a prince, I can only be manipulated by others." Zhang Ruochen thought to himself.
Eight hundred years had passed, and Zhang Ruochen didn't know where he could go now?
Since heaven arranged for him to be reborn in this body, whether it was for revenge on Empress Chi Yao in the future, or for his mother who took care of him meticulously, he had to become stronger. The humiliation and cold treatment he suffered today were all because he was too weak to resist, to control his own destiny, and even his place of residence was occupied by others.
If he wanted to earn the respect of others and live in a warm and comfortable environment, he had to become a martial artist and prove his abilities.
In the Kunlun Realm, to become a martial artist, one must first open the "Divine Martial Seal".
The so-called "Divine Martial Seal" is the qualification given by the gods to humans to practice martial arts.
Those who have not opened the "Divine Martial Seal" will never be able to cultivate true qi and become a strong person in the world. Zhang Ruochen was already sixteen years old and had not yet opened the "Divine Martial Seal".
After the age of sixteen, he missed the best age for martial arts training. Even if he opened the "Divine Martial Seal", he would not achieve much.
Why is the Eighth Prince superior to others even though they are both sons of the Yunwu Prince? Why can he drive Zhang Ruochen and Lin Fei out of the Jade Palace?
It's because the Eighth Prince opened the "Divine Martial Seal" when he was ten years old, and now he is a young martial artist in the late stage of the Yellow Extreme Realm.
"As long as I open the 'Divine Martial Seal', I can practice the 'Nine Heavens Bright Emperor Sutra'.
With the mystery of the 'Nine Heavens Bright Emperor Sutra', even if I have missed the best age for cultivation, I can still catch up with other geniuses and become a martial arts powerhouse again." The 'Nine Heavens Bright Emperor Sutra' is the supreme treasure of the Bright Emperor's cultivation. Apart from the Bright Emperor, only Zhang Ruochen knows the complete cultivation method of the 'Nine Heavens Bright Emperor Sutra'.
"Tomorrow is the Grand Sacrifice Ceremony, I hope I can get the approval of the gods and open the 'Divine Martial Seal'."
Zhang Ruochen clenched his fists, full of desire to open the "Divine Martial Seal".
After Lin Fei tidied up the room, she came over to help Zhang Ruochen, "Dust, you should rest early! Tomorrow, we have to attend the Grand Sacrifice Ceremony."
"Mother, don't worry, I will definitely open the 'Divine Martial Seal' tomorrow!" said Zhang Ruochen.
"Okay!
Lin Fei looked deeply at Zhang Ruochen and sighed softly in her heart.
Chapter One
With a "clang", a rusty iron gate was opened, and the echo was blocked by the surrounding ancient buildings, lingering on.
A few breaths later, a young man with his head drooping was dragged out from the iron gate by two prison guards. This young man, who was drooping his head, seemed to have stopped breathing, and even his arms were so thin that only bones were left. From his blood-stained ragged clothes, it could be seen that this young man had suffered some kind of torture and torment.
"Bang", the thin man was thrown on the ground by the two prison guards, stirring up some dust, and then there was no movement.
"This kid should be dead, right?" A short and fat prison guard stared at the young man lying motionless on the ground and asked.
The other prison guard grunted, "He should be dead. Who told him to be reckless and disrespect Miss Jian. Now it's good, not only was the Ning Mansion destroyed, but he himself is also relieved, it serves him right."
"Old Hui, be careful with your words, let's drag him out and deal with him first." The short and fat prison guard quickly warned.
Hearing the words of the short and fat prison guard, the other prison guard who was called Old Hui involuntarily shrank his head, and was about to lift the breathless man on the ground to drag him away.
Just at this moment, a somewhat weak voice called from the side, "Two brothers, I want to take my husband away."
The two talking prison guards then saw a woman in coarse linen clothes standing on the side. Although the woman was wearing coarse linen clothes, her extraordinary demeanor could still be vaguely seen. The only regret was that her face had been disfigured, covered by slightly messy hair, making people unwilling to look at her a second time.
Both prison guards recognized who this woman was, she was one of the only two survivors of the Ning family.
Ning Gao was the steward of the Ning Mansion. When the Ning Mansion was ransacked, he was out of the country on business, so he escaped. And this woman was the daughter-in-law of the Ning Mansion, and also the wife of the thin man who had just been thrown out of the prison, named Ji Luofei.
She survived because she stayed at the Cang Qin Two-Star Academy. Of course, this was also because Ji Luofei had little to do with the Ning family. The reason she married into the Ning family was because the Ning family and the Ji family were old friends, and she and Ning Cheng were engaged since childhood. It's just that the Ji family fell in the most inexplicable way, and in the end, only a disfigured Ji Luofei was left.
Even so, Ning Cheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still took Ji Luofei into the mansion. He planned to wait until Ning Cheng really gathered his energy, and then let the two get married.
"Alright, alright, drag him away, it's ugly to leave him here." The short and fat prison guard put away the silver coin and waved his hand impatiently.
They were originally going to deal with Ning Cheng's body, but they didn't expect someone to come over to deal with it, and also gave them silver coins. They would certainly not refuse such a good thing.
Hearing this, Ji Luofei quickly picked up Ning Cheng and sped up. She soon disappeared from the prison gate.
"This Ji Luofei would have been a beauty if she hadn't been disfigured." Watching Ji Luofei's back, the other prison guard tossed the silver coin in his hand and said in a judgmental tone.
"Stop talking nonsense, Ji Luofei is a person from the Cang Qin Two-Star Academy after all, even if she is ugly, it's not our turn." The short and fat prison guard patted the shoulder of the talking prison guard, and pulled him back into the iron gate.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled a very pleasant fragrance. When he opened his eyes, the first thing he saw was a white neck. The next moment, Ning Xiaocheng reacted, he was being carried by a woman, and the fragrance was coming from the woman who was carrying him.
That's not right, he remembered that after being rejected by Tian Muwan, he was in a very bad mood, and as a result, he took the wrong path and walked onto the overpass alone. Then a yellow light from the horizon hit him, and then there was no more.
Could it be that he is not dead yet? What's going on?
Just as Ning Xiaocheng thought of this, various pieces of information rushed into his mind, and he was reborn.
What shocked Ning Xiaocheng was that the body he was reborn into was called Ning Cheng. The reason he was shocked was because his original name was also Ning Cheng.
It's just that he often had a nightmare, that is, he saw himself coming to a very strange place, being schemed and locked in a prison, and then tortured to death. Although it was just a dream, Ning Cheng still changed his name to Ning Xiaocheng.
Unexpectedly, after all the twists and turns, he was still called Ning Cheng, and he was really reborn in the environment of his dream.
Ning Xiaocheng wanted to raise his hand to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, but the woman carrying him turned her head and looked at him without saying much.
"I'm sorry, I don't have the strength to walk." Seeing the woman turn her head and glance at him, Ning Xiaocheng said apologetically.
"The Ning family is gone, you are lucky to be alive." The woman's tone was calm, as if even if Ning Xiaocheng was really dead, she would still have this calm attitude.
Ning Xiaocheng fell silent, he had just sorted out some fragmented information. He should now be called Ning Cheng again, the only descendant of the Ning family in the Cang Qin Kingdom.
Ning Cheng's parents went to the Mango Sea to look for spiritual objects when Ning Cheng was very young, and then they never came back. Ning Cheng has been living with his grandfather, Ning Hongchang, in the capital of the Cang Qin Kingdom, Cang Le City. Although the Ning Mansion was large, there were not many people.
Of course, Ning Cheng also became the first person in the Ning Mansion, and Ning Hongchang never cared about Ning Cheng. All the bad things Ning Cheng did in Cang Le City were taken by Ning Hongchang. There are princes and nobles everywhere in Cang Le City. Although Ning Hongchang is also an elder of the Cang Qin Kingdom, he is still a bit inferior compared to those princes and nobles.
Finally one day, Ning Cheng caused a trouble that even he couldn't bear. He actually offended Jian Su Jie, the pearl of the Jian family in the Cang Qin Kingdom. Not to mention that the Jian family is not something the Ning family can afford to offend, even Jian Su Jie's fiancé, Qiu Yingguang, is not something the Ning family can afford to offend.
Ning Cheng sighed when he thought of this. The result of his offense was of course being locked in prison. His grandfather, Ning Hongchang, tried to bail him out by exhausting his connections and family wealth. As a result, he was not bailed out, but instead dragged the entire Ning family into it. This news was learned from the mouth of the prison guard by his predecessor. It can be said that the Ning family was also destroyed because of him.
After sorting out these things, Ning Cheng sighed again in his heart. There is no reason in this world, whoever has the bigger fist is the reason.
At the same time, he also understood who the person carrying him was. This disfigured woman was his fiancée, named Ji Luofei, somewhat similar to a child bride on Earth.
Later, the Ji family inexplicably fell, leaving only a disfigured Ji Luofei. But Ning Cheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still took Ji Luofei to the Ning family, planning to wait for Ning Cheng to gather his energy, and then help the two get married.
Ning Hongchang indulged Ning Cheng in other matters, but he would not compromise on the matter of marrying Ji Luofei as his wife. The original Ning Cheng was very dissatisfied with the disfigured Ji Luofei, often beating and scolding her. Fortunately, Ji Luofei was submissive and never rebutted Ning Cheng. Moreover, Ji Luofei was different from Ning Cheng, she had qualifications and could cultivate.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, she entered the Cang Qin Two-Star Academy and has already become a cultivator at the third level of Qi Gathering. In the Cang Qin Kingdom, anyone who can cultivate is called a cultivator.
At this moment, Ji LuoFei had already carried him into an extremely low black stone house. Although the black stone house was low, the area was not too small, at least it had everything it should have. There was even a small courtyard with a deep well in it.
Even if it concerned himself, Ning Cheng had to clarify this matter. Although he guessed it was the work of the Jian family and the Qiu family, he still had to ask some questions.
"Why ask me about what you did yourself?" Ji LuoFei simply answered, and then let Ning Cheng down.
After saying that, she poured a glass of clear water for Ning Cheng, and then said, "I'm going to boil water for your bath, forget some things, you know it's not good for you."
Ning Cheng watched Ji LuoFei go to boil water, and did not continue to ask questions, he understood Ji LuoFei's meaning. With his ability, the more he knew, the faster he would die.
Ning Cheng didn't know if Ji LuoFei had added something to that glass of water, but he felt that after drinking it, he had regained some strength.
Ning Cheng sat on the old wooden couch, thinking about his current situation one moment, and his sister Ning RuoLan the next. At the same time, he really didn't understand why Tian MuWan treated him that way, according to his understanding of Tian MuWan, she was definitely not that kind of snobbish girl.
Chapter 1
Chu Li was sailing on the lake, the lake breeze brushing his face, refreshing and invigorating.
The residence of the Duke of Yi was a vast lake of ten thousand hectares, with ninety-nine islands. The Martial Arts Hall he was heading to was eighteen miles away from the East Garden.
On the small boat, he was of average build, dressed in a fluttering green shirt. His appearance was ordinary but he had a heroic aura. He looked at the vast lake, his thoughts drifting far away.
Nineteen years, two months, and three days, it had been nineteen years, two months, and three days!
A distinguished high-energy physicist, a promising top student, a future great scientist, due to a small mistake in an experiment, he arrived in this world after an explosion, reincarnated and started life anew!
"Bang!" A muffled sound broke his contemplation. He turned his head to see a golden carp flopping non-stop on the boat.
Chu Li shook his head, bent down to throw the carp back into the lake. Standing up straight, a tall building came into his view.
A hundred-meter-tall building, shimmering with bronze light, solemn and majestic, fully demonstrating the grandeur of the Duke's residence.
This bronze building was the Martial Arts Hall!
In front of the Martial Arts Hall was a spacious martial arts training ground, with red clay on the ground. Hundreds of people were practicing martial arts, either practicing with swords, fists, or palms, or sparring with each other, bustling with activity.
Chu Li docked the boat and stepped onto the training ground. He hadn't walked far when a handsome young man suddenly appeared. He was tall and handsome, with sword-like eyebrows and a spirited demeanor.
He was taller than Chu Li by a head, looking down at him with his arms folded: "Chu, what are you doing here?!"
Chu Li frowned: "Move aside, a good dog doesn't block the way!"
The handsome young man laughed: "Do you want to practice martial arts?"
Chu Li suddenly smiled and continued to walk forward: "Zhuo Feiyang, believe it or not, if I fall and scream, you'll be in trouble."
The guards of the residence were forbidden to fight privately, not allowed to kill each other. The guards were divided into protective guards and attendant guards, one martial and one literary. Both were strictly forbidden to fight privately. The punishment ranged from demotion to expulsion from the residence.
Chu Li was an unranked attendant guard, while Zhuo Feiyang was an eighth-ranked protective guard. It was a big taboo for a protective guard to attack an attendant guard. If he fell and screamed, Zhuo Feiyang would be severely punished no matter how talented he was.
Zhuo Feiyang frowned: "Chu, fine, you're shameless!" Chu Li continued to walk forward.
Zhuo Feiyang stepped aside, his handsome face gloomy: "Chu, you can only resort to these petty tricks!"
Chu Li laughed: "To deal with a fool like you, petty tricks are enough!"
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him, his fists clenched tighter and tighter, as if he was about to strike at any moment. Chu Li, however, looked at him lazily, full of provocation.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly showed a brilliant smile and waved his hand: "Sister Zhao!"
A beautiful and graceful young girl was walking towards them from a distance. She had skin as white as snow, almond-shaped eyes, willow-like eyebrows, a delicate demeanor, and a gentle temperament.
Chu Li's face changed slightly. Zhao Ying, who entered the residence at the same time as them, was beautiful, kind, and gentle. She was the kind of woman that men would like at first sight.
"Brother Zhuo?" Zhao Ying walked over lightly and said in surprise: "Brother Chu?"
Chu Li sniffed the faint fragrance she brought with her and smiled: "Sister Zhao, long time no see."
Ever since he was assigned to the East Garden, he spent most of his time in the library, hoping to change his fate with knowledge, and rarely came to the Martial Arts Hall.
This time he came to the Martial Arts Hall because he encountered a problem while practicing the Small Meridian Cleansing Technique and wanted to look at the secret books and practice notes related to the Small Meridian Cleansing Technique.
Zhao Ying smiled: "Brother Chu, congratulations, the East Garden is a good place."
Chu Li nodded with a smile: "It's not bad."
The East Garden belonged to the third young lady, Xiao Qi's Jade Qi Island. Only he and Li Yue were the attendant guards there. Not only was it leisurely and comfortable, but they also had the opportunity to see the third young lady. Once they caught the third young lady's eye, their rise to prominence was just around the corner.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath. This guy was too lucky. He actually got into the East Garden. God was really blind. He had to teach him a lesson!
"Sister Zhao, don't bother with this waste. I just mastered the Breaking Delusion Sword Technique yesterday. Would you like to spar with me?"
Zhao Ying frowned, thinking that Zhuo Feiyang's words were unpleasant.
"Alright, alright, I won't call him a waste!" Zhuo Feiyang quickly apologized with a smile, glanced at Chu Li: "Even though he is a waste!"
Zhao Ying glared at him in dissatisfaction.
"Sister Zhao, it's okay," Chu Li smiled: "There's no need to argue with such an arrogant fool."
"Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying scolded.
Chu Li raised his hands in surrender: "Sister Zhao, come to the East Garden to play. The scenery is beautiful, and Brother Li's cooking skills are excellent."
"Hmph, what's there to see!" Zhuo Feiyang sneered: "It's just flowers and plants. It's better to practice martial arts in that time. Playing with things will lose ambition!" "So you're saying that the third young lady and the eldest son are losing their ambition, aren't they?" Chu Li said with a smile that wasn't quite a smile. The West Garden belonged to the eldest son, Xiao Tieying.
Zhuo Feiyang's handsome face turned red, and he laughed coldly, deciding not to argue with him.
"Brother Zhuo! Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying scolded in dissatisfaction: "Can you two stop for a moment! ...Brother Chu, I will come to play, you go ahead with your business."
Chu Li looked at her deeply: "Sister Zhao, some people only have a good appearance. It takes time to see a person's heart. Don't trust others easily!"
"What do you mean, Chu!"
Chu Li ignored him and smiled at Zhao Ying.
Zhao Ying turned and left.
Zhuo Feiyang hurried to follow her. As he was leaving, while Zhao Ying was not paying attention, he suddenly stretched out his hand.
His palm was almost about to slap Chu Li's face. He was very confident that Chu Li wouldn't have time to dodge. It seemed careless, but he had actually used his internal strength, and his speed was incredibly fast.
Chu Li slightly tilted his head, and Zhuo Feiyang's fingertips brushed past his cheek. He could feel the breeze, and the power of this palm was not light.
"Slap!"
A crisp slap sounded.
Chu Li slapped his own face with his left hand. The sound was loud and clear, but the force was not great. Then he quickly withdrew his hand.
Zhao Ying quickly turned her head to look. Chu Li's expression was unchanged, as if the slap was not on his own face.
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him with a gloomy face. Chu Li smiled, touched his own face: "What a good skill, I admire it!"
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him fiercely.
"Brother Zhuo——!" Zhao Ying's face darkened.
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I really didn't mean it." Zhuo Feiyang gritted his teeth, his voice squeezed out from between his teeth, and said coldly: "I'm sure Brother Chu won't mind, right, Brother Chu?"
Chu Li turned his head and smiled: "Sister Zhao, let it go."
Zhao Ying looked at him apologetically, quickly pulled Zhuo Feiyang away, and if they stayed any longer, the two would definitely start fighting!
Chu Li stared at Zhao Ying's graceful figure without moving, touched his burning left cheek, and activated the Great Round Mirror Wisdom to suppress the fluctuations in his emotions.
If it weren't for the Great Round Mirror Wisdom, he would have fallen into Zhuo Feiyang's trap!
In this world where martial arts are respected, the concept deeply ingrained since childhood, Zhao Ying is gentle and kind, openly and secretly protecting him, which moved him greatly.
But as a man, needing a woman to protect him, as a man, he really couldn't bear it!
He walked through the crowd on the training ground and entered the Martial Arts Hall.
He took off the wooden tag from his waist and handed it to the young man in front of the hall. The young man's eyes were sharp, he glanced at it and signaled that he could go in.
What came into view were rows of bookshelves. He walked leisurely, occasionally stopping, reaching out to pull out a book, quickly flipping through it, putting it back and continuing to walk, then stopping again, pulling out another book and flipping through it.
In one hour, he flipped through twenty-two books.
It seemed like he already knew the location of these books, he went straight to them and pulled them out. In fact, it was his first time here, he had read the Small Washing Pulse Manual in the library.
The entire Martial Arts Hall was presented in his mind, every row of bookshelves, every book's name, clear and vivid.
He casually walked to the second floor, directly to the third row of bookshelves, pulled out the Breaking Delusion Sword Manual from the second layer, flipped through it, and then pulled out seven secret manuals, which were the cultivation insights of the Breaking Delusion Sword Manual.
When he left the Martial Arts Hall, his mind had already imprinted thirty secret manuals, twenty-two notes on the cultivation of the Small Washing Pulse Manual, one Breaking Delusion Sword Manual, and seven cultivation insights of the Breaking Delusion Sword.
He was rowing a small boat on the lake, the breeze was gentle, and the original raging anger had dissipated.
The thirty secret manuals in his mind began to integrate.
The midday sun was scorching, he rowed back to the East Garden.
The East Garden is a small island with a radius of two miles, divided into flower beds, each bed with a unique flower, the entire island is filled with the fragrance of flowers.
There is only one small courtyard on the island. Chu Li pushed the door into the courtyard, a cool breeze hit his face, a large tree shaded half of the courtyard, driving away the heat.
He went into the west room, took out a green sword, and swung it in the middle of the courtyard, slow like Tai Chi sword, he was sweating after a while, his forehead shining.
He had a photographic memory, the secret manuals he read were imprinted in his mind after one glance, the Breaking Delusion Sword Technique he just learned from the Martial Arts Hall was indeed powerful, but it was also very exhausting.
"Zhiya..." A burly young man with a round face and small eyes came out of the main hall.
He swayed like a black bear, stretched lazily, yawned twice, and then spoke lazily: "Brother, you're back so early?"
Chu Li was focused on practicing his sword, he just hummed in response. Li Yue, a ninth-rank guard, was responsible for the East Garden with him. He loved food and was a great cook, his martial arts were good, but he was afraid of death and didn't dare to challenge the ninth-rank tower, so he was content to be a guard.
The guards and protectors of the Duke's Mansion were divided into nine ranks, with a tenfold difference in wages.
The guards' wages were low, and their ranks were based on seniority. Three years for the ninth rank, ten years for the eighth rank, twenty years for the seventh rank, forty years for the sixth rank, and seventy years for the fifth rank. The protectors' ranks were based solely on martial arts skills, they could rise one rank for each level they passed in the ninth-rank tower.
Their wages were high, and they could often leave the mansion to do tasks, leading a colorful life, unlike the guards who could only stay in the mansion to serve people. Anyone with a bit of ability would choose to be a protector.
Li Yue shook his neck, stretched his legs, his joints making a series of crackling sounds, then he started practicing his punches, his fists were like shooting stars, creating a gust of wind.
"Brother, stop practicing the sword, practice boxing with me!"
Chu Li spat out two words, his forehead covered in sweat the size of soybeans.
In this world, martial arts were flourishing, and training started from childhood.
From eight to eighteen years old, once the meridians were set, even the most magical techniques would be less effective, and it would take several times longer to build a foundation.
Before he turned eighteen, he had been studying the Great Wisdom Origin Sutra at the Autumn Leaf Temple where he grew up, and missed the foundation building. His spirit was twice as strong as ordinary people, and his mind was strong.
In addition, he was a high-energy physicist in his previous life, his understanding of the world was far beyond ordinary people.
The combination of the two allowed him to finally practice the Great Wisdom Origin Sutra and achieve the Great Round Mirror Wisdom.
With a strong mind, he could practice for much longer than ordinary people, and with his supernatural powers, he could observe in detail, so his progress in the Small Washing Pulse Manual was very fast, and he could build a foundation in five years.
"Hehe..., with your sword, you can't even kill a chicken, why are you still practicing?"
Chu Li suddenly sheathed his sword and snorted: "Want to compare?"
He was panting, his body soft, he leaned on the sword on the ground to support his body, the Breaking Delusion Sword Technique was too exhausting.
Chapter 1
In the quaint room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
This is the instinctive reaction of an excellent special forces soldier!
As soon as his hand fell, a sour pain like an electric shock came, followed by a wave of weakness.
Ling Tian opened his eyes.
A gentle female voice came from his ear.
Ling Tian saw a delicate face, looking at him with concern.
She was a classical beauty, breathtakingly beautiful, she could be described as a nation's beauty.
Ling Tian, a Chinese.
He had served in China's most outstanding Wolf Fang Special Operations Unit, and had made countless merits during his service.
He had participated in world-class special forces competitions, winning the individual honor of being the best in single combat, and was recognized as the 'King of Soldiers'!
Later, during a cross-national SSS-level mission, due to a small mistake on his part, a comrade was sacrificed.
Feeling guilty, he chose to retire and left the Wolf Fang.
After retiring, he remained silent for a while, chose to go abroad, and became the ace in one of the most famous mercenary organizations internationally.
As long as he took on a mission, the success rate was an unprecedented 100%!
Although he had retired from the Wolf Fang for many years, he still cared about China.
Any mission that was detrimental to China, he would not only refuse, but also find the person who issued the mission and carry out a brutal slaughter.
Over time, he became a thorn in the side of all countries except China.
In the eyes of other countries, he was a ticking time bomb.
However, as one assassin after another disappeared from the world, Ling Tian thrived more and more, and no more assassins dared to take on this 'death mission'.
Killing Ling Tian was tantamount to seeking death. This was a universally recognized statement in the world of mercenaries and assassins.
Looking at the world, he was rarely defeated, never once!
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted agent.
Country R had produced a colorless and odorless biochemical weapon, planning to transport it into China and carry out a horrific conspiracy.
Of course, Ling Tian would not stand by and watch.
He took action!
With the help of his agent, he found the location of the batch of biochemical weapons.
Just as he fought his way into the underground laboratory and was about to destroy the batch of biochemical weapons, the underground laboratory suddenly collapsed, trapping him in a completely enclosed cage.
When he saw people from Country R holding various firearms outside the cage, Ling Tian understood.
He was betrayed by the person he trusted the most!
Otherwise, with his shrewdness, the conspiracy of the people from Country R would not have succeeded.
Until he was shot to death, Ling Tian still couldn't figure it out.
"Tian'er, what's wrong with you, don't scare mom."
A gentle voice came, full of anxiety.
He was absolutely certain that he didn't know this woman.
But the woman's eyes now seemed to be looking at her closest relatives, without any hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
Just as Ling Tian was about to argue with this beauty.
Ling Tian was struck by lightning, completely stunned, as if he had been acupunctured.
The only thing that satisfied Ling Tian was that this guy was also called Ling Tian, full name 'Duan Ling Tian'.
Duan Ling Tian, fifteen years old.
An outsider of the Li family in Qingfeng Town.
His mother 'Li Rou', is the ninth elder of the Li family.
His father... in his memory, there was no father at all.
In the process of integrating this strange memory, Ling Tian also learned why Duan Ling Tian was lying in bed with serious injuries.
Early this morning, the youngest son of the seventh elder of the Li family, 'Li Xin', cursed Duan Ling Tian as a bastard born of a mother but not taught by a father.
However, how could he, who hadn't even completed his body tempering, be a match for Li Xin, who was at the second level of body tempering, and was directly seriously injured by Li Xin, barely alive.
After integrating all the strange memories, Ling Tian sighed in his heart.
He knew that from this moment on, he would integrate into this strange world as Duan Ling Tian.
From now on, he is Duan Ling Tian, and Duan Ling Tian is him.
"Madam, the master has sent someone to bring the medicine."
A voice came from his ear, and Duan Ling Tian looked up.
A maid hurried in from outside the room and handed the exquisite box in her hand to Li Rou.
The box was opened. Immediately, the scent of medicine spread.
"Tian'er, come, take the pill, mom will heal you."
Li Rou took out a black pill from inside and handed it to Duan Ling Tian's mouth.
Taking a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian opened his mouth and swallowed the pill.
The pill melted as soon as it entered his mouth, turning into a warm current that entered his body.
Then, Duan Ling Tian saw.
A cold current entered his body, dissolving the warm current formed by the pill, healing him.
An hour later, Li Rou stopped.
Duan Ling Tian found that most of the sour pain in his body had disappeared, and there was no burden at all.
Did he just take some kind of miraculous pill?
At this moment, Duan Ling Tian noticed that Li Rou's face was pale, and she was still sweating from her forehead, obviously having consumed a lot of energy to heal him.
"Mom, are you okay?"
Duan Ling Tian felt a warmth in his heart.
This 'mom' was called affectionately, without any unnaturalness.
"Mom is fine, just need to rest a bit."
Li Rou shook her head with a smile.
For her son, consuming this bit of energy was nothing.
"He and the seventh elder are still waiting in the punishment yard." Half an hour later, the maid walked into the room again and whispered.
"Let go? Go tell the person sent by the master that I will handle this matter myself."
The amiable expression on Li Rou's face was gone, and her face was cold.
"Mom, what kind of pill did you give me just now? I feel like my injuries are almost healed."
Duan Ling Tian got off the bed and stretched his body slightly.
"That was an 'Eighth Grade Golden Wound Pill'."
It turns out that this Eighth Grade Golden Wound Pill, even in the Li family of Qingfeng Town, there were only two, and now one was used on him, an outsider.
Obviously, his mother's status in the Li family was not low.
"Tian'er, the master is still waiting, let's go."
Li Rou took Duan Ling Tian to a spacious yard in the Li family mansion.
This place is where the Li family executes family law. The punishment yard!
It was noon, and the sun was scorching.
The area around the punishment yard was full of people, all Li family members who came to watch the excitement.
In the yard, a teenager was tied to a punishment post and exposed to the sun, with two middle-aged men standing beside him.
The middle-aged man with the cockeyed eyes on the right, seeing Duan Ling Tian and his mother, was furious.
"Duan Ling Tian is here... the effect of the family's treasured Eighth Grade Golden Wound Pill is really strong!" "Yeah, I saw Duan Ling Tian being carried back, he was half-dead."
"Li Xin too, usually it's fine to bully Duan Ling Tian a bit, the ninth elder won't say anything, but this time he actually used such a heavy hand, almost killing Duan Ling Tian, it would be strange if the ninth elder didn't get angry."
One by one, the Li family members saw Li Rou and Duan Ling Tian arrive, whispering.
Li Rou took Duan Ling Tian and saluted the middle-aged man on the left.
"Seventh Elder, my son Li Xin was wrong first in today's matter, but now that your son is fine, and my son has been exposed to the sun for a morning, can he be let down?"
At this moment, the middle-aged man with the cockeyed eyes, also known as the seventh elder of the Li family, 'Li Kun', had a gloomy face.
Who knew, Li Rou didn't pay any attention to him.
Instead, she took Duan Ling Tian to the bound Li Xin.
"Tian'er, how he hurt you this morning, now, you give it all back to him!" Chapter 1
When Gu Xijiu woke up, she found a very serious problem. She didn't recognize the surrounding environment at all!
Looking out through the gap in the corridor, there was a crescent moon hanging in the sky, with stars shining all over, and she was being carried forward while lying sideways.
She was a bit dazed, couldn't help but move, and then found an even more serious problem - she was naked! She was only wrapped in a thin silk quilt, which wrapped her tightly from head to toe, with only a pair of eyes exposed.
Her cold gaze first fell on the two strong men who were carrying her.
They were strong and muscular, dressed like ancient warriors. Although they were carrying people, they were silent. They were obviously martial artists with high skills.
Gu Xijiu's fingers tightened in the quilt!
She was the king of modern assassins, cold and ruthless, dominating the world, but she didn't expect to be conspired by the person she trusted the most. That person was called Long Xi, her former instructor and doctor. She didn't trust anyone, but she trusted him, even liked him, and wanted to marry him.
She was supposed to be dead, but instead of going to see the King of Hell, she inexplicably came here.
At this time, she naturally wouldn't think she was at a filming base.
She had traveled through time!
She traveled to this body, being carried like a dumpling to a rather luxurious hall.
"Ah... Ah... Help... Help... Ah, ah, don't..." The woman's delicate and painful scream instantly came out, recalling Gu Xijiu's drifting thoughts. Her gaze quickly swept around, slightly condensed! The furnishings in the hall were naturally beautiful, whether it was the rosewood tables and chairs, or the flower and bird tortoiseshell screen, all showed two words - luxury!
The man above was handsome, about twenty-seven or eight years old, his long hair was held up with a jade hairpin, casually draped over his shoulders, his muscles were smooth, his movements were strong and powerful, his lips were slightly pursed, with a hint of cold smile, he was a cool and handsome man.
Below was a young girl, who looked very young, with clear eyebrows and beautiful eyes. Unlike the man's enjoyable expression, the little girl's face was pale, her mouth slightly open, her throat was already hoarse, whimpering, cold sweat had soaked her hair, obviously in extreme pain. Gu Xijiu's face changed slightly!
This bastard, he's raping a young girl! Who the hell is he?
The two strong men carried Gu Xijiu in, but they didn't disturb the man's good mood, his movements became faster and more fierce!
The little girl finally couldn't bear it, she called out a few times in a low voice, her eyes rolled back, her head tilted, and she stopped moving.
"Boring!" The man cursed in a low voice, turned over, got off the girl, and kicked the girl off the bed like kicking garbage.
The girl didn't move, her small face had turned wax yellow, and there was a line of blood at the corner of her mouth. It was unknown whether she was dead or alive.
"This one is too useless, take her to the chaotic burial mound to feed the dogs!" The man's tone was full of frustrated desire.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagpole City, is a small town in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in the northern part of Arizona, on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, close to Las Vegas to the west, and the famous Grand Canyon to the east.
The United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon, and Las Vegas, these four names are familiar to many Chinese people, but Flagpole City, which is wrapped in the middle of these four areas, is probably not well known.
Half a year ago, Li Du was one of those 'few', until he came to Flagpole City to study.
Flagpole City is not famous in China, and it's not very famous in the United States either, but it does have a few good universities, such as the University of Arizona, Flagstaff American College, etc.
Li Du's school is called Flagstaff National College, which is only one word different from Flagstaff American College, but the difference between this one word is huge!
Flagstaff American College is a branch of American College, a very good private university, offering undergraduate, specialist, and preparatory education.
This is a diploma mill, Li Du was completely fooled into studying for a master's degree.
As a result, he had only paid half a year's tuition and research fees, and the school was closed down. The school board and admissions department had run away in advance, leaving a group of international students being driven away from the school by the police with bewildered faces.
Li Du was lucky because the school accommodation was too chaotic. He didn't live in the dormitory for the sake of studying quietly, but rented an apartment room. At least he has a place to live now. His classmates who paid for the dormitory are now wandering on the streets.
But his situation is not much better than his classmates. It's the end of January, and his rent is due. If he doesn't pay the rent in time, he might end up on the streets.
What's worse, he's out of money now!
Of course, he could borrow money from his parents and friends in China, but there's a prerequisite, that is, he's studying abroad. Now that the school has been banned, he definitely can't finish his master's degree, where does he have the face to ask his elderly parents for money? As for asking friends?
While sitting at the entrance of the small building with a worried face, the pine door behind Li Du was pushed open, and a blonde, blue-eyed girl poked her head out: "Hey, Li, are you here?"
This girl is his landlord, named Hannah-Fox, the house is the inheritance left by her parents who died in a car accident, belonging to her and her brother Hans-Fox.
However, Hans claimed to be 'busy with big business' and wouldn't live here for a few days a year. The empty bedroom was rented out by Hannah for income.
Hearing the greeting, Li Du stood up and said, "Oh, yes, Hannah, what's up?"
The girl shrugged and smiled, a dimple appeared on her beautiful face: "I just saw a few cans of beer when I was cleaning the fridge. It must have been left by Hans. I remember you like malt beer, why not drink it?"
She was holding half a dozen beers in her hand, a very common wooden box packaging, with a very obvious Budweiser LOGO on it.
Seeing these beers, Li Du also smiled. There was only a small refrigerator in the apartment, which he would open and close every day. Where would there be any beer in it?
Besides, with Hans's temperament, if there really was beer, he definitely wouldn't leave it. This guy was addicted to alcohol.
According to his guess, this beer was bought by Hannah to comfort him. After learning that their school was closed down, Hannah had comforted him several times, which touched him.
But Hannah's ways of comforting him were not many, either she would give him a motivational book, or she would give him beer.
This American girl once asked him about Chinese culture and learned the saying 'a drink solves a thousand worries'. She thought that according to the Chinese character, getting drunk and sleeping can alleviate worries, so she gave him beer to drink several times.
Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness, just as owing her a favor. In American social interactions, some gifts cannot be refused, otherwise, it would be misunderstood as refusing friendship, and he cherished his friendship with Hannah.
He took the wooden box, and Hannah left with a smile, saying before she left: "There are many problems in life, but it's still beautiful."
After repeating this American slang a few times, Li Du opened the package to take out a can of beer. But as soon as he opened the wooden box, a crystal that looked like amber suddenly fell out, 'crack' and fell to the ground.
This crystal was about the size of his thumb, and it fell heavily on the cement floor, causing several cracks to appear on it.
The reason he guessed it was amber was because it was light yellow in color and contained a small insect, similar to an amber he had seen when he was in the sixth grade of elementary school. At that time, their textbook had a text named "Amber", and the Chinese teacher brought an amber to class when teaching them.
This crystal reminded him of some good times in his childhood, he remembered the teacher saying that amber with insects inside was very precious. It's a pity that this one has already cracked, which made him regretful, otherwise selling it might be able to cover two months of living expenses.
The crystal was severely damaged, and after he picked it up, it had shattered, revealing the purple insect inside.
The insect looked similar to a locust, it was about two centimeters long, with a strange shape, compound eyes like a locust, but only two legs under its belly, strange patterns on its legs, no wings on its back, and it looked very clumsy.
Li Du had never seen this kind of insect, and he curiously picked it up to get a better look.
Just then, something strange happened: the insect's claws moved slightly, then quickly regained vitality, wriggling its body to break free from between his fingers.
Before he could react, the insect jumped into his palm, its head drooping down, and slowly, bit by bit, burrowed into his palm!
Li Du was scared to pee, really about to pee!
With a scream, he stumbled into the house, shouting, "Hannah, call 911! Help, there's a bug burrowing into my hand!"
His scream was probably too harsh, and when Hannah came out, she looked panicked: "What? What bug?"
Li Du opened his hand to show her: "This one, the bug in my palm!"
Hannah looked confused: "The bug in your palm? Where is the bug in your palm?"
Not only was there a bug, but it was also moving. After burrowing into Li Du's palm, it seemed unsatisfied and started to burrow out again, with half of its body coming out.
Li Du pointed at the bug that was burrowing out, and said in horror, "This one, this one, the purple locust, can't you see it?"
Li Du interrupted her, shouting, "I understand what you mean, you think I'm crazy! But I'm not, Hannah!"
"Shit, the bug is coming out again!"
As he was shouting hoarsely, the little bug slowly burrowed out of his skin and jumped to the ground, propped up its upper body with two legs, and started walking on the ground like a human.
Coincidentally, next to where it landed was a drain, the little bug didn't notice and walked over, falling headfirst into it.
Seeing this, Li Du was overjoyed, saying, "Great, the bug fell into the drain."
Subconsciously, a thought came to his mind, what was in the drain? Would there be sewage that would drown the bug?
But then, something unbelievable happened!
Chapter One
The land of Shen Zhou, the Northern Desert.
Ice and snow are ravaging the entire land, the vast mountains and thousands of gullies are all wrapped in silver, the snowflakes are falling down, and the sky and the earth are all one color as far as the eye can see.
On the winding mountain road, a caravan is resting. The snowstorm is too heavy, the carriage is difficult to move, and they have to wait for the snow to lessen before they can hit the road again.
"Look, a coffin puller!"
The exclamation of a middle-aged man attracted the attention of the caravan. A group of people curiously looked up towards the distance. After only a few glances, they were all shocked!
The snowstorm is howling, the world has become a blur, a mysterious golden ancient coffin is faintly visible in the distance, gradually appearing in everyone's sight.
The golden ancient coffin is two meters long, one meter wide and high, with ancient patterns and runes carved on the coffin wall. The patterns and runes emit a faint glow, completely blocking the falling snowflakes, which is extremely eerie.
What shocked everyone even more was the coffin puller in front of the ancient coffin.
He was a teenager, who looked only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was bare-chested, hunched over, his hands gripping two huge cold iron chains, carrying the chains on his shoulders, and pulling the ancient coffin forward with all his strength.
In the icy and snowy world, a teenager is pulling a coffin!
This scene is visually shocking and breathtaking. The faint light emitted by the golden ancient coffin behind him made the teenager's body somewhat blurred, and his face was unclear. In the trance, everyone seemed to see a god pulling a coffin.
"This young man has innate divine strength."
The middle-aged man exclaimed again, many people turned their attention back to the teenager, confirmed that there was no mysterious light shining on him, and were moved again.
A normal willow coffin weighs three to four hundred pounds, this ancient coffin is cast entirely in gold, needless to say, it weighs at least three thousand pounds.
The teenager has no mysterious power, so he is not a real warrior. Even a strong man only has five to six hundred pounds of strength. The teenager can pull a three-thousand-pound ancient coffin by himself. Although it seems a bit difficult, it is enough to shock people.
"He's so young, quite handsome, and he's pulling a coffin. Does this young man want to be unlucky for a lifetime?"
An old man sighed, and many people nodded in agreement. Although pulling a coffin is not common, it has occasionally happened in the history of the Northern Desert, and everyone knows a little about it.
The big families in the Northern Desert like to bury important elders in huge golden coffins after they die. These huge coffins are not buried in the ground, but placed on the top of ice mountains, which is said to bless the people of the clan.
When the family declines or encounters a major change, the family will hold a coffin-pulling ceremony, find a new ice mountain to move the ancestral coffin of the clan, change the feng shui, and rebuild the family's welfare.
This is where the coffin pullers come in.
Pulling a coffin is considered to be detrimental to one's luck. In the minds of many people in the Northern Desert, when pulling a coffin, one's own luck will be absorbed by the body in the coffin, and the body's essence and lifespan will also be absorbed, resulting in bad luck or illness for a lifetime.
So pulling a coffin is the most humble profession in the Northern Desert. Even if the commission is high, young warriors will not be tempted. Only desperate old warriors will pull coffins.
The teenager has a handsome face, is about 1.75 meters tall, has broad shoulders and a narrow waist, long legs, and muscular muscles. He wears an ancient beast tooth around his neck, which looks very wild. Judging by his appearance alone, he is quite good.
Fourteen or fifteen years old, handsome, with a terrifying divine power, the teenager's conditions are not bad. But he came to do this most humble and damaging job of pulling a coffin?
"Isn't he afraid of losing his luck, reducing his lifespan, and being unlucky for a lifetime?" The middle-aged man glanced at the golden ancient coffin a few times and said with relief: "This seems to be the ancestral coffin of the Liu family? That's right, I heard that the Liu family recently encountered a major change and offered a sky-high price."
"Silence, the people from the Liu family are coming." An old man suddenly said, and all the people in the caravan quickly shut up and looked into the distance.
Woo woo!
From a distance came the howling of beasts, a team of warriors in black armor, riding silver giant wolves, came rushing, and the fierce aura of the giant wolves hit their faces before they even approached.
"Silver Wolf Guard, it really is a warrior from the Liu family."
Everyone nodded secretly, within a thousand miles around Wuling City, only one army rode silver wolves, that was the strongest Silver Wolf Guard of the Liu family.
The Silver Wolf Guard stopped after catching up with the teenager. The middle-aged giant man in the front held a long whip and shouted coldly at the teenager: "Lu Li, hurry up! If you don't pull to Black Eagle Ridge before dark, you will not have any reward."
The teenager called Lu Li looked up, surrounded by a dozen giant silver wolves that were one meter high and two meters long, he didn't show much fear, and nodded: "Don't worry, sir, I will definitely arrive before dark."
The giant man shouted, led the Silver Wolf Guard to gallop away, and soon disappeared into the vast mountains in the distance.
Lu Li glanced at the nearby caravan and continued to pull the coffin in silence. He grabbed the cold iron chain with both hands, carried it on his shoulders and struggled forward. Every step was extremely difficult, and his muscles were trembling. Despite this, his steps did not stop at all, and he quickly passed the caravan and walked into the distance.
"It's so heavy!"
After walking a few miles and climbing a steep slope, Lu Li stopped. He was panting with exhaustion, sweating profusely in such cold weather, which shows how much physical exertion he had.
He thought about taking a break, after placing the ancient coffin, he sat on a rock, took out clear water and dried meat from the sack on his back, and chewed and swallowed to replenish his strength.
He should be able to get there before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat and looking at the sky, his eyes quickly brightened, and he muttered to himself: "Pulling a coffin can exchange for a pill, I wonder if the body tempering pill of the Liu family is really as legendary, one can increase five hundred pounds of strength?"
"If it really can increase five hundred pounds of strength, I now have three thousand pounds of strength, I only need to pull more than a dozen coffins to reach ten thousand pounds of strength, then I can... awaken my bloodline!"
"Who in the tribe dares to bully my sister then? Hehe, I will soon be able to live a good life with my sister."
Thinking of this, Lu Li's tired face was radiant, he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward, this time his steps were more steady and fast.
Shasha!
After walking a few miles, a sound came from behind, Lu Li looked back, his face was a little sad.
Behind him was also a coffin puller, but it was an old man. The old man's hand holding the iron chain was shining with white light, and there was also a faint white light flowing on his feet.
Lu Li murmured enviously, the white light was the mysterious power that only warriors had. Warriors with mysterious power will have much greater strength. This old man used his mysterious power, so he was able to walk briskly and easily pull the ancient coffin.
The old man caught up with Lu Li, he looked at him, frowned and said: "Young man, why are you also pulling a coffin? This will damage your luck."
Lu Li smiled slightly and didn't say anything. The old man looked at him a few more times, didn't say anything more, and quickly pulled the coffin away.
"If I can't awaken my bloodline again, what future can I talk about? Only a lifetime of mediocrity, being bullied every day, and causing my sister to suffer with me."
"No, this is not the life I want!"
Thinking of this, Lu Li's face became somewhat distorted, he roared, gritted his teeth and quickly pulled the coffin forward.
The snowstorm is getting bigger and bigger, the sky is gradually darkening, the golden ancient coffin in the vast mountain road emits a faint light, which is extremely mysterious and strange.
Chapter 001
"Brother is going to find a job, you stay at home and do your homework well, here is ten dollars, don't forget to go out and buy something to eat at noon."
In front of a low hut in the slums, Lu Li patted the little girl's head affectionately, rubbing it again and again. It was so good to see his sister so healthy and lively!
"Brother, I know," the little girl complained with a pout, "Don't mess up my hair, you've messed it all up."
His sister, Lu Xin, was very considerate, helping Lu Li tidy up his clothes, and advising him like a little adult, "You must work hard. Brother is so capable of enduring hardship, I believe you will definitely find a job this time."
"Don't worry, brother will definitely find a good job, earn a lot of money, and let Xin Xin live a good life," Lu Li hugged his sister, silently adding in his heart, he would not watch her slowly lose her life because of lack of money.
"When Xin Xin grows up, she will also earn a lot of money," the little girl twisted in Lu Li's arms, waving her little fist with a solemn vow.
No matter how reluctant, Lu Li still had to say goodbye to his sister.
After getting on the bus, his hand in his pocket paused for a moment, and he couldn't help but smile bitterly.
The money he had given his sister for lunch had returned to his own pocket. He should have expected that the little girl would do this. It was so heartbreaking to see her being so obedient.
Now it's the 23rd century, technology is infinitely advanced, and various intelligent technologies fill every corner of the world. This development has brought about a rapid progress in people's lives, but at the same time, it has also reduced the demand for human labor to the lowest.
Unemployment is no longer a rare thing, especially for people like Lu Li at the bottom of society, finding a stable job is a luxury.
If nothing unexpected happens, he will continue to be unemployed.
It wasn't until he joined a game guild's gold farming team by chance that he finally settled down. However, because he entered the game called "Dawn" nearly a year after it was released, he was too far behind in level and was never able to become a top player.
Two years later, his sister Lu Xin was found to have a serious illness during a school physical examination.
Without money to pay for the treatment costs of up to a million, and being hunted down by several guilds in the game during that time, he could only watch his only relative weaken day by day in pain.
The feeling was even more uncomfortable than cutting flesh with a knife. Lu Li held his sister and cried out in pain more than once.
However, fate took a turn. The day he received the critical illness notice, Lu Li cried for a while and then fell asleep in front of his sister's hospital bed. When he woke up, he found that he had been reborn, reborn three years ago.
While he was happy that his sister was still healthy, he knew he had to make money, a lot of money.
With money, he could cure his sister's illness as soon as possible, and only with money could he let his sister live the happy life that countless girls her age should live.
With money, he could hold his head high and never be inferior to anyone at any time!
After calculating, Lu Li found helplessly that even if he was reborn, it was not easy to become rich.
What he could do seemed to be only playing games - the "Dawn" that he had played for more than two years - and there were only a few days left before the game was released.
Lu Li had given up the idea of finding a regular job. He went directly to the headquarters of the Star Moon Guild, where he had served in his previous life.
The Star Moon Guild is not one of the top ten in the game, nor is it one of the top four in China. It is just a game alliance formed by a group of college students. The leaders of the guild are all rich second-generation kids. Because they are willing to spend money, the guild has developed quite well.
The Qinghu residential area located next to the University City is considered the most beautiful place in this generation. It is surrounded by mountains and rivers, with cherry blossoms everywhere. The office building is in the front, and the villa area is in the back. Only very wealthy people can establish companies here.
The receptionist looked at Lu Li's clothes with a bit of disgust, dialed a string of numbers, and then informed Lu Li that he could go in for an interview.
"We are currently only recruiting suicide squads, no more gold farmers," said the girl in charge of recruitment. She was very trendy, painting her nails while conducting the interview without even looking up.
The so-called suicide squad is actually cannon fodder, and it's quite normal to die a dozen times a day.
The reason why Lu Li wanted to join a studio was to use the studio's game helmet for free. Although gold farmers have no future, at least they can level up. Cannon fodder, which is destined to have a hard time leveling up, is not what he wants. Death in the game will result in loss of experience.
"What, 20 gold!" The nail polish was smeared on her face, and the girl screamed like a stepped-on cat.
Although "Dawn" represents the most advanced virtual technology today and has the world's top design team, it is not confident enough to go on the market without internal testing. However, the content of the test is relatively small, and it is a dispersed test, which will not affect the normal game.
The short few days of testing left the deepest impression on the players, that is, gold is hard to earn, and there are too many places to spend money.
Normal game players basically can't make ends meet in the early stage, and experienced gold farmers can't save a few silver coins a day.
Some senior professional players estimate that to save up 20 gold to establish a guild, a 100-person gold farming team needs to grind suitable monsters, deducting the cost of repairing equipment and potions, it would take at least a week or even longer. This is still the case when the money drop rate was high before the game's third system update.
And this kid in front of her, he actually promised to come up with 20 gold within a week!
20 gold, that's 200,000 copper coins.
"Did you participate in the internal test? Did you find a bug to make money?" The recruiting beauty had a thought and asked suspiciously.
Lu Li just smiled and didn't say a word, looking very mysterious.
"Ao Jian, I have something here, can you come over... Yes, someone is applying for a gold farmer, saying that he can hand in twenty gold within a week, I suspect he has a money-making BUG," the recruiting beauty had no choice but to quietly call the higher-ups.
Soon, there was a rush of footsteps. Turning his head to look, Lu Li was also a bit surprised.
The people who came were not only the boss of Star Moon, Ao Jian, but also several others. Lu Li had been in the Star Moon Guild for two years in his previous life, and he knew most of these people, all of them were high-level members of the guild.
"Oh, don't tell me, the one who can get twenty gold in a week is this kid," the short man next to Ao Jian couldn't help but wail. This person's game name was Half a Cigarette, the leader of the Star Moon Guild's thief group, and he was a very irritable person.
"Do you have a way to get twenty gold coins within a week, are you sure it's the game 'Dawn'?" Ao Jian's face was not very good either. He was originally holding a glimmer of hope, but seeing Lu Li's appearance, this glimmer of hope was gone.
Lu Li looked ordinary, his face was waxen and dark, and his clothes were wrinkled. The corners were clearly worn and frayed. At a glance, he knew he was the kind of person who had been struggling at the bottom of society.
"There's no proof in words, even if you can't get it, you won't lose much, will you?" Facing the powerful and surrounded social elites, Lu Li didn't have the constraint of a low-level person, but just smiled faintly. His calm eyes seemed to be full of endless confidence.
Chapter One
"Ye Mo, Ye Mo, are you okay? Get up quickly, class is about to start. This class is taught by Wuqing Bing, hurry up and get up." A somewhat anxious voice rang in Ye Mo's ear, giving him a strange feeling.
"This idiot, probably too embarrassed to show his face, covering it up." Another voice rang in his ear, but this time Ye Mo woke up.
Ye Mo looked around in confusion, not recognizing anyone, all were unfamiliar faces.
Seeing Ye Mo's bewildered look, another round of hearty laughter came, clearly the laughter here was directed at him. Seeing the people around him laughing as if mocking him, he didn't dare to ask aloud for a moment, he could only be on guard, preventing anyone from making a move on him.
He looked at the classmate sitting next to him, who seemed to be the only one not mocking him, and who had kindly nudged him awake earlier.
"Why does it look like a school?" Ye Mo asked subconsciously, somewhat surprised.
"Haha..." Another round of hearty laughter came.
"Ye Mo, I think you're confused. Can Yan Yan be casually written love letters? You were fine in the Ye family, but now you're no longer a member of the Ye family, be careful in the future."
The classmate sitting next to him sighed, naturally not believing that Ye Mo could forget so quickly, it was just a matter of face. He hadn't come to terms with reality, he was no longer the Ye Mo of the Ye family.
Ye Mo's head throbbed with pain, he remembered himself and his master Luo Ying refining Huiyuan Dan, then the group of mixed hairs from Xiliumen came over, then there were explosions and various fighting sounds, he remembered his master holding him and using a talisman, but how did he end up here? Is this still the Luo Yue continent?
Right, he was sitting here now, where was his master? His master was only three years older than him, and the reason why Xiliumen suddenly attacked them was because his master was too beautiful. The young master of Xiliumen wanted to marry his beautiful master, and this happened after she refused.
If his master fell into the hands of Xiliumen, the consequences would be unimaginable. Thinking of this, Ye Mo could no longer suppress the panic in his heart and suddenly stood up.
"What's the matter, don't you know the class bell has rung?" A cold-faced young woman carrying a few books walked onto the podium, coldly scanning the laughing students below, and the laughter immediately subsided.
Everyone knew that this was the English lecturer Yun Bing, who hated students making a fuss the most, and once she targeted someone, there would definitely be no good end. Ye Mo already felt something was wrong, although he could understand these words, the language was clearly not what he used to use, could it be that this was no longer the Luo Yue continent? Frowning, Ye Mo wanted to know more clearly, waves of headaches came, a lot of messy information was remembered.
And Ye Mo was completely kicked out of the Ye family after his father's death, the specific reason being that Ye Mo was not Ye Wentian's seed. More precisely, after Ye Mo's father died, Ye Mo's bloodline was re-identified, and he was determined not to be of the Ye family, which led to him being kicked out of the Ye family.
However, he still has a sister, Ye Ling, and a younger brother, Ye Zifeng. They are not from the same mother, but half-siblings from the same father. Three years ago, it seemed that his father knew he owed Ye Mo, and specifically proposed to the old man of the Ye family to marry the Ning family. Ye Tianwen probably knew that his body was not good, so he wanted to find a backer for Ye Mo, so he found the Ning family in the capital.
As for being able to marry one of the top five families in China, the Ning family was of course extremely willing. They promised Ning's granddaughter, Ning Qingxue, to Ye Mo.
During a hospital check-up, Ye Mo was found to be impotent, in other words, he was not humane. Although the Ye family wanted to hide the truth, it seemed that everyone in the capital knew overnight that one of the top five families in China, the Ye family, had an impotent person, and the Ye family had lost a big face.
"Ah..." When the memory was turned to this point, Ye Mo screamed, stood up, and almost immediately wanted to take off his pants to check. He was beginning to understand that he might have been reborn into another person named Ye Mo, but he was actually impotent, which was worse than killing him.
"What's your name, student, what are you shouting during class, come to my office after class." The beautiful teacher who was lecturing was interrupted by Ye Mo's scream, and her face didn't look good.
The rest of the students in the class were secretly amused, it was not often that a college student was sent to the office, probably only this English teacher could do it, and they had to go, the credits were in her hands.
Ye Mo sat down in despair, although he didn't understand much about the ins and outs of the family struggle, he had some understanding that he was probably kicked out of the Ye family because of his impotence, not necessarily because he was not a Ye family member, and who knew about the DNA test.
What Ye Mo was worried about was not his being kicked out of the Ye family, he wouldn't care about that, what he cared about was his impotence. And how his master Luo Ying was doing.
But he also understood why the classmates were laughing, because his predecessor had been kicked out of the Ye family, but he stubbornly pursued the hottest girl in the class, Yan Yan. As a result, she posted his love letter on the blackboard, then stood on the podium and looked at him contemptuously and said, "Young Master Ye, can you sleep with me?"
After the impotence was revealed, he was ashamed and wanted to save face, so he wanted to find a girlfriend, but he didn't expect that the girls who used to curry favor with him would treat him like this. In his embarrassment, he fainted, which was a boon for his rebirth.
He was actually reborn in such a place. He didn't understand a word of the beautiful teacher's lecture on the podium, even if he did understand, Ye Mo wouldn't listen, he absolutely couldn't accept that he was impotent now. It would be better not to be reborn than to be reborn like this.
Whether or not to attend this university is a matter of indifference, the main thing is to figure out his current situation. His impotence is related to the reputation of the Ye family, although he was kicked out of the Ye family, but who knows if he will suddenly be killed? Maybe there are other inside stories that led to being kicked out of the Ye family, is his safety still guaranteed now?
After the class bell rang, the first thing Ye Mo did was not to go to the beautiful teacher, but to rush out of the school in a hurry, he needed to find a place to check his little **, to see if he was really impotent.
Fortunately, there are not many other things next to Ninghai University, but there are many small alleys, Ye Mo hurriedly ran into a secluded and uninhabited small alley, and quickly pulled down his pants.
Little ** was indeed very small, but Ye Mo was not disappointed because little ** was small, but he was really relieved. He was not impotent, but because little ** was too big, it was blocked by a meridian, causing this false impotence.
But even so, with the current technology on Earth, it is undoubtedly a dream to open up his blocked meridian, but this is not difficult for Ye Mo, although he does not have the ability to open the blocked meridian now, to make his little ** strong, but as long as he reaches the third level of Qi training, this meridian will automatically be opened.
However, Ye Mo immediately began to feel a little disappointed again, because in the case of such thin heaven and earth aura on Earth, it is undoubtedly a difficult task to cultivate to the third level of Qi training, perhaps he can never reach it in his lifetime, in that case, he is still equivalent to impotence. Sighing, Ye Mo was about to pull up his pants, when a sudden scream startled him.
"Such a hooligan..." A high-pitched female voice rang out right in front of Ye Mo. Ye Mo was so focused on checking his own little ** that he forgot to check his surroundings. He didn't expect that this small alley was actually connected, it was just that he couldn't see it from the turn ahead.
Ye Mo is not an exhibitionist, and he doesn't have anything to expose right now, so he quickly pulled up his pants and tried to slip away.
"Ye Mo, is that you?" After the woman screamed, she surprisingly asked in a surprised tone. It was clear that she recognized Ye Mo.
Chapter 1
In the quiet of the night, in the Qingzhu high-end residential area of Jinhai City.
Shi Feng sat quietly on the soft leather sofa, holding a stack of documents in his hand, looking at the swimming pool outside the floor-to-ceiling window, filled with loss and unwillingness.
He was the leader of one of the four major game studios in Jinhai City, the Shadow, leading a large guild of tens of thousands of people, and was also a well-known master magician of the sword in Jinhai City, but now he could only sit at home and drink to drown his sorrows.
A decade of gaming career.
A decade of bloody battles.
After experiencing countless pains and hardships, he finally led the Shadow Guild to establish ten city-states in the "Divine Realm", and could start competing with the first-class guilds, enjoying endless glory. However, a single document turned everything into a fleeting cloud, gone and never to return.
Shi Feng never thought that his ten years of hard work would be in vain. For the game, he gave up so much, but in the end, it became someone else's dowry, all because he opposed the Shadow's merger into the super guild Dominating the World. The next day, the Lan Hua Financial Group gave him a reply, deleting his Sword King account that he had spent ten years training, and told him to go to the finance department to settle his salary.
All he could get was five million credit points and a mansion, which was nothing compared to the ten city-states he had established and the virtual kingdom that was making a fortune every day.
Shi Feng thought about how much he had given for the Shadow, and how he had made the Lan Hua Group become a large financial group, much of the credit was his, but in the end, he was discarded like trash. He would definitely take revenge for what the Lan Hua Financial Group had done.
"I won't let it go like this, I'll start all over again if I have to."
Shi Feng's eyes sparkled with confidence and determination, the termination document in his hand was torn to shreds, and he immediately picked up a bottle of red wine on the table and gulped down a few mouthfuls.
Even without the Sword King account, without the support of the team, the skills and knowledge in the game would not betray him. As long as the skills are still there, he can rise again in the Divine Realm and establish another virtual kingdom of his own.
In the early morning, the sun had just risen.
Ding ding ding!
The phone kept ringing.
Shi Feng was annoyed to be woken up, reluctantly got up and picked up the phone by the bed, still feeling dizzy from last night's hangover.
"Hello, what's up?"
"Brother Feng, it's Heizi, what do you mean what's up? We agreed to become professional players, today is the day the Shadow Studio is recruiting at school, haven't you always wanted to become a core member of the Shadow?"
Shi Feng was a bit confused.
He had just been fired by the Lan Hua Financial Group, how could he go to the Shadow assessment. "Brother Feng, Brother Feng?
Are you listening? They're going to test at ten o'clock, if you don't hurry over, it'll be too late!"
"Heizi, stop joking, I've just been fired by the Shadow."
"Brother Feng, how much did you drink last night? You're still not awake, the Shadow hasn't recruited anyone yet, how could you be fired? Come on, hurry up."
Before Shi Feng could react, Heizi had hung up the phone.
Shi Feng, with a heavy head, looked at his phone and found that this old iPhone 6 was not his phone at all, his phone was the latest iPhone 12.
He then looked around. The small bedroom of less than fifteen square meters was a mess, with books about game strategies everywhere, and the old model laptop on the desk in the corner, and clothes scattered in the wardrobe by the wall, and a familiar face appeared in the mirror of the wardrobe.
Shi Feng was startled when he saw this all too familiar face.
Shi Feng immediately got up and walked to the mirror, looking and looking again, before confirming that he had indeed become younger.
Yesterday he was sleeping in a spacious and luxurious bedroom, but now he woke up in this shabby place, and he had become younger.
Shi Feng still had some memories of this place. It was ten years ago, when he was a senior in college and determined to conquer the Divine Realm, he gritted his teeth and rented this small house, lived in it for more than half a year, and then after earning some money in the Divine Realm, he rented a large apartment in the city.
Back then, it was extremely hard, his family was not in good condition, and they had a lot of debt in order for him to go to college, yet his parents still worked hard to send him enough living expenses every month, so he could suffer less.
Shi Feng was determined to earn money to change his family's situation, but there were college students everywhere, and finding a decent paying job was harder than climbing to the sky, so he thought of the most profitable virtual game, and in order to improve his gaming skills, he bought a virtual helmet with the goal of becoming a professional player, and practiced his skills in the virtual game.
At that time, he ate white bread and instant noodles every day, and in order to save money, he never participated in any class gatherings or social events, so he became invisible in the class, despised by the boys and avoided by the girls. Every time he went to the supermarket to buy instant noodles, he had less than ten credit points in his wallet, and he didn't dare to buy a one credit point sausage. The female cashier saw Shi Feng's pitiful state and recommended a special price sausage. Shi Feng looked at the tempting sausage and touched his wallet, but still gritted his teeth and refused.
"Could it be someone playing a joke on me?"
Shi Feng looked at the familiar scene and his young self in the mirror, shook his head, and denied this idea.
Even the most developed America doesn't have this kind of rejuvenation technology, who would play a joke on a down-and-out uncle.
Shi Feng looked at the time on his phone again.
April 19, 2129.
"Could it be that I've been reborn?" Shi Feng showed a bitter smile on his face and joked.
He remembered that today was August 5, 2139, it couldn't possibly be April of 2129 when he was still a senior in college.
Shi Feng shook his head, trying to clear his mind, but still held a glimmer of hope in his heart, hoping that he could be reborn, really go back to ten years ago, so he walked to the computer desk and turned on the laptop.
If the time on the phone can be faked, then the news on the internet can't be faked, right?
After a few minutes on the internet.
Shi Feng was completely shocked, all the information he searched on the internet showed that today was indeed April 19, 2129, even the official opening time of the globally popular Divine Realm was clearly written on the official website, the countdown was six days later on April 25.
"Did I really go back to ten years ago?" Shi Feng stared hard at the news report of the Divine Realm, tears of excitement streaming down his cheeks.
Shi Feng's feelings at this moment were indescribable, there was regret, sorrow, and joy.
It seemed as if everything in front of him was a dream.
But the chirping of cicadas outside the window and the cold air from the air conditioner reminded Shi Feng that all of this was real.
Looking at the family photo in his phone from his college days, Shi Feng had never noticed that his father had white hair and his mother had wrinkles at the corners of her eyes, they were really old, not as energetic as before.
When he noticed that his parents were old, it was a year and a half after the opening of the Divine Realm, the high debt, the heavy labor and pressure, all made his parents seriously ill, and they never recovered. To cure them and restore their health would cost several million credit points, but at that time, Shi Feng was just a small team leader in the Shadow, and the money he earned was not enough to pay for such expensive expenses.
In order to raise money, Shi Feng tried everything he could, but it was still not enough, even though Shi Feng tried his best to maintain it, a few months later his parents still passed away.
In his previous life, he didn't take good care of his parents, who knew his pain and regret?
Even though Shi Feng later earned millions of credit points, this became a permanent pain in Shi Feng's heart.
He didn't expect fate to play such a joke on him, he really started from scratch, everything returned to the beginning.
"Good, very good, haha. Since I've been reborn, I'm going to change everything, earn enough money, cure my parents' illness, and not let them work hard for life." Shi Feng wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes and made a silent vow.
Just as Shi Feng was planning his future, Heizi's phone call came again, constantly urging Shi Feng to go to the university for assessment.
However, Shi Feng was not in a hurry. He dressed up and tidied himself before heading to Jinhai University.
He was very familiar with Youying.
He remembered that when he was in university, Lan Hailong, the eldest son of the Lanhua Group, opened the Youying Studio and provided a large amount of funds to organize the top students in Jinhai University to fight in the God's Domain. At that time, he also went for the assessment and became a core member. Heizi became a peripheral member. He was happy for a long time.
Three years later, under his leadership, Youying Studio made a fortune for Lanhua Group in the God's Domain, becoming a wealthy group. Unexpectedly, he was finally fired by Lan Hailong himself.
Since he was reborn, he still has advantages in the God's Domain that others can't match. Naturally, he doesn't plan to join Youying again, become someone else's tool, and make money for others. He wants to take a different path, fight for his own life, no longer let his parents send living expenses, pay off all debts, so he wants to start a business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and live a good life.
When Shi Feng arrived in front of the No. 1 teaching building, he saw a tall and thin young man with dark skin, walking back and forth anxiously at the entrance. This person was Heizi.
"Brother Feng, you finally came. Fortunately, the registration is not over yet. Let's go in and register quickly." Heizi said anxiously when he saw Shi Feng.
Shi Feng shook his head and said very seriously: "Heizi, I don't plan to go to Youying anymore. I want to open my own studio. Will you come?"
Heizi met in a virtual game, his skills are very good, and then they went to the world together, they can be said to be brothers. During the days of working together in Youying, although Heizi did not have game talent, his management was very strong. He managed hundreds of thousands of guild members in an orderly manner. If Heizi could help, the goal would be further achieved. However, he would respect Heizi's choice. After all, he has nothing now, and Heizi's family conditions are not good. He decided to become a professional player and join Youying to earn living expenses for his life.
It took a full minute for Heizi to look up at Shi Feng.
"Brother Feng, don't talk nonsense. Do you know how much a virtual helmet costs? That's eight thousand credit points. To open a studio, you need at least six people, plus a workspace, and you have to pay salaries and so on. The start-up capital alone will cost seventy to eighty thousand, plus subsequent investment, which is not a small amount of money. But do you have that much money now?" Heizi knows Shi Feng's situation very well and wants to persuade Shi Feng to give up this crazy idea.
"You're right, I don't even have the money to buy a God's Domain virtual helmet now." Shi Feng silently nodded in agreement. As Heizi said, even seventy to eighty thousand is less. He remembered that Lan Feilong's recruitment of a hundred-person studio cost more than five million, and later spent a lot to improve the quality and strength of the studio.
"In that case, why should we take risks? Isn't it more stable to go to Youying? At least Youying can provide virtual helmets. Otherwise, we can't even play, let alone become professional players." Heizi saw that Shi Feng understood the key to the problem, and immediately breathed a sigh of relief, and wanted to take Shi Feng into the teaching building.
Shi Feng shook off Heizi's hand, looked at Heizi seriously, and said with a very serious expression: "But I still plan to open my own studio, I don't want to be controlled by others, Heizi, will you come?"
Shi Feng will not force Heizi, after all, he has no guarantee, and it is impossible to reveal the secret that he is a reborn person, he just hopes that Heizi can believe him.
Heizi saw Shi Feng's serious expression, always feeling that Shi Feng today is very strange, too crazy, everyone knows that the early stage of the virtual game can not make money, does Shi Feng have any way to make money in the God's Domain? Even if you make money, it will be a few months later, they don't have so much time to waste.
Heizi hesitated for a long time, gritted his teeth, and finally agreed: "I know, who makes you the big brother, I will open the studio with you, but what about the virtual helmet, without the helmet we can't play the game?"
Shi Feng's frowning brows suddenly relaxed, and he happily patted Heizi's shoulder and laughed: "That's my good brother. Don't worry about the virtual helmet. I remember that God's Domain has a college student trial discount. There are distribution points in every university. As long as you have a student ID, you can get a free trial of the virtual helmet for ten days. Let's go and see."
Heizi's dark face turned pale at this time, feeling that the future was dark. Why did he believe in Shi Feng? Is it Shi Feng's confidence and stability? Is it really okay to start a business with Shi Feng?
What can you do in God's Domain in ten days?
After ten days, you will definitely miss the good time for major studios to recruit people. In the end, you still have to buy a virtual helmet, but where does the money come from?
It's impossible to earn 16,000 credit points in the ten days when God's Domain opens, even if you have a group of professional players!
"Leave the money issue to me."
Shi Feng patted Heizi's shoulder and showed a confident smile.
It's a pipe dream to earn 16,000 credit points in ten days, but he has the courage of a reborn person. No matter what difficulties he faces, he will break them one by one. And the opening of God's Domain is the beginning of his rise.
Then Shi Feng took Heizi to get the trial helmet, and spent all the money on instant noodles, put them next to the computer desk in the rental room, two large boxes, enough for more than ten days of meals, and then explained some things about God's Domain, and quietly waited for the opening of God's Domain.
At 9 o'clock on the evening of April 25, a few faint lights flickered in the dark and quiet cabin.
Shi Feng lay quietly on the bed, closed his eyes, and gently pressed the start button of the helmet.
"God's Domain, here I come."
I can't tell what kind of sound this is. When I hear it in my ears, it seems to penetrate my body and enter my soul, making people shiver in this cold snowy night.
The desolate north wind whimpers through this world, and the snow flutters with the wind, shattering the sky into pieces, layer by layer covering the earth. From a distance, it looks like a silver-clad landscape, desolate everywhere.
This is not the middle of the night, it's just dusk, but the dimness of the sky is the same as the night, giving people a heavy feeling, as if pressing on the heart, breathless. On that silver land, you can see a huge silhouette, that is a majestic city, like a mighty beast.
In the center of the city, there is a towering tower-shaped altar, in the shape of a heptagon, all black, piercing the cloud peak, standing tall in the storm, the wailing wind on the altar, mixed with such a crackling sound, spreading to the distance, with the original roughness, has a different charm.
The hoarse murmuring voice, in this snowstorm, floated from the altar, as if it merged with the wind, and it was a bit unclear.
"If there is hope, where is the hope, if there is no hope, why let me see!" The voice seemed mad, almost hysterical, roaring and circling in the sky.
Under the altar, there are countless figures wearing straw raincoats, standing silently there. From a distance, there are as many as hundreds of thousands. They are men and women, surrounding the altar, densely packed. In the stillness, fanaticism emerges, as if the person on the altar says a word, they can give everything for it.
The snow is getting bigger.
"Since you let me see, there must be hope, but where is the hope..." The hoarse voice on the altar was bitter, containing sadness, and it lingered for a long time.
"Today, Ming Huang is wrong to return, San Tai opens up the wasteland, the snow wind comes, ten thousand ages in one creation, the old man wants to calculate the barbaric sky again!" The voice suddenly became louder, and it was unknown what means were used, but the sky was seen changing its color, countless falling snowflakes all suddenly stopped, and then all rolled back, coming from all directions and converging together, causing the world to tremble!
There was no more snow falling in the sky, all the snowflakes converged to form a huge snow-colored mysterious dragon, as soon as this dragon formed, it immediately roared to the sky, the sound was piercing to the ear, making all who heard it, immediately shocked, as if to be torn apart by this sound.
Bursts of shocking blood, from the snow dragon's body oozed out, quickly spread all over its body, making this snow dragon become a blood dragon, its piercing roar, struggling body fiercely towards the sky, like a barbaric meteor straight into the sky, as if to blast a hole in the sky, opening a hope.
Its speed was so fast, in the blink of an eye it was endless, booming and whirling, as if this dragon hit an invisible barrier, the world shook, the humming sound spread in all directions, the blood dragon screamed again, its body visibly crumbling layer by layer.
Just as it was about to completely shatter, the hundreds of thousands of silent people under the altar, all clasped their hands, bit their tongues, and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, the blood seemed to be drawn by some force, rushing up, as if a sea of blood rose into the sky, heading straight for the crumbling blood dragon, merging with it, easing the dragon's crumbling momentum, and heading for a higher sky.
Seeing the blood dragon flying higher and higher, attracting everyone's attention, but at this moment, the blood dragon suddenly shook its whole body, after emitting a harsh hiss that spread tens of thousands of miles, it could no longer stop its body from crumbling, turning into countless blood-colored snowflakes, falling down, from a distance this world has been dyed a red underworld.
Even at this moment, the moment the blood dragon collapsed, a voice completely different from the scream came from its mouth! "Shang..."
At the top of the altar, in the center, sat an old man in a purple robe, the old man's face was full of wrinkles, and even more covered with brown spots, he opened his eyes in a murmur, but his eyes were dim and lightless, obviously a blind man.
In front of him was a complete spine, emitting a white light, his right hand holding a stone tablet, resting on the thirteenth vertebra.
His hollow eyes silently looked at the sky, for a long time, a long time, he sighed.
In his words, his right hand holding the stone tablet, moved again on the strange spine, rubbing the beast bone, making a crackling sound, spreading to the distance, his figure appeared desolate, blending with this sound, revealing a sense of sad loneliness and decline.
In the deep night, pitch black, the vast mountains are not calm, beasts appear, their roars shake the mountains and rivers, the trees tremble, the leaves rustle down.
Another beast roar, Lin Feng shrunk his neck, dusted off the leaves on his body, looked at the mountains in the dark, and sighed in his heart, this place is completely different from Earth.
Lin Feng sat under the tree in a daze, the few robust young men opposite all looked at him with disdain, a chubby boy even shouted at Lin Feng: "Keeping you, a foreigner, in the village is not for you to eat for nothing, hurry up and work!"
Lin Feng came back to his senses, didn't say anything, patted his butt and walked away.
Behind him, the chubby boy snorted: "Useless waste, physical strength is not even as good as a child, should throw him into the mountains to be eaten by beasts!"
Lin Feng sneered, I'm a man who crossed over from Earth, how can I compare physical strength with you beasts?
This world of Tianyuan is a world dominated by cultivators.
The Wolf Village in front of him is just a small village in the vast mountains, there are naturally no cultivators, but every villager practices martial arts, builds up strength, even women and children are no exception.
Only in this way can they survive in a world where beasts roam and even ancient species appear.
Just like now, although it is late at night, the young and strong in the village have to go hunting in the mountains, many prey are accustomed to being active at night, although it is dangerous to go into the mountains at night, the harvest will be greater.
The villagers are all used to this life, the children left in the village do not sleep, they gather together to compete and play, waiting for their parents to return from hunting.
Even the children with clear snot, carelessly play with dozens or hundreds of pounds of stone locks as toys, a group of teenagers in their teens are competing to see who can lift the giant cauldron at the entrance of the village that weighs a thousand pounds.
Lin Feng looked at these little beasts, sighed, and compared strength with them, he did indeed seem very useless.
But this won't make Lin Feng feel discouraged, although he is often discussed behind his back, he still managed to stay temporarily in this small mountain village called Wolf Village by bluffing. What really bothers him is that he has something extra in his mind.
Super Ancestor System.
At first, Lin Feng was happy, thinking that crossing over is a benefit, but the first item in the system description made him half cold.
"System main task: Host opens the mountain and establishes the sect, establishes the number one sect in this world, becomes the first ancestor."
"Main tasks are divided into different stages, each stage must be completed within a limited time, if not completed on time, directly erase the host!"
Lin Feng looked at the system description, especially the last sentence "erase the host", was speechless for a long time, and finally squeezed out a few words from his teeth: "I bought a watch last year!"
After the anger, Lin Feng helplessly read the task content, he is not prepared to take the risk to challenge the system, to see if it can really erase him, just came to this world, his butt is not yet warm, he does not want to die again.
Main task 1.0 - Recruit four direct disciples.
Task description: Even if it's a loose cultivator, if you want to pass on your mantle, you have to take disciples. The most important resource for a sect is always people, it's the talented disciples and successors, good teachers produce high students, good teachers are hard to find, high students are even harder to find.
Task time limit: one year, if not completed on time, directly erase the host.
"Damn it!" Lin Feng sighed, I'm just a newcomer who just crossed over, tender like a crisp little cabbage, I should be looking for a big bull to be my master, to hug a big thigh, right?
System brother, you should give me a secret book, so I can go and recruit disciples, I'm poor and white, what do you want me to teach people? Bluff and brag?
What's more pitiful is that the system description has a newbie gift pack, but it tells him that the gift pack system has a fault, the newbie gift pack is delayed, making Lin Feng sigh that there is no most pitiful, only more pitiful.
The opened exchange system, on the other hand, is full of good things, elixirs and treasures, techniques and powers, only what you can't think of, not what he doesn't have.
The problem is, all things need exchange points to exchange, and Lin Feng doesn't even have one exchange point now, he can only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was cursing in his heart, when there was a commotion at the entrance of the village, it seemed that the hunting team was back.
The waiting teenagers in the village all cheered and went to the entrance of the village, Lin Feng didn't care and glanced at it, but was surprised to find that all the young and strong who came back from hunting, all came back empty-handed, not only no prey, even their weapons were gone.
For these villagers, weapons are their second life, living in these mountains, without weapons they can't survive at all.
Lin Feng's mouth curled up in a subtle smile: "Seems like there's a story here." Thinking this, he also walked towards the crowd at the village entrance.
Before he got close, he heard someone roar angrily: "Lang Feng is our Wolf Village's hope, now he's been seriously injured by someone from Stone Village, we can't let this go!"
Lin Feng looked up and saw a young man sitting dejectedly in the middle of the crowd, covered in wounds, with a cold light of hatred in his eyes.
"So this is the genius that the people of Wolf Village always talk about?" Lin Feng observed surreptitiously. He had long heard of this Lang Feng, the idol of the young people in Wolf Village, seen as the hope of the village. Today was the first time Lin Feng had seen him in person.
Although Lang Feng was injured and looked dispirited, his vitality was abundant. His physical strength, although not comparable to cultivators, was definitely top-notch among worldly martial artists.
According to the public opinion of the Tianyuan Great World, having this level at such a young age, if he practiced Qi cultivation, he would also have a promising future. After all, cultivators are about guiding the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into the body, refining mana, and strengthening their own foundation.
Lin Feng calmly activated his Super Ancestor System, which had a disciple talent detector. He pointed it at Lang Feng and pressed confirm.
"The object's aptitude is too low to become a direct disciple of the host."
Lin Feng frowned, this system was too picky. He had originally thought about casually taking on four disciples to bluff his way past the system's one-year deadline, and then just expel these filler disciples in the end.
But now it seemed that exploiting the system's loopholes wasn't so easy. Even Lang Feng, a famous genius teenager in the surrounding villages, wasn't qualified. The difficulty for Lin Feng to gather four disciples to complete the system task was too great.
"One year, one year..." Lin Feng sighed in frustration.
In the crowd, an old man next to Lang Feng had a grim face and snorted: "Lang Feng is my grandson, of course we can't let this matter go, but not now. There's been a lot of movement in the mountains recently, it seems that a mountain treasure is about to appear. We'll get the mountain treasure first, then settle accounts with Stone Village!"
There were often fights between rural clans, Lin Feng had no interest in this. But the words "mountain treasure" caught his attention.
As Lin Feng was pondering about the mountain treasure, he suddenly heard someone in the crowd muttering: "I don't know how Stone Village raised such a little monster, not even four years old, a little kid, who can actually defeat our village's genius Lang Feng, it's unbelievable!"
Lin Feng's eyes suddenly lit up.
A child not even four years old defeated this Lang Feng in front of him?
Lang Feng already had some talent, but the person who injured him was not even four years old, what kind of talent would that be?
The chubby boy next to Lin Feng muttered: "Damn little ghost, we must kill him!"
Looking at him, Lin Feng echoed: "Yes, yes."
But in his heart, he was thinking that this little kid might be approved by the system. Thinking this, Lin Feng quietly left the crowd. He now wished he could immediately fly to Stone Village, but he didn't dare to leave the village alone, otherwise he would be directly serving himself as a meal to the beasts in the mountains.
Just then, a mechanical prompt suddenly sounded in Lin Feng's mind.
"Newbie gift pack released, do you want to check it now?"
Lin Feng was stunned for a moment, then overjoyed. He had never thought that the dry and dull system prompt could be so pleasing to the ear.
Finding a place where no one was around, Lin Feng opened the gift pack.
Newbie Gift Pack: The host obtains the basic cultivation level of Qi Refining Stage Four, one lottery chance, 300 exchange points, the Daoist secret manual "Nine Heavens Thunder Law", and the divine power Nine Heavens Thunder Attraction.
Lin Feng was stunned, a warm current fell from the top of his head, directly piercing his chest and abdomen, quickly opening a hidden acupoint in his body.
There are twelve important acupoints hidden in the human body, which cultivators call the Twelve Heavy Towers.
The cultivation of the Qi Refining Stage is divided into twelve levels, which is to open the Twelve Heavy Towers. Each time an acupoint is opened, spiritual energy is transformed into mana, and the cultivator's mana will go up a level.
Lin Feng now felt a warm current continuously winning battles, accompanying him all the way, until it disappeared after opening four acupoints in his body. With Lin Feng's breathing, the spiritual energy of the world outside was rapidly absorbed into his body, swirling in the opened acupoints.
Each acupoint was like a constantly rotating star cluster universe, with spiritual energy constantly being transformed into Lin Feng's own mana, just like the evolution of all living beings when the universe was first opened.
Lin Feng felt his whole body become lighter, and with a thought, the mana in the acupoints surged like a spring, and explosive power was ready to burst.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body, and comforted himself: "At least I have some self-protection now." But thinking about the system's ultimate goal of establishing the first sect in history, and that he had to become the first ancestor in history, Lin Feng immediately felt a great pressure and quickly checked the other items in the newbie gift pack.
"A lottery chance?" Lin Feng looked at it. In addition to the exchange system in the auxiliary cultivation system, there was also a lottery system, but it was gray and still in an inactive state, so he didn't need to think about it for now.
At present, he could only hope that the purchasing power of those 300 exchange points was high.
While thinking, Lin Feng entered the exchange system. He had been so poor before that he didn't have the heart to look at the prices.
After carefully looking at the prices, Lin Feng secretly cursed the system for being black-hearted. The lowest level bottle of Qi Nourishing Pill cost ten exchange points, and a slightly spiritual Iron Refining Sword cost thirty points.
Even if he wanted to get a basic outfit, a set of Feather Clothes and Star Crown, it would cost fifty points.
The most basic divine powers like "Fireball Technique" and "Palm Thunder" cost a hundred points.
As for those high-end goods with a string of zeros behind them, Lin Feng didn't dare to look at them for fear of getting dizzy.
Looking at the pitiful 300 in the "Current Exchange Points" column, Lin Feng shook his head: "The startup capital is too small."
Fortunately, the newbie gift pack had a Daoist secret manual and a divine power, otherwise Lin Feng would really be at a loss.
The Dao is the foundation of cultivation, mainly for improving the realm, while divine powers are practical martial arts or spells with many uses.
What was surprising was that the grade of the Nine Heavens Thunder Law in the gift pack was very high, and it couldn't even be exchanged in the current exchange system. It had to be upgraded before it could be exchanged.
As for system upgrades, they would only be unlocked after Lin Feng completed a certain number of system tasks, which was still a long way off.
The Nine Heavens Thunder Law is one of the top thunder Dao in this Tianyuan Great World, but it has been lost for many years. The predecessors who had successfully practiced this Dao in the past were all big shots who walked sideways.
According to the instructions, the newbie gift pack randomly opens a Dao. Being able to open the Nine Heavens Thunder Law, Lin Feng considered himself lucky. Although the purchasing power of the 300 exchange points was limited, Lin Feng's frustration was swept away.
With such a top-level Dao, if it weren't for that damn main task, Lin Feng would definitely find a place where no one was around to practice a set of divine skills before coming out to wreak havoc.
But now that he had to take disciples, that was another story.
Despite his dissatisfaction, Lin Feng quickly adjusted his mentality and took action quickly.
He quietly asked for the way to Stone Village, and quietly left Wolf Village without alarming anyone.
The two villages were now in a hostile state. Lin Feng, who had become a cultivator, was not afraid of the people of Wolf Village making trouble, but he was afraid that they would reveal his identity in front of the people of Stone Village.
Fortunately, the people of Wolf Village were all gathered at the village entrance, discussing the matter of Lang Feng being injured. Lin Feng left from the back of the village, and no one noticed his actions.
Walking on the road, Lin Feng did not hesitate and directly invested fifty exchange points to equip himself with a new outfit.
As a person from Earth, how could Lin Feng not understand the principle of "Buddha needs gold, people need clothes"? If you want to promote something, you must first do a good job in publicity and packaging.
Looking down at his feathered star crown and wide-sleeved white robe, Lin Feng nodded in satisfaction. The system's items were expensive, but their quality and appearance were beyond reproach.
When Lin Feng arrived at the entrance of Shicun, the first thing that caught his eye was a huge half-cut dead tree, with a trunk diameter of more than ten meters, all charred.
Lin Feng took a glance and guessed that it was a lightning-struck tree that had been struck by lightning many years ago. The huge crown and vitality of the old tree were destroyed, and now only a stump about eight or nine meters high remained on the ground.
But just looking at the size of the existing trunk, one can imagine how huge the tree was when it was alive.
The dead tree was charred all over, showing no signs of life.
At this time, an old man came over, coughing and saying, "This tree has been withered for ten years." He walked up to Lin Feng, his eyes scanning Lin Feng up and down, "I am the village head of Shicun, is there anything I can help you with, Taoist?"
Lin Feng smiled slightly, naturally exuding an out-of-the-world pride. Coupled with his outfit, wide-sleeved white robe, and feathered star crown, his appearance was impeccable, absolutely like a worldly expert.
"Target found, suitable to become the host's direct disciple."
Just as Lin Feng was about to speak, he heard the sudden system prompt and almost choked on his saliva.
The old village head of Shicun looked at Lin Feng strangely, but was startled.
Lin Feng's eyes were glowing green, staring at the village entrance like a hungry wolf.
At the entrance of the village, a cute and fair-skinned child was pulling the tail of a big yellow dog with all his might, his childish voice clear and loud, "Yiya yiya, don't run!"
The system in Lin Feng's mind kept ringing, "Talent system has been sorted out, the first target's information is as follows."
"Root Bone -> 10; Comprehension -> 8; Will -> 8; Luck -> 8."
"Summary: The target has extremely high talent, it is recommended to take him under your wing, teach him carefully, he will definitely be a pillar of the sect."
Lin Feng didn't see anything else, his eyes were fixed on the blood-red number "10" behind the root bone.
What does a root bone of 10 mean?
For example, when others run, they need to run a hundred meters from the starting point to the finish line. Under the same finish line, this little guy starts running from ninety meters!
No wonder, no wonder he could beat that wolf wind full of peach blossoms when he was less than four years old.
The little guy also noticed Lin Feng at this time, looking over with a puzzled face, blinking his big eyes, a full cute little boy.
Lin Feng smacked his lips, this guy not only has a strong root bone, but his comprehension, will, and luck are all at a super genius level.
Taking such a guy as a disciple, isn't the pressure a bit high?
Lin Feng pondered, gradually showing a warm and sunny smile on his face.
If someone who knew Lin Feng in his previous life saw him with such a smile, they would definitely stay as far away from him as possible.
Chapter 1
The morning sunlight, filtering through the light silver curtain, fell just right on the bed, making it hard for her to open her eyes.
She had drunk too much at the party last night, and it was Lu Yanchen who took her away.
As Time sat up, the thin silk quilt slipped off, revealing a touch of red on the white sheets, and her own body, her creamy skin covered in kiss marks.
One look was enough to know that this was the result of a night of revelry.
"I love you."
His moving words of love, when the feelings were intense, seemed to still linger in her ears. Time's face was flushed, her eyes shy, she looked around.
Where was Lu Yanchen?
Had he gone out to buy breakfast?
Time lifted the quilt and got out of bed, her legs felt weak when they touched the ground, and she almost fell.
When Time came out again, Lu Yanchen had also returned, walking slowly into the living room with an imposing and oppressive aura, his tall and straight figure.
Time looked up and fell into a pair of deep eyes, their gaze as calm as an unfathomable clear pool.
This was the first time they had such an intimate relationship, Time felt inexplicably shy, she lowered her eyes and dared not look at him.
In her confusion, she vaguely heard him say that he had a surprise for her.
Was he going to propose to her?
Time was a bit at a loss, her heart pounding.
She had just spoken when she was interrupted by Lu Yanchen's deep voice: "Let's break up!"
What did he just say, break up?
The surprise he wanted to give her was a breakup?
Was he teasing her, joking, or was he serious about breaking up?
A scream of extreme pain, stuck in her throat, unable to come out, it took a while for Time to find her voice,
Very softly, as if it was buried in the dust. "Break up, after we... Lu Yanchen, what do you mean?"
Lu Yanchen's cold expression did not change at all, "Who called me to pick her up last night, and who clung to me and wouldn't let me stop, you enjoyed it last night."
Time was stunned as if struck by lightning!
She was dumbfounded, looking at this man who was completely different from her memory, unable to control her trembling body, she asked with difficulty, "Why?"
After saying that, he turned to look out the window, a faint smile on his lips.
That smile, in Time's view, was like mockery.
Time's face was as pale as snow, the intense pain started from her heart, pressing on her nerves and spreading to her limbs, a dizzying darkness came over her, she pinched her palm with her fingertips to keep from fainting.
The air suddenly became cold and damp, freezing people to the bone, suffocating, making it impossible to stay for even a minute.
Time left.
Chapter 1
In the Ling family of Cangyun Town, Rain Country, the moon was high in the sky.
It took Ling Han a full ten seconds to finally confirm that he had indeed been reincarnated.
For a powerful being at the Heavenly Human Realm, needing ten seconds to confirm something was absolutely inconceivable, but it also proved how unimaginable the events happening to him were.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts and had unprecedented achievements in the field of alchemy. His creation of the "Three Fire Guidance" technique sparked a revolution in the alchemy world, earning him the title of "Pill Emperor".
But he was not satisfied, he wanted to go further, to reach the legendary Void Breaking Realm, to shatter the void and transform from mortal to god. To this end, he visited countless ancient sites, eventually entering the Black Blood Valley and, after facing numerous dangers, found a mysterious ancient tower.
To his delight, golden text appeared on the tower, a supreme technique called the "Undying Heavenly Scripture". When practiced to the highest level, the body would become indestructible and immortal, coexisting with the heavens and earth, and sharing the same lifespan as the sun and moon!
However, even with Ling Han's martial arts cultivation at the Heavenly Human Realm, he found the "Undying Heavenly Scripture" obscure and difficult to understand, as if he was reading a heavenly book, completely clueless.
He forcibly memorized this technique and was about to study the ancient tower when it trembled slightly, releasing a boundless divine light that instantly shattered his physical body. But strangely, his soul did not dissipate, but fell into a state of semi-consciousness, like a dream yet not a dream, which lasted for tens of thousands of years.
During these ten thousand years, his soul was constantly pondering the Undying Heavenly Scripture - apart from this, he couldn't do anything else. After ten thousand years, he finally understood the first layer of this technique.
A powerful being at the Heavenly Human Realm, it took him ten thousand years to understand the first realm of a technique, what does this mean?
You should know that a strong person at the Heavenly Human Realm generally has a lifespan of less than a thousand years. Normally, no one in the world can cultivate this Undying Heavenly Scripture, because they would have died of old age before they even started.
But Ling Han, in this strange way, mastered the first layer of the "Undying Heavenly Scripture". Then, he suddenly came back to life, reincarnated in the body of a sixteen-year-old boy also named Ling Han.
"No matter what, I'm alive again!"
"Although this body is only at the second level of body refining, and is so useless that it can't be more useless, I was once a strong person at the Heavenly Human Realm, standing at the pinnacle of martial arts, and a master of alchemy. If my aptitude is poor, I can supplement it with pills. I don't believe I can't return to the peak."
"Moreover, I can finally practice the Undying Heavenly Scripture. This is a supreme technique, and it may not even belong to the mortal world, but comes from the legendary divine realm. Otherwise, how could it take ten thousand years to understand the first realm of the technique?"
"In this life, I will surpass my predecessors and achieve godhood!"
"Also, what's the matter with this body? It only reached the second level of body refining at the age of sixteen. Is it because the martial arts of today are too decayed?"
Boom, countless memories flooded into his mind. These were the memories of another Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in this process, two completely different people merged into one, indistinguishable from each other.
"I understand now."
Ling Han nodded in his heart. The reason why he was only at the second level of body refining was because his spiritual root was too poor.
To cultivate into a martial artist, there is a prerequisite, which is to have a spiritual root. With a spiritual root, one can absorb the spiritual energy between heaven and earth, refine oneself, and transform it into one's own Yuan power.
Some spiritual roots absorb spiritual energy quickly, while others are slow. Therefore, spiritual roots are divided into four major levels: heaven, earth, mysterious, and yellow, each with three minor grades: upper, middle, and lower. The best is the upper grade of the heavenly level, and the worst is the lower grade of the yellow level.
The key to judging the quality of a spiritual root lies in its purity. The purer, the better. But Ling Han's spiritual root is a mixture of all five elements, the most chaotic. In the martial arts world, this is the lowest grade of spiritual root, barely qualifying as a lower grade of the yellow level. Therefore, at the age of sixteen, he had only cultivated to the second level of body refining, while his peers had reached the fourth or fifth level of body refining.
In his previous life, Ling Han had a heavenly spiritual root, and it was the upper grade of the heavenly level, the Nine Yang Fire Spiritual Root. Coupled with his unparalleled talent in alchemy, he reached the Heavenly Human Realm in just two hundred years with the aid of pills, a record that was unprecedented.
"Five Elements Mixed Spiritual Root, this is the lowest grade of spiritual root, no wonder the previous life, despite his utmost efforts, only had the cultivation of the second level of body refining." "For me, although the Five Elements Mixed Spiritual Root is a bit tricky, with the aid of pills, I will definitely return to the peak in at most four hundred years!"
"Eh!"
Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, his face showing an incredulous shocked expression. He was stunned for a while, and with his powerful soul power, he re-examined his spiritual root in his dantian. His shocked expression instantly turned into ecstasy.
"This is not a Five Elements Mixed Spiritual Root, the five elements are perfectly balanced, forming a Dao Lotus! This is the Five Elements Chaos Lotus, the best of the best, rarer than the Nine Yang Fire Spiritual Root, it can be called a divine level spiritual root!" "The previous life cultivated slowly because divine level spiritual roots need specific techniques to unleash their true power."
"And I... just happen to have mastered a Five Elements Extreme Technique that matches the Five Elements Chaos Lotus!"
"One hundred years! No, only fifty years are needed for me to reach the Heavenly Human Realm again!"
Even Ling Han, with his previous life's cultivation at the Heavenly Human Realm, couldn't help but show joy. Spiritual roots are determined at birth and cannot be changed later. In his previous life, in order to break through the void and become a god, he visited countless ancient sites and obtained a large number of techniques and secrets, among which the Five Elements Extreme Technique was one.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts. In this life, he will create another brilliant chapter and forge an immortal legend.
"How did the previous life die?"
Ling Han sifted through his memories, and soon his face showed anger.
The previous life was the only son of Ling Dongxing, the head of the Ling family. His mother, grandparents had passed away long ago. The Ling family was a martial arts family, every member practiced martial arts, and they respected martial arts. Why could Ling Dongxing sit in the position of the head of the family? It was because he was the strongest, he fought his way to the top.
But because of his spiritual root problem, Ling Han was regarded as a waste from a young age and was looked down upon.
In order to secure a bright future for his son, Ling Dongxing reached an agreement with Huyang Academy - Huyang Academy would accept Ling Han as a disciple and cultivate him with all their might. In exchange, Ling Dongxing would enter the Purple Light Earth Valley to find something that the academy had lost a long time ago.
Huyang Academy was established by the Rain Country Dynasty and had countless resources. If they fully cultivated someone, even the most useless person could be promoted to the Gathering Yuan Realm.
But the people of Huyang Academy were not idiots. If that thing was easy to get, how could they offer such generous terms?
The Purple Light Earth Valley was full of dangers, one wrong step could cost a life. But for his son, Ling Dongxing set off resolutely seven days ago.
Yesterday, people from Huyang Academy came and notified the Ling family that they would come to pick up the person as agreed today. But at this time, Ling Zhongkuan, the chief steward of the Ling family, came over to negotiate with the previous life, asking him to give up this precious opportunity to his grandson, Ling Muyun.
The reason was that Ling Muyun was a genius with unlimited potential, and such an opportunity should not be wasted on a waste.
The previous life naturally refused, this was an opportunity his father had exchanged with his life! But Ling Zhongkuan said it was a negotiation, but in fact, he was just notifying the previous life, and he didn't care about his opinion at all.
The previous life couldn't bear it and took action, but Ling Zhongkuan was a strong person in the Gathering Yuan Realm, he could suppress him with just one finger, how could he be an opponent?
With just one punch, the previous life was seriously injured, then locked in his own room, obviously not wanting him to make trouble in front of the people from Huyang Academy. And when Ling Dongxing returned, it would be too late.
And the seriously injured previous life was suffocated to death.
Ling Han snorted, feeling extremely wronged. The quota that his father had risked his life for was actually taken away by Ling Zhongkuan and his grandson?
Such shameless bastards!
He couldn't bear it!
He got up from the bed, immediately feeling sore all over his body - he had survived, but his injuries wouldn't miraculously heal.
"My spiritual root has also been injured!" Ling Han frowned. Ling Zhongkuan's attack had damaged his spiritual root, and a damaged spiritual root was a very troublesome matter, ordinary healing stones were ineffective.
"As far as I know, there are seven types of elixirs that can repair the spiritual root, but four of them require materials that are too expensive. Even if I sold the entire Ling family, I wouldn't be able to afford them - and besides, my spiritual root has only suffered minor damage, I don't need such high-grade elixirs."
"Of the remaining three, two need to be refined into pills, which is too difficult for me at my current cultivation level. So there's only one choice left - Yuanxin Fuling Powder, which only requires the medicinal materials to be proportionally mixed and boiled into a medicinal juice."
"First, I'll heal my injuries, then stop Ling Zhongkuan and his grandson. Although I don't care about this quota, I can't let the opportunity my father risked his life for be taken advantage of by these shameless people!"
He sat cross-legged and began to operate the "Undying Heavenly Scripture".
This was his first time operating this possibly divine-level technique, but because he had pondered it for tens of thousands of years, he was now able to control it with ease.
Humming sounds resonated within his body, a strong vitality emerged, his energy was consumed in large amounts, but his injuries were rapidly healing.
In just a few minutes, his injuries were completely healed.
"As expected of the Undying Heavenly Scripture, I just started practicing and it already has such miraculous effects. However, this is completely different from other techniques. Normal techniques use the spiritual root to transform the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into energy, while the Undying Heavenly Scripture does the opposite, refining the body with energy and healing injuries."
"When practiced to the highest realm, immortality is not impossible." "That's why it can be called a heavenly scripture!" "It's a pity that my current level is not enough, otherwise I could repair my spiritual root with the Undying Heavenly Scripture."
Ling Han opened his eyes, looked at the gradually brightening sky outside the window, and muttered to himself: "Now, it's time to meet that shameless old man Ling Zhongkuan and give him a surprise."
He put on his shoes, walked to the door, and opened it.
A tall figure immediately appeared at the door, blocking his way. This man was Zhang Yuan, one of Ling Zhongkuan's lackeys.
"Young Master Han, the chief steward ordered that you must stay in your room today!" Zhang Yuan chuckled, the person in front of him was the son of the family head, but he was a well-known waste, in his eyes, he was just a joke.
Ling Han's eyes turned cold, and he said, "You dare to stop me?"
Yes, I dare to stop you. The chief steward said that we must not let Ling Han cause trouble today, even if we have to beat him up! Zhang Yuan said with a forced smile: "This is the chief steward's order, please don't make it difficult for me, Young Master Han."
Ling Zhongkuan, this old dog, is really cautious. Even after beating him into serious injury, he still doesn't feel at ease and even sends someone to guard the door. This also shows how important it is for Ling Zhongkuan to let his grandson enter the Huyang Academy - but when this hope is shattered, one can imagine how disappointed and angry Ling Zhongkuan will be.
"Get out of the way!" Ling Han said coldly.
Slap!
Ling Han raised his hand and slapped him, saying coldly, "What are you, I told you to get out, won't you?"
What, he was actually slapped by a waste? Zhang Yuan couldn't believe it as he touched his face. This waste actually dared to hit him, and even hit him, what kind of joke was this?
Slap!
Ling Han swung his hand again, giving him another solid slap.
"Meh——meh——meh——"
The sound of imitating a sheep echoed in the quiet mountains.
Li Qiyue climbed up the hill, the night wind was urgent and cold, but at this moment, he was sweating profusely. The thirteen-year-old him, using his hands and feet, climbed up the mountain, the night seemed particularly lonely, making people shudder.
Although the night seemed terrifying, Li Qiyue was burning with anxiety.
Li Qiyue, he was born in a tenant farmer's family, his parents were both poor, he started herding sheep for others when he was seven.
Today, Li Qiyue was herding sheep as usual, but when he drove the sheep back in the evening, he found that one sheep was missing, which made him very anxious. He hurried back to the hill to look for it, but he searched the entire hill and couldn't find the sheep.
Thinking of the ferocious landlord Zhang, losing a sheep, Li Qiyue was burning with anxiety, feeling uneasy.
Now he had searched the entire hill and there was no sign of the sheep. At this time, Li Qiyue thought of a place, there was only one place he hadn't searched - the Fairy Demon Cave!
Looking up at the night of the valley in front of him, it was like a prehistoric beast, opening its mouth ready to choose people and eat them at any time. He could faintly hear the sound of wolves howling and ghosts crying in his ears. Looking at the misty night of the Fairy Demon Cave, Li Qiyue couldn't help but shiver.
The Fairy Demon Cave, a place with a bad reputation in the local area. It was said that a demon lived inside, anyone who went in would be eaten, and no one had ever come out alive after going in.
But at this moment, the sound of Zhang's landlord's whip was echoing in Li Qiyue's ears. If he lost a sheep, Zhang would definitely whip him until his skin was broken and his flesh was rotten!
"Good, good, good, my immortal crow has finally been refined, only lacking a soul, today I will borrow your soul!" I don't know how long it took, a deep and gloomy voice sounded from the Fairy Demon Cave.
"Flap——flap——flap——" In a short while, a hurried flapping sound rang out, and a strange bird like a crow flew out of the Fairy Demon Cave.
"Fly, fly, I want to borrow your soul to remember the burial ground, fly over the ruins, as long as the nine realms still exist, I will definitely find it!" In the Fairy Demon Cave, the deep and gloomy voice echoed.
From then on, in the world, there was a crow flying around, entering the burial ground, entering the fairy city, crossing the dangerous area... being involuntary, flying across the nine realms, experiencing all kinds of hardships, and not dying for millions of years!
Time passed, the era changed, one after another invincible figures rose, one after another giants fell. Gradually, I don't know when, a mysterious crow began to appear, a mysterious crow that had broken free from its shackles, began to look for a path to control its own destiny.
From the Medicine God, to the Flying Immortal Emperor, to the Blood Seal Immortal Emperor, to the Mingren Immortal Emperor, to the Sun Swallowing Immortal Emperor, to the Ice Feather Immortal Emperor... finally to the Black Dragon King.
One generation of invincible giants rose, and another generation of gods fell away, but over the course of millions of years, that crow still faintly appeared in the river of time.
The cold wind was like a knife, and the snow was falling heavily.
When Lu Sheng opened his eyes, he saw himself sitting in a yellow-gray carriage, the carriage was a bit shaky, and there was the sound of a little girl whispering next to him.
Outside the carriage, there was a noisy crowd. There were cries of selling, shouting, and cheering.
Lu Sheng sighed deeply.
He knew he couldn't go back, from a laid-back old hand in a state-owned enterprise, after getting drunk one time, he woke up in this world.
It's been five days so far.
He sniffed his nose, the air was filled with the scent of wine, pancakes, and fried fruit.
"Ah, the Bai Gui wine from Guihua Fang is getting more and more fragrant." The maid in the carriage said in a soft and milky voice.
Plus, she was born with a baby face and was small in stature. She looked no different from a ten-year-old child.
Her little face was chubby, rosy through the white, dressed in a green cotton skirt, and in her little hand, she was rubbing a hair tie for Lu Sheng, preparing to get off the car.
This hair tie was made from a very expensive type of bark, which naturally emitted a faint fragrance, but the only downside was that it would harden in cold weather and needed to be warmed and softened by rubbing with warm hands.
Lu Sheng smiled and said nothing. The carriage stopped quickly.
He lifted the curtain and got off the carriage. On the gray-white street, there were blocks of bluestone bricks, each the size of a washbasin.
The street was busy with carriages coming and going, and people leading horses back and forth. Peddlers and girls and women out for a stroll were not shy, laughing and showing their faces.
Lu Sheng looked up at the tavern in front of him. The white plaque was rectangular, with three large characters written in the middle in a flamboyant style: Guihua Fang.
"Please come in! We have reserved a 'Jia' class room for you!" A young servant greeted him with a smile.
Lu Sheng nodded, acting like a rich young master, took a silver-edged white paper fan from the small hand next to him, gave it a light shake, and the fan opened, with a landscape painting on it, the mountains and rivers undulating, light and dark overlapping, and a calligraphy that was obviously of a high standard.
He followed the young servant into the tavern as if he knew the way.
The tavern was two stories high, and the first floor was full of people listening to songs.
A young girl in green was standing in the open, her voice melodious, and a middle-aged woman was playing the pipa next to her.
They were singing a song called "Three Meetings", which tells the tragic love story of a general going to war and a fox girl in the mountains.
Unfortunately, most of the guests in the tavern were rough men, only a few literati could understand, the rest of the people ignored the two girls.
Lu Sheng stopped, seeing the first floor so lively, he simply found an empty seat and sat down.
"Who ordered the 'Three Meetings'?" He casually asked the young servant.
His status in Guihua Fang was different. If Guihua Fang was considered a high-end entertainment club on Earth, then he was the supreme VIP customer here.
Such spending, in a small northern city like Jiuliancheng, was already considered a top-tier customer.
"It was Young Master Zhou. Young Master Zhou Que."
Lu Sheng didn't make it difficult for him, so he waved him away.
After he sat down with Xiaoqiao, his gaze swept around the crowd on the first floor, and he quickly spotted a pale and weak young man in white, holding a golden fan with lotus leaf edges, gently shaking it.
"He must have taken a fancy to the little girl singing." Lu Sheng shook his head.
"Last time the young master warned him, this guy is really a bad guy!" Xiaoqiao pouted in dissatisfaction.
Lu Sheng smiled and said nothing more. He began to listen to the song quietly.
A table full of food and wine was quickly served on the dark red wooden table. Lu Sheng picked up a piece of stir-fried pork with lettuce and put it in his mouth.
He took a sip of Bai Gui wine, which was similar to a beverage. The faint sweet floral fragrance mixed together, almost like drinking juice.
This northern snow city, ice shrimp is a specialty here, in the thick ice hole, you can scoop out a large number of semi-transparent small shrimp.
Ice shrimp are half the size of ordinary shrimp, but they taste incredibly delicious.
Of course, the price is also very expensive.
Ordinary people eating it once a month is already considered a luxury, let alone having it at every meal like him.
While Lu Sheng was enjoying his food and wine, and listening to the song, his mind was on other things.
He had been in this world similar to ancient China for many days now. But from his observations, this world had many strange things.
At first, he thought he had returned to ancient times, but then he realized that was not the case.
The customs, holidays, and climate here were all very different from any dynasty or region he knew.
As he was thinking, the door of the tavern opened again.
A group of strong men in short fighting clothes walked in one after another, found a table near the corner, and sat down.
These strong men were obviously not locals, their attire was more like they had come from the central plains, their clothing and demeanor lacked the roughness of the north.
The leading strong man was bald, with copper earrings, a face full of muscles, but he was sighing at the moment.
"Don't worry, brother, if we can't get through Li's village, we can take the second route, we can also go around from Zhang's village." Another man frowned.
"What do you know, when I came to meet up, I walked from Zhang's village. The situation is similar to Li's village, many people have died."
"What exactly happened, brother, tell us, let us learn something." A man urged.
The bald strong man sighed again. "I'm not sure about the specifics, I just know that several fishing villages near Suiyang Lake have had accidents, it seems like a water ghost is causing trouble."
"Really?"
Lu Sheng's table was not far from theirs, and he could hear their unguarded conversation.
Originally, he was just listening for fun, but he didn't expect these people to start talking about supernatural things.
In this life, his Lu family was one of the richest in this northern ice city, and to say that they were wealthy was an understatement.
If compared to Earth, they would at least be billionaires.
These days when he came out to drink, he heard a lot of rumors about monsters and ghosts in the tavern, but most of them were just stories.
This was the first time he had heard such firsthand experiences, so Lu Sheng pricked up his ears and listened carefully.
Fortunately, those people didn't hide anything. They continued to talk loudly about the strange things in the fishing village.
"That water ghost, I saw it with my own eyes, it was over ten feet tall, with a green face and sharp teeth, covered in a lot of water grass, my goodness, if it wasn't for me running fast, you wouldn't be seeing me now." The bald man was still scared.
"Brother, are there really water ghosts?" A man didn't believe it.
"Are you making up a story, brother?"
Lu Sheng found it funny to hear this, guessing it was just some rough man bragging. He had seen many such people in this period.
After eating and drinking, he asked the young servant to bring the song list of the singing girl, and started browsing casually.
"Three Meetings" was good, but it didn't fit the mood, so he decided to change to a more cheerful song.
Bang!
But at this moment, the bald man's face turned red, and he slapped the table.
"This is a piece of bone that the water ghost left on the ground! I picked it up secretly afterwards!"
He carefully took out a green stone that looked like jade from his bosom and slapped it on the table.
"Isn't this just a piece of miscellaneous jade!" A man laughed.
"Miscellaneous jade? Is this miscellaneous jade?
"Brother, can I take a look at this thing."
Suddenly a gentle voice came from the side.
Lu Sheng stood by their table with a smile on his face, his eyes sweeping over the green jade on the table.
"This thing, you dare to take it? This is something left by a water ghost." The bald man was surprised.
He just took it out to show off, planning to throw it away later.
After all, this is not something left by humans. If it really attracts the water ghost to cause trouble, it would be more trouble than it's worth.
"I just want to take a look." Lu Sheng didn't believe in any water ghosts, he just thought the jade looked good, not like ordinary miscellaneous jade.
You should know that ordinary miscellaneous jade can be bought everywhere in shops and small stalls, it is the edge material of jade that is randomly polished, and the price is extremely cheap.
But somehow, when he saw this piece of jade, he felt something was wrong.
He was dressed in a green robe and white fox fur, wearing a green jade hat, and wearing black boots embroidered with silver cloud patterns.
The outfit could be spent in Guihua Fang for several months. Even enough for a normal family's living expenses for more than a year.
"The young master wants it, it's not impossible, um... one or two silver pieces will do!"
Lu Sheng let Xiaoqiao take out one or two pieces of broken silver and put them on the table.
The bald man decisively picked up the jade and stuffed it into Lu Sheng's hand. A few people exchanged glances, got up and left.
Lu Sheng didn't say a word, watching the few people leave, holding the jade in his hand, looking at it carefully.
"This is probably the only time in my life I can be so extravagant." He shook his head, one or two silver pieces meant nothing to him, according to the memory of this body, his monthly expenses were at least a hundred silver pieces. Occasionally more, he might spend a thousand.
Thinking of this, he secretly scolded himself for being a spendthrift.
Holding the jade, he ignored the curious gazes of the surrounding guests and left the tavern with Xiaoqiao, heading towards the waiting carriage outside.
But just as he left the tavern, before he had walked half the way, he suddenly paused, picking up the jade and placing it in his palm.
The jade in his hand, right in the palm of his right hand, began to melt.
The originally hard stone, in just a few seconds, turned into a dark green sticky liquid, from which a faint scream could be heard.
The entire sticky liquid suddenly exploded, turning into a cloud of green smoke, slowly drifting away from Lu Sheng.
He stood there in astonishment, blinking his eyes, the jade was still in his hand, but the green inside had quietly disappeared at some point.
He stood there in a daze, constantly recalling the previous scene.
Xiaoqiao kept calling him from the side.
Lu Sheng came back to his senses, looked at the jade in his hand, it was just an ordinary pebble, not even jade anymore.
"Let's go, back to the mansion!"
The two got into the carriage, the coachman picked up the whip and whipped the air a few times, and the two hairy black horses slowly started to move.
Inside the carriage, Lu Sheng didn't say a word, constantly looking at the pebble in his hand. Xiaoqiao also noticed something strange about the stone at this time.
"We've been fooled again!" She muttered to herself, not saying much. This time was still better for the young master. The biggest scam he had ever fallen for was a so-called antique wine pot, which cost him thousands of silver pieces and almost killed his father. This time it was only one or two silver pieces, sometimes the young master spent more than this on a meal.
The carriage headed back to the mansion. As they passed the city gate, Lu Sheng heard someone shouting outside.
"...I heard earlier that the water ghost has been exorcised! A wandering Taoist took action and solved the crisis of the fishing village!"
"Did someone from the court come?"
"They came early, I heard that even the city's prefect Ouyang was almost trapped. Fortunately, he met a wandering Taoist. It is said that as soon as the Taoist took action, there was a flash of golden light, the water ghost screamed in pain, turned into a green sticky liquid, and then exploded into a thick smoke and dispersed."
"Of course not!"
Lu Sheng heard that this was the city gate guard officer chatting.
He often deliberately passed by this city gate, the officers and soldiers here were well-informed and liked to brag about strange things.
"This is a coincidence..." Lu Sheng's face was expressionless.
He thought back to the jade earlier, and his heart sank.
In the autumn of the 9999th year of the Shen Zhou calendar, in the East Sea, Qingzhou City.
Qingzhou Academy, the holy land of Qingzhou City, more than half of the strong people in the noble families and sect families of Qingzhou City have come out of Qingzhou Academy. Therefore, the people of Qingzhou City are proud to be able to study in the academy, and they will study hard if they have the opportunity to enter the academy.
However, it seems that not everyone has this awareness. At this time, in a classroom of Qingzhou Academy, a young man was sleeping on the table.
On the podium, a young girl in a green dress also noticed this scene, a trace of anger appeared on her pretty face, she stepped forward and walked towards the sleeping young man.
Qin Yi, seventeen years old, a formal disciple of Qingzhou Academy, an outer disciple lecturer, beautiful and voluptuous. In the classroom, a pair of eyes followed Qin Yi's attractive figure, even when she was angry, Qin Yi's steps were still elegant.
"This guy, he's actually sleeping in Sister Qin's class again." It seemed that they only noticed the sleeping figure at this moment, many of the young men around were speechless, obviously, this was not the first time.
"With Sister Qin's beauty and figure, even just looking at her is pleasing to the eye, what on earth is in that guy's head."
Among many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular one, without a doubt. The reason is obvious to anyone who sees her. Many people regard her as a goddess, her class is always full.
Qin Yi's steps were light, she made no sound when she came to the young man's side, she stood in front of the table, looking at the sleeping face in front of her, her beautiful face was full of frost.
"Ye Futian." A soft voice came out, but it was not from Qin Yi, but from behind Ye Futian.
It seemed that he heard someone calling him in his sleep, Ye Futian moved, propped up his head with both hands, slowly opened his eyes, in his blurry vision, he saw a pair of undulating peaks.
"So big." Ye Futian couldn't help but whisper, his voice was very soft, like he was talking to himself, but in this quiet environment, this voice was particularly abrupt, in an instant, many eyes were fixed in the air, then turned into anger.
"He dares... to openly disrespect Sister Qin?"
A series of angry glances turned into sharp swords, making Ye Futian shiver, as if he felt something was wrong, his gaze moved up from that tempting place, and then he saw a delicate face full of anger.
"Uh..." Ye Futian had a black line on his face, why was it Qin Yi?
He looked back and saw a fifteen-year-old innocent girl staring at him angrily.
Ye Futian glanced at the girl, then cursed under his breath, he had been badly hurt, no wonder the size was wrong.
"Sister Qin, I..." Ye Futian was about to explain.
"Ye Futian." Qin Yi coldly interrupted him, "What was the background of the establishment of Qingzhou Academy?"
Obviously, Qin Yi wanted to avoid the embarrassment just now and change the subject, but her anger at this moment, Ye Futian could clearly feel, he even faintly felt a few strands of sword intent flowing from Qin Yi, sharp and bone-chilling, piercing every inch of his skin.
"Three hundred years ago, the Eastern Phoenix Emperor unified the Eastern Shen Zhou, ordered all the lords to establish martial academies, and promoted martial arts. Qingzhou Academy was established under this background." Ye Futian replied, of course what he said was recorded in official history, in the unofficial history he saw in his family there was another name, but that taboo name was not allowed to be mentioned.
"What professions are there in cultivation?" Qin Yi asked again.
"Cultivation can be divided into martial arts and magic, martial arts practitioners have many professions such as warriors, knights, swordsmen, magic practitioners have many professions such as mages, alchemists, refiners, and mages are divided into many systems, of course there are also those with special talents who practice both martial arts and magic." Ye Futian replied.
"You seem to have missed one profession." Qin Yi asked seriously.
A sacred light appeared on the young man's face: "The strongest profession recognized by Shen Zhou, those who are favored by heaven, the Destiny Mage, have the talent given by the heavens, those rare talents, such as summoners, beast tamers, star mages, most of them come from Destiny Mages, Destiny Mages, whether they practice martial arts or magic, have stronger talents than others."
Everyone around was fascinated, the Destiny Mage, a legendary profession, bearing the destiny, receiving the favor of the heavens. "Not only that, even the Destiny Mage is naturally suitable for both martial and magical cultivation."
Qin Yi looked forward with longing, then turned to the young man in front of her, somewhat angrily said, "I didn't expect you to know quite a bit about this."
"Of course." Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said seriously, "I am a Destiny Mage."
"Pfft..." A young man not far away who was drinking water choked violently, coughing violently. All eyes around him turned to Ye Futian, as if looking at an idiot.
How could there be such a shameless person in the world? He is indeed a legendary figure in Qingzhou Academy, not only openly flirting with Sister Qin, but now also falsely claiming to be a Destiny Mage, just to attract Sister Qin's attention?
However, who is he? He has been studying in the academy for three years, always lingering in the first stage of awakening, his body is weak, obviously he has not completed his body refining, such a mediocre person, even a waste, claiming to be a Destiny Mage? Does he have no shame?
Qin Yi's chest rose and fell again, creating a magnificent sight. She angrily looked at Ye Futian: "Since you are a Destiny Mage, naturally your life palace has a soul, release your life palace soul and let me see."
"My life soul is still sleeping and cannot be summoned. I fell asleep in the lecture hall because of the life soul." Ye Futian calmly responded.
"Ye Futian..." Qin Yi suddenly shouted loudly, her beautiful eyes staring at the young man in front of her, saying: "Three years ago, you entered the academy at the age of twelve. At that time, I was still an outer disciple. I watched your talent test. Your perception of spiritual energy was top-notch, shocking the academy, and many teachers paid attention. However, in the past three years, you have made no progress, always staying in the first stage of awakening, doing nothing all day, lazy and unbearable, absent-minded in the lecture hall, have you ever practiced?"
"For three years, whether it's the spring or autumn exams, you have all given up, directly ranking last in the academy. Ye Futian, do you have any sense of shame?"
With Qin Yi's angry roar, the entire school building became silent, and you could hear a pin drop. Everyone's eyes were fixed on Qin Yi's excited face. It seemed that this was the first time they had seen Sister Qin like this.
Ye Futian seemed to be stunned too, his dark eyes staring at the delicate face in front of him that was red with anger.
"Has it been three years?" Ye Futian murmured in his heart, he didn't realize that three years had passed, and the guy in his life palace hadn't changed at all. He was also surprised that the usually cold and aloof ice queen, Sister Qin, had been paying attention to him all along, starting from when he first entered the academy and was tested for his top-notch perception talent.
The space was dead silent, Qin Yi's beautiful eyes stared at the young man in front of her, his clear and handsome face, clean and deep eyes shining like stars, at the age of fifteen, apart from being a bit thin, there was nothing else wrong with him. In a few more years, he would definitely be a handsome man.
"Was my tone too harsh?" Seeing a hint of melancholy in Ye Futian's eyes, Qin Yi couldn't help but think to herself, and her anger dissipated a bit.
"There's another month until the autumn exam. If you still give up or fail this time, even if Yusheng pleads for you, it won't help. The academy won't allow you to stay any longer. Do you understand?" Qin Yi continued, the people in the school building focused their eyes, it seemed that the academy had had enough of that guy.
If so, it would probably go down in the history of Qingzhou Academy. After all, it's extremely rare to be expelled from Qingzhou Academy.
"If he leaves, I leave." At the back, a indifferent voice came, many people looked at the boy sitting in the corner, their eyes complex, with envy, jealousy, admiration, and fear.
"The academy has decided that Yusheng doesn't need to participate in next year's spring exam. He can choose to practice in any of the academy's battle tower, knight group, or magic palace. His future can't be affected by you anymore." Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed, his and Yusheng's destinies were going in completely different directions.
Ye Futian's mouth curled up in a faint smile, somewhat cynical.
"Shut up..." Yusheng stood up from the back, his eyes shining with a dazzling sharp light, piercing towards Qin Yi.
"Sit down." Ye Futian said without turning his head, Yusheng's eyes paused, looking at the figure in front of him, then quietly sat down, as if Ye Futian's words were an iron command to him.
"I've decided..." Ye Futian's face showed a slightly reckless smile, looking at Qin Yi and said, "I will officially participate in this year's autumn exam."
Behind him, a dazzling light flashed in Yusheng's eyes.
Has it been three years? Is he finally going to get serious?
Three years of cultivation in Qingzhou Academy, everyone in the academy only knows that Yusheng has an extraordinary talent, his perception of the gold attribute is top-notch, his martial arts talent is also extremely high, he can cultivate both magic and martial arts, although he is an outer disciple, his realm is even higher than many lecturers.
However, who really understands that sleeping boy?
"You are weak and still stuck in the first stage of awakening, even if you participate in the autumn exam, how can you pass?" Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian, sighed in her heart, even if he tried hard now, it might still be too late.
"What if I pass?" Ye Futian seemed to have no self-awareness at all, his tone full of strong confidence.
"If you can pass, you can do whatever you want in the lecture hall in the future." Qin Yi said.
Ye Futian's eyes flashed with an unusual light, looking at the beautiful figure and hot body in front of him, his eyes involuntarily looked at the place he shouldn't have looked, and weakly said, "Can I do anything?"
"What does he mean by this..." Many people stared at Ye Futian.
"This shameless bastard, where is he looking?" It seemed that many people noticed Ye Futian's gaze and had the urge to explode. He even dared to flirt with Sister Qin?
Qin Yi naturally noticed Ye Futian's gaze as well, and the sympathy that had just arisen in her heart instantly disappeared. Her beautiful eyes stared fiercely at Ye Futian, gritting her teeth and saying, "You can do whatever you want!"
Deep in the mountains, thousands of demons gathered.
For the first time, all the tribes put aside their grudges and appeared at the same time, tigers, rabbits, foxes, snakes... all kinds of demons were present. For a time, the entire forest was filled with the voices of various demons, big and small, delicate and enchanting. At the top, there were ten demon kings sitting, these top powerhouses of the demon world, but at this moment, they all had the same heavy expression.
"All of you demons, you must have a clear idea of what has been happening here recently." The Tiger tribe has always been strong, and the Tiger King was the first to speak, which quieted all the demons, "We are all demons, in this crisis, I think all tribes should put aside their prejudices, unite, and solve the current problem together."
"What's the purpose?"
"Do we still need to guess?" The Tiger King snorted coldly, "Apart from those cultivators in the six sects and three schools, who would do such a thing. Haven't we been slaughtered by them for years?"
"But we and these cultivation sects have always been clearly divided, why would they suddenly block our way out of the boundary." The Fox King looked puzzled.
"We didn't eat their three sects and six schools' eggs." The Snake King also guessed, "They don't need to tear their faces like this."
"Exactly!" The Leopard King also said indignantly, "We've been like this for so many years, which demon hasn't eaten a mortal or two, why would the three sects and six schools suddenly make a move? I don't think it's them."
"Right, everyone knows that the demon energy in our realm is harmful to their cultivation, so they never approach the border forest, how could they be stationed here on purpose."
"But... apart from the six sects and three clans, who else has the strength to kill all the demons that have crossed the boundary within three months?" The Tiger King still insisted on his own idea.
The Eagle King nodded, as if recalling something, his feathers all trembled, "I heard that those demons who crossed the boundary, each died without a trace, some were skinned and cooked, their bodies hung on the old ashamed tree in the forest, dried by the wind. Such cruelty... worse than beasts."
"It's simply too much bullying of the demons." The Tiger King smashed the armrest of the stone chair with a palm, stood up angrily, "Fellow demon kings, I think instead of guessing who did it, we should go out and find out. I don't believe that no matter how high their cultivation is, they can stop this army of ten thousand demons?"
As soon as he said this, the other nine demon kings immediately showed agreement. Indeed, instead of being scared, it's better to take the initiative.
The Deer King was the first to respond, "My son died at their hands, instead of guessing here, it's better to go out and fight. What about the three clans and six sects, when have we demons ever been afraid of them!"
"Isn't that why we gathered here today? No matter who it is, let's go out and avenge our fallen kind." Even the timid Rabbit King stood up to respond, the rabbit clan had suffered the most casualties.
"That's right, if we don't avenge this, we are not worthy to be demons!"
"With the souls of our clan above, we swear to avenge this."
The other demon kings also stood up one after another to respond, even the various demons waiting around, some showed their true forms, some showed their claws, and they all started shouting slogans of revenge, looking like they were ready to go.
"What..." A thin voice suddenly rang out in the crowd of demons, "I think we don't need to go."
In the wave of anger, a dissenting voice suddenly appeared. Although the voice was not loud, it successfully attracted the attention of all the demons. The shouting stopped, and all the demons' eyes were focused on it.
"Who is it?" The Tiger King let out a roar, searching for this cowardly demon.
The demons searched around, even though they were the most sensitive creatures, they couldn't find the person who had spoken.
"Who was the one who just spoke?" The Tiger King was a little angry, "Where is the cowardly demon? Have the guts to stand up for me!"
"I'm here, here!"
The demons looked around again, but still couldn't see who was speaking.
"Here, here..." The voice rose again, "Left, left, no... too far, a little to the right, wrong, look here, look here!"
The demons followed the voice and looked left and right several times, but still couldn't find the person who was speaking.
"Sigh! Forget it, I'm here!"
Not until a sigh, a figure suddenly climbed onto the high platform where the demon kings were sitting. Only then did the demons see the person who was speaking.
It was a woman in a grey robe, her shoulders drooping weakly, her eyes lifeless and drooping, her whole person exuding a lazy aura, she was very short and thin, her face a little yellowish.
The word "weak" popped up in the minds of all the demons, too weak! Even the demon energy on her was pitifully weak, as if any demon could blow her away with a breath.
No wonder the demons couldn't find this person after searching for a long time, such a demon was really too inconspicuous.
The bloodthirsty Tiger King couldn't stand it, he snorted, "Hmph, you cowardly kid, a few cultivators have scared you into this state." Demons can transform, but this is the grand meeting of ten thousand demons, so most of the demons here show some of their original forms to distinguish their races, only she maintains a complete human form, which makes the Tiger King even more displeased, "You dare not show your original form, what kind of demon are you?" "I am a human."
"I am a human." The woman replied.
"A human demon?" The Tiger King was stunned, "What kind of demon is a human demon? I've never heard of it!"
"How can all kinds of weak demons dare to participate in the grand meeting of ten thousand demons." The Tiger King glared at the woman angrily, "You cowardly little demon, stop talking nonsense here, affecting our morale to go and take revenge."
"No, I'm serious." The woman raised her hand without repentance, her shoulders unconsciously drooping, making her look even weaker, "You really don't need to go out and find someone to take revenge."
"You're still talking defeatist talk!" The Tiger King was angry and roared, "Believe it or not, I'll eat you, little demon."
"If you eat me, there's no need to make a wasted trip, right?"
"What do you mean?"
"What I mean is, the person you just mentioned who killed all the demons, worse than a beast..." She sighed, patted her grey robe, raised her head, still looking listless, but pointed to her own nose and said, "It might... be me!"
The whole scene was silent for three seconds, dead silence.
"Kill her!"
The ten thousand demons who had reacted all pounced on the woman at the same time.
Small animals and such - what a hassle!
Five minutes later.
- The first and last grand meeting of ten thousand demons, concluded!
Chapter One: Tony Dunn?
The loud noise was stimulating his brain nerves, the decibels were deafening. A dazzling white light shot into his eyes, causing a throbbing pain like the sun.
Dunn couldn't help but squint his eyes, but the white light did not disappear, instead, it spread to the whole world.
What the hell is going on? Am I at a rock concert?
Dunn cursed in his heart and opened his eyes, but what rushed into his sight was a big scary face. A face covered with black sweat, the hot air sprayed from the two black holes under the wide nostrils seemed to have touched his face. The big mouth full of white teeth was as terrifying as a wild animal, and of course, the bad breath that came out of it.
Next was a fierce, head-on collision. Dunn felt as if he had been hit by a heavy punch on the chin, and he fell backward.
The weight of the two people pressed on those poor plastic bottles, they couldn't bear the weight and declared to disintegrate. The white water splashed out, and even a water column shot out from the mouth of a bottle, directly hitting the face of the "pond fish" behind, and the other "pond fish" seemed to be frightened sparrows flying into the sky.
"Damn it!"
"What the hell!"
"What's going on?"
"Team doctor, team doctor!"
"How did you kick?"
Dunn lay on the ground, staring blankly at the unfamiliar faces around him, some of them looked anxious, some were gloating, and some covered their faces and couldn't see their expressions. The surroundings were still noisy, but the loud noise just now had changed its tune, with boos and laughter in it.
Where is this? Who are they? What's going on?
Wait, let's see what's happening on the sidelines?" The live commentator suddenly became excited, he stood up and looked down from the top stand, "Forest team's main forward David Johnson was hit to the sideline coach's bench in a scramble with the opponent, and poor coach Tony Dunn was just standing on the sideline directing the game... Oh! Look at the terrible scene on the ground, this is really a Mars hitting the Earth collision!
Dunn lay on the ground, his light gray suit was soaked, wrinkled and covered with grass and dirt, looking like a used rag.
A big-nosed, black-bearded man who looked a bit like Mario appeared in his vision, he quickly took out white gloves from his dark-colored bag and put them on, then began to check Dunn's body.
Damn, it seems he fell on the back of his head!
"Can you hear me?" He waved his hand in front of Dunn's eyes, his tone was obviously much more anxious than before.
At the same time, the TV screen began to replay the scene just now.
David Johnson was pushed hard by the opponent's No. 14 in a fierce scramble, then this big black man rushed towards Tony Dunn who was standing on the sideline. But strangely, Dunn could have avoided it, he had plenty of time, but at this moment he stood on the sideline like a puppet, watching his player hit him.
The scene was repeated. The Forest team players anxiously surrounded the coach's bench, naturally, the center of the crowd was Dunn lying on the ground, and the black forward David Johnson who made the mistake was even kneeling on the ground praying non-stop. If anything happened to his coach, he would be the first player to kill his own head coach on the field.
Unlike the tension of the Forest team players, most of their opponents stood in the field, crossed their arms and watched the show, and some curious people took on the role of the team's spy, constantly running to watch the excitement, and then running back to share the situation in the crowd with their teammates.
The Forest team fans in the stands didn't seem to worry about the life and death of their head coach, they took this opportunity to loudly curse their team's poor performance, various words starting with "F" or "s" burst out of their mouths, and countless raised middle fingers made the "0:2" on the big screen particularly eye-catching.
The Forest team's team doctor Gary Fleming was still doing his best, he clearly saw Tony's eyeballs move just now, why didn't he respond afterwards?
He slapped Tony Dunn's face, still no response. The team's acting head coach lay on the ground like a wax figure, his mouth slightly open, his eyes wide open, as if he had seen something very surprising.
The blue sky, the cotton candy-like white clouds, faces of different colors and expressions, the noisy environment, all of this was familiar, but so strange, as if it was thousands of miles away from him.
The main referee signaled the team doctor to handle it himself, he couldn't let the game stop indefinitely because of the injury off the field. He blew the whistle to let all the players return to the field, the game had to continue, even though the Forest team players had no desire to fight anymore.
"But he might be in danger of life!" Fleming was very angry at the referee's indifference, he pointed at Dunn who was still lying on the ground and yelled at the referee.
"Then you call an ambulance, I'm just a referee!" The main referee fought back without showing weakness, "And, he doesn't seem to be as dangerous as you said." He pointed to Fleming behind him, then ran back to the field.
Fleming turned around and saw Dunn slowly standing up touching the back of his head, he quickly went up to support him. "How do you feel, Tony?"
Dunn asked blankly, "Where is this?"
Fleming turned around and cursed, he had been really unlucky recently. "Des, Des, come here!" He waved to a golden man on the coach's bench.
The man called "Des" ran over. "How's Tony?"
"Terrible. He even asked me where this is?"
Des's reaction was the same as Fleming's just now, he also turned his head and cursed.
"I suspect it's the result of him falling down and hitting the back of his head."
"Is the situation bad, Gary?" Des bit his lip, his face serious.
"I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad." Fleming shook his head.
"What does that mean?"
"In a good situation, he just has temporary amnesia, and he will recover after a rest. In a bad situation... do you still need me to say it?"
Des waved his hand to indicate that he understood. "Send him to the hospital? But the game is still going on, and we are behind, we need him to direct the game..." As he said, he turned his head to look at Tony Dunn next to him, but he was surprised to see Dunn slowly moving towards the player tunnel.
"Hey!" Des quickly threw Fleming away and ran up to stop his colleague.
"Tony, where are you going?" In the noisy environment, Des's shouting actually had the effect of "whispering".
Dunn turned his head and looked at Des blankly, this look made Des feel cold, now the golden light of the setting sun above their heads was brilliant, but he couldn't see any light in those eyes.
"Tony, where are you going?" Des repeated.
"I... I don't know, maybe... going home..." Dunn murmured, still trying to break free from Des's hand.
Fleming also ran over from the side: "Tony, you can't go home now. We are in a game, you are the head coach, you have to direct the team!"
The tug-of-war between three people at the entrance of the passage attracted the attention of both substitute benches and the spectators in the stands, even the players on the field would occasionally glance over here.
Don suddenly laughed: "Am I the coach?" This is ridiculous, how could I possibly be the coach... Although I am a fan and often play football manager games, how could I possibly be a coach? This must be a dream, a damn nightmare!
Fleming introduced the two as if they were meeting for the first time: "This is Des, Des Walker. Former England international, a central defender on the field, retired from the team last season, now he is your colleague, your assistant."
Don nodded, then said to Des: "Okay, now you command the game for me, I need to rest." After saying that, he broke free from Des's hand, ignored the huge boos behind him and the two stunned people, and walked into the passage.
Fleming looked at Don's back, then at Des Walker.
Walker sighed heavily and turned back. "This game can't be played anymore!"
Don sat in the passage, leaning against the wall, blankly looking at the surrounding environment. On the white wall opposite him was a huge logo, under the red "mushroom" were three wavy lines, and below was an English word: Forest.
Where am I? What's going on?
Don touched the back of his head, which was still aching.
Damn, sneak attack on me, hit me from behind!
"What's my name?" He muttered to himself, but suddenly covered his mouth. It was not until this moment that he realized that he had been speaking in English all along.
"Damn, what's going on?"
Finally understanding where he was, Don was stunned again, this was too incredible, so much so that his brain stopped responding after heavy computation. And all this seemed to have nothing to do with him anymore.
The above is a scene that happened this afternoon at the City Stadium, where Tony Don, the acting head coach of the Forest team, was knocked down by his player on the sidelines and seemed to fall into a brief coma. When he got up again, he walked straight into the player's passage.
With the faint light from the street lamps outside, Don stood in the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror. A middle-aged foreigner with a tall nose, deep eye sockets, blue eyes, and slightly curly brown hair.
In fact, Don from Sichuan, China, is only 26 years old, and the man in the mirror even has forehead lines! Thirty-four years old! This is Tony Don's age.
Not only did he inexplicably stoop to an Englishman, but he also traveled forward four years and three months!
Although he never thought he was handsome enough to attract many women.
He roared at the mirror, then punched and shattered the mirror. The reflection in the mirror instantly became countless, the fragments fell to the ground making a clattering sound, countless faces looking at Don, as if mocking him.
Don felt a little dizzy, he took a step back, leaning against the smooth wall and panting heavily.
After sitting quietly in the dark for a few minutes, Don gradually calmed down, he decided not to think about such complex issues for now. He had a habit in China, whenever he encountered something unpleasant, he would go find a place to drink. There are bars everywhere in Chengdu, maybe he could even find a one-night stand. He habitually thought of Nottingham as Chengdu in his heart, and decided to go out and find a bar to drown his sorrows.
Looking at the gloomy sky outside, he put on a thick coat and walked out the door.
"Losing 0:3 to the weak Walsall at their home ground, Forest team has indeed been unlucky recently. Paul Hart, who was highly expected, did not bring good results to the team, he submitted his resignation to the team chairman Nigel Doughty after the last game, and it was quickly approved."
The TV fixed on the overhead was broadcasting today's sports news, naturally focusing on everything that happened on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest team's game.
A round of boos sounded in the noisy bar.
A drunken man gave the TV the middle finger. "I know that Tony Don! He used to be a little kid assistant to Paul Hart in the youth team."
Just as the drunk man finished his long speech, Don walked in through the door. The sound of the door attracted the attention of most of the people chatting and drinking in the bar, everyone turned their eyes to the door, when they saw who was coming in, they were first surprised, then a mocking smile appeared on their faces.
A typical middle-aged British man stood up with his glass and shouted, "Our coach Tony Don has arrived!"
"Woo!" The people in the bar made a "welcome" boo.
"Cheers to his beautiful off-field defense against Johnson's breakthrough!" The middle-aged man raised his glass, and the people around immediately followed suit and raised their glasses. "Cheers!
Another obviously drunk man staggered up, walked up to Don, held a beer bottle to his mouth, burped and asked: "Coach Tony Don, that was a beautiful defense, but the main referee and public opinion obviously don't... don't think so... uh!
After asking, he turned his head and laughed at the other people in the bar.
So he pushed away the bottle in front of him with a gloomy face. Then he walked straight to the bar and said to the bartender inside: "Please bring a bottle..." He habitually wanted to say a bottle of "Little Two" - a small bottle of Erguotou, although he is from Sichuan, but he went to university in the north, from that time he liked this strong liquor - but he now knows he can't say "Little Two" in English, more importantly, he quickly realized that this is in England, not in China. He muttered a curse under his breath, then changed his words: "Bring the strongest liquor."
The others who had been observing him heard him say he wanted the strongest liquor, and they all shouted loudly.
"Yo! Is our timid Tony also drinking?"
The young bartender, faced with these excited customers, was also a bit at a loss, he wanted to get the liquor but was stopped by those drunks: "Give him juice! Juice!"
"No no, or milk, we have the freshest milk juice!"
"Ah haha!"
The noise outside disturbed the owner of the bar, he came down from upstairs, stood at the staircase, and saw that almost all the customers who hadn't fallen asleep on the table were gathered in front of the bar, in the middle of them sat a man wrapped in a black coat, being mocked by those drunks.
His loud voice immediately quieted the bar. The drunks who were still very arrogant just now, when they saw the person standing behind them, immediately quieted down.
Don found it strange, who could make this group of people behave with just one sentence? He slightly turned his head and saw a person walking out of the shadow of the staircase.
The young bartender quickly pointed at Don and said to the man: "Boss, he wants a strong drink."
The newcomer was a bit surprised when he saw who was sitting, but he still said: "Give it to him."
"But... but they won't let..." The bartender looked at the drunks who had returned to their seats in distress.
The man looked around the bar, and everyone he glanced at lowered their heads, either pretending to sleep or drinking heavily. Don became more interested in the middle-aged man in front of him.
"I see no objections, pour him a glass of Scotch whisky, it's on me." The bar owner turned to Don, "Single or double?"
The onlookers at the bar burst into laughter.
The bar owner also laughed. "I forgot who you are..." He poured half a glass of golden whisky into a glass, then added half a glass of water. Then he handed it to Don: "This is the drink from my hometown."
Don took a sip and immediately started coughing, he rarely drank foreign liquor. Moreover, this pure Scotch whisky had a strong taste of charcoal.
There was a burst of schadenfreude laughter in the bar.
"The Tony Don I know never drinks, he lives like a true traditional Puritan. And he wouldn't look at me with this look, don't you know who I am?" The man stared at Don, and Don felt like he was being seen through by this man.
He had to find a way to cover himself. "Uh... I," Don lowered his head and took another sip, this time he didn't dare to let the liquor stay in his throat for a second, he swallowed it directly, the uncomfortable feeling was indeed lighter.
There was another burst of laughter.
The man touched the back of his head, indicating understanding.
Someone next to Don helped him out, a voice shouted: "It seems that our coach Tony really hit his head! The man sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, a two-time European Cup winner, the 1978 Stanley Matthews Award winner, Mr. Kenny Burns! He is a hundred times better than your stupid donkey!"
People behind laughed loudly, shouting "stupid donkey" non-stop, but unexpectedly, the object of their ridicule suddenly threw the remaining half glass of whisky in his hand. The golden Scotch whisky shone brilliantly under the light, drew a beautiful arc in the air, and then accurately hit the unlucky guy's face - as precise and beautiful as David Beckham's free kick. "Bang!"
His swearing was hit back by a solid glass, and Don pounced on the other person with an unexpected speed and the glass. He had been holding back his anger for too long, inexplicably coming to this place, inexplicably traveling forward four and a half years, being ridiculed and insulted inexplicably... he just wanted to vent on someone now, whether he knocked someone down or was knocked down by someone.
The two crashed into the table behind, empty bottles fell and shattered on the ground with a crisp sound.
The laughter stopped abruptly, everyone was stunned. They didn't expect Tony Don, who was just like a coward, to suddenly explode.
The first person to react was the bar owner Kenny Burns, he pushed a fat man standing next to the bar and shouted: "What are you standing there for? Separate them!"
Apart from the mess on the ground, the beaten man's forehead was already oozing blood, there was a red circle there, which was the mark of the cup mouth. In addition, his left cheek was punched, as red as if he was drunk.
As for Don, apart from messing up his hair and clothes, nothing happened. He seemed to have vented his anger when he was pulled up, and he didn't have the posture to rush up and continue beating. He tidied up his clothes and hair, then spat at the unlucky ghost who was held by his companion: "I don't care who you are, don't mess with me."
Then he turned to Burns and said: "I'm sorry for messing up your place. Today is too ***..." He got angry when he thought about being teleported, "I will come to apologize in person another day, don't worry about the compensation."
Then, without waiting for the bar owner to respond, he turned and walked towards the door. As he passed the fat man, he mocked: "Keep your milk for yourself, fat pig."
Everyone watched him push the door and leave, but no one thought to stop him, just watched him leave, leaving a mess.
The bar was silent. At this time, the drunkard sat up from the table, looked at the silent room and the mess, and asked in a daze: "What did I miss?"
I don't want to be a foreigner! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Don shout like this?
Since his "past life" was quite bad, why not take this opportunity to have a different life? Although he has never been a football coach, he has watched football for more than ten years and played every generation of football manager games, so he knows something about the nature of a coach's work, isn't this a good opportunity for a challenge?
He no longer considers why God chose him, this boring question. Now he only needs to consider how to be more like a real professional coach, although it will be difficult, but it is worth trying.
"Hey, buddy. You broke into my house without my permission, I'll call the police if you don't leave in ten seconds!" A hoarse voice suddenly sounded next to him.
Don looked blankly at the old man standing opposite, who was holding a lot of newspapers and a half-eaten hamburger in his hand.
"This... is your home?" He pointed to the bench under his **.
"Of course."
"Ah, sorry, I disturbed you..." Don stood up from the chair, the other party immediately sat down, then lay down. He covered himself with the newspapers in his arms, and pressed them tightly between the chair back and his body.
Looking at the satisfied beggar eating a hamburger and lying in the "newspaper nest", Don even had to thank God for not letting him "possess" him. Fate was not bad to him.
A taxi dropped off a passenger in front of him, he walked up quickly and got in. Don looked at the beggar enjoying his "dinner" in the cold wind for the last time in the car, and asked the driver to take him back to that unfamiliar home.
From today, a whole new world slowly unfolded in front of Don. On a sunny Saturday morning, Zhao Yao was on his way to get his cat neutered.
In the cat bag he was carrying was a yellow tabby cat, also known as an orange cat, a type of domestic cat. Its head, back, and limbs were covered with layers of yellow and orange stripes.
Its chest and belly were a large patch of fluffy white fur, the tips of its limbs were white, it is said that this kind of snow-white gloves have a killing effect on girls, it can control their brain waves, making them make "ah~~ah~~" sounds.
Although it was a male cat, its eyes were big and it looked very feminine.
At this moment, the cat was making a heartbreaking howl. Most domestic cats are very, very homey, they only want to stay at home for their whole life, moving or going out is a very scary thing for them. Zhao Yao could only keep comforting the cat.
Meanwhile, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dark meteor slowly crossed the outer space, gradually flying towards China. The surface of the meteor was flickering with a strange luster, as if it was constantly releasing some kind of radiation to the surrounding void.
Inside the Star Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao put the cat bag on the front desk: "Male cat neutering, I made an appointment before, surname Zhao."
"Before looking at the records, you haven't been here before, you need to fill in the information column on the medical record card."
In outer space, a meteor slowly passed over the land of China, starting to move towards the Pacific Ocean. Wherever the meteor passed, many cats suddenly shivered, their eyes flashing with a deep luster, just like the luster emitted by the meteor.
At this moment, Matcha suddenly moved, struggling to jump up and dart towards the hospital's main entrance.
The nurse let out a scream, but Zhao Yao on the side suddenly sprang out and grabbed at the fleeing Matcha.
Zhao Yao was too slow and couldn't catch Matcha's body, he only caught Matcha's tail.
When its tail was caught, Matcha let out a roar, instinctively turned its head and bit at Zhao Yao. This is the instinct of felines, and its speed was incredibly fast. In an instant, it bit Zhao Yao's hand, causing him to feel pain and immediately let go.
Perhaps knowing that it had caused trouble, Matcha did not continue to run away, but curled up its body, looking at Zhao Yao somewhat uneasily.
Zhao Yao held Matcha and said, "Stupid cat, what are you biting, are you rebelling?"
The eyes of Matcha suddenly flashed a faint light, and the traces of blood on its teeth completely disappeared.
Zhao Yao also felt a sudden dizziness, then he wanted to see if the wound on the back of his hand was deep, but when he looked, he was slightly stunned. His hand was smooth and there was no wound or blood.
The nurse on the side took the cat and comforted it, "Good Matcha, it's okay, it will be fine in a while, don't be nervous."
The meow heard in Zhao Yao's ears, however, was not a simple meow, but had turned into understandable words.
Zhao Yao pointed at Matcha in front of him in shock, and said in surprise, "This...this...this cat can talk!"
The nurse looked at Zhao Yao in confusion and said, "Mr. Zhao, are you okay?"
"Didn't you hear it?" Zhao Yao hurriedly said, "It...it's talking."
The nurse frowned, looking at Zhao Yao with an increasingly strange gaze.
"Can you understand what I'm saying, meow?"
"Take me home!"
"Woof woof woof woof, I'm scared~meow."
Zhao Yao opened his mouth wide, looked at the nurse who was still comforting Matcha without any awareness, and then looked at Matcha and said, "Can you understand what I'm saying?"
"I can understand, I can understand, I want to go home, take me home, woof woof woof woof woof."
The nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao who was talking to the cat, her face becoming even more strange.
Ignoring the nurse's strange gaze, Zhao Yao quickly picked up Matcha and stuffed it back into the bag, and ran out of the hospital.
In the rental house, Matcha relaxed as soon as it returned to the familiar environment, lying on the coffee table and licking its white paws, squinting its eyes, looking very leisurely. For cats, licking fur is always a very suitable behavior for relaxation.
In front of the coffee table, Zhao Yao stared at Matcha, and tentatively said, "Can you still talk?"
Then he stood up, looking eager to try, "Does the master want to play a game?"
"Eh, this... let's play later." Zhao Yao scratched the back of his head, somewhat at a loss, "When did you learn to talk?"
Looking at the innocent face of Matcha, Zhao Yao had a strange expression.
But Matcha didn't seem to find the situation strange at all, suddenly jumped into Zhao Yao's arms, rubbed against Zhao Yao's body with its eyes closed, and said in a childish voice, "Play a game with me."
Looking at Matcha, who spoke like a five-year-old child, Zhao Yao touched its head, and the latter made a sound of enjoyment.
"Adding up, you're only one year old, now equivalent to a five-year-old human." Zhao Yao's mouth curled up in a slight smile, "Still a child, this seems not bad."
A month later, at nine o'clock in the evening.
Zhao Yao opened the door of the rental house with a tired face, casually took off his clothes, and collapsed on the sofa.
Although the rental house he lived in was only thirty square meters, it was fully furnished and was a newlywed couple's former house. Moreover, it was close to the company, so he didn't have to worry about commuting even when he worked overtime. So even though the rent was not cheap, Zhao Yao was still willing to pay.
After Zhao Yao lay down, Matcha unknowingly climbed next to him, rubbing his arm with its head, looking affectionate and flattering.
Zhao Yao smiled, rubbed Matcha's head, and the latter showed an expression of enjoyment.
But at this moment, the phone on the sofa was also pushed over by Matcha.
Chapter 1
Tang Mo'er was lying on the table, her delicate white arm cushioning her small head. Her long, black hair, smooth as satin, floated in mid-air, revealing half of her bright, youthful face. Hmm, it's hot, so hot.
What's going on?
A constant heat from within her body was burning her small face, making her uncomfortable. Today, she had come to the capital from Ye City and had just drunk a glass of boiled water handed to her by Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, her half-sister from the same mother.
"Something's wrong, Tang Mo'er has jumped down, go after her, don't let her escape!"
Tang Mo'er jolted awake, Han Xiaowan had set her up!
What should she do?
Tang Mo'er looked at the man, as if she had grabbed a lifeline, "Sir, save me, I've been drugged, and there are a few men behind me who want to rape me."
The man's deep, cold eyes glanced over the girl at the men behind her. His gaze was indifferent, but it sent chills down one's spine.
Those men were small-time thugs, they had seen some things. They had seen this man who dominated the headlines of financial magazines and controlled the economic lifeline of the capital on TV.
Gu Mo Han.
This was a man they absolutely couldn't afford to offend, so they turned and ran. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, a shocking battle was taking place. Angels with wings burning with flames, knights clad in heavy armor, crusaders wielding golden long swords, were fighting against an evil army composed of bone dragons enveloped in black smoke, terrifying death knights, and countless skeleton soldiers.
The battlefield of the two sides was not a plain filled with war and gunpowder smoke or a burial ground full of bones, but a pitch-black darkness where the edge could not be seen. This was undoubtedly a very strange imagination.
But what was even stranger was that outside this battlefield, in the void shrouded in endless darkness, one could hear a few faint voices whispering?
"Operate it, hurry up and operate it! Oh my God!"
"When you're talking about others, you should control your death knight first! The death knight is fighting with the mobile fortress!"
"Where are my troops? Who is attacking my troops? Where is the enemy?"
After the battle, the angels, knights, and scattered skeleton soldiers that had originally existed on the battlefield also disappeared into the darkness of the background. Here once again returned to the absolute silence shrouded in endless darkness, as if nothing had ever happened.
But a few voices were still exchanging something, and even more other voices joined in.
"My teammates are just a bunch of pigs! Even a tied dog is better than them! Not only do they not help the battle situation at all, but they also want to grab the command of the core troops..." The voice of the previous failure said somewhat unwillingly.
"Pah! It's clearly because the undead creatures are too weak. If it were my demon army, it would definitely be different..." Another voice also fought back without showing weakness, and made such a forced explanation for his wrong command: "I originally thought that the death knight could easily solve those fortresses."
Upon hearing this voice, a few soft laughs couldn't help but come from the darkness, and the arguing parties suddenly lost their temper and said helplessly to the victorious side: "We admit defeat."
And the winning side actually made a round of ungentlemanly mockery at this time?
"Haha! Justice will eventually defeat evil!"
"In front of our strength, whether it's the undead or the devil, even God will kill you!"
Such words undoubtedly make people even more angry. The two sides, which had already calmed down, suddenly started a new round of verbal fights. The third person on the winning side who was outside this new battlefield asked somewhat helplessly: "Should I not have organized this game?"
So the previous fierce and heroic battle was just a game?
A voice that did not participate in this game responded: "Being able to simulate a realistic war with consciousness, making us bystanders feel as if we are on the scene, is really amazing. You are really good at bringing us surprises, Hope."
And this guy called Hope, in the face of the other party's sudden thanks, modestly replied: "You flatter me, this is just a pastime."
Yes, that battle that seemed like a life-and-death duel between the forces of good and evil was just a pastime, only adding a little bit of fun in this endless prison.
This is the void realm outside the real plane, it should be a place of eternal darkness, cold, silence, where no living beings can survive, a realm more terrifying than death.
However, in such a place, this land that can hardly accommodate any living beings, a group of creatures that are difficult to define are stubbornly surviving. They have lost their bodies and only their last consciousness remains in this void.
They call themselves Void Walkers, forever imprisoned in this prison called the Void.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were all top-notch experts in various races and fields. They were mages who had reached the pinnacle of the magic path, warriors who had touched the limit of the martial path, alchemists who created everything, devout missionaries, demons who ruled hell, liches who controlled souls, etc. They had all left their names in the history of various planes.
Many people thought they had long since perished, and only those historical records proved that they had once existed, but they did not know that this group of old monsters, who were strong enough to be described as perverted, were actually imprisoned in the endless void outside the plane. They had spent countless years there and seemed to be forever imprisoned there. The thin barrier between the real plane and the void, which seemed thin, was the wall of sighs that they could never break through, even though the power they once had was so strong, they were helpless.
But they never gave up the hope of escaping. Because among these 33 Void Walkers, there is a very special existence, that is, the fifth walker codenamed Hope.
Hope's real name is Bai Yi, and he does not come from the large and small planes outside the void where humans live, but from a strange place called Earth. He used to be an editor of a small news website. His daily work was to copy news from other websites at home and abroad, and then publish it on his own website with a title such as "Explosion!
Men can cry, women can be silent and so on, a noisy and boring job.
Later, due to an accident, Bai Yi, who was between life and death, did not immediately lose consciousness, but entered this mysterious void by chance, met several other Void Walkers, and finally survived stubbornly until this moment.
The Void Walkers insisted that he, who came from a different world, would be the key to escaping this endless prison. "Only you are different. If you want to leave here, you are our only chance. I firmly believe this, so I use the codename Hope to call you." The first Void Walker, codenamed Magician, once said to him.
They have always believed in this, believing that they will be able to see the light of day one day, even though they have been imprisoned for countless times. Hundreds of years? Thousands of years?
To persist in this eternal prison for thousands of years without going mad, it is obviously not enough to rely on chatting or discussing. In fact, the main way for Void Walkers to pass the time is an activity called Memory Sharing.
This activity is based on a consciousness technique called Memory Retrospection, which allows one to recall every detail they have experienced, even every punctuation mark on a newspaper can be clearly remembered.
Then, through a certain degree of editing, some memories that one does not want others to see, such as sleeping with a woman or with one's own hands, are removed, and the memories are exchanged with the other party. This is equivalent to watching a super-long movie about someone else's life, which is a great way to pass the time.
The memories of thirty-three void walkers equate to him experiencing thirty-three lifetimes. Even though he later forgot most of his memories to avoid confusion, retaining only their knowledge and experience, his mindset also matured and became steady through these thirty-three lifetimes, shedding weaknesses such as immaturity and impetuosity, and he was no longer an ordinary person on Earth.
Therefore, he was highly regarded by other void walkers. However, countless years have passed, and even he could not find any opportunity to break away. The only thing he could do was to make this dull and boring time a little less boring.
Meanwhile, the reality plane of Ister is about to welcome the arrival of nightfall. When the afterglow of the setting sun covers the entire Xiansei Academy, the students finally finish their heavy coursework for the day. Accompanied by young and energetic laughter, they stroll in pairs along the tree-lined paths in the academy.
Mia, a second-year student in the Soul Armor department, is one of them. She has a cute and charming face, her black hair is tied into two equally cute ponytails, and she is wearing the standard uniform of Xiansei Academy. After saying goodbye to her classmates, she comes to the academy's square alone, finds a bench to sit down, and takes out some leftover bread from her dinner from her jacket pocket. She carefully tears the bread into tiny crumbs and sprinkles them on the bluestone floor of the square.
A moment later, the sound of wings flapping comes from the air, and several pigeons quickly land at Mia's feet. They peck at the breadcrumbs she sprinkled while cooing. Mia carefully squats down, her long ponytails gently sweeping the ground as she moves. She quietly watches this group of pigeons that she is already familiar with, a satisfied smile on her face.
The beautiful girl, the gentle pigeons, the square with several standing statues, along with the lush vegetation around, under the last golden light of the setting sun, together form a beautiful picture.
This is something Mia does every day, and it is also the most relaxing moment of her day. As a student of average aptitude, life in Xiansei Academy, a higher education institution, is always particularly hard.
"It's getting dark, let's call it a day. I have to go back and practice. Goodbye, Mr. Pigeons." Mia's face maintains a relaxed smile as she says goodbye to the pigeons, then she steps up, her slender legs wrapped in white stockings under her short uniform skirt, and hurries back to her dormitory.
The evening is also an important study time, especially for students like Mia with average talent. The effort required is not as easy as the smile that seems to always be on her face.
1. Chapter 1
In the Su family mansion, a martial soul awakening ceremony is taking place in the huge martial arts field.
The young man on the altar is named Su Yu, the son of the eldest elder of the Su family, with extraordinary talent.
Su Mo, the son of the Su family's head, Su Hong, completed the nine-fold body tempering at the age of fourteen and is known as the first genius of the Su family.
Now that a genius like Su Yu has appeared, the martial soul awakened by Su Mo, with his talent, will certainly not be inferior to Su Yu.
If Su Mo can also awaken a martial soul above the fifth rank of the human level, then the Su family can produce two top geniuses this time, which will greatly contribute to the future development of their Su family.
When the presiding elder shouted out this name, all the shocked disciples, elders and others looked at the handsome young man next to them, their eyes full of expectation, even surpassing the previous Su Yu.
Su Mo's face was calm, and he stepped up to the altar.
Su Yu, who stepped down from the altar, had a proud face and gave Su Mo a cold smile, his eyes full of provocation.
Su Mo ignored him, took a deep breath, sat cross-legged, and closed his eyes.
From the bottom of the altar, a series of symbol lights immediately floated out and continuously drilled into Su Mo's body.
His talent is top-notch in the Su family. He completed body tempering at the age of fifteen, and his talent is not bad. However, he has always been suppressed by Su Mo.
At this time, more and more runes flickered on the altar, wrapping Su Mo's body.
Su Mo, who was sitting cross-legged with his eyes closed, breathed slightly faster, and from his body, the sound of rumbling gradually rose.
Everyone stopped breathing and stared at the altar!
Boom!
Finally, with a loud noise, a pitch-black phantom suddenly rose up, the black phantom was like a black hole, slowly rotating inside, bottomless, giving people a sense of coldness.
At the same time, a yellow halo flickered above the phantom.
Ah!
In an instant, everyone in the field was stunned.
A halo?
The lowest level martial soul?
How is this possible?
Even Su Yu was stunned, completely astonished.
Because he couldn't think of it, the first genius of the Su family actually only awakened the first-order martial soul of the human level, the lowest level martial soul!
Su Mo sat on the altar, slowly opened his eyes, and was also stunned when he saw his martial soul.
"A first-order martial soul of the human level..." Su Mo murmured to himself, with a bitter smile at the corner of his mouth. He never thought that he would awaken the lowest-level martial soul!
"The worst martial soul?" "Actually awakened a waste martial soul!
"What first genius, he is simply the first waste of my Su family."
For a while, including the elders and deacons of the Su family, everyone's eyes changed when they looked at Su Mo, with disappointment, disdain, and contempt.
On the altar, Su Mo slowly got up, his fists unconsciously clenched.
With a cold glance around, Su Mo sneered in his heart: "These people are really snobbish!"
In the past, Su Mo was extraordinarily talented, and everyone was polite to him, and wherever he went, he was surrounded by people, and flattery was heard.
Now, he has awakened the garbage martial soul, and these people immediately changed their faces.
Su Mo shook his head, did not argue with them, walked down the altar and left in large strides.
His face was a bit itchy, and it seemed to be a bush around him.
"Didn't I die in a car accident? How did I come back to life?"
He was a little surprised, but before he could figure out how he had escaped from death, the scene in front of him made him immediately excited and stared. Then he was dumbfounded!
No way! Such a beautiful girl, how can she relieve herself anywhere?
Xu Que's eyes widened. He just watched the beautiful girl completely lift her skirt in front of him, and the underwear inside was also taken off little by little. What caught his eye was a piece of tender white, with a unique body fragrance of a woman.
"Miss, what are you doing, you can't urinate anywhere!"
The scene suddenly froze. She let out a scream, panicked and put down her skirt, the whole person bounced up from the spot, stepping on a sharp sword and flying away.
Damn, what is this? Flying with a sword?
It turns out that she is really a fairy!
Xu Que was taken aback, and at the same time, a large section of unfamiliar but familiar memories suddenly surged in his mind, as if he had experienced it since birth.
I fucking crossed!
Immediately reading the memory in his mind that did not belong to him, Xu Que sorted out everything.
This is actually a world of cultivation, just like the little fairy who is angry and flying with a sword in front of him, people can practice various methods to become immortals.
And the owner of his body turned out to be the current prince, but this prince is a complete unlucky egg.
He was just a poor orphan, but he had a unique spiritual root that was rare in a thousand years.
When he was young, he was favored by the emperor and became a prince. He was provided with countless heavenly materials and earth treasures for his cultivation. In just six years, he condensed his belly pill and entered the Golden Pill period.
On the day he entered the Golden Pill period, he truly entered the bridal chamber with the princess, so he spent seven days and nights on the wedding bed. As a result, the enchanting princess like a fox charm actually took all his cultivation and even took away his spiritual root talent.
The genius prince just got married and became a waste. He, who has no value for use, was sent out of the palace quietly overnight, and was killed by the emperor's arranged person on the way to exile to the frontier. He died of anger and was finally abandoned here.
"Alas, it's a pity!"
After sorting out these memories, Xu Que's face was full of regret, he shook his head and sighed, and said annoyedly: "Damn! Why didn't I come earlier and cross to the happy time when I was crazy in bed with the beautiful princess?"
Thinking of the enchanting charm of the beautiful princess on the wedding bed, the proud figure, and the various panting, Xu Que felt more and more regretful, and he was one step late!
"Bold lewd thief, dare to peep at this lady's toilet, give me your life!"
At this time, a scolding sound suddenly came, but it was the fairy who had returned.
Her face was red with shame and anger, but her eyes were full of endless killing intent. She was still stepping on the sharp sword with cold light under her feet, and she killed Xu Que.
"Damn, fairy, this is definitely a misunderstanding! It's clearly you squatting on the place where I was lying, and... even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, can you please pull up your pants first? This way, I have very little motivation to run away!" Xu Que shouted and ran away.
The woman's face changed suddenly, her face flushed red, she lifted her underwear under her skirt, spat, and scolded: "The lewd thief is looking for death." The speed of the sword flying under her feet suddenly increased, and she killed Xu Que.
While running wildly, Xu Que was thinking frantically about how to escape.
Suddenly, a flash of inspiration flashed in his mind.
Immediately stopped, took out a familiar token from his arms, turned around and shouted at the woman: "Bold demon girl, I am the current prince of the Fire Yuan Kingdom, dare you disrespect me? Be careful I will kill your nine clans!"
Just at this moment, a series of system prompt sounds suddenly rang in Xu Que's head.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for activating the system of showing off and slapping faces, this system will protect you and help you show off and fly!"
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully showing off, reward 1 point of showing off value, do you want to enter the mall to exchange?"
"The system detects that the host 'Xu Que' has low abilities and is difficult to survive under the difficulty of this world, so it rewards a novice gift package, do you want to check the gift?"
At the same time as the prompt sound, a light screen window popped up in front of him, displaying several pieces of information data.
Xu Que first took a deep breath, followed by uncontrollable laughter. What kind of system is this for showing off and slapping faces, it's tailor-made for me, helping me break through the sky! Now I have something to play with.
"Rascal, you're about to die, what's so funny?"
Suddenly, a soft scolding pulled Xu Que back from his ecstasy.
The woman had somehow already stood in front of him about ten meters away, holding a flying sword pointing at him, her big watery eyes staring at him suspiciously.
"Come on... you want to fight me, don't you? Dare you to take one step closer to me?"
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully showing off, reward 1 point of showing off value."
Sure enough, the system prompt sound that only Xu Que could hear rang again in his ear, and he couldn't help but laugh again. "Right, there seems to be a gift package."
Suddenly, the picture on the light screen window changed, and a square gift box appeared. The gift box was opened, and several rays of light jumped out and disappeared in a flash.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining the beginner experience pill, which can be used to gain ten thousand experience points."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining two beginner teleportation talismans, which can be used to instantly move to any place within a radius of five kilometers."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining the beginner 'Ancient Five Elements Jue' (Note: The beginner chapter can only be practiced to the foundation building period, and the subsequent chapters can be exchanged in the mall)."
"Ding, the system detects that the host 'Xu Que' has incomplete spiritual roots and does not meet the cultivation conditions. The system will complete all spiritual roots for you."
Immediately, Xu Que felt as if his body was pierced by a current, and his scalp went numb instantly.
But what followed was a sense of comfort, as if all the pores of his body were completely opened, greedily absorbing the spiritual energy from all directions.
Boom!
Soon, he felt a drastic change in his body, becoming more in tune with nature, as if he could merge into everything and control everything.
But he knew very well how familiar this feeling was. When his heavenly fire spiritual root had not been taken away by the princess, he had such a close feeling towards the flame. Now the system not only repaired his heavenly fire spiritual root, but also completed the other attribute spiritual roots.
Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, all five spiritual roots are complete at once, and each one is the top-notch "heaven" level.
My goodness, this is going against the heavens!
Thinking of this, Xu Que couldn't help but shout: "With the system in hand, I have the world. What the hell is the princess and emperor of the Fire Yuan Kingdom? When I, Xu Que, return after leveling up, I will step on all of you, crushing you to pieces."
"How dare you, rascal, since you claim to be the son-in-law of the Fire Yuan Kingdom, you dare to speak wildly, intending to kill the king?" The woman next to him was a bit dumbfounded, had this son-in-law gone mad?
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully showing off, reward 1 point of showing off value."
Only then did Xu Que come to his senses, his mouth twitched slightly, damn it, he was so busy showing off and looking forward to the future that he almost forgot about the trouble at hand, he had to think of a way to run away quickly.
"Right, the experience pill!"
He suddenly remembered that there was a beginner experience pill in the novice gift package.
Without any hesitation, he quickly operated the system interface with his mind, opened a package, and three items appeared in it.
"Use, use." Xu Que stared at two of the items, shouting in his heart.
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully cultivating the 'Ancient Five Elements Jue'."
"Ding, the host 'Xu Que' has taken the beginner experience pill and gained ten thousand experience points."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for leveling up, current realm is Qi Refining Stage Level 1."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for leveling up, current realm is Qi Refining Stage Level 3."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for leveling up, current realm is Qi Refining Stage Level 10."
In just a few breaths, Xu Que went from being a powerless mortal to a cultivator, directly rushing to the tenth level of the Qi Refining Stage, just one step away from the Foundation Building Stage.
And his current strength is even stronger than the normal tenth level of the Qi Refining Stage.
The reason is that he now has five heavenly spiritual roots, which is equivalent to a person having five times the strength of ordinary people.
Even under the mutual generation and restraint attributes of these five different spiritual energies, the power that bursts out is far more than just five times.
"Now I really have nothing to say, if I'm not invincible, who is?"
Xu Que couldn't help but get excited. But at this moment, the woman across from him waved a ray of light, cutting through the sky, and the sharp sword blade came over like a poisonous snake in the blink of an eye.
"Damn, fairy, I just called you this little beauty to come forward and let this son-in-law take a good look, who told you to draw your sword? You're ambushing me!"
Seeing the flying sword coming, Xu Que was immediately scared and started cursing.
But despite the cursing, his footwork was not sloppy at all, he slid back smoothly, and a strand of water elemental spiritual energy condensed at his fingertips, lightly flicking the incoming sword blade.
"Dang!"
With a crisp sound, the sharp sword was flicked away by him.
"This... how is this possible?"
The woman was stunned. In the sect, those who could easily break this sword, apart from those uncles with profound cultivation, at least those senior brothers and sisters at the sixth level of the Foundation Building Stage could do it!
"I'm just wondering, I've already said that what happened just now was a misunderstanding, but you're still clinging to it, even wanting to kill me? Don't think that just because you look like a fairy I won't hit you, anyway, I didn't see clearly just now, this time I'll take a good look."
Xu Que said angrily, stepping out, the earth elemental spiritual energy immediately merged into the ground, his speed suddenly increased, and in the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of the woman.
Following that, a strand of water elemental spiritual energy surged out of his palm, surrounding the four directions, and the woman was restrained on the spot before she could react.
"Ras... rascal, what do you want to do?" The woman was greatly frightened, feeling that the fire elemental spiritual energy in her body was completely suppressed.
"Hehe! Since you've already called me a rascal, then I can't carry this pot for nothing."
Xu Que had a wicked smile on his face, raised his eyebrows, and reached out to lift the woman's skirt.
Chapter One: If there is a next life, I will dance with you under the heavens!
Nine Heavens, amidst the sea of clouds, the Wind Thunder Platform, a line of sky!
Here, is the Nine Heavens Continent, the upper three heavens, a place of absolute danger, the Wind Thunder Platform! It can connect with the wind and thunder, and enter and exit the line of sky!
But at this moment, the Wind Thunder Platform is filled with a bloody wind and a miserable fog!
"Chu Yang, hand over the Nine Tribulations Sword! Spare your life!"
"Chu Yang, the Nine Tribulations Sword, the first divine object in the world, is a waste in your hands. For so many years, you have made no progress, it is simply a waste of heaven's resources! Just hand it over.
A wave of noisy shouts came from all directions.
The look in his eyes, still as calm and steady as a rock! - His body, still as straight as a spear!
Just like the sword in his hand, full of the meaning of unbending! Even though he has already suffered a fatal injury!
Under his feet, within a radius of hundreds of feet, there are countless broken limbs and bodies, and blood is flowing.
Looking at the crowd of experts around him who were shouting but not rushing over, Chu Yang showed a mocking smile on his face, arrogant and disdainful!
Such people, such temperament, no matter how high their cultivation, no matter how many people; even if they can kill me ten thousand times, they are not worthy to be my enemy!
How could the matter of the Nine Tribulations Sword in his own hands leak out? He had clearly investigated for three years before confirming that there was a piece of the Nine Tribulations Sword in the Wind Thunder Platform of the upper three heavens. He had gone through a lot of hardships and finally found an opportunity to risk his life to come to the upper three heavens. But why did he encounter such a huge ambush after he arrived here?
Today, he entered the upper three heavens, and it was only the fifth day! Today's situation is purely a dead end! He has always been known for his mysterious movements, who knows his plan?
He has charged more than a dozen times in a row, each time, he was blocked back! And the places he chose were all dead ends!
Extreme in emotion, extreme in sword! He extinguished his emotions and entered the sword, entered the martial arts with the sword, sought the heavenly way with the martial arts, paid the price of lifelong loneliness, and used the killing all over the world as a raft to cross the world, but unfortunately he still could not practice the Nine Tribulations Sword, and practice the Nine Heavens Divine Skill!
Is it his choice that is wrong? Or is this path fundamentally wrong?
A heartless swordsman is a heartless swordsman. If a swordsman has feelings, what kind of swordsman is he? The way of the sword, the way of martial arts, and the way of heaven are all heartless... But why is he so shaken at the moment of life and death?
Nine Tribulations Sword, Nine Tribulations Sword, what is your secret?
Looking at the greedy eyes around him staring at the Nine Tribulations Sword, Chu Yang gave a bitter smile in his heart. You only know that getting this Nine Tribulations Sword can make you invincible in the world, but do you know how much I have paid for this Nine Tribulations Sword?
There's nothing left.
Blood is flowing, Chu Yang clearly senses his life is quickly passing away, he has pursued martial arts all his life, entered emotion, broke emotion, exited emotion to become emotionless, and extinguished emotion. At the moment of death, he thought his only regret should be that he did not reach the highest realm he pursued in his lifetime during his lifetime. But what he didn't expect was that at this moment, a figure he thought he had long forgotten suddenly appeared in his mind.
Mo Qingwu, the woman Chu Yang entered and broke emotion for!
"So, I haven't really broken my emotions..." Chu Yang showed a self-deprecating smile at the corner of his mouth and muttered to himself.
A trace of regret quietly spread in his heart, like smoke, sweeping his entire soul in an instant.
Qingwu! I don't know if I can meet you when I go to the underworld this time?
"Let's go together! Just chop him off! As for the Nine Tribulations Sword, we can discuss it slowly!" Someone shouted loudly: "Otherwise, when he recovers a bit, it will be our turn to have a hard time!" The crowd around him agreed loudly, and immediately raised their swords and surrounded Chu Yang.
"One life does not dance lightly, one dance is a lifetime of bitterness; this life dances for you, even if it is bitter, dance a lifetime!"
This is a small poem written by Mo Qingwu on the night of their commitment. I still remember, at that time, Mo Qingwu's eyes were tearful, her gaze was lost and resentful, she... knew early on that I was using her feelings to practice, but she still threw herself into my arms like a moth to a flame, allowing me to burn freely!
After hearing the news, I rushed over immediately, but it was still a step too late. Although I later killed all the people of the world family who hurt Mo Qingwu, not even sparing their nine clans and not leaving a chicken or dog, but the beauty could not be resurrected!
That peerless beauty, on the verge of death, gently lay in my arms and said to me: "Chu Yang, if there is a next life... if I can meet you again, I hope you can... look at me properly. I am better looking than a sword!"
Qingwu, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, why would there be tears in the corner of your eyes?
Two clear tears shattered my heart at that moment! From then on, this heart is sealed!
Life and death follow each other to the nine heavens!
This is a poem written by the world's number one scholar, Xue Lei Han, inspired by Mo Qingwu's deep affection for Chu Yang.
And now, Qingwu, you have reached the nine heavens, but I am still in the world... But, I can be with you in life and death immediately... life after life!
Chu Yang was lost in thought, and a gentle and sad smile appeared on his usually hard mouth.
Qingwu, wait for me!
Qingwu, do you know, if there is a next life, I would rather not practice any swordsmanship, I would rather not have any peak, I would rather not take revenge, I just want to be with you! In this world, what can be worth your satisfied smile?
No! Not bitter... Qingwu, you are bitter, but you don't feel bitter, now... I am very bitter!
More and more swords and blades were added to his body, blood was flying, and pain was gathering from all over his body, finally interrupting the song and dance in his mind!
Chu Yang roared in rage! Suddenly stood up, his black hair flying wildly!
Chu Yang felt a pain in his heart, looked down, and the jade pendant hanging around his neck shattered in front of his eyes with a snap. His eyes were about to split in an instant!
This is the only memento Qingwu left for him!
"Kill!" Chu Yang suddenly raised his head, his eyes filled with murderous intent, and with a loud shout, the Nine Tribulations Sword in his hand suddenly stirred up thousands of sword lights, like a belt of light formed by lightning from the nine heavens!
With a series of bangs, all the weapons surrounding him were neatly cut off a section!
Everyone hurriedly retreated, looking at the neat circle of half-cut weapons under Chu Yang's feet with horror, and cold sweat flowed down their backs. They didn't expect the power of a single strike from the Nine Tribulations Sword to be so terrifying!
Chu Yang looked around and suddenly asked softly, "Do you want the Nine Tribulations Sword?"
Without waiting for anyone to answer, he laughed coldly and slowly said, "Good! I will let you see the Nine Tribulations Sword!"
He suddenly leaped up! He had already suffered countless fatal injuries, but he leaped up!
"Nine Tribulations Sword, a point of cold light, ten thousand feet of light!"
With the arc shooting out, millions of cold lights surged out!
Nine Heavens Sword Technique! One sword!
Nine Heavens, is the name of this continent. All the sword techniques in history have never dared to use these three words as their name, but this Nine Tribulations Sword Technique directly uses the name "Nine Heavens"!
Throughout the ages, only this set!
Although Chu Yang could not exert the true power of the Nine Tribulations Sword Technique, he had understood these few swords for a long time. The power of these few swords, although not as great as imagined, is far superior to worldly sword techniques.
The dozens of experts around him knew that this sword was extraordinary, and they all brought out their bottom-line skills to resist this attack! Everyone's body was shaking, feeling that the weapon in their hands was about to become unstable.
"Nine Tribulations Sword, what's wrong with slaughtering the world!"
Before the first move was finished, the second move had already arrived with a murderous aura! The surging light, like the tide of the sea, burst out with boundless killing intent!
Screams rang out, more than a dozen experts, each capable of dominating a region, tried their best to resist, but still ended up bloodied and retreating in disarray!
At this moment, everyone had an illusion: Chu Yang now, was definitely not injured! He was in perfect condition!
What they didn't know was that they had interrupted Chu Yang's memories, interrupted Mo Qingwu's dance, causing Chu Yang to be completely furious, fully unleashing all the potential of his body! This was the power of life, the rage of the soul!
"Nine Tribulations Sword, gather the wind and clouds to become the emperor!"
Chu Yang suddenly opened his eyes and roared, "Why? Why is there none?"
In the distance, three directions, three kinds of light rose at the same time, transforming into three golden shadows in the air! They were dazzling, with an unruly arrogance.
He was just a Martial Venerable, although only one level away from the King level, this one level was as different as heaven and earth!
Three King level! What a big move!
"But this Upper Three Heavens is not a place where you, a mere Poison Sword Martial Venerable, can run wild!" One person said slowly, "It's a pity that I can't fight you fairly, what a pity!"
As the voice fell, the other two appeared. The three of them, all in wide robes and large sleeves, came riding the wind. They were graceful and composed.
Chu Yang's eyes were somewhat blurred: "You three kings... also want the Nine Tribulations Sword?"
"We want you dead!" The three smiled at the same time, with a dignified demeanor: "But taking over the Nine Tribulations Sword is also an unexpected gain. A big gain!"
Chu Yang sneered coldly, straightened his back, and said proudly: "It's a pity you don't understand the Nine Tribulations Sword! You will never get it!" His eyes became resolute and determined!
He was now too weak to fight!
This was the only sword he could wield with full power. When he first saw the sword technique, he knew he could use this sword. But such a sword required his own life to drive!
It was the Nine Tribulations Sword Spirit killing autonomously, destroying everything!
The three kings, almost too late to defend, even too late to scream, turned into ashes! Even their king-level power transformed into golden shadows still flickered in the air, but their lives had already turned into nothingness!
Chu Yang sighed, floating in mid-air, his eyes casually glanced, but he found a person he thought should not appear here. In the distance, a man in white was staring at this side, his face full of disbelief.
"Heavenly Secret?" Chu Yang's eyes narrowed, finally understanding. Why his secret operation was ambushed, why all his attacks were accurately blocked!
It was him, the godly calculator Mo Tianji. No wonder he was defeated so thoroughly!
Chu Yang's body slowly fell from the air, slowly fell down, like a withered leaf in late autumn, falling in the dust, his face with a faint but warm smile, murmuring: "Qingwu, if there is a next life, I will dance with you under the sky!"
Since death was inevitable, he would embrace death with the greatest passion and the strongest longing! Because there, was his lover!
Chapter 2
Meng Qi's secret delight was interrupted, his pride turned into embarrassment, and the gazes from the novice monks like Zhen De were both surprised and contemptuous, much like elementary school students wanting to distance themselves from a bad classmate. Only Zhen Hui, "Fang A Qi", was staring blankly at the golden Buddha statue in front of him, as if his mind was wandering in the heavens.
Subconsciously, Meng Qi half-turned his head to look at Xuan Zang next to him. Would he have noticed anything?
For him, embarrassment and frustration were minor issues. The real problem was if his secret of reincarnation was exposed!
Xuan Zang still had a bitter expression on his face, his eyes filled with despair. After feeling Meng Qi's gaze, he gently shook his head: "Namo Amitabha, everything will be decided according to Xuan Ku's decision." He didn't hint, he said it directly.
Ah, he thought I was pleading with him... Meng Qi secretly breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that he had passed this hurdle. Unless the parents of this body, or the horse-faced uncle and others came looking for him, he should not be exposed. If another ten or eight years passed, no one would suspect him, as childhood memories are easily forgotten.
Compared to this, being sent to the Servant's Court was a minor matter!
Meng Qi, who had accidentally hit the mark, tried hard to make his expression as dull as Zhen Hui's, so as not to let Xuan Zang see through his lack of despair and sadness.
After Xuan Ku, with his broad face and large ears, had asked all the remaining children, Meng Qi and Zhen Hui were among the six who were sent to the Servant's Court, while the rest were assigned to the Martial Monk's Court.
He gently tapped his left palm with the ruler in his right hand: "Follow me to the Servant's Court for tonsure and to receive your monk's robes and scriptures. In the future, work hard and there will be opportunities to enter the Bodhi and Dharma Courts to study advanced scriptures and martial arts."
There's Dharma here too?
Meng Qi was stunned for a moment, but Xuan Ku didn't give him time to think, he directly walked through the children and headed outside the hall.
Surrounded by strangers, Meng Qi didn't dare to ask more questions. He followed closely behind the two yellow-robed monks, Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang, and turned into a nearby courtyard.
"You are not officially initiated, you just need to worship the Buddha and have your heads shaved." Xuan Ku pointed to the futon in the small Buddha hall.
"Yes, Uncle Xuan Ku." The children all responded with Zhen De, then one by one they knelt on the futon and kowtowed to the golden Buddha statue above.
When all the children had worshipped the Buddha, Xuan Ku put his hands together and respectfully saluted the Buddha statue, chanting "Namo Amitabha". Then, he walked to a child and gently touched his head with his right hand.
The child's black hair instantly changed, turning yellow at a speed visible to Meng Qi's naked eye, and fell to the ground like leaves. In less than two breaths, the child had become a real novice monk.
"Let go of your troubles, stay away from the mundane world." Xuan Ku solemnly said, his deep voice echoing in the quiet Buddha hall.
"What kind of martial arts is this? It's amazing!"
Meng Qi was both shocked and excited. Would he have a chance to learn such martial arts in the future?
Xuan Ku went to each child in turn, removing their hair, always saying the same words.
When it was Meng Qi's turn, he lowered his head, silently chanting the names of the Buddha and the Taoist ancestors, mourning for his soon-to-be-lost hair.
The thick and wide palm gently touched Meng Qi's head, and strands of dry hair fell in front of him, which made him feel sad and almost uncontrollable. He loved the mundane world and had never thought of becoming a monk.
"Let go of your troubles, stay away from the mundane world."
Xuan Ku's voice was like a suddenly struck bell, shaking Meng Qi all over, purifying his mind.
But after Xuan Ku left and the purity disappeared, Meng Qi's belief remained firm, he must return to secular life in the future!
After worshipping the Buddha, having their heads shaved, and leaving their names on the monk's disc, Xuan Ku asked a few grey-robed monks to take these children to the backyard to collect their belongings - two sets of grey monk's robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, "Shaolin Precepts", "Morning Class Twelve Small Spells", etc.
"Once you have learned to read in the 'Scripture Lecture Court', you can recite the precepts and morning class spells of this temple. Before that, let me briefly explain the main precepts of this temple. First, do not deceive the master and destroy the ancestors. Second, do not allow, cannot steal martial arts. Third, do not kill. Fourth, do not drink alcohol. Fifth, abstain from meat and spicy food. Sixth, do not break the precept of lust..." Xuan Ku repeated the main precepts that needed to be observed several times, and finally said seriously: "Those who violate them will be lightly scolded, and those who are serious will have their martial arts abolished and be expelled from this temple."
He only mentioned two of the punishments, the lightest and the heaviest, and there were also punishments such as hard labor, copying scriptures, corporal punishment, and facing the wall.
After explaining these things, he and Xuan Zang left the "Servant's Court" with these novice monks.
"Within this temple, those who wear grey robes are ordinary monks, those who wear yellow robes are the monks in charge of each court, and those who wear yellow robes and red kasaya are the abbots, the heads of each court and the elders..." Along the way, Xuan Ku tirelessly instilled "temple knowledge" into the novice monks, until Zhen De and others entered the "Martial Monk's Court", he became silent again.
The group walked further and further away, with green trees covering both inside and outside the yellow wall, few Buddha halls were seen. After a while, Meng Qi saw an old and mottled courtyard.
"Oh, Xuan Ku, Xuan Zang, you guys are here so early?" A fat monk greeted them with a smile at the door. He was also wearing a yellow robe, but his collar was open and his belly was protruding.
Xuan Ku frowned, and solemnly put his hands together: "Namo Amitabha, Brother Xuan Xin, how can you be so lazy?"
The fat monk Xuan Xin was used to Xuan Ku's temper, and he didn't get angry at all: "Oh, you are too obsessed with appearances. Are these for our Servant's Court?" He didn't want to argue with Xuan Ku on this issue, and directly pointed to Meng Qi and others.
"Please arrange it, Brother Xuan Xin." Xuan Ku answered seriously.
At this time, Xuan Zang, who had been silent, suddenly spoke: "Are Zhen Ying and Zhen Guan still in the Servant's Court?"
"They are, they are!" The fat monk Xuan Xin said in confusion: "Brother Xuan Zang, why are you asking about them? Do you intend to take them as disciples?"
Xuan Zang shook his head and sighed: "My martial arts have been destroyed, I can't mislead others, how dare I take disciples? Brother Xuan Xin, please let them share a room with Zhen Ying and Zhen Guan."
He was referring to Meng Qi and Zhen Hui.
Meng Qi's heart pounded, this was the first time Xuan Zang had arranged something for him. Could it be that the two monks, Zhen Ying and Zhen Guan, had something special that could help him?
"Haha, Brother Xuan Zang, how dare I take the word 'trouble' for what you ordered? This is a small matter, why bother?" Xuan Xin agreed immediately.
Xuan Ku glanced at Xuan Zang and didn't say much. Instead, he seriously said to Meng Qi, Zhen Hui and other novice monks: "I arranged for you to be in the Servant's Court because each of you has problems. If you can solve them yourself and polish your mind, there may be opportunities to enter the Martial Monk's Court, Dharma Court, and even the Bodhi Court in the future."
"But if you continue to be deceitful, lazy, playful, impetuous, and can't bear hardship, I won't hide it, I will report to the Precept Court and give you appropriate punishment."
He openly stated his thoughts, showing his integrity, without any selfishness, which made Xuan Xin's face turn slightly red.
"Yes, Uncle Xuan Ku." Meng Qi and other novice monks answered in unison.
After watching Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang leave, Xuan Xin twisted his body, making his fat shake up and down: "Finally they left, I'm most afraid of seeing this iron-faced ghost."
This monk... Meng Qi pretended not to look around, following the swaying Xuan Xin into the Zen room.
"Zhen Ying, Zhen Guan, this is your junior brother Zhen Ding, Zhen Hui." After Xuan Xin pointed at Meng Qi and Zhen Hui, he turned around and led the other young monks to another Zen room.
Inside the Zen room, there was a large bed that could accommodate seven or eight people to sleep, and nothing else.
On the bed, two monks in grey robes, one lying and one sitting, both in their twenties. The one lying down had a dull expression and was speechless, while the one sitting had a cold tone: "Just put your luggage under the bed. If you want to drink water, go to the water tank in the courtyard." "May I know your name, senior brother?"
Meng Qi glanced at the wooden and dull Zhen Hui, deciding to take the initiative to establish a good "roommate relationship".
The sitting person coldly said: "Zhen Guan."
After answering, he stopped talking, even turned his head away from Meng Qi and Zhen Hui, leaving Meng Qi with no chance to start a conversation.
As for Zhen Ying, he closed his eyes and continued to sleep.
What kind of people are these!
Meng Qi secretly complained, but on the surface, he smiled at Zhen Hui: "Junior brother Zhen Hui, I am Zhen Ding, you can call me senior brother in the future."
"Yes, senior brother." Zhen Hui called out without any difficulty.
This dull little guy is good!
Meng Qi sighed secretly, deciding to play the role of a senior brother and help Zhen Hui: "Little junior brother, let's change into our monk robes first."
Although there were people in the room, Meng Qi, who often went shirtless in the dormitory during his university days, felt no discomfort. He quickly took off his clothes and put on the monk's robe.
While quietly thanking the simplicity of the monk's robe, he checked the things on his body that he hadn't had time to inspect before.
The robe of this body was finely woven and soft. Even if Meng Qi was not a connoisseur, he could tell that it was valuable. At the same time, there was a transparent jade pendant hanging from "his" waist, and a small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red string around his neck, close to his chest, cool and comfortable.
Meng Qi carefully played with the thumb-sized jade Buddha. It had a compassionate face and looked lifelike, obviously carved by a skilled craftsman. At the same time, it felt delicate, warm and cool.
"According to Uncle Ma's face, this jade Buddha was given by an unknown old monk? But since the Marquis didn't take it away, it's probably not ordinary, so it's better to wear it close to my body."
Meng Qi hung the jade Buddha pendant back on his chest, hidden close to his body, then packed up the jade pendant, clothes, etc., and put them under the bed he had chosen.
At this time, Zhen Ying, who had been in a deep sleep, suddenly sat up, put on his shoes and went out. Meng Qi was stunned, not understanding what had happened.
"It's time for dinner." Zhen Guan said coldly, and also got off the bed and walked towards the door.
What kind of people are these two!
Meng Qi cursed again, then turned to Zhen Hui and said, "Little junior brother, are you ready? It's dinner time!"
"Ready!" As soon as Zhen Hui's voice fell, his small figure darted to the door like a rabbit, as if he was already starving.
"..." Meng Qi was suddenly embarrassed. Was he the only normal one here?
Zhen Hui suddenly stopped at the door, turned back and looked at Meng Qi with a puzzled face: "Senior brother, aren't you going?"
You have a conscience, you know to wait for me!
Meng Qi thought to himself, then half-jokingly replied: "I'm not as hungry as you guys."
Looking at you guys, you're like starving ghosts reborn!
He turned around and started running.
Hey! After a few flutters, he shouted loudly: "Hey, little junior brother, wait for me!"
Suddenly, a wave of sadness hit his heart. Others have little junior sisters, why do I only have little junior brothers, and it can be foreseen that there will be no junior sisters in the future.
In the pouring rain, a woman in her late twenties with a beautiful appearance, accompanied by a little boy aged five or six, knelt in front of the iron gate of a luxurious villa.
The woman's name was Zhao Meiling, from a remote small mountain village. Six years ago, she had hoped to go to university with dreams and hopes, but she didn't expect to meet a man who changed her life, this man was the famous playboy of Beitung City... Li Zhe!
At that time! Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe were in the same school. By accident, she was noticed by Li Zhe. Then Li Zhe pursued Zhao Meiling crazily, using all kinds of tricks and means.
Zhao Meiling was just a simple and honest girl who had just come to the city. How could she be a match for such a playboy? Not only her body, but also her heart was completely given to him. But after Li Zhe got tired of playing with her, he cruelly abandoned her.
Later, Zhao Meiling found out that she was pregnant. She wanted to give birth to the child, even at the cost of falling out with her family.
After the child was born, Zhao Meiling wanted to raise him by herself. But five years later, due to excessive physical exhaustion, she was diagnosed with a terminal illness and had only a few years to live. She finally decided to send the child to the Li family, hoping that the child could experience fatherly love and have a better life, so that she could rest in peace after her death.
But the Li family coldly rejected her, completely denying that the child was from their family. Zhao Meiling could only kneel in front of the iron gate with her child, begging bitterly.
At this time, the iron gate slowly opened, and several people came out holding umbrellas. The man leading them looked somewhat similar to the little boy. He was the little boy's father, Li Zhe.
"Here! Stinky woman, this money is enough for you to live a good life," Li Zhe frowned and handed Zhao Meiling a check.
Zhao Meiling shook her head, looked up at Li Zhe, and said, "Zhe! You must keep Fu'er, he is your son!"
Li Zhe flatly refused, then coldly said, "Do you want this money or not?"
Hearing this, Zhao Meiling was already in tears, shaking her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe snorted coldly, threw the check in his hand at Zhao Meiling, and was about to turn around and leave.
Zhao Meiling, who was kneeling on the ground, suddenly hugged Li Zhe's thigh and pleaded bitterly, "Zhe!"
"Slap!"
Before Zhao Meiling could finish speaking, Li Zhe slapped her face heavily, "Let go! You stinky woman".
The little boy next to him saw his mother being hit and quickly ran over to hug Li Zhe's thigh, calling out in a childish voice, "Dad! Don't hit mom".
In fact, the little boy didn't know who his father was from the moment he was born, and his mother never mentioned it. It wasn't until this time that Zhao Meiling showed the little boy a picture of Li Zhe that he knew he had a father, and he was so happy that he almost jumped up.
But now, he didn't understand why his father didn't want his mother and even hit her.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy hugging his thigh with a look of disgust, and kicked the little boy away, "Who is your father, you bastard!"
The little boy was kicked away and fell to the ground, curling up in pain and clutching his stomach. This pain was far beyond what a five-year-old boy could bear, and he couldn't help but let big tears roll down from his eyes.
Zhao Meiling was also shocked, and quickly let go of Li Zhe, ran over to pick up the little boy, and asked anxiously, "Fu'er, are you okay?"
The little boy looked at his mother's worried face, pursed his lips, held back his tears, and shook his little head.
Li Zhe didn't even glance at the mother and son, he walked into the iron gate. A man with some white hair, who seemed like a butler, picked up the check and handed it to Zhao Meiling, advising her sympathetically, "You should take this!"
Zhao Meiling shook her head, holding the little boy, and slowly disappeared into the rain.
The butler watched the mother and son's retreating figures, sighed deeply, turned and walked into the house, slowly closing the iron gate.
Four years later! Before Zhao Meiling's death, she called the now nine-year-old boy, who had grown a lot, to her bedside. Gently rubbing his head, she weakly smiled and said, "Fu, you must study hard in the future, so you can have a good job. Also, don't resent the Li family, and don't resent your father, promise me, okay?"
The little boy held back his tears and nodded seriously.
Seeing the little boy nodding seriously, Zhao Meiling's face had a peaceful smile, and she slowly closed her eyes forever.
At two o'clock in the middle of the night, a bright moon hung high in the sky, the bright moonlight illuminating the earth, making the surroundings not dark.
"Boom!"
A deafening noise suddenly came from the sky. Zhao Fu was startled and looked up at the sky. He saw the entire sky seemed to be burning, turning into a huge sea of fire. Countless objects emitting colorful lights, with long tails, like meteors, fell from the sky.
"Bang!"
With a loud noise, a meteor emitting colorful light fell in front of Zhao Fu. The dazzling light made Zhao Fu block it with his hand. After the strong light dissipated, a crystal stone about one finger long and two fingers thick floated quietly two meters above the ground.
Zhao Fu curiously walked up and grabbed the crystal stone. The floating crystal stone was unresponsive and was grabbed by Zhao Fu.
At this time, the people who were originally asleep were also awakened by a series of loud noises. They opened the door or the window, looked at the countless crystal stones floating in the air, and began to rush out of the house to grab these crystal stones. Zhao Fu didn't stay in place for long and hurried back to his own home.
In a single rental room, Zhao Fu carefully looked at the crystal stone. If it was just for appearance, no gem could compare to this crystal stone. If it was rare, its value would be priceless. But the key is that too many fell from the sky, at least billions, so this crystal stone might not be worth any money at all.
"Detecting the host as a primary intelligent body, starting soul binding..."
Ding! Soul binding successful, beginning to head to the Apocalypse World.
After this sound, Zhao Fu's eyes went dark, and he fainted on the ground. "Hong Dalì, male, 22 years old, orphan, died unfortunately while bravely saving two children who were about to be hit by a car. After research and decision by relevant departments, Hong Dalì was posthumously awarded as a hero, and an excellent university student in the province."
"I won't go, I won't go, I won't go, I don't want to go to Hong's house to get engaged with you!" Tang Muxin buried her head in the pillow, kicking her white little legs desperately: "Hong Dalì is a well-known waste in the city, he has lost all face for the Hong family, and he is sick and twisted, not only is his brain not bright, but he is also a standard prodigal son, I don't want to find such a person as my fiancé!"
Tang Muxin, the only beloved daughter of Tang Ruishi, the chairman of Tang's Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is talented and knowledgeable, not to mention beautiful. She is a gentle and graceful lady who gathers the aura of heaven and earth, especially good at cooking, a standard woman who can go to the hall and the kitchen and the bed. She is the dream lover of many boys in school.
But today she heard her father say that he was going to take her to the famous prodigal son Hong Dalì's house to get engaged, how could she bear it: "If it weren't for his parents spoiling him, the only seedling of a thousand acres of land, with his kind of waste, he would have been driven out of the Hong family to fend for himself, where would he have the opportunity to squander his family's wealth all day?"
Hearing his daughter's words, Tang Ruishi, sitting at the head of the bed, showed a bitter smile and said helplessly, "Xinxin, I have no choice."
Your engagement with Hong Dalì was personally arranged by your grandfather. Although he is a bit prodigal, it's not a big problem, right?
Tang Ruishi was wearing a gray-green vest, inside was a spotless white sweatshirt, with a simple bow tie at the collar. He had a light stubble on his lips and held an ancient bronze pipe in his hand. His short black hair was combed back meticulously, shiny and bright. His overall image was quite good, but his originally bright eyes were now filled with helplessness and unwillingness.
Speaking of which, if he wasn't really forced to a dead end, how could he be willing to give away his own daughter? After all, that Hong Dalì can be described as a unique flower in the world, the only thing he likes to do or can do is two words: squandering.
His most famous sentence is: "I must squander, if I don't squander, wouldn't I be wasting my parents' talent for making money?"
This sentence can be described as a joke known to everyone in Tianjing City. Many parents educate their children like this: "If you dare to learn from Hong Dalì, that prodigal son, see if I don't break your legs!"
So, it's indeed reasonable for Tang Muxin to have such a big reaction.
"Well, that's true..." Tang Ruishi thought for a while with a frown, suddenly his eyes lit up, and he said, "Xinxin, how about this? We get engaged first, and when my company recovers, we find an excuse to cancel the engagement. This time we exceeded the budget for research funding, once the funding catches up, as long as this project is successful, it will definitely be a world-shaking event. When we recover, we can think of a way to cancel the engagement, they shouldn't say anything then, right?"
Tang Muxin sobbed, "It's easy to get engaged but hard to cancel. His family is one of the top 500 companies in the world, it won't be that easy, right?"
It has to be said that Tang Muxin is a very smart girl.
If her family falls, her fate will definitely not be good. This world is like this, survival of the fittest. When you are strong, maybe no one dares to touch you, but when you really fall, there will definitely be many people who come to kick you when you're down.
For example, the eldest son of the Liu family who has always been pestering her at school.
So Tang Muxin cried for a while, and in the end, she also knew that there was no other way besides this method. She could only reluctantly get up: "Well, let's try it first, sob, dad, you must remember to cancel the engagement in the future, I don't want to marry that prodigal son!"
"Yes, for my Xinxin, dad will try his best to mediate." Tang Ruishi sighed, patted Tang Muxin's shoulder, "Xinxin, let's go."
Hong Dalì sat on the bed, his eyes blank, his mind in a mess.
The surrounding environment was very unfamiliar, and there was a big problem with the memory in his brain. Now he could only barely recall the harsh brake sound, and the rest were some messy memories that didn't belong to him.
"Didn't I die, where is this?" Looking at his pale and slender hands, Hong Dalì thought to himself: "This is not my body, this is not where I usually live. So, where is this?"
He looked around for a while and thought: "The most important thing now is to figure out the current situation."
"One, am I dead or alive now. Two, where is this place, who am I. Three, what should I do next."
"Let's start with the first point," Hong Dalì pinched a small piece of oily skin on the back of his left hand, rubbed it, and felt pain: "I feel pain, so I should still be alive." He carefully touched his face, neck, ears, and top of his head: "This body is clearly not my previous body, but it is still within the category of humans."
"Then the next question is, where is this place, and who am I?" Hong Dalì looked around again, the structure of the reinforced concrete house, the white walls, various modern household appliances, and even a computer with a thirty-inch LCD monitor in the corner of the room: "It's a modern society, but I've never seen the celebrities on the surrounding walls, and I've never heard of the various toy models. So, is this world the legendary parallel space?"
There was no one around, Hong Dalì carefully stood up and took a deep breath: "This body is really weak, thin like a bamboo pole, I really don't know when it will suddenly die."
Turning on the computer, Hong Dalì casually opened a few websites, the content displayed was very different from that on Earth, but at least it made him understand a few things: "First, the language of this world or this country is still Chinese. Second, it is indeed a parallel space, many things are different from Earth, but not too much.
"No ID card?" He thought for a while, but quickly let it go: "Hehe, looking at the age of this body, it should not be very high, probably seventeen or eighteen years old, there may be an ID card, but more likely it has not been issued yet, after all, this world is different from Earth, some minor differences are normal."
"Successful binding of the Prodigal System, current level: Level 1."
When the system voice introduced to this point, a small figure suddenly appeared in Hong Dalì's mind, which should be himself.
"Host name: Hong Dalì."
"Performance: 32. Note: The normal person's index is 100."
Hong Dalì was dumbfounded: "Prodigal System? Is this thing real or fake?
Fortunately, when Hong Dalì was desperate to commit suicide, the metallic voice of the system came again: "Explanation: The host can get one attribute point for every 100,000 yuan (RMB) spent.
When all the host's attributes reach the level of a normal person, the Prodigal System will be upgraded, and new items and props will be added at that time, please look forward to it."
"Can I get attribute points?" At this time, there is nothing better than being able to improve my attributes. Hong Dalì listened with a smile, "Can I really get attribute points by spending money and make myself like a normal person?"
The system's voice was still so cold, but at this time it sounded like a song in his ears: "Yes."
Hong Dalì was so excited that he almost jumped up: "I want to spend! I want to be prodigal!"
"Next, please accept the first task from the host: The first time to be prodigal. Task requirement: Spend at least 100,000 yuan before midnight tonight.
"Current spending amount: 0."
"Damn, it's already eight o'clock in the evening! Only four hours left, no, I have to go out! I want to be prodigal!"
Just thinking about this, the room door was gently pushed open, a maid in her forties bowed slightly to Hong Dalì and said softly: "Young Master Dalì, the master and madam ask you to come over, please follow me."
"Can you buy me a game cabin?" Jiang Fei asked his father with anticipation.
"Xiao Fei, you are already in high school now, you can't be addicted to games like before!"
"Mom! This game is different! This is a masterpiece that Shengshi Company has carefully crafted for thirteen years, known as the second world of mankind!"
The game Jiang Fei mentioned, called "Dawn", is indeed another innovation in human history. It is not only a model of virtual reality games, with a realism close to 100%, but also allows players to experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night. Through this technology, the human body enjoys eight hours of quality sleep physiologically, but can experience a completely different magical life for twenty-four hours mentally!
"This game is being promoted by the country! It's not a scam, this game will not only not affect learning, but also allow people to rest better!"
Jiang Fei is still insisting!
"I said for the last time, no! If you don't go back to your room and do your homework within twenty seconds, your pocket money will be cut by fifty percent next month!" Dad said with a straight face.
"Old stubborn!"
Jiang Fei muttered in a low voice, but he also knew that there was no room for negotiation. His family was in good condition, and his dad was definitely not reluctant to buy this game cabin, but his dad was stubborn and absolutely did not believe that playing games would not affect his studies! "Fei Ge, how about it? Tonight "Dawn" is going to officially open the server, have you prepared the game cabin?"
As soon as the class bell rang and the teacher left, a little fat man behind Jiang Fei asked him with his shoulder.
Don't mention it, this time I can't play with you guys!" Jiang Fei smiled bitterly!
"Brothers are all counting on you!"
The little fat man Zhao Feng was anxious. This little fat man is one of the few friends Jiang Fei has in school. Jiang Fei's class, High One Nine, is a key class in the school. However, Jiang Fei's grades are average, neither up nor down, and he is not good at sports or interpersonal communication, so he is definitely a standard invisible person.
"What can I do if my dad disagrees?" Jiang Fei rolled his eyes, he had nothing to hide from his only friend.
"Or should the brothers pool money to buy you one?" Zhao Feng said, because his condition was similar to Jiang Fei's, they were both those who were not outstanding in all aspects, so the relationship between these two invisible people who were not noticed by teachers and classmates was very good.
Jiang Fei comforted himself.
"I hope so!"
Zhao Feng nodded.
Jiang Fei has loved playing games since he was a child, especially these realistic games. As a boy, who doesn't want to be a chivalrous man? A man should carry a three-foot sword and make great achievements, this is the dream of every man, but in peaceful times, and in a highly developed society, let alone no wars, even if there are wars, it is just pressing a button, so if you want to enjoy the hot blood of battle, you can only experience it in virtual games!
But this time, Jiang Fei had no hope. Since he entered high school, Jiang Fei has been issued a limited entertainment order by his dad. All the game equipment at home has been sealed, and online games are even more out of the question!
It was not easy to wait until school was over, Jiang Fei walked home listlessly. Although it was only about six o'clock in the evening, it was already very early because it was winter.
Thinking that today is the day when "Dawn" opens the server, Jiang Fei locked himself in his room in a fit of anger! Around ten o'clock, Jiang Fei had finished his homework. He lay on his back on his bed, watching the clock on the wall slowly approaching ten o'clock, feeling a little uncomfortable.
The opening time of "Dawn" is ten o'clock tonight, and then from ten o'clock to six o'clock the next morning, running for eight hours a day, neither delaying the player's normal life, nor allowing the player to fully experience twenty-four hours of game time! "Ah! Such a great game and I can't play!"
Jiang Fei muttered, unconsciously rubbing the ring on his index finger with his hand.
"What the hell is this?"
Jiang Fei's mouth was wide open, looking at the ring on his hand that was emitting a faint light, he was so scared that he couldn't speak!
"Buzz!"
A white light flashed, Jiang Fei's eyes blurred, and when his vision became clear again, it was no longer his room in front of him!
"Ding! Welcome to the world of "Dawn"! No. 34784 novice assistant at your service!"
A crisp female voice entered Jiang Fei's ears!
"Dawn? Is this the login interface of "Dawn"?"
"To be precise, this is the character creation interface!" The novice assistant answered.
Jiang Fei still found it hard to believe, he didn't have a game cabin at all, how could he possibly enter the game?
Perhaps this is my dream! Maybe I was too tired after finishing my homework, so I fell asleep in bed, including the matter of that mysterious ring just now, I'm afraid it's all part of the dream. Daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams, maybe I just really want to play this game! Chapter One.
"Swindler! Big swindler!"
An angry shout, followed by the sound of footsteps fleeing on the bluestone ground.
Zhang Xuan helplessly stretched out his hands: "I'm really not a swindler, I'm a teacher at the academy... I just want you to be my student! And, even if you say I'm a swindler, why add the word 'big'?"
After muttering to himself, he remembered what the director of political education had said, Zhang Xuan rubbed his eyebrows: "This is the seventeenth one! If I can't recruit a single student today, I can pack up and go home tomorrow!"
Zhang Xuan was not originally from this world, but a librarian at a regular university on Earth. He only remembered a raging fire, and then... there was no 'then'. He woke up in this world.
Just like the novels, martial arts are respected, and strength is king!
He thought he could cross over to a waste, be divorced, and then slap his face and counterattack, singing all the way... It seems that he thought too much. When he got here, he found out that he was not a student, but... a teacher!
The most miserable teacher in the entire academy!
Other people's classrooms are overcrowded, and there is no place to sit, but his classroom is empty. A few who were dragged in by him in the end all cursed "swindler" several times and ran away!
The reason is that the guy who was possessed by his own soul, not to mention the lowest strength among the teachers, has extremely poor vision, can't see anything, and the key... he also teaches wrong, and has caused a case of demonic possession!
This is the same as a hospital killing people, damaging its reputation, being despised by people, and even the new students, one by one, keep their distance, fearing that they will fall into his hands and be taught half to death!
Without students, and being criticized, last year's teacher evaluation, the entire academy ranked last, and even got the only zero in history.
Under the depression, he drowned his sorrows with alcohol, and as he wished, he hung up and took the opportunity to cross over.
The new semester begins, and the academy has issued a final ultimatum. If he cannot recruit a student in his class this year, he will be directly dismissed from his teaching qualifications!
Today, seventeen new students have passed by his classroom. As a result, as soon as they hear the name, they all run away without exception, as if a little girl has met a strange uncle, running as fast as they can.
"It seems that I have to find a way to trick one!"
While thinking about how to start pulling people, he saw a girl with a dazed face poking her head out of the door.
"Excuse me, is this Teacher Lu Xun's classroom?"
The voice is sweet, cute, the appearance is handsome, and the person is lovely.
Teacher Lu Xun, the star teacher of the academy, his class is always full, and many people come to admire him.
"She's the one!" Seeing someone throwing herself into the net, Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up.
Recalling all kinds of pretentious routines he had seen in his previous life, he sat quietly in his seat, posing as a worldly expert: "Do you want to worship him as a teacher?"
The girl nodded like a sparrow, her black eyes full of admiration: "I heard that Teacher Lu Xun is the most powerful teacher in Hong Tian Academy. The students he teaches are all extraordinary in strength, and everyone is proud to be able to join his class!"
"No matter how good he speaks, if it doesn't match your cultivation theory, not only will you not make progress, you may even regress! The teacher is not famous, but if it matches your theory, you can also make rapid progress and greatly increase your cultivation!"
"Is that so... I've also heard my brother say similar things!" The girl was stunned for a moment, her beautiful eyes a little confused: "But, I don't know what kind of classroom I'm suitable for!"
Seeing her hooked, Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up, hesitated for a moment, Marx, Engels and other sages appeared in his mind one after another, pretending to be difficult: "Meeting is fate, so, I am also a teacher of this academy, I can help you check your roots, talents, and temperament for free, and by the way, recommend a suitable teacher for you!" "Thank you, sir!"
Unexpectedly, this teacher she happened to meet was so generous, the girl excitedly nodded her head.
"First show me your cultivation level!"
Zhang Xuan's eyes were half-open and half-closed, as if he didn't care.
"Yes!"
Whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh!
In a moment, the room was filled with the howling of fists, and a series of qi was running around the girl like a swimming dragon. Her whole person's aura was condensed but not scattered, powerful but not obvious, indicating that she had an excellent foundation.
"Okay, I see, you usually practice hard and diligently, have a solid foundation, excellent talent, and are a rare genius!" After a set of punches, Zhang Xuan nodded in satisfaction.
This is what he learned from the fortune tellers on Earth. The words are all-purpose, the range is very wide, people can't hear the mistakes, but they secretly call it accurate.
"Teacher, I've been injured on my leg, and the doctor said it's basically useless..." The girl interrupted his endless talk, with some doubts in her eyes.
"Injured..." Zhang Xuan's old face turned red, but his skin was thick, and others couldn't see it. He continued to talk nonsense and fan the flames: "Do you think I didn't see it? As soon as you exerted your strength just now, I knew it! The reason I said that is because... no destruction, no establishment!"
Anyway, it's all about tricking, if you can talk nonsense, just talk nonsense, first trick a disciple over.
"Opportunity? Teacher, what kind of opportunity?" The girl's eyes lit up.
After her leg was injured, she always felt inferior to others and was secretly inferior. She didn't expect that she might be able to turn misfortune into blessing.
"This opportunity can make you soar into the sky and become the first in the new life. After all, your talent is already very good, and you are a peerless genius that is rare in a million years, but..." Zhang Xuan kept talking, almost didn't take out a book of "Rulai Shen Zhang".
Hearing that she could become the first in the new life, and praising her as a genius, the girl's face couldn't help showing heat, and she quickly asked: "But, what?"
"But..." Zhang Xuan sighed, with a sense of lament that a good talent was about to be buried: "There are not many teachers in the entire academy who can see this opportunity!
"Don't recruit students?" The girl originally had high hopes, but when she heard this, her eyes dimmed a bit, and then she thought of something and jumped up: "If they don't recruit students, then teacher, do you... recruit?"
"Of course I still recruit, it's just that, as you can see, I'm indifferent to fame and fortune, and I don't have that much time!"
Thump!
Before he finished speaking, the girl knelt down: "I know that the gentleman is noble, please accept me as a disciple! I will definitely practice hard and not lose the teacher's face!"
"I promise not to disturb the teacher unless it's absolutely necessary!" Seeing that he was somewhat reluctant, the girl quickly nodded, her face sincere.
"I don't have many students, and I may not be able to compare with other teachers in terms of resources, and I will also be criticized by others..." Zhang Xuan continued.
"That's it... I heard that refining resources is very important..." The girl hesitated for a moment.
The teacher's collection of resources in the academy is linked to many conditions such as the performance and number of students taught. If the resources are not enough, it will be difficult to make progress in cultivation.
"Cough cough, I deliberately tested you just now, since you are determined and sincerely recognize me as a teacher, I reluctantly accept you!" Seeing her hesitation, Zhang Xuan immediately interrupted and hurriedly said: "Verify your identity!"
"This... so soon?"
Unexpectedly, this teacher's face changed like a book, and it was outrageous. The girl was slightly stunned, took the token representing her identity handed over by Zhang Xuan, and was considering whether to verify it or not. She saw that the previously calm and incomparable Teacher Zhang had already pulled her palm, took out a sharp knife and lightly cut it, and a drop of blood fell on the jade card.
Buzz!
The light flickered.
The girl was stunned.
Didn't this teacher just say that he was going to consider it, and he was indifferent to fame and fortune? Why is the action so fast, and... the knife is ready?
"From now on, you are my student!" After the blood drop recognized the master, Zhang Xuan finally breathed a sigh of relief, and once again resumed the high-profile style: "What's your name?"
"Reply to the teacher, my name is Wang Ying!"
Knowing that it cannot be changed, the girl didn't say much, and nodded her head with a cute face.
"Well, take your identity card, go get your bedding, books, and find your own place to live by the way! The class officially starts tomorrow, just come here to find me!"
Zhang Xuan waved his hand.
"Yes!" Wang Ying nodded her head and turned to leave.
"Successfully fooled another one!"
Seeing her become his student, Zhang Xuan finally breathed a sigh of relief and smiled slightly.
It wasn't easy. If it weren't for the many pretentious techniques he had seen online, he might not have succeeded today.
Having a student meant he could avoid the fate of being fired. Zhang Xuan felt a lot more relaxed, and his spirit instantly improved. The lingering thoughts of his previous life slowly disappeared from his mind.
"Don't worry, since I've taken over your life, I'll live it well for you!"
The previous Zhang Xuan had died because he couldn't recruit students, and he was very unwilling. Now that he had a student, his last persistence disappeared without a trace. It was only at this moment that Zhang Xuan fully mastered this body.
Boom!
Just as Zhang Xuan was thinking about fooling a few more students after fully controlling his body, he felt a shock in his mind, and a loud sound like a giant bell rang out.
Boom!
Various mysterious languages made him dizzy. Then, a huge palace appeared in his mind, with five big characters shining on it.
Heavenly Dao Library!
He pushed the door and walked in. Countless bookshelves stood tall, and the books were endless, stretching as far as the eye could see.
"A library? Damn, I was a librarian in my previous life, I hope it's not the same in this world!"
Other people's big gifts were either grandfathers or systems, all kinds of awesome things, but he got a library. Zhang Xuan felt a darkness before his eyes and almost fainted.
A library? What the hell? Will I throw books when others throw swords in a fight?
"What kind of books are these?"
Feeling helpless, Zhang Xuan reached out to grab a book from the shelf, wanting to see what use this library had. But as soon as he grabbed it, he found that his hand passed directly through the shelf and grabbed nothing.
"Are you playing with me? You give me a library, but I can't get any books. What am I supposed to do?"
Zhang Xuan was speechless, almost in tears.
Chapter 1
Huh? Where's my tattoo?
Zhao Yu rolled up his sleeve, looking surprised at his two fair arms. Before, his arms were tattooed with two fierce, domineering green dragons!
How... are they all gone?
Zhao Yu looked up and found himself sitting in a brightly lit office, surrounded by small office partitions.
At this moment, the phone kept ringing non-stop, papers and files were flying everywhere, and more than a dozen office workers were rushing around in the hall, all looking frantic.
At this time, a middle-aged man in a brown jacket quickly walked over and called out to everyone, "Team Leader Qu Ping will now brief everyone on the electric baton rape case. We will take action tonight, everyone listen carefully!"
Someone quickly pulled over a whiteboard, which was filled with writing and several photos attached.
Hearing the call, many workers hurriedly gathered around, casually pulling up chairs and sitting in front of the whiteboard to listen attentively.
Zhao Yu did not move, still sitting in his seat.
At this moment, he was still in great shock. He touched his right ear, which was surprisingly intact! Previously, his right ear had been split in half in a fight by a thug.
Zhao Yu wanted to find a mirror to look at his face, but suddenly saw a photo on the office desk. The photo showed a young and handsome man in a police uniform, who looked exactly like him!
Damn it! In great shock, waves of unfamiliar memories flooded into his mind like a bursting river. Zhao Yu gradually realized that he had experienced what was known in legends as - time travel!
Zhao Yu clearly remembered that he was a top fighter of the Green Dragon Gang, a reckless thug! Although his real name was also Zhao Yu, people in the underworld preferred to call him Zhao Tianba!
Damn it!
Zhao Yu was shocked again, he finally remembered that before this, he had been executed by lethal injection!
But, thinking about it... how did I end up here?
Could it be... I really traveled through time!?
And it was a seamless transition, without any reincarnation?
With the influx of new memories, he was amazed to find that this was a parallel world similar to his previous one, and his current identity was a detective of the Major Case Squad, surprisingly - a policeman!
The hall he was in now was none other than the police station's office!
Zhao Yu couldn't believe his eyes, this huge contrast was unimaginable. A seasoned thug had suddenly become a detective of the Major Case Squad, how could this be explained?
He subconsciously touched his head. In the past, due to several knife wounds on his head, his hair never grew evenly, so he simply kept a bald head, looking fierce and evil. But now, he had a head of flowing black hair, completely looking like a handsome young man.
"Colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been 3 cases of electric baton rape in our city..." At this moment, a short-haired, big-eyed female detective was briefing everyone on the case.
Zhao Yu quickly found information about this detective from his memory. She was the team leader of the Major Case Squad B team. Despite her young age, she was steady, had a high case-solving rate, and was a favorite in front of the leaders. Any major case that required the whole team's cooperation would be presided over by her.
"The victims are all young women with flashy appearances, and they all have issues with their lifestyle." Team Leader Qu Ping introduced, "The crime scenes are mostly near bars, karaoke clubs, and other places of entertainment, and the crimes all occur after midnight."
"According to the victims' statements, the criminal first follows the victim into a deserted alley, then uses an electric baton to stun them, and then commits rape. After the crime, the criminal will - urinate on the victim!"
Hearing the word "urinate", the scene fell silent.
Zhao Yu glanced at the man, who was Liu Changhu, the deputy captain of the Major Case Squad. During Zhao Yu's internship, this man often assigned tasks to Zhao Yu, making him deliver letters and pour tea every day, treating him like a servant.
In this world, Zhao Yu was not a thug, but a weak big boy who had just finished his internship and became a regular police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but many older colleagues would joke with him and assign him tasks that should not belong to him.
The current Zhao Yu was not a pushover, how could he stand being ordered around? He slapped the table and stood up.
His sudden rise startled Liu Changhu, and even Team Leader Qu Ping had to pause.
However, just as everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a silver bell-like female voice suddenly spoke before Zhao Yu. A girl with a ponytail, a slightly chubby body, and large glasses appeared in front of everyone.
The girl was a new intern clerk assigned to the Major Case Squad, named Li Beini. This girl was a fan girl, who had set her sights on Zhao Yu within less than a month of contact.
Although Zhao Yu was weak and often bullied, he was handsome, with a height of 1.78 meters, handsome and young, and indeed had a certain killing power on the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing her beloved being ordered around, Li Beini quickly stepped forward to help: "Captain Liu, let me do it, let me do it! I'm still an intern, these tasks naturally belong to me!"
After speaking, Li Beini gave Zhao Yu a knowing smile and ran to the tea room in the hall to make coffee.
Zhao Yu couldn't vent his anger, so he had to sit down again and continue to ponder his time travel problem. Although he had traveled through time, his memory was very clear, because just a few minutes ago he was still lying on the execution chair. In his previous life, he was sentenced to death for murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in his heart that he was framed and did not kill anyone! The person who was killed was a real estate tycoon, and Zhao Yu just beat him up as instructed by his superiors, it was impossible to kill him.
Moreover, even if he did beat someone to death, it would be manslaughter, not murder! Therefore, his death sentence was a conspiracy by others!
Thinking of this, Zhao Yu couldn't help but feel angry, his fists clenched tightly. If he could find the people who framed him in the future, he would make them pay double!
At this time, Li Beini had already brewed the coffee and distributed a cup to each colleague present. The young girl's face was always filled with enthusiasm, and she would kindly encourage with words like "hard work" and "keep going" every time she handed out a cup, which was quite popular among her colleagues.
"Officer Zhao, this cup has two packets of sugar! Tonight is bound to be an all-nighter, you have to hang in there!"
Before Zhao Yu could react, Li Beini happily went to clean the dishes.
At this time, Team Leader Qu Ping had finished briefing the case, and it was now the turn of the head of the Major Case Squad, Captain Jin Zhenbang, to speak. Captain Jin was over 50 years old, with white temples, and was a serious and diligent old man.
Captain Jin said forcefully, "There have already been 3 electric baton cases, and if there is one more, it will be classified as a serial event. Not only the higher-ups, but we also can't bear this big hat!
So, everyone, cheer up and try to solve this case in the shortest possible time! "So... Team A will send people to investigate the crime scene. Since the criminal followed the victim to commit the crime, he must have appeared in the bar or karaoke club where the victim was before, so pull out all the surveillance from there, we must find this person!
"Yes!"
"Group B, you are mainly responsible for evidence comparison!" Captain Jin ordered, "The criminal has no criminal record, so the bloodline is not viable. However, the criminal's urine is an important clue. Although the police station can't find a match, you can go to the hospital or physical examination center for comparison. As long as this person has had a physical examination or has been hospitalized, he can definitely be found!"
"Yes!"
"In addition, the electric baton used by the criminal, the mobile phone signal at the scene, and the only victim who has seen the criminal's face, these clues cannot be ignored, and all need to be followed up!"
"Yes!"
"Alright, each group arranges an action plan. If there are no problems, let's set off as soon as possible!" Captain Jin finished speaking, closed his own folder, and was about to turn around and leave.
"Wait a minute, I... I have a question!"
Everyone turned around and found that the person speaking was none other than Zhao Yu.
Captain Jin was also taken aback and quickly asked, "What's wrong, Zhao Yu? What's your question?"
Zhao Yu pointed to his forehead and said boldly, "I'm not feeling well, I'm going home first, you guys have fun!"
Chapter 1
In the 21st century, in the office of the director of the East Sea City Advanced Private Hospital.
With a "bang", a thick medical record was slammed onto the table. Director Lin's face was ashen, his anger uncontrollable, "Han Yunxi, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Lingyun Group, he owns 40% of our hospital's shares, you must prioritize his detoxification!"
Facing the director's furious rage, Han Yunxi calmly put her hands in the pockets of her white coat. "Director Lin, I'm sorry, Mr. Li is suffering from chronic snake venom, I don't allow queue jumping in non-emergency situations."
She was pure and beautiful, with big eyes and small dimples. At a young age, she was famous in the Chinese medicine world for her amazing acupuncture skills. She was a rare detoxification expert, whether dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins, or toxins in the human body, all were her strengths.
"Get it straight, this is Lingyun!" The director angrily slammed the table.
"Enough, don't tell me about equality before doctors, only the distinction between men and women. Han Yunxi, I'm telling you, arrange for detoxification immediately, otherwise, from today on, get out of the medical field!"
Everyone thought Han Yunxi would be scared, but she remained calm and serious, "Director Lin, in front of me, there is no distinction between men and women, only two kinds of people, those I want to save and those I don't want to save. I won't save Mr. Li, please find someone else!"
After she finished speaking, she politely smiled, turned around and walked away. Her seemingly frail body was elegant and composed, her quiet beauty contained an undeniable pride. However, when Han Yunxi opened the door, Director Lin was furious.
"Han Yunxi, how dare you talk to me like that, stop right there!"
As he spoke, he threw the medical record folder on the table at the back of her head. Han Yunxi was taken aback, only feeling a warm sensation slowly flowing down from the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, in the country of Tianning.
Han Yunxi woke up groggily from the bridal sedan, hearing the surrounding celebrations, the sounds of drums and gongs were everywhere, but everything was black in front of her.
What's going on?
Han Yunxi pulled off the thing covering her head and took a look, immediately gasping for breath, this... isn't this a wedding veil? She instinctively looked up and down, finding herself in a phoenix crown and wedding dress, just like a bride... drunk!
The bridal sedan was swaying, making Han Yunxi's head ache, and at this time, strange memories began to flood into her mind. Undoubtedly, she had traveled through time, and was about to get married as soon as she arrived!
The original owner was the legitimate daughter of the Han family, a medical family in the country of Tianning, also named Han Yunxi. Because her birth mother's medical skills saved the then queen, now the dowager, she was betrothed to the then seventh prince, now King Qin Long Feiye. This was once a beautiful story, and the Han family's status skyrocketed because of it.
But no one knew that Han Yunxi was born a jinx that caused her mother's death, and grew up to be an ugly girl who knew nothing about medicine. The marriage was thus delayed and became a taboo for King Qin. Unfortunately, a few days ago, King Qin angered the emperor, and the emperor decreed that they should choose a date to get married before the end of the month.
King Qin Long Feiye was crowned king at a young age, he was the only surviving prince in the struggle for the throne. Although he was only in his early twenties, he was the only uncle of the current emperor, and was undoubtedly the most powerful person in the country of Tianning.
The Qin King's mansion was in the south of the city, and the Han family was in the north. The bridal sedan had to pass through the city from north to south. Even though King Qin himself did not show up, his wedding still attracted a lot of attention, causing a sensation throughout the city.
Just as Han Yunxi was sorting out these memory information, the joyous celebration suddenly stopped, only to hear the matchmaker exclaim, "Oh no, something terrible has happened!"
Chapter One
"Xiao Yu, Xiao Yu, wake up. It's almost midnight, get up and have some dumplings."
Feng Yu found the voice somewhat unfamiliar, but also very warm. He mumbled an agreement, opened his eyes, and saw a young face that only existed in his memory.
"Sis?"
"Wake up, go wash your face quickly. I told you not to drink, but you insisted, and you fell asleep before the Spring Festival Gala even started." Feng Dan Ying said with a smile.
Spring Festival Gala? Is it New Year's Eve today?
Feng Yu looked around in confusion. A small room of less than six square meters, a single bed, patched quilts, an old wooden table, a 20-watt incandescent lamp overhead emitting a dim yellow light, and old newspapers pasted on the wall, all about national events he could no longer remember.
Isn't this the old house on the farm where he lived as a child? But this house was demolished long ago with the construction of the small town. And how did his sister become so young?
Feng Yu raised his hand, only to find that this was definitely not a prank, because his hand had become smaller, and his arm thinner.
He jumped off the bed and stood by the door frame. There were marks he made with a small knife every New Year's Day. The highest line read, "1988, 166 cm."
Is it 1988 now? Has he not yet graduated from junior high school?
He pinched himself hard, almost crying out in pain. Could this not be a dream?
Feng Yu opened the door and saw his mother cooking dumplings in a large pot in the kitchen. His room was next to the kitchen, and the living room was on the other side of the kitchen, which was called the main room on the farm.
"Are you awake? Will you still drink in the future?" Zhang Mu Hua looked at her son lovingly.
Feng Yu looked at his mother, who still had a full head of black hair, and his eyes moistened.
"Mom, you've worked hard."
"What are you talking about, child? Hurry up and wash your face, go watch some TV in the room, the dumplings will be ready soon." Zhang Mu Hua felt very gratified when she heard that, her son was growing up.
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on a bench in the living room, his lips trembled. In the future, just as he was starting to earn money, his father was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and passed away in less than three months, without even spending a penny of his earnings.
The pain of wanting to support his parents but not being able to do so made Feng Yu feel very upset for a long time.
"Dad." Feng Xing Tai turned his head to look at his son: "Are you awake? Is your head still dizzy? Watch some TV, the ethnic dance gala is very festive."
"Dad, I want to have a drink with you later." Seeing the anger on his father's face, Feng Yu quickly explained, "Beer is fine."
He had only had a few drinks with his dad in his lifetime, and now Feng Yu had a strong desire to have another drink with his dad.
"You still haven't learned your lesson, alright, we'll have a little more later, I'll see if you can get up to pay New Year's greetings tomorrow! Dan Ying, go get two bottles of beer."
Feng Dan Ying shook her head helplessly and turned to get the beer and glasses.
There was also a single bed in the main room with quilts on it. Feng Dan Ying lived in school and stayed with her mother in the inner room when she came home for holidays. This bed was for Feng Xing Tai to sleep in. But three years ago, it was Feng Yu who slept there.
There was a three-door vertical wardrobe on the west wall of the living room, with two suitcases on top of it. On a solid wood table, there was a 14-inch black and white TV, which was showing the Spring Festival Gala.
In the middle of the living room was a folding round table, which was already filled with dishes and bowls and chopsticks. There were eight dishes in total, all leftovers from the night before. There was chicken, fish, and pork knuckle, all eight dishes were meat dishes, and there was not a single vegetable dish.
Feng Yu didn't watch TV, but walked to the wardrobe and looked carefully in the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall by the door, February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve.
He could now confirm that he had been reborn!
His mother quickly cooked the dumplings, and both Feng Yu and Feng Dan Ying went to the kitchen to help bring the dumplings to the table. After all four of them sat down, Feng Xing Tai picked up his chopsticks.
"Xiao Yu, you're still drinking!" Zhang Mu Hua glared at Feng Yu.
"Mom, it's New Year's, let me have a little more."
Feng Xing Tai also said a few words to help, and Zhang Mu Hua shook her head and let them go. Feng Yu even poured a glass of beer for his mother and sister, as a family, they had to have a drink.
"Dad, Mom, Sis, Happy New Year, cheers!"
These leftover dishes on the table, Feng Yu took a casual bite and found them exceptionally delicious. At this time, there were no hormones and additives like in the future. Fish, rabbits and the like were all wild, and chickens and pigs were raised at home. The two of them ate these dishes, along with the dumplings, and each drank a bottle of beer. Feng Xing Tai wouldn't let them have any more.
After dinner, Feng Yu washed up and went back to his small room to lie down. As he lay in bed, he tossed and turned, unable to stop thinking about his life before his rebirth.
Feng Yu was originally a man in his forties. After resigning from a securities company, he made a living by investing on his own.
He had a wife but no children, his father died of illness early, and his mother lived with him.
He remembered that it was the spring of 2015. In order to take his wife abroad for infertility treatment, he wanted to earn more money. So he put all the savings in the house, including the mortgage on the house and car, and borrowed a large sum of money, all of which he invested in the stock market. According to his prediction, it was a bull market, and anyone could make money.
The situation was very good at the beginning, and his investment quickly doubled. So he boldly used high leverage in an investment company, hoping to make more profits. With another doubling, he could live comfortably for the rest of his life without doing anything.
When the stock market rose to 5000 points, he, like many others, was greedy and thought it could continue to rise. The stock market did rise a bit at first, but it soon plunged. Because he used high leverage and didn't have additional funds, he lost a lot. After paying back the borrowed money, he became penniless. His wife didn't even know that the house and car had been mortgaged, and he didn't know how to face his family.
He went bankrupt. That day, he drank a lot of alcohol, and then deliberately fell on the road in front of many people, and was hit by a truck.
This shouldn't be considered suicide, right? The accident insurance he bought should be able to compensate a few million, enough to redeem the house and car, and leave some money for his mother and wife.
He remembered that when he saw the truck coming at him, he thought that if God could give him another chance, he wouldn't want to die so pathetically again, he wanted his family to live comfortably!
But he didn't expect that God really gave him another chance!
Since God has given him another chance, he will not have the regrets of his previous life in this life. He wants to become a billionaire, he wants to become a legend in the investment world!
"Xiao Yu, stop shouting, go to sleep."
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Mu Hua called out. At the same time, she complained to her husband, why did he let their son drink again at night, he was talking nonsense.
Hearing his mother's complaining voice, Feng Yu smiled, turned over, and fell asleep sweetly. End of Chapter One.
May 20, 2019, Monday.
Spring ends and summer begins.
In this season, the temperature difference between day and night in the Jiangnan region becomes very large. During the day, you're still sweating in shorts; at night, you have to curl up in the quilt, freezing like a bird in the cold.
Jiangnan University City.
Song Shuhang is alone in his dormitory, his computer desk pulled to the side of his bed, allowing him to watch movies in various positions.
Song Shuhang does not have a habit of skipping classes - last night, the weather was stuffy, and in his sleep, he kicked off his quilt with a move called 'Double Dragons Emerge from the Sea'.
In the second half of the night, the temperature dropped sharply. Song Shuhang, who was only wearing a pair of shorts, was immediately miserable. In his sleep, he desperately searched for his quilt on the bed, but couldn't find it. In the end, he could only curl up like a shrimp, shivering under the midnight cold wind.
When the sun rose, Song Shuhang had become a member of the seasonal cold army.
His roommate had already asked for leave for his classes today.
Then, he took some cold medicine and slept until now.
The fever has subsided, but his body still feels weak, and he is in no condition to attend classes. So, he can only stay alone in the dormitory, watching movies out of boredom.
On the screen, the progress bar of the movie slowly advances. But Song Shuhang didn't take in any of the movie's content.
"Has the medicine not worn off yet? I'm so sleepy." He yawned, feeling his eyelids heavy.
'Ding ding ding~' At this moment, the chat software in the lower right corner of the computer screen jumped.
This is a notification that someone has added him as a friend or invited him to a group.
"Who added me?" Song Shuhang muttered, he lightly tapped the lower right corner of the computer touch screen, and the notification popped up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun (******) requests to add you as a friend.] Additional message: None.
Huangshan Zhenjun? Who is this, with such a strange nickname?
"Is it a classmate?" Song Shuhang wondered, thinking of those classmates who were still in their adolescent fantasy phase despite being in college. If it was them, they would indeed come up with such strange nicknames.
Thinking of this, he clicked 'agree'.
Immediately after, another system message popped up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun invites you to join the group 'Jiuzhou No.1 Group', do you agree?
Song Shuhang continued to agree.
'Shushan Pressure' agrees to join 'Jiuzhou No.1 Group'.
[You have agreed to join the group, say hello to your group friends!] There is also a system smiley face attached.
Chat tools are becoming more and more user-friendly these days.
After a series of notifications popped up, Song Shuhang calmly closed the notifications and group chat window - he was now feeling sleepy, how could he have the energy to care about what group he had joined?
Anyway, his group settings have always been 'do not prompt messages, only display the number', the group chat will not pop up to disturb him, it will only display the number of chats in the group.
When he is more awake, he can go through the chat records, and then he will know what group he has joined, and the chat records of the group members will not be lost.
The movie progress bar is still stubbornly advancing, but Song Shuhang's consciousness is becoming more and more blurred.
In the Jiuzhou No.1 Group, seeing a new member join, some of the lurking members surfaced. Beihesanren: "Did Huangshan Zhenjun bring a new Daoist friend in? It's been more than a year since we last added a new member, right?"
Another ID named 'Su's Aqi' quickly replied: "A new Daoist friend? Which region of Huaxia is the Daoist friend from? What's the Daoist name? What's the cultivation level?"
This series of questions, something seems off?
"Is it a fairy? If so, report your three sizes and show a photo!"
"Sanlang brother, are you really a goldfish?" Beihesanren sighed: "Don't die again, what if Huangshan Zhenjun brought another senior in?"
Sanlang is a good guy, he is passionate and helpful, so he is popular - it's just that he likes to talk nonsense, and he is good at dying.
Unfortunately, this guy's luck is so bad that it's infuriating. Every time he unintentionally dies, he always offends the seniors. These idle seniors are just looking for fun, naturally they are happy to torment Kuangdao Sanlang, the fun that comes to the door.
"Please don't mention the words 'senior', I have a shadow in my heart." Kuangdao Sanlang sent a row of 'tears streaming down his face' emojis.
Four years ago, his broken mouth offended a beautiful 'senior', and he was tormented... that senior tormented him for a whole year and four months. You heard right, it was a whole year and four months! Thinking back to that inhuman period, his eyes were moist.
Sanlang had just finished speaking, and the group immediately popped up with a series of laughing emojis - unabashed, straightforward schadenfreude.
There are eight people online in the group, six of them popped up a row of smiling faces.
"You guys who take joy in other people's misfortune, I remember every one of you, don't let me meet you, otherwise I will let you taste the power of my 72 fast knives!" Kuangdao Sanlang said hatefully. He is very confident in his fast knife, none of the six guys who just laughed are his opponents in a one-on-one fight.
Kuangdao Sanlang had just finished speaking.
His cultivation is profound, he has reached the late stage of the 5th rank Linghuang, only two steps away from the 6th rank Lingjun, but he can't beat Aqi.
His 72-way knife method is fast and ruthless, and his body method is as fast as lightning, but he can't beat Aqi.
He is known as Kuangdao, and when he goes crazy, even he is afraid, but he just can't beat Aqi!
When the people in the group saw Sanlang wilt, they popped up another string of unrestrained laughing faces.
"......" This time, Kuangdao Sanlang could only send a string of colons in frustration.
The people in the group made a fuss for a while, but they didn't see the newcomer speak, and they were a little puzzled.
"New Daoist friend not speaking?" Beihesanren asked.
Unfortunately, due to the effect of the cold medicine, Song Shuhang had once again entered a semi-sleep state.
At this time, Su's Aqi happily sent a message: "I checked, the new Daoist friend is called 'Shushan Pressure'. Have you heard of a master with this Daoist name? This Daoist name sounds a bit like a Confucian practitioner?
Thinking back, the Confucian practitioners are even more fun to fight than the Buddhists, not only are they good at talking, but their fists are also hard. And when they get excited, they will recite poems to boost their spirits, it's great! I love fighting them the most."
"Aqi, I say, do you always only care about whether the new Daoist friend is good to fight, and whether it's fun to fight?" Kuangdao Sanlang sent a 'tears streaming down his face' emoji.
"Uh." Su's Aqi was a little embarrassed.
Beihesanren laughed: "Could it be another 'senior' who doesn't know how to use chat tools?"
As he said this, everyone felt a sense of déjà vu.
Yes, about four years ago, there seemed to be a senior who had been in seclusion for more than a hundred years and finally got on the chat software, and was added to the group by Huangshan Zhenjun. But because he didn't know how to type, he didn't speak.
Then, a guy named Kuangdao Sanlang happily talked nonsense in front of this senior, asking her to report her three sizes, send a photo, and voice chat and so on.
Then... a few days later, Kuangdao Sanlang saw this senior in person. She was a very beautiful senior, as dazzlingly beautiful as the moon in the night sky.
Then, this beautiful senior tormented Kuangdao Sanlang for a whole year and four months before she left satisfied.
At this time, an ID called 'Pharmacist' spoke.
A strange short message, without a head or a tail.
Fortunately, the people in the group are used to Pharmacist's short chat style - he is asking where the group owner Huangshan Zhenjun is.
Pharmacist's short speech is not because of his noble and cold personality, but because he types with two-finger Zen plus handwriting, which is very slow. When there are many words, it's easy to make mistakes, and it's extremely painful to delete and write. So Pharmacist is used to making his speech as short as possible.
"He added someone and then immediately went offline. I heard that his beloved pet demon dog ran away from home again, and True Monarch Yellow Mountain went after it," replied the North River's Loose Practitioner.
"..." Medicine Master.
"We can only wait until the new friend learns to use the chat tool to chat again."
They all assumed that the new addition was also a fellow practitioner.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang gradually woke up.
"I remember someone added me to a group just now, it seems to be called the 'Nine Provinces (1) Group'?" He muttered softly, casually opening the chat tool in the lower right corner and pulling out the chat window of the 'Nine Provinces (1) Group'.
What kind of group is this?
Soon, the chat record from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang roughly browsed through it.
My seat? Chasing a demon dog?
Various terms from the world of immortals and knights.
The way people in the group chat is also interesting - half ancient and not ancient, half white and not white. It feels like modern people trying to communicate in ancient language, but because their foundation in ancient language is not up to par, their communication is awkward.
"Chuckle~~" Song Shuhang laughed out loud.
It seems like this is a group created by a fan of the immortal knight genre?
Oh no, this is definitely not an ordinary immortal knight fan group!
Everyone in the group has given themselves a Taoist name, the place they live is called a cave dwelling, and the group owner's lost pet dog is described as a demon dog running away from home. There are also people who claim to have not fought a Confucian walker for hundreds of years, which means that person claims to have lived for several hundred years?
Just looking at these chat records gives a sense of embarrassment.
"This level of obsession has reached the level of 'chuunibyou', and it's a very Chinese-style immortal knight 'chuunibyou'," Song Shuhang nodded secretly.
It seems that this is a concentration camp for patients with immortal knight 'chuunibyou'!
This is his first impression of the 'Nine Provinces (1) Group' and its members.
But why did they add him to the group?
He looked at the profile of the group owner, True Monarch Yellow Mountain, who was not his classmate, and he was sure he didn't know him.
Blue, slender lines flowed smoothly from the tip of the pen. On the palm-sized card, the light blue lines kept increasing, gradually, a complex and mysterious pattern became more and more perfect with the sliding of the pen tip.
Suddenly the pen tip paused heavily, a sharp change from the lightness just now, followed by a sharp hook, the pen hook like a knife edge! The pattern on the card suddenly lit up, then quickly dimmed down, returning to normal.
He still looked focused as he finished this card, he had only completed fifteen so far, and there was still a gap of ten from today's task. He is currently making a one-star energy card, as the lowest level energy card, it is currently the most widely used and one of the most consumed cards.
Just then, the room suddenly went dark.
The meter showed a number of one hundred. I didn't expect the energy to run out, it seems today's task will have to add one more. Chen Mu, who returned to the table, quickly got back to work, all his livelihood depended on this most paper-level card.
Chen Mu's room is very small, less than forty square meters, with a semi-old work table inside. Apart from the work table being relatively clean, the rest of the room is filled with piles of miscellaneous items. These miscellaneous items are also varied, piles of old books, scattered various raw materials.
In this simple place, Chen Mu has lived for three years. This is a relief house provided by the federal government, such a small room, you only need to pay one hundred and fifty Odi a month to live in. For poor people like Chen Mu, there is no cheaper place than this.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen Mu finally finished today's work - twenty-five energy cards. He carefully counted the number of cards, counted twice, and only after confirming that the number was correct did he carefully put the energy cards into the card bag in his clothes.
As soon as he entered the door, the shopkeeper noticed and greeted, "Ah Mu is here!"
He replied to the shopkeeper. Shopkeeper Hua is a man in his fifties, the years have left indelible marks on him. Fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, wearing a pair of reading glasses.
Chen Mu carefully took out the card bag from his bosom, took out the stack of energy cards, and handed it to the shopkeeper: "Twenty-five."
Shopkeeper Hua took the cards from Chen Mu's hand, didn't even look at them, and casually put them on the shelf, laughing, "I'm lucky to have you delivering cards every day, otherwise my supply would be short."
Chen Mu smiled slightly, but did not respond, he knew that Shopkeeper Hua's words were mostly joking. A one-star energy card is the cheapest energy card, but it is also one of the most consumed cards, and this place is located near the East Guard Academy, where could it possibly only sell twenty-five energy cards a day?
Shopkeeper Hua also knew Chen Mu's temperament, and didn't waste words, he directly asked, "Ah Mu, do you need cash or a transfer?"
Chen Mu answered succinctly, and then handed a prepared light green card to Shopkeeper Hua. After settling the bill, Chen Mu bid farewell to Shopkeeper Hua and was about to turn around and leave.
Shopkeeper Hua suddenly called Chen Mu, "Ah Mu, wait a minute."
Chen Mu stopped, turned around and looked at Shopkeeper Hua with a slight surprise, "Is there anything else, Shopkeeper Hua?"
Shopkeeper Hua took out a goose yellow note from the drawer, smiling at Chen Mu, "I almost forgot something. This is a lecture certificate for a card maker training class, it was given by the distributor when I received the goods yesterday."
Looking at the kindly face of Shopkeeper Hua, Chen Mu was moved. He knew how much help this old man in front of him had been to him over the years, if it weren't for him, Chen Mu believed that his current life would also be out of reach.
Three years ago, when he first learned to make energy cards, he went around trying to sell them, but few people were interested, no merchants were willing to buy them. The demand for one-star energy cards is very large, and merchants prefer to buy in large quantities at once. Chen Mu could only make thirty at most in a day, which for a merchant, is a small number that doesn't even count as a fraction.
Fortunately, he met Shopkeeper Hua. Shopkeeper Hua agreed to buy his energy cards, but the purchase price for each card was 103 Odi, two Odi lower than the market price for energy cards. Despite this, Chen Mu was still extremely grateful to Shopkeeper Hua.
The price of 103 Odi, although lower than the batch price of 105, made Chen Mu feel surrounded by great joy. He sold all the energy cards in his hand, bought the cheapest food, and spent all the rest of the money on raw materials for energy cards.
From then on, Chen Mu's life finally stabilized.
Twenty-five energy cards a day, he didn't miss a day.
This went on for three years. In these three years, he only made one type of card - a one-star energy card. In addition to making energy cards, he spent all his time researching how to reduce costs.
Finally, in the third year, the cost of the energy card was controlled by him at 95 Odi, he could profit 8 Odi per energy card, his daily income stabilized at 200 Odi, this was a number he could not have imagined three years ago.
Chen Mu, who came back to his senses, smiled at Shopkeeper Hua, "Thank you, Shopkeeper Hua!" He took the lecture certificate and carefully put it into the card bag in his bosom.
They often advertise in a very grandiose way, such as this lecture certificate says something like "East Guard Academy Recognized Degree" "East Guard Academy Senior High-Level Card Maker Authority Personally Lectures" and so on, but what's actually inside Chen Mu knows very well. The institution that organizes this training course and the East Guard Academy only have a little relationship, which is that this institution has to pay a fee to the East Guard Academy each time, as the price for them to maintain this nominal "jointly organized".
Chen Mu still plans to go and listen to what is being taught in the training class. Card making is one of the most profound knowledge, over the years, he has never given up self-study, but the results have been minimal. It wasn't until last year that he realized what was going on.
For a boy with no foundation at all, it is naturally extremely difficult to self-study card-making, which is known for its profound and obscure nature. However, he had no doubt about his own intelligence, and was able to learn to make a one-star energy card within a week just by memory. The card maker of that year had once praised his talent.
Since then, he has put aside this temporarily high goal for him and started to turn to the most basic theoretical learning. No matter how tired he is from work every day, he will take time to study these boring knowledge.
After saying goodbye to Uncle Hua, Chen Mu walked south along a small alley. Today is Saturday, and he has another job.
After crossing two streets and walking for about twenty minutes, he arrived at a second-hand waste card acquisition station.
He is also the owner of this acquisition station. Every Saturday and Sunday night, Chen Mu would come here to work part-time for three hours.
Chen Mu nodded slightly to Xiao Hei, but there was still a bit of dullness on his face.
Xiao Hei was used to Chen Mu's face. When Chen Mu first came here to ask for part-time work, Xiao Hei originally refused. This acquisition station has been managed by one person since his father started it, and when it came to him, he also managed it all by himself.
However, when Chen Mu said he didn't want a salary, Xiao Hei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Mu still has a reward, usually Chen Mu will choose a few waste cards to take away as his salary.
Sometimes Chen Mu would pick out a few energy cards that hadn't been used up from these piles of waste. Xiao Hei calculated that the cost he saved on this every month was a large sum. But for the silent Chen Mu, he couldn't help but be curious, how did this guy know that there was still residual energy in these cards?
But since then, every time he saw Chen Mu, he was all smiles.
Chen Mu squatted down and began to classify the stacked waste cards. There are many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, mimic cards, and even some relatively rare plant and animal cards. But all the cards here are useless without exception, what Chen Mu has to do is to categorize these cards.
The work went very quickly, and it was clear that he was very familiar with this job.
Chen Mu flipped his wrist and threw a card to Xiao Hei: "Here, this card can still be used for a while." This two-star energy card still has at least half of the energy, Chen Mu can't understand why the original owner of this card would waste it like this. The capacity of a two-star energy card is one thousand, which means there is almost five hundred energy left inside.
Xiao Hei looked at the two-star energy card in his hand, his eyebrows and eyes were all smiling. He ran to the energy meter, inserted the card, and when he saw the "523" number lit up on it, Xiao Hei's face was almost squeezed into a ball with laughter.
Three years of production career has given him his own understanding of this most common and lowest-level card. There is not only one way to make a one-star energy card, Chen Mu has already collected twelve different structures of one-star energy cards from this kind of collection.
These structurally different one-star energy cards have given Chen Mu a great start, precisely because he has learned some techniques from these cards, he has successfully reduced the cost of making a one-star energy card to ninety-five Odi. But such good luck won't happen every day, so far, he has only collected twelve.
But today's luck seems to be good.
Looking at the one-star energy card in his hand, judging from the surface structure, it is a new structure of a one-star energy card that Chen Mu has never encountered before.
He put this energy card aside and continued to bury his head in sorting. The number of one-star energy cards is really too many, but Chen Mu patiently checks them one by one. His speed is extremely fast, and he can almost tell whether it is what he wants just by lightly touching these one-star energy cards.
All of this comes from his familiarity with one-star energy cards. This familiarity is left over from three years of uninterrupted production. He doesn't need to look at it, he can judge whether this card is a one-star energy card, whether it is a structure he has seen before, just by the feel of his hand. He is too familiar with them, down to every detail.
The fingers that swept over the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
Lin Che got up from the bed in a daze.
Her head was so heavy that it didn't seem to be her own, the luxurious bed sheet touched by the palm of her hand was not the one she usually used, the light above her head was not the half-broken energy-saving lamp she was used to seeing, and the pain in her body was as if she had just been torn apart, she raised her wrist, and the green and purple marks were clear and obvious.
She covered her mouth, not wanting to make a sound, lifted the quilt, and saw her naked self inside, the scream almost rushed out of her throat.
Lin Che's agile eyes turned around in her eyes, decisively lifted the quilt, got out of bed to tidy up her messy clothes, put them on casually, and ran out without looking back.
"Ah... let me go, let me go..." Lin Che struggled with her hands and feet.
The man's big hand grabbed her neck, effortlessly, and directly pulled her back onto the bed.
His deep eyes seemed to carry a born arrogance, his cold cheeks, his high nose on his white face, his skin like white jade, made her, a woman who thought her skin was not bad, feel envious and jealous.
She asked herself that she had seen many men, but those men who were called male gods became dull in front of him.
Was it this man who tormented her half to death last night?
"Who sent you, you actually drugged me? You think you can leave here unscathed after doing such a thing?" He looked at this stunned woman, anger flashed in his deep eyes.
This strange woman, her skin is better than snow, her small face is pleasing, a pair of agile big eyes, her eyelashes flutter, like a frightened deer, but unwilling to show weakness, staring at him with wide eyes.
Gu Jingze's gaze settled on her, and saw Lin Che's eyes start to spin again with the rapid rotation of her brain.
But she got the wrong person.
The man in front of her, although handsome enough to make people dizzy, is obviously not the top-tier superstar Gu Jingyu.
This time, she was rudely grabbed by him again, and when she fell to the ground, she even rolled awkwardly before stabilizing.
"You got it wrong, the one who is seriously damaged now is me." She fell and her butt hurt, her hand hurt, and the pain below was even more noticeable. Annoyed, she shouted out, "The one I want to confuse is someone else, it has nothing to do with you, you think you're worth my drugging, I'm not the kind of person who just does it, you owe me for the drug!"
Got the wrong person?
Gu Jingze's face was tight, his eyebrows were knotted, his dark eyes were like lurking beasts, staring at this disheveled woman, her white half shoulder was exposed, with green and purple marks on it, clearly eye-catching, on her white skin, it was like a blooming plum blossom.
The scenes from last night flashed in his mind again, and he suddenly felt a heat in his lower abdomen, and once again felt that obvious heat surging in his body.
He moved his gaze away from her face.
This damn woman dared to drug him, and the drug effect was so strong.
His momentary opening gave Lin Che the opportunity, regardless of everything, she jumped off the bed and pushed the man away with all her strength.
Without daring to look back, she ran out quickly.
Hearing his hiss, she shouted, "What are you looking at, go look at yourself!"
"You..." Gu Jingze was about to turn around and grab her, but he felt a wave of discomfort in his body, and he was once again uncontrollably aroused.
"Damn it." He cursed, clenching his fist to suppress that damn arousal.
A series of sounds came from outside.
Qin Hao turned his head and looked, his mouth agape in surprise.
What just happened? How did a disheveled woman come out of the master's room?
He raised his sharp eyes, the black pupils shining brightly, making Qin Hao quickly swallow all the doubts he shouldn't have.
Gu Jingze was in the bathroom, constantly washing his body, until his skin was flushed pink, then he cursed at the mirror, "****."
Gu Jingze was stunned, at this time, his mother actually came over, he knew it wouldn't be good news.
When the bathroom door was opened, a beautiful lady standing outside was surprised to see the mess on the bed.
The uncleaned bed was clearly telling everyone what had happened last night.
Gu Jingze's eyes were dark, he pulled over a bathrobe and put it on his honey-colored shoulders, "I know what you want to ask, but, mother, I'm very busy today."
How could Mu Wanqing not ask, the excitement on her face was hard to hide, looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed to the bed and said, "Jingze, I already know, you had a relationship with a girl."
Gu Jingze pushed the door open, and said coldly to Mu Wanqing, "Can you please not interfere in this matter?"
"How can I not interfere, Jingze, you must marry her, you have to take responsibility for her."
"Mother, I won't marry her, I'm not crazy, she's just a stranger, I don't even know her name."
"Mother!" Gu Jingze stood there, his expression even more troubled because he thought of that woman.
"Do you still think of Mo Huiling? I tell you, there is no possibility between you and her, you have been with her for so many years, but you can't touch her, you are destined not to be together!" Mu Wanqing said bluntly.
"Mother, enough!" Gu Jingze wanted to interrupt Mu Wanqing.
But Mu Wanqing was very excited, "Jingze, you know your illness, you can't touch women at all, the family has almost prepared for artificial insemination for you to have a child, but, you touched a woman today, it shows that she is the most suitable for you!"
The famous Taoist mountain, Qingcheng, has been visited by countless strange people and scholars since ancient times, hence the saying "hidden dragons and snakes in the grass".
Countless myths and legends, countless legendary stories, like a thick cloud, shroud Qingcheng in a mysterious veil.
At dawn, on the stone path in the mountains, groups of Taoists in green robes, holding three long incense sticks, silently and quickly move along the path, heading towards a towering, smooth stone wall on the back mountain.
The mountain road is steep and wet with dew, but these Taoists are faster than galloping horses, leaving streaks of green shadows. Some even leap up from time to time, crossing a hundred meters in the wind, their clothes fluttering in the morning wind, their floating momentum is like immortals descending to the world.
From the Qingcheng Mountain, various peaks, and various palaces and pavilions, Taoists continuously come out and gather in front of this unnamed stone wall.
Among them, a large group of young Taoists hold various flags and magical instruments, carrying incense burners and walking around the nine-square array. The smoke rises straight into the sky, the misty air twines upwards, forming a cloud covering the heads of the group of Taoists.
In the forefront of the many Taoists, right under that stone wall, a group of Taoists wearing purple robes with gold edges, with the eight diagrams embroidered with silver thread on their chests and backs, and cloud and flower patterns on the edges of their robes, stand solemnly there, holding dust brushes, expressionless.
The group of Taoists quietly waited for a while, when a red light suddenly leaped up in the east, the red light instantly tore open the sky and spread in all directions, the many Taoists all bowed down together, performing the three kneels and nine kowtows to the stone wall.
Thousands of Taoists chanted mantras at the same time, the 'om om' mantra sound intertwined, turning into a subtle sound wave that made people tremble, and gradually, a strange power rose from the sound of the mantra, a bright seven-color glow shot out from the heads of the many Taoists, shining on the smooth and shiny stone wall.
Those Taoists in purple robes with gold edges all bowed down at the same time, murmuring a prayer in their mouths.
This continued for half an hour, and finally a ray of white light shot out from the top of the stone wall, and soon the entire stone wall was emitting a bright white light.
Smoke and mist rose to the sky, and in the stone wall, countless clouds and mist entwined, and several vague figures with golden light around them appeared in the clouds and mist. The figures became clearer and clearer, and finally, three men and two women, five Taoists in white robes, with their faces obscured by golden light, appeared in front of everyone.
The woman in the middle looked down at the many Taoists kneeling in front of the stone wall, and suddenly had a scroll in her hand, which she threw out casually.
The white light on the stone wall flashed, and the scroll with a purple jade axis and woven with gold thread slowly floated out, falling right into the hands of the old Taoist in purple robe who was leading the many Taoists to bow down. The woman who threw the scroll muttered a few words, turned around and was about to leave with her companions.
Several old Taoists in purple robes suddenly shouted, "Ancestor, have mercy, have mercy!"
The 'dong dong' sound kept ringing, all the Taoists bowed their heads and saluted the five men and women, their foreheads knocking on the rocky ground.
The woman who threw the scroll shouted coldly, and all the Taoists immediately knelt down on the ground, not daring to make any more movements or sounds.
However, another female Taoist next to the woman laughed a few times in a low voice, and threw out a few more things.
The light on the stone wall dimmed, and the five Taoists disappeared without a trace.
Several items shining with strange light slowly fell from the sky, they were a sword, a bead, a small tripod, five talismans, and nine medicine bottles.
The sword, bead, and small tripod were small like children's toys, but each one was dazzling with smoke and mist, obviously extraordinary items.
The five talismans were even more wrapped in golden light and purple aura, with an almost imperceptible pressure surging out wave after wave, making the Taoists who were slightly closer unstable and being pushed back by this force.
The nine medicine bottles were densely engraved with various talismans and seals. The old Taoist who had just received the scroll opened one of the medicine bottles in front of many Taoists, and a refreshing medicinal fragrance immediately gushed out. The thousands of Taoists in front of the stone wall all took a deep breath at the same time, feeling their seven orifices clear, their meridians as if washed by clear water, and their whole bodies brightened.
Just smelling a wisp of medicinal fragrance was better than three months of hard work for these Taoists. The old Taoist in the purple robe hurriedly stuffed the medicine bottle and sealed it tightly. Just the fragrance of the pill had such a miraculous effect, it can be imagined how precious the pill in this bottle is.
Several purple-robed old Taoists huddled together and whispered for a while, each packing up their swords, beads, tripods, talismans, and medicine bottles. Then, in front of all the Taoists, they unrolled the scroll.
The first half of the scroll contained a scripture for cultivating qi and nourishing the spirit, the "Tai Xu Qi Jing". The latter half of the scroll, however, caused the purple-robed old Taoists to lose color in their faces, all of them crying out in alarm. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Taoists swarmed out from within Qingcheng Mountain.
The potential power of Qingcheng Mountain in the secular world was fully activated, stirring up an invisible huge wave.
Chapter 1
In the scorching heat of July, the asphalt on Youbo Road emitted a pungent smell under the intense sun, as if it was about to melt.
The air above the road was distorted due to the heat.
Under such a scorching sun, there were hardly any pedestrians on the street, and even the number of cars was reduced. Everyone was seeking shade to escape the heat, or enjoying the comfort of air-conditioned rooms.
A woman in a washed-out white shirt and grey suit pants was hurrying along, heading straight for the Second People's Hospital.
Her hair was sticking to her face due to sweat, and her cheeks were unusually flushed, clearly sunburned.
Her white shirt was soaked with sweat and clung uncomfortably to her body, but Qiao Nan had no time to care about this, clutching her bag containing one hundred thousand yuan tightly.
This was the money she had managed to gather by selling all her valuable possessions. Her sister needed two hundred thousand for surgery, and she still had to figure out how to get the remaining hundred thousand.
As she headed straight for the ward, Qiao Nan's hand had just touched the doorknob when she heard the conversation between the mother and daughter in the room.
"Mom, it's all Qiao Nan's fault. If it weren't for her, Da Jun wouldn't have divorced me." This was the voice of Qiao Nan's sister, Qiao Zi Qin.
"Don't cry, I've already scolded Qiao Nan for you." Mother Ding Jia Yi comforted her eldest daughter, stroking her head.
Standing outside, Qiao Nan's heart sank. Her sister's affair was discovered by Chen Jun, which led to him leaving her. But what did this have to do with her?
Thinking of Chen Jun, Qiao Nan's eyes darkened.
Chen Jun was originally Qiao Nan's boyfriend, but Qiao Zi Qin got pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child. Ding Jia Yi scolded Qiao Nan, accusing her of being a heartless little beast who not only stole her sister's boyfriend but also forced her own sister to have an abortion.
In the end, Qiao Nan had to step aside and let Chen Jun be with her sister.
"Mom, Da Jun divorced me, the child is not with me, and I have this disease, what should I do? Mom, I don't want to die, I haven't had a chance to take care of you, I really don't want to die."
In the ward, Qiao Zi Qin was crying hard in Ding Jia Yi's arms. She was still so young and had many good days ahead of her. She really didn't want to die.
Hearing that her eldest daughter had such a serious illness and still wanted to take care of her in the future, Ding Jia Yi was deeply moved.
Ding Jia Yi comforted and patted Qiao Zi Qin's back: "No, mom will definitely not let anything happen to you. Mom has already gone to raise money for you because of that dead girl Qiao Nan."
Not long after Qiao Zi Qin divorced Chen Jun, she developed kidney failure and needed a kidney transplant immediately.
But in this marriage, Qiao Zi Qin was the one who made the mistake by having an affair, and since Chen Jun worked for the government, Qiao Zi Qin was left with nothing. Now she was sick and didn't even have money for treatment and medication.
Qiao Nan, who had long known about her mother's favoritism, felt a pang in her already numb heart after hearing this conversation.
She was already forty years old. After breaking up with Chen Jun, she never dated again. It wasn't that she didn't want to, but her mother wouldn't let her.
Over the years, most of the money she earned was given to her mother. Her mother used the money she earned to buy her sister a 150-square-meter apartment, while she could only live in a rented room of a few dozen square meters.
She paid for the food, utilities, and even the water and electricity bills at her parents' house. Every time her sister came home, she brought some things with her, but she took even more when she left.
She was laughed at for being an unmarried leftover woman at her age. Qiao Nan knew that her mother didn't want her to get married, she just wanted her salary.
But this was her own mother. Every time she went on a blind date or fell in love, her mother would make a fuss. She had no choice.
After all her hard work over the years, all she got in return was the term "dead girl". Especially when Qiao Zi Qin blamed her for her own affair and divorce, Qiao Nan, clutching the hundred thousand yuan in her hand, suddenly didn't want to give it to Qiao Zi Qin.
Before Qiao Nan could leave, the next conversation she heard truly made her feel cold and desperate.
"What if Qiao Nan raises the two hundred thousand, but we can't find a kidney donor? The doctor said that if a relative is willing to donate a kidney, the compatibility would be higher and there would be less chance of rejection."
Leaning against Ding Jia Yi, Qiao Zi Qin said pitifully, "If there really is a relative's kidney, maybe I could save some money on treatment."
Kidneys are not easy to find, some people wait until they die without getting such an opportunity!
Knowing this, Qiao Zi Qin realized that just having money was not enough to survive, she had to think of other ways.
"Or, mom, should I get a blood test?" Ding Jia Yi asked hesitantly.
Qiao Zi Qin shook her head repeatedly. Her mother was already old, and her kidneys were definitely not better than hers. If she was going to get a kidney, she wanted a good one: "Mom, you're the one who gave birth to me and raised me. I can't bear to see you go under the knife. My dad definitely won't do either."
"Then..." Ding Jia Yi thought for a moment, her eyes lighting up: "When that dead girl comes, I'll have her get a blood test. She's your biological sister, she's definitely a match!"
"That's good, but will Qiao Nan agree? After all, it's a kidney." Qiao Zi Qin's eyes were full of calculation.
In order to survive, to be prepared for any eventuality, she would definitely not give Qiao Nan the chance to refuse.
"Miss Qiao, you're here to see your sister, why don't you go in?" As Qiao Zi Qin and Ding Jia Yi were talking, a nurse's voice came from outside.
Qiao Zi Qin's face changed drastically: "Mom..." Had all their conversation just now been heard by that dead girl Qiao Nan?
Without a word, Ding Jia Yi got up and chased after her, indeed seeing Qiao Nan's retreating figure, then she shouted Qiao Nan's name.
Hearing Ding Jia Yi's shout, Qiao Nan refused to turn back or stop. Tears kept falling, but her heart was shattered.
For her mother and sister, she didn't even have a home of her own. But what about her mother and sister? They had calculated her money and it wasn't enough, now they wanted her kidney.
Qiao Zi Qin's words, Ding Jia Yi didn't understand, but Qiao Nan did. The more she understood, the more Qiao Nan hated. Even if she really owed the Qiao family, she should have paid enough!
Qiao Nan's head hurt, and she wanted to tell her mother that it was dangerous on the street, when a car rushed towards her.
With a "screech" and a "bang", two loud noises exploded in her ears. Qiao Nan was in so much pain that she couldn't speak, but she still forced her eyes open to see how her mother was.
Ding Jia Yi was indeed frightened. Seeing her younger daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over and muttered, "Qiao Nan, it's good if you die. At least you can help your sister if you die. Zi Qin will have a kidney, and there will be money!"
Her younger daughter was hit and killed, and the person who hit her would definitely have to pay compensation.
Hearing Ding Jia Yi's words, Qiao Nan's eyes widened, staring at Ding Jia Yi, and before the paramedics arrived, she was so angry with Ding Jia Yi that she died!
Chapter 1
The most frustrating thing in the world is to fantasize about heaven one moment and find yourself in hell the next.
Mo Wen is such a person. Two months ago, he was sitting in the classroom, dreaming of getting into his desired key university, but now he is working as a laborer on a construction site under the scorching sun.
Thinking of his miserable fate, Mo Wen spat fiercely on the ground and wiped the sweat continuously dripping from his face. He had just finished moving a cart of bricks, and he was already drenched in sweat.
Mo Wen, a teenager of seventeen or eighteen, has an ordinary face, dark skin, a lean body, and a pair of somewhat steady eyes. Perhaps the children of poor families have to grow up early, and despite his young age, he seems mature for his age.
After placing the cement cart full of bricks by the roadside, Mo Wen found a shady spot to sit down. The foreman was not around, so it was a good time to slack off. On the dry and busy construction site, being able to slack off for a while was a blessing.
He sat down boldly on a cement board, his eyes constantly scanning the road. Soon, his eyes lit up; a graceful figure emerged from across the road, immediately attracting his attention.
Although the distance was far and he couldn't see the other person's face, the figure was definitely attractive, especially the elegant walking posture, like a professionally trained model.
Don't underestimate the art of a woman's walk. Mo Wen, who spends his days on the construction site, has the road and sidewalk right across from him.
It seemed like he remembered something, and he pulled out a green metal disc from his shirt. It was the size of a coin, with a thin green iron chain attached, like a strange necklace.
This object was something Mo Wen accidentally found a few days ago when he was demolishing an old house. At that time, he found an old green brick in a wall. The green brick was pitted and dilapidated, probably a century-old antique brick.
If it were any other century-old antique, it might be worth some money, but a green brick, even if it's an antique, is probably worthless.
At that time, Mo Wen casually threw the green brick on the ground, but he didn't expect the green brick to break apart, and a metal ornament fell out from inside, which was the strange necklace in Mo Wen's hand.
The green metal disc was a bit strange, divided into eight areas on the surface, each engraved with various strange symbols.
Mo Wen was not familiar with antiques, but he could tell that the object in his hand was a miniature version of a Bagua disc. Ordinary families would hang a Bagua disc at home to ward off evil spirits and worship as a magical instrument.
Although he was not superstitious and did not believe that the Bagua disc had any ability to ward off evil spirits, he knew that such an ancient Bagua disc should be valuable. It might even be an antique. If sold to an antique dealer, he might become rich overnight.
Mo Wen's eyes were full of longing, and he caressed the Bagua necklace as if he were caressing his lover. Once he became rich, those beautiful women he used to only dare to watch from afar would be at his disposal.
"Something's happened. Something's happened!"
"Something's happened! Call an ambulance quickly."
A noisy shout came from not far away, and soon many people ran towards it. The shouting also interrupted Mo Wen's daydream.
He looked over there with a puzzled look, hesitated for a moment, then stood up and ran towards the crowd.
A quick glance at the situation in front of him made him jump. A middle-aged man in his fifties, dressed in ragged clothes, was lying on the ground convulsing. He was pale, breathing heavily, and clutching his chest tightly, seeming to be in great pain.
From his eyes, there was deep fear, as if he could feel death.
Many workers had rushed over, but no one dared to step forward. A group of workers with little education obviously didn't know what had happened and didn't dare to act rashly.
"Acute myocardial infarction!"
Mo Wen's face changed slightly, and he looked at Old Zhang, who was convulsing on the ground, with some difficulty. He recognized Old Zhang's condition at a glance, because someone in the village had suddenly suffered from acute myocardial infarction and died within a few minutes. He had witnessed the whole process.
The village he lived in was very remote, and there were basically no professional doctors in the village. When someone got sick, they would simply treat it with traditional remedies passed down from their ancestors, without any targeted treatment.
His mother was weak and sickly, and there were no doctors in the village. His biggest dream was to get into the most famous medical university in the country, become a doctor, and treat his mother and the villagers.
Unfortunately, he failed the college entrance examination. With his scores, he could have been admitted to the medical department of Huaxia University and qualified for free admission. However, he was replaced by a privileged young man from a powerful family. Despite having lower scores than him, he was pushed out.
Although his grades could still get him into other good schools, the high tuition fees were something he simply couldn't afford. In order not to burden his mother, he had to give up his studies and start working to earn money.
The construction site was in the outskirts of the city, far from the city center. The nearest hospital ambulance would take 25 minutes to arrive. But looking at the patient's condition, whether he could hold on for 25 minutes was another matter. Holding on for 25 minutes? That would be a miracle!
He knew this man, who lived in the same dormitory as him. His name was Zhang Lao Shi, and everyone called him Old Zhang. He was a simple and honest man. Because he didn't have any skills, he could only do the lowest level of work on the construction site like him.
It was said that he had a son in college, and he worked so hard to earn money to support his son's college education.
Mo Wen looked at his coworker Old Zhang on the ground with some hesitation. His dream was to become a doctor. He had a certain understanding of some simple and common diseases and knew that there were several emergency measures for acute myocardial infarction that could alleviate the condition.
But who dares to save people casually these days? If he could save him, it would naturally be a good thing, but if he couldn't save him and something happened to the patient, the responsibility might fall on him.
Unfortunately, society is so realistic. Perhaps simply taking some emergency measures to alleviate the condition and delay the time of death could save a life. But like the others around him, Mo Wen didn't dare to step forward to help.
Taking a deep breath, he was silent for a while, then finally sighed, stepped forward and walked towards Old Zhang who was having an attack. He was not a do-gooder, but he had a good relationship with Old Zhang. They were both poor rural people who came out to work, deeply understanding each other's hardships. Old Zhang was the pillar of his entire family. Watching Old Zhang die with his own eyes, his conscience couldn't bear it.
"Don't move him, I'm a doctor."
A graceful figure ran from a distance, weaving through the chaotic construction site and jogging to the scene.
Mo Wen was slightly stunned, and instinctively stopped. A fragrant breeze blew, and a graceful figure appeared in front of him.
It was a girl, with a beautiful face and a tall figure, only half a head shorter than Mo Wen. She was wearing a beige floral dress, the hem of which fell at her knees, revealing a pair of slender and fair legs. As she ran, her dress fluttered, making her look charming.
Mo Wen's gaze involuntarily froze. He spent his days on the construction site, stealing glances at young girls passing by, but this was the first time he had seen such a beautiful girl! A naturally beautiful face kept echoing in his mind! Without makeup, she was stunning.
He discovered that the girl in the white dress was the same woman whose figure he had secretly admired from across the street. Now he realized that not only did she have a great figure, but her face was also extraordinarily beautiful.
The girl ignored Mo Wen and squatted down to check on Old Zhang's condition. Her beautiful face quickly changed, indicating that the situation seemed serious.
Mo Wen also knew that the patient was in shock, and the situation was not optimistic.
"Can you help me?"
The girl looked up anxiously at Mo Wen. As he was the closest to the patient, she naturally turned to him first.
"Sure!"
Mo Wen was slightly stunned. He didn't expect the girl to ask for his help, but he quickly reacted and hurried to her side.
"Can you help me straighten his body and slightly lift his legs?" The girl asked while carefully performing chest compressions on Old Zhang.
Mo Wen, who knew some methods to alleviate myocardial infarction, quickly did as the girl said. He knew that the girl's method was correct. Lifting the patient's legs was to prevent the patient in shock from suffering from brain hypoxia. In the absence of oxygen tanks and other equipment, this was the best solution.
He suddenly felt a burning sensation in his chest, which was getting hotter and hotter, as if a red-hot iron block was sticking to his chest. His face changed slightly, and he subconsciously touched his chest, finding that it was the Bagua plate that he had excavated from the blue brick.
An Lin stood on the top of a high-rise building, facing the noisy wind.
The wind was howling, and the feeling of rapid descent made him scream in fear, even though he had nothing to live for. "Help!"
The fear of impending death enveloped his whole body, making every part of his body tremble.
At this moment, An Lin's body was suddenly enveloped by a mysterious white light.
The terrifying feeling of supergravity came at this moment. He felt like he was on a roller coaster, rushing to the bottom, then making a curve and flying into the sky.
An Lin's screams continued as his body flew into the sky and then landed back on the rooftop.
The intense feeling of supergravity and the alternating feeling of life and death made An Lin feel dizzy, and he vomited uncontrollably.
"Hey, young man, are you okay?" At this moment, an elusive voice reached An Lin's ears.
He looked up and saw an old man looking at him with a loving expression.
The old man had white hair and beard, a celestial appearance, and was surrounded by golden celestial energy, looking pure and flawless.
Seeing this, An Lin was shocked, and countless scenarios flooded his mind.
Various scenarios began to appear in An Lin's mind. Wasn't this the beginning of all the dreams?
Thump!
An Lin kowtowed heavily, tears welling up in his eyes, "Immortal, thank you for saving me!"
The old man, who was called an immortal by An Lin, stroked his white beard and smiled slightly, "Young man, you are in the prime of your life, why do you choose to end it?"
"My mother passed away early, and my father is addicted to gambling." "After my father lost our house in gambling, he owed millions of gambling debts that he couldn't repay, and then he ran away!"
"Millions! What can I use to repay it?"
"Then I was forced to drop out of school and work for the creditor."
An Lin sobbed as he poured out his feelings, feeling that his life was bleak. A life spent repaying debts was no different from a salted fish, it would be better to reincarnate early.
After hearing An Lin's experiences, the immortal also had a sympathetic look in his eyes. He slowly said, "Young man, your life is really hard... Well, since we met, it must be fate. And I see that you have excellent qualifications, why don't I give you a 'system' to change your life?"
Upon hearing this, An Lin trembled. He thought it was a great fortune to have a connection with an immortal, but he didn't expect the immortal to be so generous as to give him a system at their first meeting!
"Woo woo woo, Immortal Grandpa, you are really too good to me! I really don't know how to repay you!"
The immortal smiled kindly, raised his palm to the sky, and then a pure white light ball appeared in his palm.
"Young man, come here and hold this light ball in your hand." The immortal said to An Lin.
Upon hearing this, An Lin was extremely excited and couldn't wait to hold the light ball.
The light ball in his hand emitted a warm current, and the light it emitted was extremely soft.
"Initiate system transfer." The immortal slowly said.
As soon as the immortal's words fell, the light from the white light ball flourished!
At this moment, the immortal said to An Lin, "Young man, make a vow quickly, swear to accept this War God system, and never abandon it in your life!"
War God system?
What a domineering name!
But why does this oath sound like a marriage vow?
Without thinking too much, An Lin quickly said, "I swear to accept the War God system and never abandon it in my life!"
As soon as An Lin finished his oath, the light ball shot into his body and merged with him.
Then, a voice sounded in his mind, "Host detected as Tianming Dao physique, qualified, system begins to merge!"
An Lin was very excited, so excited that he wanted to cry.
He originally thought his life was bleak, but he didn't expect a turn for the better, and at this moment, he welcomed the life of a plug-in system!
The immortal was also very excited, and he was so excited that he was already crying!
"Immortal Grandpa, what's wrong with you, are you okay?" Seeing the old man's strange behavior, An Lin asked curiously.
The immortal came back to his senses, wiped his tears, and realized that he had lost his composure.
"Young man, after getting the system, you must work hard." The immortal said earnestly.
"Yes! I will!" An Lin nodded heavily.
"So, do you want to go to school to cultivate immortality?" The immortal asked again.
Go to school to cultivate immortality? Only a fool would refuse!
"Yes, I really want to cultivate immortality!"
An Lin almost didn't think about it, and answered immediately. The immortal smiled with satisfaction, took out a golden piece of paper and handed it to An Lin, then said, "This is my recommendation letter. With it, you can go to the Cultivation Union University to study and officially embark on the path of cultivation."
An Lin was shocked. It turned out that the immortal had paved the way for his cultivation!
He solemnly took the recommendation letter from the immortal, looking at the immortal with gratitude.
An Lin was very curious about this immortal who had given him a new life.
"As for my name... let's not say it." The immortal gently stroked An Lin's head, his face showing a sympathetic expression.
"I have to go, young man, goodbye."
The immortal bid farewell to An Lin, and then flew away on a cloud.
"Immortal, take care!" An Lin bowed gratefully to the immortal flying into the sky.
The immortal's laughter came from the sky, the laughter was extremely cheerful, extremely unrestrained, as if he was venting a lifetime of grievances.
Why is this immortal so happy? Why does it feel like he's happier than me?
An Lin was puzzled.
At this moment, a female voice sounded in An Lin's consciousness: "Hello."
This female voice was beautiful and melodious, like a heavenly sound, making An Lin shiver all over.
Is this the voice of the system?
An Lin was uncertain.
At this moment, a interface appeared in An Lin's mind.
The interface was gray, with only a few words displayed on it: The functions of the War God system will be activated after entering the Primordial Continent.
What the hell is the Primordial Continent?
An Lin thought of the recommendation letter given by the immortal. He opened the golden paper in his hand with anticipation.
Then, he found that there was nothing inside the golden paper, only a slightly recessed handprint.
An Lin was a little confused, but he still put his hand on the paper, overlapping with the handprint.
Suddenly, the paper shone brightly with golden light. An Lin only had time to exclaim in surprise before he was completely swallowed by the golden light.
An Lin felt a dizzying sensation, his vision went from pitch black to bright again.
Then he found himself once again high in the sky, beginning to free fall.
An Lin once again experienced the feeling of jumping off a building, a thrilling sensation that made him want to cry no matter how many times he experienced it.
An Lin struggled to lift his head, then saw a scene he would never forget.
Two white dragon gate pillars, hundreds of feet tall, stood between the sky, with a plaque engraved with mysterious characters that he couldn't understand.
Beyond the gate, there were countless palaces, stretching as far as the eye could see.
Colorful clouds floated around the palaces, various mythical beasts soared between heaven and earth, presenting a grand and magnificent fairy-like scene.
An Lin stood in place, his face full of shock.
So, this world really does have fairylands!
An Lin tried to calm his emotions and cool down.
After a while, he saw a woman in a Taoist robe approaching and hurriedly went to greet her.
"Hello, fairy sister." An Lin waved to the woman.
The beautiful woman saw An Lin waving at her and walked over.
Seeing this, An Lin excitedly asked, "Beautiful fairy sister, can you tell me where this is? I'm new here and don't know much about this place."
Hearing An Lin's words, the woman looked a bit strange, then said, "Jili gulu?"
"Ah, what did you say?" An Lin was confused.
The woman showed the same expression as An Lin and said, "Jili gulu wa lei jili?"
At this moment, An Lin was stunned, a terrible guess appeared in his mind.
"Fairy sister, can you speak Mandarin?" An Lin's eyes were a bit moist.
"Gulu gulu wa ji ji ji?" The beautiful woman put her hands on her hips, looking a bit angry.
It's over, there's a language barrier.
What is she saying? I don't understand at all!
Nani? In the end, An Lin cried.
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
On a platform, hundreds of people were screaming and cheering, surrounded by dozens of cars, most of which were super sports cars.
The most eye-catching place was the two cars about to start the race.
One was the most expensive red Ferrari 488 on the field, worth more than four million, and the other was the cheapest Ford Mustang on the field, worth five hundred thousand. The two cars formed a stark contrast.
This was a showdown between Liu Feng, the new young master of Beijing, and Zhang Han, one of the former four young masters.
Next to the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han silently leaned against the car door. His clothes were shabby, his hair was long, and his bangs covered his eyes when he lowered his head. People couldn't see his closed eyes. From the lower half of his face that was exposed, one could vaguely see the unique handsomeness of the young master Zhang, but his current temperament was full of decadence.
As for Liu Feng, he was like the center of attention in the crowd on the right, his expression as if the world was at his feet.
"Let's go see the once high and mighty young master Zhang."
Liu Feng waved his hand, a cold smile on his lips as he led the way.
"Young Master Zhang?"
"Are you asleep? The once arrogant young master Zhang is now in such a state, tsk tsk, the race is about to start, and you're still acting indifferent, my young master Zhang!"
"He looks like a beggar now!"
"No, I think he's even worse than a beggar, maybe he's living on pig food."
On the side of the Ford Mustang, a chubby man with glasses stood, next to him was a three or four-year-old girl.
The little girl was cute as a doll, wearing a white dress, her delicate little face like a cute princess from a fairy tale, except her hair was a bit messy, everything else was perfect. However, at this moment, the little girl's clear eyes were filled with tears of grievance. Listening to the crowd's ridicule of Zhang Han, she seemed about to cry.
If it were normal times, the little girl's cute appearance would probably attract a lot of attention, but now, it was Liu Feng's solo performance time.
A round of mockery finally elicited a response from Zhang Han.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes, there was a look of confusion in them. Seeing the behavior of the people in front of him, his gaze hardened, his eyes full of contempt for the world.
"You ants dare to bark in front of me?"
Zhang Han suddenly blurted out such a strange sentence.
The whole field was silent for a moment, but the next moment, a wave of sarcastic laughter broke out.
"Zhang Han, I think you're fucking crazy!"
"Probably turned into an idiot."
The crowd started mocking again, but when Zhang Han saw the scene in front of him, he was stunned.
"Isn't this when I was racing with Liu Feng on Wolf Mountain in '09?"
"Why am I here?"
"Wasn't I crossing the heavenly tribulation?"
"Could it be... I've come back?"
"Was I reborn by the Nine Heavens Divine Thunder of the Heavenly Tribulation?" A tremor flashed in Zhang Han's eyes.
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight major families in Beijing. Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at the time, so Zhang Han was fearless. But once, when his family was traveling by plane, they encountered a plane crash. His parents and sister died, and his second uncle, Zhang Ming, became the head of the family, but he couldn't prevent the decline of the Zhang family.
Zhang Han was greatly hit at the time, believing that his family had been murdered. He began to secretly investigate Zhang Ming, who had always hated his father, but was discovered. Coupled with the many people Zhang Han had offended before, he was eventually driven out of the Zhang family.
It's been five years now, and Zhang Han refuses to leave. He has always wanted to investigate the matter. Life is hard, but he persists, until this incident at Wolf Mountain.
He remembered that during the car race on Wolf Mountain, he had an accident and was seriously injured, losing both arms. He struggled for five years and eventually committed suicide by jumping off a cliff, but unexpectedly entered the world of cultivation. When he started to get in touch with cultivation, Zhang Han awakened a divine ability - Treasure Sniffing Nose. His nose could smell the aura of treasures within a certain range.
With this divine ability, over five hundred years, Zhang Han had accumulated his cultivation to the extreme with various treasures.
"Why isn't it five years ago?"
Zhang Han's expression showed a hint of desolation.
Not being filial has always been Zhang Han's biggest regret. Before his relatives left, he was young and reckless and didn't understand things. He caused a lot of trouble for his father and said a lot of things that hurt his mother. No matter how much he regretted it, he couldn't make up for it.
Filial piety is the most important virtue. Although Zhang Han was rebellious at the time, his love for his parents was no less than others.
The tree wants to be quiet but the wind does not stop, the son wants to support but the parents are not there.
"Zhang Han!"
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's thoughts. Looking up, he saw Liu Feng looking at him with cold eyes.
"Five years ago, you drove me out of Beijing!
Today, five years later, I, Liu Feng, the King of Cars in Los Angeles, have made a strong comeback, while you, Zhang Han, are living worse than a pig or a dog! Remember, today I, Liu Feng, will make you, Zhang Han, leave Beijing horizontally!"
"Oh, that's impressive?" Zhang Han exclaimed in surprise, "Then I won't compete."
"Zhang Han!"
Liu Feng shook the car key of the Ferrari in his hand and said, "As long as you beat me, this car is yours." "Then I can't refuse your kindness."
Zhang Han said with a smile.
"Heh."
Liu Feng sneered, raised his hand and ordered his men, "Set up the screen!"
As soon as the words fell, several TV screens were set up behind him, and at the same time, remote-controlled planes rose up in various places on Wolf Mountain. When the screens were turned on, the cameras on the remote-controlled planes transmitted back, reflecting the entire race track of Wolf Mountain.
"Let's get ready to start!"
Liu Feng nodded secretly to the chubby guy in the glasses behind the Ford Mustang, and got into the Ferrari.
"Daddy, Come on, Beat the bad guys."
"How can this cute little girl casually call someone daddy?"
Zhang Han shook his head with a smile.
"Brother Han, you can definitely win!"
The chubby guy clenched his fist at Zhang Han, making an encouraging expression.
"May your words bring me luck, your car will bring me good fortune."
Zhang Han glanced at him lightly and sat sideways into the Mustang.
"Get ready!"
The engines of the two cars roared angrily at the same time.
Inside the Ferrari, a smug smile hung on the corner of Liu Feng's mouth.
The chubby guy behind showed a meaningful smile.
The cute princess at his feet was full of fear and worry, her eyes filled with tears, looking pitiful.
And in the Mustang, Zhang Han had a cold smile on his lips.
"Are you conspiring to harm me?"
"Unfortunately, I am not the same person I used to be." "Even if I have no cultivation now, how can you ants provoke me?"
Chapter One
Rusty Lake.
Federal Special Waste Disposal Site No. 23.
Also known as the "Treasure Tomb".
With the continuous development of the cultivation civilization, the treasures that were once high above and could only be driven by cultivators have entered thousands of households, becoming essential tools for ordinary people to travel, study and work.
While bringing convenience to life, it also produced a large amount of scrapped treasures and metal waste.
Most of these waste treasures still retain a lot of spiritual power, which can easily cause radiation pollution. The array of symbols that construct the treasures is extremely unstable, and there is even a risk of explosion. If left unchecked, it will cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the Federation, there will always be several "special waste disposal sites" set up to specifically deal with scrapped treasures.
Special Waste Disposal Site No. 23, located in the southern suburbs of the Federation's cultivation town "Floating City".
Under the dim sky, a swamp polluted into purple, emitting a strong stench, the peaks composed of metal fragments are like hundreds of dinosaurs showing their backs from the swamp. The peaks are full of broken flying swords, next to the flying swords sits a rusty crystal puppet, the hollow eye sockets have long extinguished the spiritual fire, only the small insects that feed on spiritual energy stick their heads out from inside, carefully looking at this dangerous "treasure tomb".
"Boom!"
Countless metal components scattered like flowers, splashing around, causing a chain collapse of several garbage mountains around, raising dust in the sky, like demons dancing, obscuring the entire sky.
Here, it seems to be a forbidden zone for life, only insignificant cockroaches and worms regard this place as a paradise.
Li Yao hid behind a garbage mountain, licked his cracked lips, his earthy yellow windbreaker was full of dust, making him blend with the environment.
He glanced at the rising explosion cloud not far away, the clear eyes of the teenager did not reveal any emotions, and there was no wave.
Only when the soil and metal fragments splashed onto the garbage mountain where he was hiding, he slightly retracted into the garbage pile, and at the same time put on goggles that could cover half of his face.
"Here it comes!"
At 3:52:38 in the afternoon, the daily routine garbage dumping time, and also the carnival moment for Li Yao, a "garbage bug"!
The spiritual watch worn on his left wrist is a hunting-specific model launched by the cultivation sect "Flying Spirit Sect" three years ago. He picked it up in the garbage mountain and took a full two months to repair it.
In addition to timing, it also has a very powerful function, which can record special frequency vibrations, and notify the owner when a specific vibration comes nearby.
This function was originally used to remind hunters that there may be powerful monsters nearby.
But after Li Yao's modification, it became a reminder that the garbage ship is about to appear.
A moment later, accompanied by a negligible buzzing sound, more than a dozen black spots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time, the dust from the explosion has not yet dissipated, and more than a dozen small black spots are mixed in it, and they cannot be distinguished at all.
Li Yao shrugged his nose, his fingers lightly touched a rune on the side of the goggles, "swish", the surface of the goggles glowed red.
Under the scan of the red light, the garbage ship hidden behind the dust was outlined with a round and round figure, clear and clear.
And the hunting function of the spiritual watch also firmly locked the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
"Garbage Ship No. 1327, it's you!"
From birth to ten years old, Li Yao has been staying in the Treasure Tomb for ten years. He is familiar with every inch of land here and every garbage ship in the sky. This "No. 1327 Garbage Ship" is responsible for collecting the garbage in the "Upper East District" of Floating City.
The Upper East District is the most luxurious wealthy area in the city, with many cultivators living in it, and the treasures they discard are the most valuable.
Many treasures are even intact, just because they are slightly old, or a new generation of products have been launched, they are discarded by cultivators and tycoons without care.
For Li Yao, this is not a garbage ship at all, it is simply a treasure ship loaded with gold mines!
"Whoosh!"
Li Yao exerted force on both feet, shot out like a bullet, rushed between the garbage mountains, rushed into the dust, and rushed towards the "No. 1327 Garbage Ship"!
Surrounded by shaky garbage mountains, under the feet is the "gurgling" bubbling poisonous swamp, Li Yao is like the most agile monkey in the mountains and forests, from time to time borrowing force from a protruding part of the garbage mountain, each step can bounce tens of meters away, the movements are smooth and pleasing to the eye.
"Li Yao, you bastard, you're stealing food from me again!"
At this moment, more than a dozen figures sprang out from behind several garbage mountains, dressed similarly to Li Yao, but without his advanced red goggles and spiritual watches.
These people all held shovels and iron rods in their hands, and they were aggressive.
Like Li Yao, they are all garbage bugs who make a living by "Special Waste Disposal Site No. 23".
Where there are benefits, there are struggles. A ship of abandoned treasures may be just garbage for the high cultivators, but for these poor people at the bottom, it is the hope of survival. Li Yao is the best garbage bug in the Treasure Tomb, and naturally it is a thorn in the eyes of most garbage bugs.
Li Yao didn't care, he smiled, his waist suddenly exerted force, his figure strangely turned, and he turned ninety degrees without warning, avoiding a fat teenager with angry eyebrows in front of him, and even took advantage of the situation to step on his fat face. With this foot, the whole person rushed out another thirty or forty meters.
"Fat Dragon, we all come out to mix food, it's about who is faster, you should lose weight!"
The fat teenager had a huge red mark on his face, his nose was almost sinking into the fat, and he was so angry that he yelled, directing his subordinates to chase after him, and a group of people quickly entered the dust area.
There has just been an explosion here, which is extremely unstable. Dozens of garbage mountains may collapse at any time. Even the vicious and vicious Fat Dragon and his gang of teenagers can't help but slow down when they enter this place, watching Li Yao rushing like the wind.
Fat Dragon couldn't help but spit out a mouthful.
Before the words fell, another explosion occurred inside a garbage mountain not far from Li Yao, and tens of thousands of tons of metal components and broken treasures rushed down like a mountain flood!
"So spiritual!"
But I heard a scream from the dust: "Little Black, help!"
A black light that was deeper than the night sky shot out, turned a circle in the metal mountain flood, and then rushed into the sky. It was a rusty, notched, and black flying sword. This flying sword has a huge guard like black wings. Li Yao lay on the flying sword like a drowning man holding on to a straw, surrounded by black light, rushing towards the sky!
In the sky, more than a dozen garbage ships have revealed their huge bodies. Each garbage ship is hundreds of meters long. The round and round body is like the turtle in the legend that supports the earth. The "turtle shell" is densely engraved with tens of thousands of runes. The spiritual light flashes, colorful, helping these tens of thousands of tons of big guys resist the invasion of gravity.
"Splash!"
The hatch doors of the "giant turtles" opened one by one, spewing out a sky-covering amount of metal components and broken magical treasures, crashing heavily towards the ground.
For a moment, the spiritual energy between heaven and earth was stirred up wildly, causing a stormy sea!
Even the garbage ship weighing tens of thousands of tons was swaying left and right in the wave of spiritual energy, violently shaking, and had to desperately separate to reduce interference.
Fat Dragon and others dared not approach easily, fearing being affected.
Li Yao was still riding his black flying sword, darting left and right in the wave of spiritual energy. Although he looked extremely embarrassed, he was as flexible as a loach.
Of course, he dared not confront the stormy sea head-on, but relied on his decades of survival experience to find a relatively calm safe area between the tides of spiritual energy, just to get as close as possible to the landing point of the garbage magical treasures, the closer to the water tower, the first to get the moon.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage ship roared like a beast, turned direction, and lazily returned, and the dust gradually dissipated.
Fat Dragon finally managed to crawl into the center of the dense garbage dump, only to see Li Yao sitting comfortably on a brand new garbage mountain, smiling at him.
"Damn it!"
Fat Dragon's face was shaking with fat, but he was quite tangled in his heart.
The garbage mountain chosen by Li Yao was quite clever. It was not the largest garbage mountain, and it didn't look like the richest one.
There are dozens of garbage mountains scattered around, containing valuable garbage magical treasures.
If he continues to entangle with Li Yao here, he might be taken advantage of by other garbage bugs.
There are already faint figures of other garbage bugs around, and cheers are heard on many garbage mountains, which means that someone has found something valuable.
Fat Dragon heard that Li Yao, this stinky boy, is still a famous student of the "Red Sky Sect Affiliated Second High School" in Floating City.
The Red Sky Sect is a well-known large sect in the southern part of the Federation, with strong strength and many masters.
Although Li Yao may not have learned any true teachings, he is not something that can be dealt with by a few punches and kicks. Otherwise, he would not have been rampaging in the tomb of magical treasures for more than a decade, still alive and kicking, and even earned the nickname "Vulture"!
But if he just leaves like this, where can he put his face?
His nose is still embedded in the flesh! While he was struggling in his heart, a gust of wind swept over, and Fat Dragon subconsciously reached out and grabbed it. It was a scrapped crystal brain the size of a fist.
Li Yao smiled and said, "Fat Dragon, we are all out to make a living. It's just that I robbed you of a 'Starlight' level crystal brain last time. It's not like I killed your dad. Is it necessary to be so endless? Here, I just found a 'Xiaolong 17' crystal brain made by the 'Qinglong Gate'. It is the most advanced model. It can calculate more than 5,000 thoughts per second. Although it is burned out, I estimate it can sell for three to four thousand. Just as I respect you, Brother Fat Dragon, let's call it even, how about it?"
"You..." Fat Dragon didn't expect Li Yao to come up with this, and he was stunned for a moment, scratching the fat on his face in disbelief.
"Hey, look over there, the people from the 'Wild Wolf Gang' are coming soon. They are not like me, a lone traveler. They will definitely eat up dozens of garbage mountains and won't even leave you a screw!" Li Yao pointed to the west.
"Good boy, you have a set! Let's go, hurry up and sweep the goods!"
A group of garbage bugs scattered and rushed towards the garbage mountains in all directions.
Li Yao took a long breath, sat down on the garbage pile, sweat the size of soybeans rolled down his forehead, and his smiling face instantly turned gloomy.
"Damn fat man, my hard-found 'Xiaolong' level crystal brain, you got it for nothing!"
"Wait for it, is my 'Vulture Li Yao's' stuff so easy to take?
One day I will make you spit out what you ate of mine, return what you took of mine, and add interest, calculated at usury, let you know why everyone calls me 'money-grubbing vulture'!"
"No, I must speed up. Those bastards from the 'Wild Wolf Gang' are even more unreasonable than Fat Dragon!"
"Mom, how many times have I told you, I went to save people, not to commit suicide!"
"Don't lie to your mother, you can't even dog paddle, and you're saving people? Besides, there's no one in the river!"
Wang Yao was speechless. Today he came down from the mountain and saw someone falling into the river by the village. He hurriedly jumped down to save the person. After jumping down, he remembered that he couldn't swim. What's more ironic is that the person who fell into the water was not a person, but an inflatable doll, a very realistic one.
"Is there anyone in the village who is so fashionable to use this thing?!"
This was his last thought before losing consciousness. When he woke up again, he was lying on the kang at home, next to his parents, with worried expressions.
And less than a day later, the whole village knew that the silly college student who had contracted the mountain and planted medicinal herbs was depressed and jumped into the river to commit suicide. "Kids these days, they haven't experienced setbacks, they can't stand the blow!"
"That kid must have gone crazy in school, where are the brand-name college students who come back to farm?"
"Exactly!"
"We're not planting this medicine anymore!"
The father who had been squatting and smoking a pipe suddenly blurted out this sentence. The villagers are good-faced, these rumors, Old Wang listened to his heart and was upset, and if he continued to plant, he would lose some money, and he might even lose his son.
"That's right, listen to your mother this time, don't plant medicinal herbs anymore, go to the city another day and let your sister help you find a decent job. Your Changmao third uncle's child just graduated from an unknown school, found a job in the city, and now he's buying a house there!" Wang Yao's mother also chimed in.
After hearing this, Wang Yao no longer argued with his parents and had to nod in agreement.
He was originally a graduate of a prestigious university. After graduation, he returned to the mountain village with a passion, started his own business, contracted a barren mountain in the village, wanted to plant medicinal herbs, and get rich. But when he really started doing it, he found that planting medicinal herbs was not as simple as he thought. It was not enough to have a passion, and many things were not in the books, but had to rely on practice and experience.
In the first year, the medicinal herbs he planted got a disease and lost all his capital. In the second year, the medicinal herbs bloomed and grew leaves but did not grow roots. This is the third year. Just when things seemed to be getting better, this happened.
But after feeling better, he went up to the south mountain again. This is a barren mountain. Perhaps because of the soil, it doesn't grow crops very well, but there are more than a dozen large chestnut trees and jujube trees. There is a large gentle slope on the mountain, where he painstakingly reclaimed several acres of medicinal fields. For this, he specially paid for someone to build a small house on the mountain and pulled up electricity to take care of these few acres of medicinal fields. Through wind and rain, spring, summer, autumn and winter, he has devoted three years of hard work. Saying to give up, he really can't bear it.
Looking at the well-grown medicinal herbs, he reached out and touched them.
Why not try another year?
"Detected medicinal herbs, trigger conditions met, activate system?"
A cold mechanical voice suddenly sounded.
"What sound, who?!"
There was no one around, only mountains, water, and woods.
"Hiss, is it a hallucination?"
"Do you want to activate the system?"
The mechanical voice sounded again, seemingly just within reach.
"There's a ghost!"
Wang Yao shivered all over.
Pharmacist system?
As soon as he said these words, a light screen appeared in front of him, very much like the character panel in Wang You's mind.
Hallucination, it must be a hallucination.
He shook his head hard, and the light screen that appeared out of thin air disappeared.
Woof woof woof, at this moment, a local dog rushed down from the mountain and came to his side, panting with its tongue out, wagging its tail, looking very happy.
"Sanxian, where have you been again?"
This is the local dog raised by Wang Yao, who has accompanied him on this mountain for three years. The man and the dog entered the small house on the mountain, Wang Yao lay down on the bed, feeling a bit dizzy.
"What was that just now?"
He recited the name of that thing again, and the light screen appeared again, like a projection.
"Here it comes again!"
After several experiments, Wang Yao confirmed that this thing was not an illusion, but a real existence, something that could not be explained by science. It has character attributes, skills, and a package, much like an online game.
Job Level: Rookie (Actually, you can't even be considered a bird, at most an egg!)
Constitution 1, Strength 0.9, Spirit 0.85, Agility 0.9, Will 1.1 (1 is the average level of a normal adult male).
Is this real? He was completely stunned.
Great, he is now planting medicinal herbs, just what he needs! Wang Yao, who had come back to his senses, jumped up excitedly, startling "Sanxian" next to him.
Is there another skill panel? Wang Yao wanted to click but couldn't see.
"Why can't I open it?" He asked subconsciously.
"You can't even plant herbs well, and you want to do other things, go shovel shit!"
It seemed to hear his question, and such a line popped up on the panel.
Damn, what's going on? Who designed this, come out, I promise I won't kill you! "What is this again?"
Wang Yao clicked on the package column and found a symbol like a water bottle.
Ancient Spring Pot, contains ancient spring water, one bucket a day.
How to use it, reach out and take it?
Wang Yao had a thought, and there was something more in his hand, it was a wooden water bottle, antique, holding it in his hand, it was quite heavy, shaking it lightly, there was water gurgling inside.
"There really is water! Ancient spring water?"
He found a water bucket from the room and poured out the water from the water bottle. The small bottle kept pouring out water until the entire water bucket was filled.
How magical?
! Wang Yao stared blankly at the water in the bucket, very clean and pure, scooped up a mouthful and put it in his mouth, very sweet.
Delicious!
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank it, drank three big bowls before stopping, after drinking this water, he felt much more comfortable, and the fatigue on his body was gone.
Woof woof woof, Sanxian was circling around the bucket.
"Come, you drink some too."
Wang Yao also filled a bowl in its drinking basin, and the local dog quickly drank it up, then barked again, wagging its tail, obviously it hadn't had enough.
"Okay, let you drink enough!"
This man and dog drank almost half a bucket, if they weren't too full, they would probably drink up the whole bucket.
Wang Yao had never drunk such sweet water in his life.
Chapter One: I Need to Lose Weight!
In the scorching summer, the Chi Yun Rainforest, located in the eastern part of the Federation, is shrouded in mist, like a thin veil surrounding it. The towering ancient trees crisscross, and from the dense canopy, occasionally a few birds soar into the sky, screeching as they fly across the horizon.
In the sky, the sun, which seems to exist eternally, is no longer as people remember it. Years ago, it was pierced by an indescribably large ancient bronze sword, revealing half of the sword tip!
This ancient sword seems to have experienced countless ages, coming from the stars, exuding endless vicissitudes, and even a strong pressure, forming a halo, covering the sky, as if it could suppress the earth and make all beings worship!
From a distance, this scene of the sword and the rainforest looks like a painting, until the buzzing sound from afar breaks it. A large red hot air balloon ship is slowly flying over the rainforest.
The cabin of this hot air balloon ship is large enough to accommodate hundreds of people. Many young boys and girls can be seen in groups of three or five on the deck, occasionally bursting into laughter.
They are students from Phoenix City who have been admitted to one of the four major Taoist academies of the Federation, the Piaomiao Taoist Academy. They are taking this airship belonging to the Piaomiao Taoist Academy, crossing thousands of miles, to study at the Piaomiao Taoist Academy.
Perhaps due to the anticipation of studying, the journey is not boring for these young boys and girls. Between the boys and girls, there is some vague attraction, making this long journey somewhat enjoyable.
Because the journey is long, the airship is equipped with a restaurant, a spiritual cultivation room, a medical room, and other areas.
At this moment, in the restaurant of the airship, there are many students. Next to one of the dining tables, there is a chubby boy with a protruding belly.
This chubby boy is about seventeen or eighteen years old, wearing a large blue robe, his round face can barely be considered handsome. He is patting his belly, making a popping sound, while regretfully looking at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him.
"I'm going to gain three pounds from this meal, why couldn't I resist? If I want to become the President of the Federation, I can't die young."
The chubby boy, with a worried look on his face, burped in regret. This chubby boy is called Wang Baole, who is also one of the students admitted to the Piaomiao Taoist Academy this time. His lifelong dream is to become an official, and to become the President of the Federation is his lifelong pursuit. The reason for having such a great ideal is closely related to his childhood experience.
In his memory, when he was young, his father often patted his head with deep emotion.
"Baole, it's good to be an official. You must remember that although money can solve everything, you will still be bullied. If you want not to be bullied, you must become an official and be superior to others."
At first, Wang Baole didn't understand, until he was scolded by the class monitor for not handing in his homework on time in elementary school. After he gave the monitor two pieces of candy, he was reported to the teacher by the monitor. This left an indelible mark on his young mind.
So from that moment on, he wanted to be the class monitor, not to bully others, but to prevent himself from being bullied.
But as he grew up, he found that there were many people who could bully the class monitor, so he thought that if he became the highest official, that is, the President of the Federation, no one would dare to bully him. The reason why he tried his best to get into the Piaomiao Taoist Academy was that all the high officials of the Federation graduated from the four major Taoist academies.
However, he was not very lucky. His family's bloodline was very peculiar. He still remembers the night a year ago when his thin father showed him the family tree in the ancestral hall.
That was the first time Wang Baole saw the family tree. He clearly saw that all the ancestors who weighed more than 200 pounds died young and did not live past 35.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream... he hadn't waited to become the President of the Federation, and he had reunited with those fat grandfathers.
In the following year, for him, losing weight had risen to a certain height. Even after the Federation entered the Lingyuan era, with the richness of spiritual energy and the resurgence of ancient martial arts, there were various ways to lose weight. But Wang Baole had almost tried all of them, and his weight was still steadily increasing.
The emergence of memories made Wang Baole grit his teeth and determined to lose weight again tomorrow.
With this decision, Wang Baole felt a lot less pressure. While picking his teeth and humming a tune, he looked up at the blue sky outside the window, and his mind began to become active.
"I don't know if Dr. Lu likes the gift I sent him. It's an antique I sneaked out from home. He should like it."
Wang Baole comforted himself, thinking that as long as he got close to Dr. Lu, he would have a small backing in the Taoist Academy in the future.
"The old man has limited power, but I should also send some gifts in the future. But this Dr. Lu is old and must have a lot of connections. I think I made the right move."
Thinking of this, Wang Baole was very pleased, feeling that he was one step closer to the position of the President of the Federation.
He was very confident that he could become the President of the Federation. This confidence mainly came from all the autobiographies of high officials he had studied from childhood to adulthood, and he even summarized several killer moves for being an official.
At this moment, feeling happy in body and mind, Wang Baole looked at the blue sky outside the window and felt it was exceptionally beautiful.
But soon, his eyes widened in surprise, noticing that in the distant sky, a black cloud was gathering, spreading like it was about to cover the sky. Inside it, there was thunder and lightning, flashing a series of electric lights, slowly approaching. This scene also attracted the attention of many students and caused exclamations.
Wang Baole was also taken aback. After the Federation entered the Lingyuan era, the emergence of spiritual energy led to the birth of many astonishing phenomena in the world. The original flying objects were no longer safe, which led to the birth of hot air balloon airships driven by spirit stones.
With the continuous exclamations, the rumbling thunder suddenly came, and the loud noise was shocking. You could see that the distant thunder and magnetic black cloud was rapidly growing, and the lightning inside had spread out, like a black net, flashing across the sky, dazzling and shocking, making people's hearts beat faster. The originally moving airship also began to slow down.
Just as everyone was uneasy, the door of the restaurant was pushed open, and a wind seemed to howl. An old man in a white Taoist robe walked in. This old man had a face full of wrinkles, but he had an immortal wind and bone, a dignified face, especially his eyes were shining, and his righteousness spread all around. As soon as he arrived, his majestic voice spread throughout the restaurant.
"Everyone, report to the Spirit Cultivation Room immediately, put on your magnetic spirit suits, and we will enter the Thunder Magnetic Zone in half an incense stick's time!"
As soon as these words came out, the students in the restaurant stood up in awe.
Wang Baole's eyes lit up. The old man in front of him was Dr. Lu, whom he had given a gift to before. Looking at the other's dragon-like and tiger-like momentum, Wang Baole felt more and more that his previous investment was not wrong, and secretly said that this old man must be extraordinary, and he was even more clever.
Just as he was feeling proud, the old doctor glanced around and saw Wang Baole. He snorted, walked over, took out half of a black mask from his bosom, and threw it on Wang Baole.
"At such a young age, don't put your mind on some messy things. You haven't even entered the Taoist Academy yet, and you've learned to give gifts. I've seen a lot of people, so keep this mask for yourself." The old doctor looked solemn, with a clear and upright look, as if he was reprimanding Wang Baole with disappointment.
Wang Baole took the mask, his heart thumped, realizing that the old doctor was angry. He was a bit anxious and wanted to explain, but suddenly remembered the killer move he had summarized from those high-ranking officials' autobiographies. One of them was to admit mistakes in front of superiors as soon as possible, which often minimized the problem.
So he took a deep breath, quickly put on a remorseful look, and admitted his mistake.
"Teacher, you're right, I was wrong!"
The old doctor was a bit surprised. The words he originally wanted to scold were somewhat stuck because of the other party's quick admission of mistake.
Seeing the old doctor's expression, Wang Baole breathed a sigh of relief, feeling a bit proud, thinking that the high-ranking officials' autobiographies were indeed useful.
The old doctor snorted, raised his head to scan all the students in the restaurant, and pointed at everyone with his right hand.
"And you guys, you are all the future students of my Piaomiao Taoist Academy. Look at what you've been like these days. You must always remember that we martial artists should first establish ourselves, then speak, and then act!"
The old doctor was deeply disgusted. His words echoed in the restaurant, making everyone lower their heads in shame after hearing them. But Wang Baole's eyes brightened, thinking it was time to show himself.
So he quickly took out a small notebook from his bosom and started recording on it, occasionally looking up at the old doctor with a listening expression, and sometimes nodding seriously, as if to remember every word the other party said. This move was also a killer move he summarized from the high-ranking officials' autobiographies.
When the other students saw this, they looked at Wang Baole as if they were looking at a god.
Seeing this, the old doctor was also stunned for a moment, a sense of strangeness he had never felt before rose in his heart. He had seen so many students come and go, but this was the first time he had encountered such a strange person. He couldn't help but look at him a few more times, but gradually began to sneer.
"Little guy, it's not so easy to flatter me. You should thank this thunderstorm. Otherwise, I could scold you for three days and three nights. I want to see if you can write all of it in your notebook!"
As soon as the old doctor's words came out, his momentum changed instantly. A strong aura emanated from him, as if it turned into a pressure, covering the entire restaurant. All the students were stunned, feeling that in this battle, the old doctor was still a foot taller.
Wang Baole blinked, touched the recording jade slip in his pocket, weighed it for a long time, looked at the approaching thunderstorm, and finally gave up the idea of taking it out. He felt that it was not shameful to be submissive in front of his superiors.
Seeing the expressions of the crowd, the old doctor was pleased and spoke passionately again.
"Remember, focus on cultivation in the future. Don't be greedy, don't be unrighteous, and don't always think about finding a female companion. You should know that lust is a sharp knife. These days, you guys have been too improper!"
Just as he was saying this, suddenly, a delicate voice floated out from the old doctor's communication bracelet.
"Grandpa doctor, where are you? I can't tie this magnetic spirit suit, come and help me."
The voice was charming. As soon as the old doctor heard it, his body involuntarily trembled. He coughed dryly, glared at everyone seriously, then turned around and left in a hurry, while excitedly speaking to the communication bracelet. "Oh, I'm coming, baby, don't worry, I'll come and help you right away."
This scene was too sudden and the contrast was too great. Everyone was dumbfounded, even Wang Baole was stunned for a moment. It took him a while to gasp for breath. Along with the uproar of the crowd, Wang Baole gritted his teeth and cursed a few times.
"This old lecher, all those words he said before were bullshit! There are only so many female students, we don't have enough to share, and he, at his age, is still competing with us for resources, just because he's an official!"
The more Wang Baole thought about it, the more angry he became. Amid the discussion with his classmates, his dream of becoming an official became even more firm.
As the alarm intensified, everyone ended their discussion and went to the cultivation room with resentment.
The cultivation room, located in the core area of the airship, is a place for these students to practice, and also the most secure place when the airship passes through special areas.
At this moment in the cultivation room, as everyone gathered, under the arrangement of the teachers who accompanied the ship from the Piaomiao Taoist Academy, everyone sat in several rows and put on the airship-specific magnetic spirit suits issued by the Piaomiao Taoist Academy.
Just after putting on the magnetic spirit suit, Wang Baole, who was still indignant at Dr. Lu, casually looked around. His already depressed mood became even worse due to a gaze from afar. He unconsciously frowned and showed a disgusted look.
Where his gaze fell, there sat a girl with long legs, very attractive, but she was also frowning, showing a disgusted look. Obviously, in their mutual gazes, the other party was familiar and extremely disgusting.
"Bad luck!"
Both of them muttered in their hearts, quickly avoiding each other's gaze, as if even looking at each other was an eyesore.
"I can meet this flat Du Min wherever I go, it's so annoying!" "What's so great about it, isn't it just a class leader? When I get to the Taoist Academy, with my killer moves in the officialdom, I can also mix up a half-official position!"
Soon, after everyone had put on their suits and the teachers who accompanied the ship from the Piaomiao Taoist Academy had checked them one by one, they explained some precautions and sternly warned everyone that there was danger when the airship entered the thunder magnetic area and there was a certain possibility of life and death crisis.
Seeing everyone's expressions change, these accompanying teachers left solemnly, the door of the cultivation room was directly sealed, and the lights gradually dimmed.
At this moment in the cultivation room, although there was still low conversation, as time passed, the tension became more and more intense, and gradually no one spoke, falling into complete silence.
In this silence where you could hear your own heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still indignant, couldn't help but become nervous. Until half an hour later, the entire airship shook violently and entered the thunder magnetic area!
From the outside, the entire thunder magnetic cloud was majestic, like a big mouth, directly swallowing the hot air balloon airship, which was very small compared to it.
This kind of weather seemed to contain the power of destruction, capable of sweeping everything. Perhaps only the shocking sword sun in the sky could ignore everything, as if looking down on the world for 37 years was not enough, but even longer.
This year is the 37th year of the Spirit Element.
In 3029 AD, Earth's technology developed rapidly, there were no more national borders, the Earth was unified, and the Federation era began. It was at this time that a big sword flew from the stars, pierced the sun, and shocked the world.
The hilt of this big sword, perhaps because it was already broken, shattered a large amount of debris in this violent vibration, scattered across the stars, some of which fell on various places on Earth.
With the arrival of the bronze big sword and the falling of the fragments, a new energy source that seemed to permeate the world and was inexhaustible suddenly appeared on Earth, later named...spiritual energy!
Spiritual energy is like air, some places are rich, some places are thin. Because those scattered fragments were obtained by the Federation and various forces, they found various methods of cultivation, refining tools, refining pills, and refining spirit stones on them. The text on them was full of ancient meaning, leading people to contact ancient texts, becoming a trend.
The appearance of spiritual energy quickly replaced the original energy source, changed people's lives, not only formed the spiritual network, but also changed the course of Earth's civilization, making the entire Earth start a cultivation civilization.
From then on, ancient martial arts rose, the world changed greatly, and the era of everyone cultivating immortals began.
This is known as the Spirit Element Era.
At this moment, within the thunderous dark clouds, a red hot air balloon airship is slowly moving. Countless lightning strikes are constantly bombarding it from all sides, but thanks to the soft light curtain that spreads out to protect it, the airship remains incredibly stable.
As for the core area of the cabin, the cultivation room, all the students including Wang Baole are now unknowingly asleep, as if a strange power is guiding them into a dream.
Only in the main tower at the bow of the ship, there are seven or eight teachers at this moment. Some are drinking tea, some are smiling, and they are having a relaxed conversation with each other, which is completely different from the way they scared the students before.
The leader is an old man with a face full of wrinkles, holding a smoking pipe, puffing away. If Wang Baole were here, he would definitely recognize at a glance that this old man is the shameless old doctor Lu from before.
With the opening of a middle-aged teacher, the old doctor who was smoking, gave a slight smile.
