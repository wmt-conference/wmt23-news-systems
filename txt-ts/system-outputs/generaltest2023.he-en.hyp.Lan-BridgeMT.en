In the Shadow of Extinction: Three Bird Cubs Born in Iran
The world's fastest animal has fallen victim to brutal hunting, droughts and deadly road accidents across the Islamic Republic.
As a result, their numbers dropped to at least 20 bridesmaids.
Three young Asiatic bridles have recently been released into the air in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic condition of an endangered animal in the country due to deadly forms, hunters and road accidents.
It's the first birth of a bradles in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where poodles still live in the wild.
Iran's IRNA news agency reported that the veterinary team, responsible for the Turan National Park in northern Samnan province, decided to have a caesarean birth in captivity.
It also states that less than 20 brothels have been recorded in seven different counties in the country.
Due to the threat of extinction, the UN implemented a protection program for them back in 2001.
Now, in Iran, it is hoped that the new puppies could lead to an increase in the brindle population in the future.
Last January, Iran's Deputy Environment Minister Hassan Akbari said that the country's brothel population had declined dramatically from 100 brothels in 2010 to just 12.
"Their situation is extremely serious", Akbari said, noting that the bridesmaids have fallen victim to drought in their habitat, hunting and even road accidents.
The brindle is considered the fastest animal in the world capable of reaching speeds of about 60 miles per hour.
Bridesmaids can be found all over the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: we tested the Car Thing.
Quietly, Spotify began to try its luck in the hardware world.
After years of development, Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the United States.
We've got our hands on the first device in Israel
The vision: make your old cars smart.
Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and it's built specifically to provide a solution for people with old cars.
A few weeks ago, I had the first opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to a select few in the United States, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was exceptional, since our home car broke down and we had to drive for a few days in a replacement car with an old system.
After two weeks of fun, I realized how easily the Car Thing can become an integral part of many people's systems.
On the other hand, with the long waiting list and the uncertainty of a global launch, I believe many would prefer to use other solutions.
From Idea to Reality
Sometime in 2018, Spotify users started getting an interesting offer in their email inbox -- the option to buy a new device with voice control and fourth-generation connectivity that would turn any old system into a smart car.
The rumors slowly died down until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company was planning to soon introduce a new product for a smart radio simulation vehicle with glandular connections.
A few months later, these rumors made headlines again after the music service updated the car's status -- the same one we know today from the app -- which is activated as soon as the smartphone detects a connection to the car's system.
It's been two years.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled Car Thing last April, its smart car system.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited release, with a long waiting list and many delays in shipping.
So of course, right after the press conference that was held, I went on the website and signed up.
Two months later, the long-awaited message arrived.
Reconnecting to the site will buy me the option to purchase the device with a little surprise - it won't cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a little box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing.
First of all, the Spotify device really impressed me with its build quality.
And it's a little bit smaller than my iPhone 11 and it has a bigger, brighter, more compact touchscreen on the front than I expected.
You'll also find a round button and a circle next to the screen that you can rotate to navigate between the interface screens.
And despite the giant circle, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stand out too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I'd prefer if the company allowed me to change the activity of the loop so that I could control the volume of the smartphone, because I can also navigate through the touchscreen.
Maybe this will be possible in a future update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes a USB Type-C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you probably remember how we used to turn off the radios and hide them in the drawer after we got out of the car.
The Car Thing definitely brings that feeling back with its construction.
All the adapters connected to the body of the device by a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
In addition, along the top you can find small buttons, which can be easily set to play different playlists or podcasts.
By long pressing of one of the buttons while listening, or by requesting from the voice assistant, I set some playlists that I hear frequently and the radio program that I listen to every morning on the road.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
From old car to smart car
After a fairly simple physical installation, I connected the Car Thing to electricity.
I was surprised at the quality of the setup process.
The instructions were clear, it took less than five minutes to sign in to Spotify, and a few moments later I was on my home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone through a node and controls the app like a control panel, so it can copy all of our account information from it.
So you'll still have to connect your smartphone to the car, whether it's through a spindle or through an AUX cable to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, because like the smartphone app, it emphasizes album photos and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one in the app, you can find music recommendations to suit your taste, your search screen, and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or using the manual scrollbar.
What's more, you can call your device's voice assistant at any time by saying "Hey Spotify".
With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums, and even search for podcasts.
In my experience, she recognized my voice fairly easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was dancing directly on the device.
That's probably because of the four microphones we put on top of it.
It is important to note that the voice assistant currently does not support Hebrew, and at the time of publication, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
So is it worth waiting for?
My experience with the device has been great, which is a positive surprise to me considering it's still in its early release.
Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
However, there have been occasional slight glitches in the interface, but I believe Spotify will address such bugs with future release updates.
The Swedish company has obviously been working on it a lot over the last few years, and of the different versions that have been leaked online during that time, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to target it for.
After all, it's all about controlling the app on your smartphone, not much more.
What's different about buying a car for a few cents and connecting it so that the smartphone is closer to you when you're driving?
This question is reinforced when you consider that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify, and will often buy the user much more functionality.
However, the more I used Car Thing, the more I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
The ability to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I've learned to appreciate in the last couple of weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even release the device to the general public?
And if so, will it be launched here in our little country?
The Swedish company isn't saying much right now.
She didn't even share how many signals to the device she's currently running around the world, and how many she plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is the expected price of $79.
In the meantime, the Car Thing provides a first glimpse into a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Israel's Spotify says there's no word yet on a plan to launch the device in the country.
I'm not going anywhere.
Have you recruited talent for the company?
That way you don't let your competitors steal it.
The economy is still a labor market dominated largely by workers, and the same is true of the most desirable workers -- talent.
Here are some suggestions to help you maintain it in the workplace
I'm not going anywhere.
Despite the rise recorded last month, Israel's unemployment rate remains among the lowest in the world, and in the top ten among OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the ILO).
That is, the economy is still in a labor market dominated mostly by workers, and the same is true of the most sought-after workers -- talent.
As for those professionals and managers who are proven centers of knowledge, experience and ability, trends in the labor market teach that competition for talent, as it is defined by employers, is still at its peak.
What this means for employers is that in the current job market situation, they don't have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after recruiting a desired talent, because as soon as he enters the company, another company will already be trying to kidnap him.
That is, the competition for talent is so fierce that even after recruitment, many will continue to receive a plethora of tempting job offers, with 30 percent of employees actually leaving within a month of getting the job and starting work.
That's why smart employers will immediately move from the recruitment phase to the retention phase, where the path starts first and foremost with preparation and creativity right from the beginning of the recruitment process.
An efficient, structured, thoughtful hiring process will make the talent excited about their new workplace from day one and even look forward to the next.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper recruitment process that will help retain new talent:
It's no secret -- organizational collaboration and readiness.
Share with the people who will be working with him about his recruitment, explain to them why he's vital and important to the company and the role, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who comes to a place where he is expected and appreciated will feel welcome and will strive to prove the expectations that hang over Ben.
Knowledge is power -- alignment of expectations.
On the first day, they had an expectations call with the talent.
Get to know his professional background and see where he sees himself in the future, so you can introduce him to the diverse and unique tools that you and your workplace can provide him to get there.
We're all human beings.
During the recruitment days, try to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and take an interest in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who's shown interest and allowed to express himself beyond the confines of his job will appreciate it and want to keep it.
Curiosity is driving.
Right at the recruitment stage, you can create attractiveness that makes talent want to fit in quickly.
Do it not by talking about bonuses and perks, but by exposing him to an exciting field or interesting technology, because these kinds of stimulations to creativity lead to increased curiosity and interest in the workplace.
Also, encourage the talent to voice their thoughts and opinions to the various projects in the company and make it clear to them that they are important to the organization.

Pocket electricity: Cost of non-closure of coal plants in June - one billion dollars
Knesset Research and Information Center report: Non-closure of coal plants by the June 2022 deadline estimated at one billion shekels
• Electricity company: "Fuel policy is primarily dictated by the Department of Energy"
I'm not going anywhere.
The economic cost of not closing coal plants by the June 2022 deadline is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, according to a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center.
According to the report, this cost is reflected in the electricity price to the consumer, which is expected to rise in the coming months due to the rise in the price of coal.
In addition, an additional excess of about 900,000 tons of coal is expected to be used in 2023, resulting in additional costs to the electricity industry from the non-closure of coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas remains significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report said that a cut of about a billion shekels in electricity tariffs by 2022 would mean a 4 percent reduction in the rate of electricity consumption for households.
That is, the economic cost of not closing stations is about a billion shekels, and the amount that could have been cut for the domestic consumer is about 4 percent.
It should be noted that as part of the reform of the electricity economy, it was decided to establish a subsidiary of the electricity company, which would set up natural gas-fired units, designed to replace the 4-1 carbon units at the Rabin Lighthouse.
Following this decision, a government decision was taken in July 2018, stating that the 4-1 coal-fired units at the Ohr Rabin power plant should cease operations.
The decision set timetables so that the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will begin in June 2022, accordingly, the 4-1 carbon production units will also cease to operate at that time.
In response, the electricity company said: "Fuel policy is written first and foremost by the Department of Energy.
In accordance with the decisions of the ministry, a policy of reducing the use of coal to the minimum possible has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas".
Paying the Price: Everything You Need to Know About Interest Rising
Continuous Carrots: Interest rates on the shekel are expected to rise by half a percent next week
How much will it cost to pay the mortgage?
And what is the best thing to do? • What are some of the benefits?
All the answers.
Severe inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of more than 4% in the past year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise interest rates on the shekel as early as next week.
Analysts estimate the rate of increase to be between 0.25% and 0.5%.
If you do raise the interest rate by half a percent, it'll be already at 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
That's after years of interest rates in the economy being near zero.
The sharp rise in interest rates is costing hundreds of shillings in mortgage payments and is putting a drastic burden on households.
With the help of a mortgage expert, we've been looking at how much more we can pay and what we should do now.
If the interest goes up by half a percent, how much will the monthly mortgage payment cost?
For a mortgage of NIS 1.2 million, with a 40% prime interest rate, the monthly repayment will be NIS 125.
What was the average mortgage price at the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, it's been a significantly sharper increase.
This is because interest rates on the other mortgage-backed lines (and not just on the prime line) have also increased - on the fixed-rate and the fixed-rate lines.
If the interest rate does go up by half a percent, the cost would be, according to Kroser's estimate, about 620 shekels on a mortgage of about 1.2 million shekels.
The prime track (40% of this track) will make up the cost of about 280 shekels, assuming another 0.5% increase next month.
The variable rate of interest (26.7% on this line) will make up the cost of about $120.
The fixed-rate course, which is 33.3 percent of the course, will cost 220 shekels.
So what's the recommended course of action today?
For those with a mortgage that's too close to the mark, Cluster recommends considering recycling to non-matching routes.
For borrowers whose monthly repayments have risen significantly and who find it difficult to meet their repayments, he recommends considering recycling a mortgage and spreading it out over a longer period.
That's to reduce payments despite the interest rate hike, because it's always better to pay back than to be a loser.
For new mortgage holders - he highly recommends getting to know the different routes and tailoring the mortgage to their financial capabilities.
So in the future, when interest rates go down, they can recycle mortgages with minimal early-payment fees.
As for the buyers of the condominium, a cluster recommends making advance payments to the buyer and taking out a mortgage now.
It should be borne in mind that the construction investment ratio raises the price of the property significantly even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The residential construction investment price index has risen by 6.6% in the past year.
In view of the increase in the price of this index, the Banking Supervision Authority announced yesterday that it was considering the creation of a mechanism that would allow for the inclusion of attachments in mortgages, but the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The price of gasoline is rising and Israelis will have to pay in July more than eight shekels a litre.
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price per liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08 shekels.
At the same time, by the end of 2022, the reduction of half a dollar per liter of tax on solar energy will be extended to the entire country.
A decade's high: Gasoline prices will soar by 36 cents a liter - to more than eight shekels a liter as of July 1.
The new price for a liter of 95-octane gasoline will be 8.08 and anyone wishing to enjoy full service will be required to pay an additional 21 cents a liter.
At the same time, a half shekel per litre reduction in the solar tax is scheduled for the end of 2022, according to the IRS.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continued rise in oil prices, against the background of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise in the value of the dollar.
If it weren't for the half-shekel government subsidy since April, the price of gasoline would have hit an all-time high of 8.25 shekels a liter.
The discount expires at the end of July and the IRS and the Treasury are promoting a public notice announcement these days extending the half-shekel-per-liter gasoline tax reduction until August 9.
Also, starting August 10, a further reduction of half a shekel will be fixed, so that only from that date the price of a liter of gasoline will fall by one shekel until November 15, 2022.
That's what the I.R.S. said.
"We've reached a point where I don't remember five consecutive months of surplus government revenue.
We started a few months ago with the solar tax cut.
We've been working for a week on a four-month extension of the blue, gas and solar tax - instead of half a shekel a shekel.
It's good for the industry and good for the citizenry.
If we lower it, it will affect inflation, reduce production and lower the cost of living.
As finance minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus primarily on this", Minister Lieberman said at the Israeli Institute for Democracy's Horwitz Conference on Economics and Society.
Currently, more than half of the price of gasoline is taxed by the government (blue tax and VAT) - a high tax rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic effect on the cost of living in the economy - because it affects both household and business spending, public transportation and airfares, transportation costs, and more.
For the third time in a row, Ashdod is the most business-friendly city in the world.
Fatiha has reached the second place in the ranking of doing business by the Ministry of Economy •
After them: the streets, Ashkelon and the first of the sign •
Minister Berbibai: "Corona has highlighted the importance of local government in business development"
I'm not going anywhere.
Ashdod is the most friendly city for small and medium-sized businesses.
This is the third year in a row that the Ministry of Economy and Industry's Small and Medium-sized Business Agency's Doing Business in Local Authorities Index, which ranks local authorities, has found this.
In second place is the location of the city of Open Hope and in third place streets.
They are followed in order by Ashkelon, First Zion, Tel Aviv-Joppa, Haifa, Ramah-Gaden, Holon, Beer-sheba, Jerusalem, Beth-sim, Nethaniah, and the sons of Barak.
The agency does the local authority index.
This is the fifth time and it aims to be a tool for local authorities, as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters, as well as to analyse its performance in the areas in which it operates.
The index is based on several parameters that are examined in each authority, which test the level of the authority's "friendliness" to businesses within its jurisdiction.
The index divides municipalities into three size groups by population, since a municipality of up to 50,000 inhabitants is not the same as a municipality of more than 150,000.
The T.A. jumped this year.
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings for each local authority: business satisfaction, access to tenders, access to information and arnouna.
The ranking shows that Jan's ranking dropped from second to eighth, Bethany dropped from fourth to 12th, and Nathaniel dropped from fifth to 13th.
A downgrade does not mean that the Authority's business service has deteriorated, and in many cases it results from the fact that the service of other business authorities has improved more and they have been upgraded, while the downgraded Authority has improved less its business services.
Among the top performers are Hope's Gate, which moved up from sixth to second place, and Streets, which moved up from 12th to third.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth to 11th place in 2019, improved to sixth place in 2021.
"Business as a Growth Engine"
According to the ranking, Galilee is the top-ranked of the local governments with between 50,000 and 150,000 residents.
It is followed by Kiryat Mushkin, the headquarters in Benjamin, Makbush-e-Rauf Intelligence, the village of Shabba, Renna, Nakharia, Karmiel, Apula and Hode-Sharon.
The 28th and final place is occupied by Tiberias.
"The measure is designed to encourage local authorities to facilitate small and medium-sized businesses, starting from the date of opening the business and throughout its activity before the authorities", says the Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Berbibai.
"Business is a significant engine of growth for the Israeli economy and accounts for about 50 percent of business output and about 60 percent of employment.
Small business development is in the public interest of all of us, but local government has a direct impact on the businesses within it.
The coronavirus has highlighted the importance of local government and we have seen that authorities that have acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, have become the first government interface for them".
Ren Koiti, director of the Small and Medium-sized Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and essential role in the ability of businesses in their area to thrive and flourish.
In the last two years, as we deal with the coronavirus crisis, authorities have a greater weight in helping businesses survive in their field and survive in general".
2021 in the mail: 20 packets per household - and a weight gain
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020 •
The average weight per package is 435 grams - a 36% increase from 2020
The busiest month: December, when the average package weighed 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million parcels of mail arrived in Israel, almost 20 parcels on average per household - this is according to the data of Israel Post obtained by Israel Today.
The number of packages arriving in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019 - when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there has been a jump of more than 36 percent a year in the weight of packages coming in from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of foreign products arrived in Israel, a jump of 36% compared to 14,860 tons in 2020 and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits
The average weight per pack has jumped by 60 percent in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The surge in parcel weight is mainly driven by two main trends, both on the seller's side and the buyer's side: the major overseas shopping sites unify items for one delivery and no longer ship each product from the "shopping cart" in a separate package.
On the Israeli consumer's side, the quick delivery of the shipments, within a few days of ordering, supports the purchase of more everyday goods such as clothes and gifts, which the buyers wish to receive near the purchase.
In 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month with the highest number of packages arriving from abroad and the highest number of items is December, with 4.2 million packages weighing a total of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per pack was 524 grams, 20 percent higher than the annual average.
The Black Friday effect.
More packages arrived in December than in any other month, likely in the wake of November's shopping holidays, such as Chinese Singles' Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Big orders start arriving in Israel within a week or two of purchase.
Research: Most household tenants are unaware that tax refunds are available
Many renters receive money from the state, which can reach tens of thousands of dollars.
Did you change jobs?
You went to the ER?
Did you move from the city to the settlement?
You may be entitled to a non-cancellable amount in a simple procedure
All the details - inside.
Most renters are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can add up to large sums.
The State Auditor stated in a report about two months ago that two million employees are eligible for tax refunds of NIS 3.6 billion, which means you should also check if you are eligible for tax refunds.
Many employees can get a high amount, since four out of five employees are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, however, they hire several tens of thousands a year.
If you're thinking that this money has gone to waste anyway, think again: Employees can file income tax returns for six years back.
Tax:On conducted an in-depth survey of 4,000 of its customers regarding their tax returns during 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their distribution by population groups and by gender, age and geography.
The data shows that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis and the expense of hundreds of thousands of workers to the state, there were a number of significant changes and at the center of them an increase of 15% in the average return to the father's house which was 4,300 shekels per year.
The reason is that the starting fees are lower than the wages and therefore there is a gap between what the worker has paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest return received in 2020 by a customer of the company amounted to 121,054 NIS in terms of returns for the last 6 years.
What can I get a tax refund on?
One of the reasons to get a tax return is a change in workplace.
Eighty-one percent of people who changed jobs during the year generated an average tax refund of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data showed that 74 percent of women who gave birth and took maternity leave for more than 16 weeks were eligible for a refund of an average of $1,500 for that year.
Another reason to return is donations.
100% of the people who donated and paid taxes got their money back.
Another contributing factor is the lack of food credit. 63%
We haven't updated a maintenance deduction, so the tax refund for every year that we haven't updated that deduction is 2,616 shekels.
Unemployment - Expenditure on health care: 93% of those who became ill or unemployed and earned more than 12,000 shekels received a tax refund of 4,021 shekels for the same year.
Other reasons for tax refunds include: refunds for life insurance payments, life insurance on mortgages, refunds for profit, refunds for losses on securities, failure to register birth credit points for a male and distribution of tax refunds by geographic location.
94% of people who took out personal life insurance or a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In an analysis of every million shekels of a 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax return for the period was over 20,000 shekels for the entire term of the mortgage.
100% of the migrants received a tax refund for the year of transition because the residence permit is only issued after 12 months from the date of becoming a resident of a settlement and thus the first year is actually paid full tax.
79% of the clients holding securities were eligible for tax refunds in those years.
However, it is important for the holder of securities to check annually as losses are not rolled over from year to year but only by filing a report.
Fifty-six percent of men who have a baby don't put credit on their paycheck for the birth year.
The payback rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over six years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tax:on CEO, Tel Karmon: "The coronavirus crisis has made the hired public in Israel much more active.
He's curious, he checks, and he demands what he deserves in income tax returns.
It turns out that sitting in the homes of hundreds of thousands of Israelis, before or after being laid off, for months on end, has caused many of the hired workers to take a deep look at what they deserve from the country.
It's important to know that today, all tax returns can be processed digitally, easily and simply, without the red tape that has been a deterrent in the past".
The job market: fewer job applicants, more pay
AllJobs report for 2021 summary: at the top of the demand - jobs without experience •
The number of jobs offered increased by 50%
Looking for a job, but not breaking into the market
In the year that just ended, there was a 15% decrease in the number of resumes sent, and for each job only 23 candidates applied on average, compared to 41 candidates the previous year - according to a report by the AllJobs website for the 2021 summary on the coronavirus crisis and its effects on the Israeli labor market.
According to the report, job seekers were mainly interested in job-oriented fields such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, jobs with no experience topped the list with more than 38,000 searches - likely due to the return of young people with no professional experience to look for work immediately, after the initial payments.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and maintenance had just under 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the coronavirus crisis, the salary in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average salary in Israel stood at 11,675 shekels gross.
The average monthly salary in software was $17,915, and in information systems analysis it was $17,140.
However, between the center and the periphery there was a wage gap of more than 2,000 shekels: in the center of the country it was 12,500 shekels on average, compared to 10,795 in the north and 10,135 shekels in the south.
In terms of gender, the average gender pay gap, which can also be explained by the type of work and the number of hours worked, remained at 36%.
Men were paid 13,295 shekels, compared with 9,740 shekels for women.
Trying to get back to film.
On the business side, there was broad-based growth in almost every sector of the economy, and businesses were craving hands-on work.
Thus, the supply of jobs increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40,000 jobs in Olghobes.
A website survey of employers found that 50% were optimistic about their financial status in 2022, 30% of whom indicated their intention to increase the number of hires but 72% say they will struggle to do so this year.
The largest bid was for jobs without experience -- and there were over 58,000 of those on the site.
They were followed by customer service and administration jobs with about 44,000 jobs in every field, sales and software jobs with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education jobs with 24,000 jobs, and bookkeepers still needed at 19,000 jobs.
"Job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not entering the market, mainly because of the lack of attractive jobs.
Also, prolonged disengagement from the workforce makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to make a living".
The unemployment rate in Israel has risen to 6.3%.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 270,000 Israelis were out of work in December 2021.
In November, there were 262,000 unemployed.
The percentage of unemployed in the first half of December 2021 was 6.3%, about 270,000 Israelis, compared to 6.1% in the second half of November 2021 (about 262,000).
This is according to the data of the personnel survey for the first half of December 2021 of the Central Bureau of Statistics.
The unemployment rate stood at 4.5% in the first half of December 2021 compared to 4.3% in the second half of November 2021.
In other words, that's 193,000 unemployed versus 180,3000.
According to the characteristics of the labor force in the first half of December 2021 among those aged 15 and older, this population included 6,607,500 residents in Israel, not including institutions and residences outside settlements.
Of these, 64.4%, or 4,252,700 are in the workforce and the remainder, 2,354,800 are not in the workforce.
Of those in the labor force, 95.5% of the 4,059,700 are employed and the rest unemployed.
Of those not in the labor force, 2.3% have stopped working due to layoffs or job closures since March 2020.
The Human Resources Survey provides information on the labor force in Israel and is conducted on a regular basis by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
In the first half of December 2021, we interviewed 8,700 people aged 15 and over on a regular basis.
In the second half of November 2021, we interviewed approximately 8,900 people aged 15 and over on a regular basis.
The survey population includes permanent residents of the State of Israel, tourists and occasional residents staying in Israel for more than one year in a row.
The survey enables the development of the labour force, its size and characteristics, the extent of unemployment and more to be monitored.
"Inconceivable": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence
Celebrates the fact that "we can live as we like", is excited to meet the audience and makes sure to spend time with the kids
This weekend and Kobe's Independence Day,
What's your typical Friday look like?
"The weekends are the most important moments in my life.
Consecration and tradition are very deeply rooted in my soul.
Friday nights at my house are for kids, Aug. 10 and Jan. 8.
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and props, have lunch and do something fun together, like play football or ride horses or play board cars.
Sometimes we go to the beach, or even just wash the car, but we always stop to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store on the way - and there's always another excuse.
When we come home with a lot of presents, the smell of cooking greets our faces".
How's your Friday dinner?
♪ I bless the kitchens around me ♪
On my side is Tunisian Persian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, song and joy.
From my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, comes the Ukrainian food, which is deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
By the time we get to my mother-in-law's apartment, there's already incredible smells coming out of the lobby.
I usually do the initiation, along with the kids, who know him by heart.
"In the end, my only fun after dinner is passing out on the carpet, "and having the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of bloated person".
Do you have any special childhood memories from weekends?
"As a child, I would wake up on Saturdays to the sounds of Israeli music on the C network and the pale navigation systems, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in the Land of Israel, usually up north.
Every outcast corner of the land made him proud in his heart.
He passed away three months ago from a serious illness, and for him Lent and the Sabbath were the holiest of holidays, especially since the whole family should be together.
I recently released a song in his memory called "Keep You", which I wrote with Joy Cohen.
I believe he was proud of this piece, which celebrates the bond between father and son".
We will soon celebrate the 74th Independence Day. As an enthusiastic Zionist, how do you feel about Christmas?
"Independence Day is a holy day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who is allowed to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I was already climbing trees and tied to a wire rope with Israeli flags.
Today, my Independence Days are full of gigs, and I always meet an audience that's crazy happy, celebrating that we can live as we want.
We need to make sure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren have that opportunity, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted".
Her Friday:
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all my dead loved ones": The Friday dinner that Asti Zakheym dreams about, and how does she deal with the fact that her husband keeps the Sabbath?
Tell me about your willingness to sit
I'm not going anywhere.
"Preparations start as early as Thursday night, when I come home from a show or workshop and I cook until three in the morning everything that takes a long time to cook like sausage, onions and spices.
On Fridays, in the first part of the day, I take time for myself, to meet with friends and friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I go to rehearsals.
In the summer, Saturdays come late, and I have a lot of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch a sunset or just a good show.
On Saturdays, I usually invite my mother, Rhoda, who celebrated her 89th birthday, and friends over for dinner".
Can you share more cooking?
"I like shortcuts.
For example, instead of folding ten onions, cutting them up and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry them.
On my Saturday table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and oven-baked cabbage.
Most of the cooking is done by me, and they're, of course, heated on the counter on Saturdays.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and in the winter - the choline".
Your husband is a religious man and you're from a secular home.
- How does it work?
"Living with a Sabbath keeper is an endless compromise.
"Love your neighbor as yourself" became a reality.
Family trips he can't go out to, so I found myself packing the kids and joining friends' family trips a lot.
Plus, I'm also the shift driver for the kids, the one who picks them up on Friday nights from parties and meetings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Sabbath, since I usually do not show up on the Sabbath and take a kind of 'forced leave' - which is good".
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
"I'd open a big table and invite my dead.
Sometimes I imagine what would have happened if my brother Daniel Zell had been alive, or if my father, who is now Zell, had seen my children: Oriel, 23, and the twins Tamara and Neema, 16.
We probably fought about football and politics and stuff".
Do you have any special childhood memories from weekends?
"We were a warm, united family.
On Friday afternoon, Mom would make a bunch of chips, bring back hummus and baits from the market, and burn the peas for a grilled salad.
And then we'd drive to Aunt Hannah's with Elijah, or as she would say, Elijah's hand, and she'd make linchpins.
Since I was the only one who didn't like raisins, she would make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the little one, and she worried about me.
On Saturdays, my father and I would take a tour of the port of Joppa, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Girish, came from when they arrived in the country with nothing".

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are engaged.
Almost two decades after their love story ended in a breakup, Lopez and Affleck return to each other's arms.
Lopez separated from baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021.
I'm not going anywhere.
One of his: Almost two decades after their first romance ended in a breakup and a year after their reunion, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing the romantic loop and getting engaged.
The joyful news was shared last night (Friday) by Lopez with her fans on her official website onthejlo.com
I'm not going anywhere.
The announcement of the engagement comes after a week of documenting Lopez spin when a giant diamond ring is clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative on her behalf confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
Remember, the last time Affleck, 49, pulled out a ring and offered it to Lopez, 52, to be his forever was in 2002, and it was an eye-catching ring with a giant six-carat pink diamond, estimated to be worth about $2.5 million.
Despite the grandiose gesture of love, the two separated in 2004, accusing the media of over-obsession and relentless harvesting of their lives.
Since then Affleck has been married to actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as is known, has been married three times before, including singer Mark Anthony, who together became parents of twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she separated in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including two-year engagements.
The Kardashians say, "You can't make up what's happening to us".
"Chaos Never Ends", mother Chris Jenner insists on a new series starring the reality show's first family, and gets support from her daughters and new producer
In an article that will be published in Sitting Magazine, they talk about the big money, the mill, the brands and the change Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm not the one who thinks for hours about which bikini selfies to take".
It may come as a surprise to many, but the most sought-after brand in 2022 of Disney's content empire, which also includes Marvel and Star Wars movies, among others, is the Kardashians.
The details of the first family's contract with Disney have not been disclosed, but estimates suggest a minimum of $100 million has been transferred to the family's daughters, who now also serve as producers.
In a press conference with the stars, each accompanied by an entire beauty team who take care of the touch-ups of makeup, hair and clothes non-stop, the family girls, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it's not reality, this time what's received on screen is completely authentic.
"What is happening to us is unimaginable", family mother Chris Jenner says emphatically, "the chaos is endless".
"We're showing how much we've grown since that show aired in 2007", says Chloe Kardashian.
"When we first started, we were scared, a lot happens to us in life, and we can't simply fit everything into a narrative of beginning, middle and end.
A lot of plots were rushed through editing, wrapped up in flashing color film and forgotten.
That's not what real life looks like.
Now we're more exposed, turning directly to the camera naturally, not just reality but an authentic documentary series".
When confronted with their new involvement in the show's production, which effectively gives them complete control over the content that is received on screen, Chloe states, "We are involved behind the scenes, watching clips during editing and commenting, but not from a position of protector but simply giving our opinion on what will make the show better.
It's a reflection of our lives and I personally feel like I've grown emotionally by watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they're more boundary-setting".
"Growing up"
Kim Kardashian, for her part, is continuing to forcefully change her image from a cheap reality thrasher to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I grew up", she claims, "raising four black children, which means I come from the most marginalized community in this country.
I want to change reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends can have a different future, in the hope that we can heal this crooked system.
That's my motivation".
"I'm no longer the Kim who thinks for hours about what bikini selfies to post", she insists, "but it's not completely gone from my life either.
A man must be true to who he really is and take everything for granted".
On the reasons behind Ryan Seacrest's discovery of the producer's firings and their new and highly profitable path in the industry, the implications of the move to Disney, the family's greasy slot machine and its impact on the brand's profitability and more, in the full article to be published in Sitting Magazine.

Spring Grapes and Sharid: An outdoor festival that creates new surprises in Jerusalem
The capital's international festival, which has become a tradition and will be held in a number of venues, will feature musical performances by leading local artists, and incorporate innovative and surprising circus and artistic performances.
I'm not going anywhere.
As every summer through the years, alongside the heat, humidity and boredom of the students, comes the Jerusalem International Outdoor Festival, which has already become a tradition in the capital and will be held in a number of venues (including Mitchell Garden, the Sultan's Pool, in front of the Tower of David and at the foot of the Old City Walls) - between 15-27 August.
Within the festival, musical performances of many artists will be held every day, including Shirat Hadid, Kobi Peretz, Abib Geffen and Aaiwiut, who will host Natasha's friends, Shalomi Sabbat, Edan Habib, Nathan Ghoshan, Nasrin Kadri, Danny Sanderson, who will host Tashlem and Amir Dedon, Neha Arz and more.
Along with the music, there will be two interesting shows this year.

The theatrical performance will combine dancers, actors, and physical theater artists to interact with the audience.
SPARKS is a circus, movement and aerial performance by Circus Y, an Instagram photography exhibition inspired by famous works of art.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The winner of "Next Star" releases a second single and returns to his childhood memories and his father's significant presence in his life.
"The song is about how to keep in touch at a distance", he says.
Tamir Greenberg released his second single, Into The Night, after winning over the crowd with his first single and appearance on The Next Star.
In recent months, Greenberg has continued to play many concerts: the TA Culture Hall, the TA Opera House, Amphitheatre Shawnee, Amphitheatre Joshua Garden, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
The song Into The Night was produced and engineered by Greenberg along with producer Autumn Greer.
The video, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song is about the relationship between my father and me.
About the time I left the country for the U.S. and how to keep in touch at a distance", Greenberg says.
Next month, Greenberg will perform at the opening ceremony of Maccabiah in Israel, and for the new season of "The Next Star", his winning song, "Tell Me Where The Light Goes", was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Blue and white product: Jubilee Full is the season's big winner and the 16th ninja in the world.
The phenomenon climbed Mount Maduryama in 26 seconds and claimed the title of "First Israeli Ninja".
Yugev Malaka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but he won't hold the Ning title.
The
There's a winner: Jubilee, who has completely conquered the Midoriya, and he's the winner of the fourth season of Ninja Israel and now he holds the title of the first Israeli ninja and 16th in the world.
Who hasn't been on the show since its first season, so he finished first, and in season two, he lost to Gil Merentz.
In the third season he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, and during filming he stated that this would be the last season.
Tonight, he climbed Mount Midoriama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished first, after beating his rivals Yoyogi Queen Vichy Kalpon.
Queen managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished second.
It should be noted that according to the rules of the program, in each season only one ninja can be crowned who has managed to climb the Midoriyama in time.
Therefore, despite Queen's impressive achievement, as the season's overall winner will climb the podium three seconds faster, Queen does not win the world ninja title.
He can compete for it again next season.
Well, we figured out that full of superheroes, Rotherham Rock is perfect, and Ninja Israel is the most important sporting event in the world.
I'm not going anywhere.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat in the finale of a reality show and acted like it was the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
I'm not going anywhere.
Rotherham Rock represents for us such a perfect feminine ideal, it's a distortion to portray it that way on television.
She makes more money on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when she needs to, she can even broker her business partner.
She's a mother and a career woman who advertises for banks and weather stations, models and hosts reality shows and series, and serves as an inconceivable role model for young girls.
And maybe it makes sense that Rock's service is going through a screen that's too perfect, because in the show she hosts, you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the ninja world, everyone is bigger than life, and guides come first.
Ace helped her get into a situation where he was supposed to be taken off the screen for a while, but because he's not an ordinary human being, he was taken out before the first set of ads.
Listen to the soundtrack of the event: Neve Ruskin, who has broadcast European and world records in his lifetime, but is excited about a mega-wall as if it were the most significant sporting achievement on the planet.
In the final, two Olympic medalists (Jordan Gerbi and Lina Ashram) sat alongside him as commentators, as if to emphasize the rarity and quality of the entry requirements for the superhuman world that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons.
Ninja Israel went out of their way to market the season, which ended last night with Mt. Midoriama and the Jubilee, which was climbed in 26 seconds and finally crowned by Ninja.
There led a nearly impassable trail, one after another dropping all the superhuman characters that the show had taken care to inflate their egos throughout the year.
You want to be a ninja deer?
Not with us.
This is where superheroes come in.
The emphasis was on the search for an heir to fill the throne, the one called "the King of kings and the only one of his kind", and other titles designed to make clear how perfect and unique he is.
As a result, the difficulty level was raised, the girls who tried to compete on the season tracks crashed, and the boys competed with each other to see who had the most squares on their stomachs and Dict's charisma to get into the shoes of the retired filly.
They will say that it is a sports program that encourages physical activity and presents overcoming difficulties and challenges, but to the vast majority of viewers - average chair-puppies like us - Ninja Israel cultivates for us a model of sporting achievement that is inconceivable.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When the age of suspicion moves from punches to talk of holiness
It's weird to see the comedian, the ex of Comedy Store, host Channel 14's "Saturday Reception", where he's tasting chopsticks and giving a mainly male stage
If we were to play a game of association, we would all have the same answers to the question, "What does the concept of willingness to sit remind you of?" I'm going to go.
You say, "Sponge and toiletries, pots on gas and staircase odors, Iron Elan or my father as a TV actor", but the weirdest thing would be if someone suddenly said, "Age of grief".
'Cause a grief-stricken age in the midst of sponge and cooking is the most disconnected thing television can offer.
And indeed, "Saturday Night Live", his new show on Channel 14 at noon on Friday, is disconnected in spirit from the time it airs.
Along the middle of it -- the subwoofer is standing.
He speaks fast, holds a microphone even when he's tasting, and tries to split the dose between punches and talk about holiness.
In his defense, the budget deficit is felt, and that's probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also felt in the premiere, which aired the day before from headquarters in Benin, is a clear gender divide.
The men sang, played, danced, preached Torah, marketed restaurants and factories - while the women contented themselves with a small item, in which they excitedly told stories of sewing.
Happy women's day to you.
Got a date with Gilles Sauvre, now 14.
Protected Housing Association v. Ruthie Rousseau: "Saying 'this tastes like protected housing' is hurting our business".
Chairwoman Julie Geth wrote a letter expressing the union's complaint against what they claimed was an offensive statement by the judge of "Next Restaurant" in one of the trailers for the show.
Ruthie Rousseau responds, "I'm glad there are places that invest more in the cuisine of this population".
The Association of Nursing Homes and Safe Housing in Israel against "The Next Restaurant": In a letter sent to Israel Today by chairwoman Yuli Geth, it is written: "In the pre-show preview, which was distributed on all social networks and television, it is described that the professional judge of the competition said 'food tastes like safe housing', i.e. food from a closed establishment with low-quality food".
"The tone chosen by the show's judge, Ruthie Rousseau, to describe her disappointment with the food the contestant has filed to cancel our long-standing campaign to fight ignorance in the area is because the sheltered housing communities operate in the various houses restaurants for the benefit of the tenants with top-notch chef meals".
It added: "Service teams and homeowners struggle to maintain the image of secure housing that offers quality housing solutions for the elderly, including reduced loneliness, abundant recreation, a high standard of living, and more".
In Israel in recent years more and more families and older people are realizing that loneliness is the most serious illness of old age and are seen in community settings as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, which is why we devote resources and effort to providing our residents with the finest food.
Most shelters use professional chefs to build a menu.
We would be happy at any time to invite the judging panel to be impressed by the winning dishes served daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant staff at the sheltered housing, we apologize and clarify.
Let's come together, the media and Israeli society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly".
Ruthie Rousseau commented: "I'm glad there are places that are investing more in the cuisine of this population, who definitely deserve great food in their later years.
I respect the hard work of cooks, butchers, nurses and chefs everywhere, including safe houses".
"Double standards: in Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer responded to criticism from a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards.
"The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
♪ I'm going ♪
Nick Cave canceled a show in Russia earlier this week because of the war, declaring that he "stands with Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon".
In doing so, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also canceled shows in the invading country.
But in Cave's case, his cancellation notice took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmed has been criticized for being a transgender singer, as in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two concerts in Israel, despite much criticism from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to Israel, then-President Keefe told local media: "In the end, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians".
That same Ahmad remembered well Kiev's words for music and against politicization.
The fan even posted on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", a nasty post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupier state, so the situation of Palestine is the same as the situation of Ukraine.
"What bothers me about your post on Ukraine", Ahmed wrote. "That you did not support the Palestinians, who also suffer from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but I think Israel is primarily responsible for Palestinian suffering.
This makes me very sad, because you represent a double standard here", the Turkish fan concluded.
But the story doesn't end there, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmed in a long and detailed letter, stressing that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first scenario is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbour, in the hope of changing the security order of the whole of Europe.
The second situation is a complex friction between two peoples.
Conflicts, though, are similar in that innocent people, sharing a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel deep sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are or who they are".
Cave added that while he is not interested in detailing his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he definitely supports the Palestinians as well, noting that he has spent the last 20 years participating in fundraising events for them.
"But this is no time for debate, Ahmed", the singer made clear, "it's time to unite and support the Ukrainians, whose land is currently undergoing a disaster.
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians are strongly opposed to the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them - I would".
In light of the decline in illness, the Corona Projector will return to run the Zoo.
Professor Salman Zarqa was appointed in July 2021 and led the policy of treating the third and fourth waves of the coronavirus.
At the request of the Minister of Health, Nitszen Horowitz, will continue in parallel as a projector.
Professor Zarqa: "It is good that the omicron wave continues to subside, and it is still our duty to prepare for another wave".
I'm not going anywhere.
In light of the decrease in coronavirus cases, the coronavirus project, Professor Salman Zarqa, will return to run the Zhou Hospital in Zanzibar on Sunday.
At the request of the Minister of Health, Netan Horowitz, will continue in parallel his role as a projector.
"I am happy for the sake of the citizens of Israel that the wave of Omicron continues to subside and that we have received our normal lifestyle back", said Professor Zarqa, adding: "We still have a duty to prepare for another wave of illness as a result of the virus still being present here in Israel and around the world".
Professor Zarqa was appointed to the position in July 2021 and led the policy of treating the third and fourth waves of coronavirus.
Starting May 1, Israel returned to a "between-waves" status, which includes a reduction in most coronavirus cases, while maintaining the ability to conduct sequential testing and investigations, which will provide a basis for action in the event of a new variant being discovered.
I'm not sure.
A report by the National Knowledge and Information Center for the Corona Campaign, released this morning, states that "there is a decrease in the average number of new confirmed cases to below 2,000 per day, on a weekly average, along with a decrease in the number of hospitalized and critically ill patients".
However, they emphasized that "there is a significant underlying disease and the actual number of infections is much higher.
The number of institutional tests performed in the community (excluding foreign tests, MI) is low, and stands at less than 20,000 tests on average per week.
The low scope of testing makes it difficult to identify and understand trends".
State inspector's report: the actual budget for most years of operation of the pharmaceutical basket committee is less than the recommended budget
According to the report by Methanieu Angelmann, for over 20 years of basket activity, the Ministry of Health did not oversee the committee's activities.
The report also states that meeting minutes are published significantly late, if at all.
The critic also recommends increasing the transparency of the activities of the subcommittee ¢ and updating the procedures for the work of the basket.
Another flaw is that since the committee started, the Ministry of Health has not asked the hospitals to report on the volume of use and utilization of the drugs in Basel X, which would allow them to analyze and control the budget given to them.
The Drug Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees in our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new drugs to be given to the public free of charge through health insurance  but a new state inspector's report released today warns that it has been operating for more than 20 years without monitoring reports and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council overseeing and examining its activities.
Israel Today columnist Ren Reznik adds that the State Auditor's investigation was conducted in the wake of the ongoing exposures in Israel Today of drug cart manufacturers.
According to the report by Mettenjo Engelman, it recommends "to make corrections and improvements in the expansion of the basket, which will lead to a better utilization of the healthcare basket budget to which the public is entitled".
Throughout the years of existence of the mechanism of addition to the drug basket, in the years 2021-1998 medicines amounting to eight billion shekels were added to the state budget, with the addition moving annually in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, requests were made to add about 800 new medicines and technologies to the healthcare basket, at a total annual cost of more than NIS 2 billion.
In fact, the budget allocated to the expansion of the basket was less than the volume of requests.
For most of the committee's years of operation (90% of the time), the amount of the budget surplus was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired surplus rate.
The complainant notes that the amount of the annual premium should be reviewed and adjusted in order to allow for certainty and long-term planning.
Angelman also noted that "the transparency model in basketball work is lacking".
Thus, for example, the rules of procedure of the Basketball Committee stipulate that minutes of meetings, which are closed to the public, are to be published within 60 days, but in practice the minutes are published 160-109 days late, with sometimes the final minutes of meetings not being published at all.
"The delay in publishing protocols impairs the transparency of decisions; therefore, it may affect the ability of proposers  hospital organizations and pharmaceutical companies  to reapply as soon as possible and appropriately, after having learned from their rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and corrected their proposals, and made a reassessment as to their readiness to be accepted in the next round", the reviewer noted in the report.
"The Ministry of Health should publish the protocols according to the schedules established in the protocol".
Of the thousands of submissions, only one financial comment was submitted.
Another criticism of Engelman concerns the preliminary procedure of evaluating the technologies submitted to the drug basket.
The reviewer found that half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for the rejection.
Another deficiency concerns the operation of the subcommittee of the drug basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where patient numbers and drug costs are discussed.
The reviewer recommends that a public representative be included or that the discussions be made public without confidential commercial details.
The procedure of the Health Services Basket Committee states that "an economic assessment" must be submitted for a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, for the 2021-2019 Basket Committee hearings, requests were made to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report found that the requests did not include financial estimates, including estimates of the amount that could be saved by reducing the risk of obesity-related diseases or by avoiding gastric bypass surgery.
It also suggests that the decisions of the drug basket committee are not in line with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
For example, the Ministry of Health in 2019 defined prevention medicine and preparation for the treatment of cancer growth in chronic diseases as targets, but the decisions on the expansion of the basket did not emphasize the need to achieve these goals.
The complainant also warns that since 2011 the medicine basket has also included non-hospital insurance services, including rehabilitation and portable devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health ("third supplement").
That's when the legal framework for this step is only set in the past tense.
In the last six years, 74 million shekels from the supplement to the medicine basket have been used for these services.
Angelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work procedures and also determine whether a separate financial supplement is needed for these services.
About one-third of the new drugs that come into the drug basket are defined as "no-cost drugs", which don't cost the health insurance companies extra because they replace existing treatments.
The reviewer proposes to explore the possibility of these drugs being marketed in a different and shorter route, so that the medicine basket can be updated several times a year instead of just once a year.
There's no oversight of the use of particularly expensive drugs.
The criticism also shows that since the Basket Committee began its work 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked hospitals to report or monitor the volume of use and utilization of drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the Ministry to analyze and control the budget given to the boxes.
Over the years, only two reports were published covering the years 2009-2006, both of which were published significantly late (the last one was published this year and dealt with the use of the budget for the years 2009-2007).
"Delays in testing may lead to difficulties in data collection and analysis, irrelevance of conclusions after such a long time, subcommittee bias and decisions based on incomplete findings", the report said.
Also, the office does not oversee the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not produced samples.
These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion shekels in the years 2021-2016).
In this regard, the reviewer wrote: "It is recommended that the Department of Health conduct individual surveys of these drugs and technologies and compare their use with estimates.
Controls and analysis will allow systematic conclusions to be drawn about the work process of the Subcommittee on Basketball Committee and how the evaluators are prepared when pricing and improving medicines and technologies".
"Shocking and unfathomable: A heated debate at the Health Committee on poisoning at the Daffna home"
The first patient who died had normal blood counts ten minutes before she died.
Chairman of the committee, H.K. Silman: "If people there cared that the kitchen would be like home - it wouldn't look like this".
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old inmate of the Beth Dafna hostel in Holon died of food poisoning, her medical records were taken and they were normal, the hostel's director said at a hearing today (Tuesday) in the health committee.
"We've got night nurses who check in during the night and a nurse who does rounds.
There have been several reports of diarrhea, and this tenant actually last had measurements taken 10 minutes before she stopped responding, and they were normal.
She was on surveillance like the other Dayakers with diarrhea.
She's a nursing patient, we went to get Manoch to help move her and then the same tenant didn't respond.
We started resuscitation and called the nurse at the clinic", the director of the shelter described what happened last Sunday morning at the shelter.
This is an incident in which three residents died, six were hospitalized and a total of a quarter of the residents (33 out of 131) suffered diarrhea due to eating contaminated surfer meat.
The director of the shelter said this against the backdrop of allegations that death from food poisoning was the result of neglect and lack of oversight by the caregivers.
Dr. Naima Nuss, head of epidemiology at the Department of Health, noted that "we can't definitively determine what the three residents died of.
They only took blood samples".
It was also discussed that even from the residents who were admitted to the hospital, it was no longer possible to take a stool sample because it was not theirs and therefore the cause of death and illness could not be determined with certainty.
An engineer from the Ministry of Health also noted that "the Ministry of Health checks the health status of kitchens in institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or to renew the license".
The Ministry of Welfare has admitted that a committee has not yet been appointed to investigate this case and the previous case of abuse of children that took place three months ago at the Zion Children's Institution in Sharon.
The chairman of the Health Committee, H.K. Edith Silman, said during the discussion: "If people there cared that the kitchen would be like home - it wouldn't look like this.
The dorms in the welfare state need more.
They're in fragile health and require extreme care and supervision.
It's shocking and unfathomable what happened out there.
The terrible findings that came out were only after they knew the health department was coming to check.
Where's the oversight and accountability of the offices?
How is it that in a discussion like this, there are no ministers and CEOs present to explain what's going on here?"
Yigal Nahdoumi, the CEO of the Eckstein House who runs the home and even ran the home himself said, "Hundreds and thousands of people across the system are rising up with only one goal: to do good to people.
The people who died were people I personally treated.
You're one of the apartments I put to sleep on my hands.
This is a shocking event for us".
Sumder Una, a former resident of a dorm the same age as him, burst out at him and said, "Enough of the lies and nice words.
I was there".
Galli Bermi, representative of the parents of Bakim Israel: "We have complained about the food before and they didn't get the criticism".
Oren Hellman, founder of the Equal Opportunity Project for the inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities, complains that the names of the deceased have not been published: "We don't even know their names.
Are they worth less?
Disregarding our children's lives".
Suspected default at Wolfson: the surgeon ruptured the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Fars Abu Akkar as the head of the hospital's chest surgery unit.
The chairman of the medical board complained that the director, Dr. Engel, was warned before his appointment.
Hospital: "He is esteemed and experienced"
A terrible mistake was made at Wolfsson State Hospital in Holon, when during an operation the doctor tore open the patient's heart, leading to his tragic death.
The operation on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19.
This was the first surgery Dr. Farrah Abu-Aker performed at the hospital, after being named director of the chest surgery unit at Wolfson.
During the operation, which was intended to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, which led to heavy bleeding and caused the patient's death.
But the unusual complication opened a Pandora's box, raising serious questions about how to run the hospital.
The director of the Oncology Institute and chairman of the medical board, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation of the case in a letter he sent to the hospital administrator, Dr. Anat Engel.
The letter made the most serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu-Aker, after the previous unit director, Dr. Benny Zuckerman, was transferred to Shiba Hospital in Tel-Shamwar.
A giant hole in the heart
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient has been sober, functioning and being treated by him for the past four years.
Recently, he developed an outbreak of the disease, and an abnormal accumulation of fluid was discovered in the atrium, where the heart muscle is located.
Also, the surgeon, Dr. Abu Akkar, was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred in the operation, and Dr. Haghi Dekal, chief of the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Wolfson, who was operating on a child in the next room at the time, "was rushed to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart".
He said the heart was drained of blood, the BP was at zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said that Dr. Deckel approached him and told him that Dr. Abu-Aker was not professionally and personally suited to run a chest surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and despite the fact that he was supposed to be the direct manager of the chest surgeon, Dr. Engel held an auction without sharing it and accepted Dr. Abu-Aker for the position.
He also noted: "It is a simple procedure, which lasts a few minutes", adding: "We cannot ignore the flawed process of accepting Dr. Abu Akkar to the post.
The question arises as to whether there is direct responsibility of Engel for the failure of the operation and the death of the patient".
An experienced surgeon
Israel Today was presented with information and statements from other senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised in Dr. Ron Brenner's case.
Dr. Mordechai Shamounov, chief of surgery at A. Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint, writing that Dr. Abu Akkar is "one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but a relatively young breast surgeon".
He also added that he was selected in a proper auction and Dr. Deckel did not participate, in accordance with his statements about his desire to "disconnect" from the chest unit.
He also noted: "I was not a party to the proceedings either, and perhaps I should have been.
Dr. Shamounov wrote that Dr. Fares Abu Akkar started work on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace. "All the doctors at the hospital were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.
He's done dozens of similar procedures, and unfortunately, this case ended as it did.
A Wolfsson hospital spokesman said: "We share the family's grief.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ron Brenner.
The breast surgeon mentioned in the article is a highly regarded surgeon with many years of experience, and was selected in a tender to manage the breast surgery unit affiliated with the Department of Surgery at Wolfsson Hospital.
"According to Dr. Haghi Dhakal, his quotes are inaccurate and out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who was unfortunately in a very critical condition.
The hospital is looking at the details of the case with transparency, and the health department knows the details of the case".

Model of healing: Three top doctors tell about their mentors
Professor Gallia Rahab misses the wit and wisdom of Professor Marvin Shapira, especially during the pandemic.
Dr. Shalomi Kudesh has not forgotten, even in his role, the push from Professor Saul Soknik.
And Dr. Eberth Baron-Herb thanks Dr. Tommy Schinfeld for the class, sympathizing with the patients.
Three key people in hospitals write about who inspired and encouraged them to be better, as caregivers and as human beings.
Three senior doctors, three teachers of life and profession: On the occasion of the Israeli Doctor's Day, Israel Today invited Prof. Galya Raheb, Dr. Shalomi Kudish and Dr. Efrat Baron-Herb to recall the characters who accompanied them on their journey - and helped them become who they are today.
Professor Gallia Rahab, head of the infectious diseases unit in Shiba.
About Professor Marvin, who was a very nice man.
The encounter that opened my eyes - and changed my life
If I hadn't met Professor Marvin Shafra, who was the director of the infectious diseases unit at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have remained an internal medicine specialist.
He's the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to do it.
I met him in the hallways of Hades, back in the '80s.
I didn't think for a moment that I would leave the Infirmary, because I loved treating the patient himself; but Professor Shafira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also expressed in neurology, also in the Infirmary, and in fact in every field.
I thank him for bringing me into this realm.
All along, I liked his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with all his soul, who loved his patients, and he taught me not to take things for granted and to examine everything thoroughly.
He was a real, upright man, without ego, qualities that I loved very much.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was my role model and most influential, I was going to choose my father, Dr. Joseph Rakofer, Jr., a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a guerrilla unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine -- but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapira.
Both, for example, inspired proverbs that doctors use to this day - such as "Ticho is de persona", which means that taking a biopsy of tissue from an infected organ allows you to know which drugs to give; or "When You Use It Slowly, You Lose It Slowly", which is designed to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
Professor Shaira Zell was married to a physiotherapist who worked in engineering and father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven, I cried.
He was something -- a brilliant, clever epidemiologist who volunteered for anything.
He never complained, not even during his severe illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the epidemic team, and he's very much missing at this time.
If he were with us today, I'm sure I would consult him, and I'm sure he was one of the leaders of the epidemic team.
Bringing to Light: Measure of a Lighthouse
Dr. Salome Kudesh, director of the Soroka Hospital.
I'm going to tell you about Professor Saul Soknik.
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors.
I'm not going anywhere.
I first met Professor Saul Soknik when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I came on a tour of internal medicine in the D.I.D. that he ran.
I later returned to the department again in my sixth year, and I did my final medical school thesis under his guidance, writing a computer simulation of a patient with polyarthritis.
Saul influenced every significant juncture in my professional life for 20 years, and he was the most significant man in shaping my image as a doctor; not only professionally, but also - and most importantly - personally and personally.
During my internship, I was torn between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted with him about my choice of specialty.
I ended up choosing to specialize in internal medicine with him in Sorouka.
During my internship, he provided me with constant direction, in a variety of ways -- in scientific writing (sorry, I didn't stick around long enough), in dealing with patients, in working with a multidisciplinary team -- a field where the department excelled -- and, in fact, in every aspect of medicine.
To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and as an administrator, traits that come from hell.
When I finished my internship and was considering whether to go abroad for a pay period, Saul pushed and guided me, helping me with letters of recommendation and advice on how to proceed.
The transition period was a very important time in my professional development, and without Saul's support and encouragement, I'm not sure this would have happened.
On my return, when I was offered a position on the hospital board, Saul was again the one who supported and helped.
Then we went through some rough patches together in the internal medicine department.
Saul was able to perfectly integrate teacher, manager, friend, and team mate without their different roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to be as successful as he is in this particular combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns, who today are found throughout the Israeli medical system, and who perpetuate his memory and actions through their outstanding work.
I'm honored to be assigned to this group.

Dr. Ephret Baron-Herb, director of the Schneider Center for Pediatrics.
It's about Dr. Tommy Schinfeld.
The man who taught me medicine, especially listening.
Dr. Tommy Schinfeld, founder and former director of the intensive care unit at Schneider Children's Medical Center, taught me how to be an intensive care physician, but more than that -- he taught me how to think.
The obvious lesson I learned from him is to treat the most complex, sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious thing to do is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined that they would find themselves in these complex situations in the ICU with their children.
It sounds weird, but it's obvious.
But I learned even more profound and meaningful things from him.
Looking back, because I'm a doctor who's a manager and a manager who's a doctor, I can see the connection between the worlds today; the education I got from Dr. Schinfeld connects them.
Dr. Schinfeld taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to listen to the monitor, to listen to the nurses, to the care teams young and old alike, and to listen to the parents.
All of this needs to be done not only to communicate more accurately and effectively, but also to gather at all times a wealth of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in pediatrics are everywhere, and of course in intensive care as well.
Listening and talking creates a deeper understanding, both on the part of the treatment team and on the part of the patients and their families.
My understanding today as an executive is that these insights are true even when looking at a whole system.
The deeper and more rigorous the understanding that takes place, integrating in the dialogue all the treating factors, the more precise the decision-making process will be, tailored to the situation, and most importantly - early in order to prevent future damages, immediate or distant.
That's why Dr. Tommy Schinfeld is so much more than an inspiration to me.
He's a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and precise, to listen -- and then to apply.

Medical negligence at different stages of labor
In order to win damages, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that the damage was caused by negligence.
Birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family's life.
But unfortunately, sometimes births end in serious birth or delivery damage caused by medical negligence.
In cases where childbirth ended in a physical injury, to the child or to the mother, there is room to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even to consider seeking legal counsel.
A medical malpractice attorney will examine whether there were any defects in the medical staff's conduct at the various stages of the birth that caused the harm and, where appropriate, consult a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every medical error amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of the term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily teach that the treatment was negligent.
When, then, is it negligence?
When the doctor's error was due to a lack of skill or a deviation from a reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have been caused otherwise.
In this article, we will examine the different stages of labor, explain what complications may occur at each stage and when they amount to medical negligence.
The axis phase
The axis phase lasts on average between 8 and 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (to allow passage of the fetus at birth) and should reach a diameter of about four inches [10 cm] at the end of the process.
Most cases of medical negligence in the pivotal stage involve the failure to recognize fetal distress before birth, which causes damage to the unborn child sometimes even manifesting as cerebral palsy.
Cerebral palsy:
Cerebral palsy may be caused by a failure to detect or delay the detection of a subconjunctivitis, which is manifested by a failure to supply oxygen to the fetal brain tissue.
As a rule, monitoring of the condition of the newborn and the correct placement of the fetal heart monitor should lead to early detection of fetal distress development, allowing the medical team to act quickly and rescue the newborn before it is irreversibly damaged.
Cases in which the medical team ignores signs of oxygen deprivation in the fetus or misinterpret the data in front of the fetus and on the fetal monitor or responds late to stress on the monitor may constitute negligence.
Cerebral palsy can also be caused by a fall of the umbilical cord as well as a rupture of the uterus that is not detected in time.
Even in these extreme cases, it's worthwhile to find out if the medical team acted properly.
For example, attorney Anna Reif Ligenza, of the financial firm Serrore & Co., which specializes in representing medical malpractice victims, reports that her office handled a lawsuit of a child who was injured during birth after the midwife popped the sac of spleen when the fetal head was too high, thereby causing the umbilical cord to fall (when the umbilical cord precedes the fetal head) and impaired oxygen supply to the fetal brain (as a result of the fetal head pressing on the umbilical cord) and giving birth to a severely neurologically impaired child.
In another case, a lawyer said that her office filed a lawsuit due to gross medical negligence on the part of a maternity ward staff at a large hospital who during the delivery did not recognize any obvious signs that should have led to a real suspicion that the newborn had a tear of the uterus in the area of the surgical scar of her previous pregnancy.
The fetus that escaped through the rupture into the abdominal cavity suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued late on the verge of death.
Due to severe fetal distress during birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
It should be emphasized that, in order to obtain damages, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal relationship between the negligence of the medical team that led to the breastfeeding diagnosis and the damage caused to the unborn child, that is, that the damage was caused by negligence and not by any other cause or factor.
The causal link will be established by examining medical indicators that, according to the medical literature, are the only indicators of a causal relationship between suffocation and brain injury.
Among other things, they look at the foetus' blood levels of acids, its abortion scores, the presence of neurological and systemic damage, and more.
The death of the fetus
The active stage of labor
The active stage of labor begins when the cervical opening reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
In addition, the baby's birth was postponed and a caesarean section was avoided.
In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, Carrie, a lack of progression of the active birthing process.
In such cases, a caesarean section is usually performed to prevent various harmful effects on the fetus from delayed labor.
"There are instances when failure to perform a cesarean on time can cause irreversible damage to the fetus", explained lawyer Rafe-Ligenza.
"For example, we were handling a medical malpractice lawsuit of a stillborn child who died due to a significant delay in a C-section.
Unlike any known medical practice, medical staff were not trained to recognize fetal distress and perform a cesarean despite the extremely slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the surgery caused great structural damage to Luda which ultimately led to her death shortly after her birth".
Carelessness in the Birth of a Vacuum
In situations where there is a significant danger to the mother or fetus requiring a particularly rapid termination of labor, a vacuum birth is sometimes performed.
In this process, a vacuum "dope" is placed on the fetus's head and the fetus is forcibly pulled out.
Naturally, this action involves risks and can cause harm to both the fetus and the mother and therefore requires great care, accuracy, and skill.
In these cases, medical negligence may be manifested by the physician not following mandatory guidelines and performing the operation despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the fetal head is too high in the pelvis, or performing it for too long or when despite the failure of several attempts the physician continues and repeats the operation more than the number of attempts allowed.
In these cases, if the careless vacuum action caused damage, among other things, it may cause cranial damage and bleeding that could lead to the development of brain damage, there is room for a damages claim.
Paralysis in the name of ERB
Paralysis named after Arb, this is a congenital nerve damage in the brachial plexus (a nerve junction that connects the spine to the upper part of the shoulder) and when it occurs during childbirth it is worth checking whether the damage occurred due to negligence of the birthing staff.
The injury manifests in weakness of the arm muscles and can lead to complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in discharging the newborn due to the occurrence of 'paraplegia' - a congenital emergency that occurs when the fetus' shoulders are trapped inside the birth canal after its head has been removed.
When should you suspect that the paralysis was caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the weight assessment of the fetus indicates that it is a chromosomal fetus, meaning that it is expected to be born weighing more than 15 pounds [4.5 kg] and according to the guidelines it is preferable to deliver the mother by cesarean section.
When the baby weighs more than 10 pounds, a cesarean should be considered in light of risk factors, including gestational diabetes and second stage labor delays.
In the event that the medical team ignores the estimate of abnormal fetal weight or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with a vaginal birth and the risk of shoulder fracture and paralysis from ERB is realized, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.
Indeed, in EC 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk of shoulder formation during birth can be predicted in advance with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder formation, where there is a risk of it occurring, is by cesarean section".
The exit phase of the placenta
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its exit occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the exit of the baby and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process usually lasts for up to half an hour after the baby comes out and often occurs spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical staff.
After the egg is removed, the medical team will check to see if it came out whole or if there are any parts of the egg left in the uterus.
At this stage, complications may occur that could cause serious birth defects.
One of the most common complications of uterine fibrosis is called Ashman syndrome. Uterine fibrosis is the result of inflammation caused by uterine fibrosis, a condition that affects the uterine lining to the point that the cervix cannot move.
Therefore, in cases where the medical team failed to identify any residual bone or failed to take all appropriate measures to prevent uterine fibroid injury despite suspected residual bone in the uterus, it may be a case of medical negligence and the case merits further examination by an experienced attorney.
Death at birth
A stillbirth during childbirth is a fairly rare occurrence.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family turns, unfortunately, into the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the newborn in time or responds late to such bleeding.
"For example . . . ", explained attorney Reif-Lingenza, "our firm filed a claim involving a stillbirth in which the medical team ignored and failed to respond to the life-threatening signs of the birth for hours and was late in diagnosing massive and uncontrollable bleeding that was a known complication of her underlying illness".
"In another case", explained attorney Reif-Lingenza, "our firm represented the relatives of a woman who died after giving birth to twins due to hemorrhaging caused by an improperly sewn caesarean section.
In the same case, the midwife complained of severe pain and weakness after the operation, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints and clinical condition, responding only late after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death".
Loss of uterus
In serious cases, medical negligence at birth can lead to a hysterectomy, says lawyer Rafe Lingza: "Our firm sued a hospital on the grounds of medical negligence after childbirth.
In the same case, the woman, a 31-year-old, lost her womb due to a failure to properly treat massive bleeding observed by the medical staff after the birth and yet no action was taken in time that could have prevented the damage".
What are the compensation claims for medical negligence in childbirth?
Childbirth compensation for injury due to medical negligence at birth includes many damage components, with the most significant amounts being for pain and suffering, nursing and paid care, lost wages and pensions for the victim and even for his parents and other damage components.
The compensation awarded to an injured minor for lost wages and pensions is calculated in most cases on the basis of the average wage in the household.
Also, the compensation includes medical expenses, medical and rehabilitation equipment costs, housing adaptation costs for the baby, mobility and more.
"The amount of the compensation is determined in each case by the person and his circumstances", explains attorney Rafe-Ligenza, adding that "today most medical malpractice claims end in a settlement that weighs the chance and risk each party has in the proceedings". However, the lawyer added that "there are cases where the proceedings end only in a verdict, in which if the lawsuit is not dismissed, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages and, for example, in a lawsuit brought by our firm, the District Court ruled that a minor who had suffered a cerebral hemorrhage due to an Irish vaginal hernia received compensation in excess of ten million shekels".
In summary
Medical negligence at birth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.
In these cases, a proper legal examination of the sequence of events that led to the tragic outcome, by a lawyer trained in handling medical malpractice claims, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
That's why there's a high incidence of corticosteroid eye disease in the South.
Research has suggested a link between the development of the disease and close marriages
The highest prevalence was in the Bedouin sector.
Expert: "It's possible that in any sector with a lot of cousin marriages, there's a high incidence of the disease".
Cartoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairment.
It's very important to diagnose it early and find the right solutions to prevent it from getting worse.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted that help us understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new findings provide scientific evidence to suspect that corticosteroid eye disease is a genetic disease.
A recent study, which looked at the transformation of the cornea from a forked to a scratched shape, found that the cause of corneal disease and weakness and distortion of its shape is related to an enzyme imbalance, whereby free radicals can damage the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The source of that enzyme deficiency is genetic, which supports the hypothesis that cartocinosis is an inherited disease.
According to Professor Ariella Gordon-Shag, head of the Department of Optometry at Hadassah Academy College, "In a study published in the field among Arab students in Haifa, a 3.2% incidence of cartoconus was found.
The highest prevalence was among students from the Bedouin sector -- 20 percent had cartoconus, but there was a relatively small sample".
The researcher added that this finding is not surprising: "Cartoconus is very common in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we found that close marriages are a risk factor for C.T.D.
So in any sector with a lot of cousin marriages, we might find a high prevalence".
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding in light of the unambiguous conclusion: in cases where there is a family history of CKD, all family members should have an appropriate eye exam as soon as possible.
According to Erza Proctor, a B.Sc. clinical optometrist, "there is ten times more clinic visits from remote peripheral areas, especially the southern area, than the center".
Procter adds: "Over the last decade I have noticed that most patients are coming from the periphery, especially from the Beersheba area.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriages within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and the lack of awareness of proper treatment of the problem".
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Procter explains that cartoconus usually develops in adolescence or late teens (ages 16-15 or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, along with an increase in cylinder capacity.
Cartoconus patients have distorted and/or blurred vision of shapes and bones.
These symptoms worsen with the development of the disease, which usually progresses slowly and gradually over years.
However, the disease may also progress rapidly and reach a peak in just a few months.
Many of the patients even show increased sensitivity to light.
Three years after the operation in Gaza, the IDF revealed the name of Colonel M. Bennett: "Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel".
Mahmoud Khir a-Din from the village of Harfish is a lieutenant who was killed in the operation at Khan Yunis.
"The publicity is for him, his family and his children".
We'll be considering the possibility of publishing a photo of Colonel Emmanuel Moreno patrolling the headquarters.
About three and a half years after the operation that got involved in Khan Younis, the IDF allows today to announce that the one killed in action, Colonel M, is Colonel Mahmoud Khir a-Din Zall from the village of Khorphish in the north.
The 41-year-old was in Naples.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "It has been three and a half years since Lieutenant-Colonel Mahmoud Hira al-Din Jalal was killed in action in a covert operation in Khan Younis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the country.
"Mohammed Jalal was a paratrooper and later rose through the ranks to become a lieutenant colonel in the IDF's Special Operations Unit.
Israeli hero decorated posthumously with the Chief of Staff's Cross.
He added: "I condolenced him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and face of the hero of Israel, Lieutenant Colonel Mahmoud Hira al-Din, openly.
The environment has its eyes on him.
Since the operation, the IDF has prohibited his name from being published for security reasons, and today, after a discussion by the head of the Intelligence Branch, Major Aaron Haliho, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, a hero of Israel, was born on 28 December 1977 in the village of Khorphish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmad and Nassira, and has seven siblings.
He's a member of the Druze Witness.
Was married to a man and father of two sons.
He served as an officer, combatant, and special operations commander in the Intelligence Branch.
Throughout his life, Khair al-Din was a social leader, and the world looked up to him.
He attended school in the village of Khurphish until the fourth grade, and then went to the military boarding school at the Royal School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he enlisted in the Parachute Regiment, and in 2000 he graduated from Officer Candidate School.
In 2002, he was spotted by the MNA's Special Operations Unit and went to serve in it.
During his service he completed a Bachelor's degree in Law from the College of Management and a Master's degree in Education and Business Administration from the University of Haifa.
In 2002 he met his wife, Nahad, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year in which he and his friends founded an organization that works to advance the status of the Druze Witnesses in Israel.
In 2010 he joined the "Other" association and started to guide a group in the village of Khorphish, after ensuring that its association would start to work in Druze villages to encourage youth to join the army.
In 2013, our second son was born.
Chief of the General Staff, Colonel Aaron Haliwa, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "It is time we become involved in revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din, the hero of Israel.
We've completed our work and we've concluded that there is no security impediment to releasing his name and picture.
He deserves it too, his family and his children", he said.
"Exceptional Educator and Leader"
"Through many operations he is no less than a hero in my eyes", said the champion of Haliwa.
"He has made a significant contribution, with courage and coolness, to the State of Israel.
He deserves his rightful place".
He added: "I didn't know him personally, but he was an outstanding educator, mentor and leader - not just on the operational side, but on my values as well".
Chief Haliho said that he would consider publishing the photo of another hero, Colonel Emmanuel Moreno, who died in the Second Lebanon War.
The operation in Khan Younis took place on 11 November 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of meticulous preparation by the intelligence community.
In the command of the operation sat the then Chief of Staff, Colonel Gadi Ezenkot, then Chief of the General Staff, Major Tamir Hayman and then Chief of Staff, Nedab Ergman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been made public, and the IDF has stressed that this is an operation that the intelligence community will not tolerate.
But in the Arab media, they've been showing off communications equipment that the Palestinians say was left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was to plant the bugs.
According to reports, on the day of the incident, the force drove two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint set up by Hamas men, and something about their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas operatives.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The field investigation lasted about 45 minutes, during which time it became more and more aggressive.
When the force realized it was in a precarious situation, Colonel Khair al-Din managed to distract the Hamas people, and in a split second, this force commander, Colonel A, managed to open fire.
The fire killed three Hamas members, and unfortunately also Colonel Khair al-Din.
Ten months after the difficult incident, the Chief of Staff, Colonel Abib Kochbi, decided to accept the recommendation of the PLA Committee and award the Chief of Staff to three of the fighters in the incident deep in the Strip - among them also Colonel Khir a-Din Zhal.
The commander of the fighter force and another fighter on the team also received a CBP.
The Army's announcement said that Colonel M received the Medal of Honor "for his actions in the operation with his command, in enemy territory, with determination, coolness and courage, in defense of his comrades".
Subsequently, he acted out of initiative and desire for contact, took a leading role in capturing the enemy and acted with resourcefulness to advance the takeover.
Consider moving from Pinza operations to a full-scale operation
Israel needs to ask itself, again, if it is not right to change policy towards the Jenin Quarter.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank, but the Jenin gunmen may have no choice.
The stormy weekend we've been through shows that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the terrain is still explosive.
It will take a lot of hard work and dedication to cross the two upcoming commemorative dates peacefully: the day of the "Nakba" that began today (the first), and the day of Jerusalem that will be marked in two weeks.
Not a few factors will stand in the way of trying to bring Tramp back to his senses.
In their minds, as always, are the terrorists, who are focusing a special effort on trying to preserve the violent atmosphere of recent weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the day before was killed a Navy fighter, R.S.V.N.M.R.Z.L.
Fighters who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they did not remember such an extent of gunfire and violence - testimony not only to the sheer amount of ammunition on the ground, but also to the willingness to use it.
This forces Israel to ask itself, again, if it is not right to change policy towards the Jenin caste, and move from small, intelligence-based Pinza operations to a large, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel was prevented from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank and the entire arena; even now, the security system prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid arson, but the Jenin gunmen may not leave it a choice.
To draw the lessons for future events.
Reza's death in battle is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims to have deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shirin Abu Akla.
An operational activity is a dangerous affair for those who participate in it and for those present on the scene.
The IDF is taking huge risks for its forces to avoid hurting innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes paying for it with the lives of fighters.
This indicates high morale, but it also has intelligence value: A terrorist captured alive - as happened the day before in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about terrorism, attacks, and other terrorists; it is information that is often not available in any other way, and it can be used to thwart future attacks.
The IDF did the right thing the day before by releasing its interim investigation into the death of Abu Akla, making it clear that it is not possible to determine at this stage who caused her death.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful that a definitive bottom line can be reached.
In any case, it seems that nothing will convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without having to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terrorism - the original cause on behalf of which the IDF is continuously operating in Jenin.
As always, the nature of such stories is to die.
The world's public opinion is busy maturing and moving on, especially as Ukraine continues to rage in several intense wars.
Therefore, it is unfortunate that Israel insisted on giving the interpretation of Abu Akhla's death even more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's poor handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu-Aqla's family did not live up to the initial conclusions, they should have expected a little more skill from the police who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly less excitement from the Palestinian flags that were waved.
Responsibility obliges us to act to calm the situation.
Well done to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Chief of Police for ordering an investigation.
It appears to have lacked adequate training and clear guidelines, but what's disturbing is that this is the second time this has happened to police in a short period of time, and in two different counties.
In the incident at Dizengoff, too, the police failed to manage the event, isolate the scene and handle the media.
Well, the inquiry committee will do well not only to analyze the officers' conduct at the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions that will allow for a more successful handling of similar incidents in the future.
In addition to internal police treatment, he's also committed to reporting on the behavior of public elected officials who have lost their way and direction.
The Knesset currently has a number of members who pose a threat to democracy.
They're on the left and the right, using their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
HHK Ofer Kassif is the latest example of this; if no action is taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the state will implicitly encourage the next generation of elected officials to further police their actions.
Moves like this, which in the eyes of a defending democracy, are essential in the explosive times of this era, with factors behind them that seek to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with a clear head is expected to rise above all of this and act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel may quickly slip into an escalation against enemies from outside, and worse - against enemies from within.
Police official: "Government policy and goal setting are required"
The Israeli police have launched an operation to evict the illegal residents, but the road is still long.
There is no single factor in the State of Israel today that encompasses all of this".
"If you want to deal with the illegal resident phenomenon, you need government policy, and from it you need to define goals, tasks and responsibilities.
Today there is no single factor in the State of Israel that includes all this", a senior police official told Israel Today.
Until a month and a half ago, before the security situation worsened, the phenomenon was manifested by 20,000 to 30,000 inmates who entered every day through the breaches in the fence.
In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day to work through 34 controlled checkpoints.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each branch is limited to a cap that is set by the diplomatic rank according to the security, economic and political situation in the State of Israel.
Permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Directorate.
Given this, a BAH is not necessarily a Palestinian who has been banned from entering due to criminal involvement or connection to attacks, but in many cases it is Palestinians who have been jailed because they do not meet the permissions limit.
It should be emphasized that the perpetrators of the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Alaed were considered to be praiseworthy, but were not supervised, because they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required the security forces to monitor their movements.
"Therefore, there is no point in their entering through the breaches in the fence", says a senior security official, "whoever wants to carry out an attack can also enter the country through the controlled crossings, and there have been cases like this in the past.
Thousands of arrests
In the wake of the attack in Alaed and in light of multiple reports of attacks, the police have launched a large-scale operation to track down illegal residents.
By the end of the week, 16,000 prisoners had been arrested.
About 600 of them were questioned and had criminal cases, and about 200 were jailed.
According to police prosecutor's policy, proceedings against unlawful stay are only conducted against convicted criminals or repeat offenders (recidivists).
An illegal first-time resident is investigated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes the same thing happens a second time, but only the third time he is arrested, imprisoned, and charged with being illegal.
According to the law, if an illegal resident is caught within 50 to 100 yards of each side of the separation fence, he is handled by the military prosecutor.
Data obtained by Israel Today shows that in 2021 40,010 illegal residents, travelers and passengers were handled by the police.
7,405 illegal residents were arrested and 19,533 criminal cases were opened.
The number of employers, drivers and passengers handled by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and 5,640 criminal cases were opened.
"The foundations of the praise phenomenon do not depend on the police, not on the IDF, not on Israeli society, not on Palestinian society.
They depend on other factors", says a law enforcement official.
"To address the phenomenon, their motivation to go to work in Israel must be stripped away, and the Israeli side must charge them a price to prevent them from crossing the fence.
Those involved claim that the price is not being collected because of a lack of places in prison and the fact that arrests are only made when there are accompanying offences or a repeat offender.
Legal sources argue that the decision to charge a fee to the hospital only began with his third arrest, partly because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests being made every day.
Whoever examines the punishment will find that it is not deterrent".
There's a lot of complexity.
"He is", says a police source, "a complex man".
He could be a family man who came to this country to work to earn a few shekels and come back.
It's the basic platform, and it's used by all sorts of people who come into the country to commit crimes or attacks.
A hospital can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, 16-year-old illegal residents were caught by the police and even 8- and 10-year-old children were sent by their parents to crossroads to earn a few shekels a day.
"It also complicates matters because in such cases we have to bring in the parents and file charges for neglect", says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced construction work.
In the past, there were also local authorities who employed inmates in garbage disposal, mainly in the north.
Of the 34 passages, there are about 18 main passages.
There are transit routes for vehicles and goods, there are transit routes for people only and there are transit routes that are both.
All crossings are monitored by the IDF and the Transit Authority.
The pilgrims are usually driven into the country by private drivers, since it's easy money.
"There are those who do it for a living and there are gangs whose main occupation is transporting people", says a police official, "usually mostly Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and correspond with them.
It can go up to 100 shekels to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies don't do this, because if the company gets caught, it's doomed to shut down".
The police point out that under certain circumstances, driving to a hospital can be considered a misdemeanor.
"A taxi driver who operates with licenses in accordance with the license and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at scheduled points and at fixed hours, including by scheduled appointment, does not break the law", says a senior police official, "Whoever knows he is driving in the desert, usually picks them up at night at hidden points, including unloading at hidden points.
"Most of these guys are driving a truck from Chukmak because they know we're confiscating their car, so they'd rather drive an old one".

In addition, arrests were also made in the village of Silwad east of Ramallah, as well as the detention at home of three students from the Qatlah al-Islamiyah, the Hamas-linked list at Anjaah University in Sham, which recently recorded violent clashes with Fatah students and security forces on campus.
"Criminal investigation must be initiated against her": city inspector of Haifa on serious charges of torturing Klish Rotham
The city inspector's report presents concerns about alleged criminal conduct by Dr. Anata Klish Rotherham against former city officials and political opponents: stalking employees and inflated payment to the accounting firm for conducting investigations.
"The grave findings of the report warrant the opening of a criminal investigation".
The city of Haifa has not responded.
Stalking of city employees and political opponents and a hefty fee to the accounting firm for conducting investigations, "at the expense of the public purse".
A report by the Haifa Municipal Inspector Ofer Tal published yesterday (Tuesday) raises fears of alleged criminal offences by the mayor, Dr. Taten Klish Rotherham, against former municipal officials, municipal employees, and political opponents.
According to the suspect, Klish met with the accounting firm of Berlab & Co. and requested an investigative review.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former mayor, and a code name given to the council member, Sopi Neks, and we checked whether the tenders between the city and a company owned by Neks' family, are eligible for the hedrin.
The auditor's report also shows that there is a complete disorder and lack of control over the work of an accountant with whom she had a cliché encounter.
The municipal treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to centralize and synchronize the work of the accountant and the municipal departments and the data collected by the accountant has not been transmitted to him.
As a result, no one in the municipality was aware of all the projects being carried out by the accountant, and what the scope of work required for each of them was.
Moreover, the hourly reports submitted by the accountant were in many cases not duly certified.
A situation arose in which the scope of matters in which the accountant was involved grew disproportionately, with much interference in the ordinary conduct of the municipality, without any supervision and monitoring by the municipality.
To sum up the report, the review recommended that the accountant's outstanding payments be suspended until material is received detailing his work on each of the issues examined.
In addition, accounts filed with the Haifa Municipality were under codes such as "threshold guards", information store, fish shop, investigative review of the mayor and an investigative review report on purchases.
Shortly thereafter, the deputy city attorney, attorney Ymit Klein, noted that the mayor herself had signed the payment authorization on her behalf.
"Not ordered by any review report and I don't know what it's about", she wrote.
It is also known that the cost of the investigative review is about two million shekels of which one and a half million shekels were paid and about half a million shekels remained to be paid, from the tax money of the public charity.
Former Mayor Jackie Wakim responded: "These vile acts of defaming elected officials at the expense of the public purse and the taxpayer are a criminal offense".
Sofi lashed out at the city councilwoman in her response: "The inspector's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves".
Reaction of the lawyer of Hirat Gulen, a member of the Haifa City Council: "The evidence and the hard findings from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the Counsellor for Investigative Review to conduct investigations, which raises doubts as to whether some of them are permitted by law in the way they were conducted and in particular the investigations concerning the opposition member of the council, the mayor and former senior officials".
Lior Detz of the Threshold Guards Association: "All the red lines seem to have been crossed that a public authority sends private investigators to gather information against lawyers representing an organization that exposes corruption and while its law firm is conducting public proceedings against the Haifa Municipality".
Haifa Municipality has not responded.
The Judah Barrab accounting firm is not interested in commenting.
"Iran and Hezbollah worked together to undermine UNICEF's activities in Lebanon".
The Defense Minister attended the International Cyber Conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel knows its adversaries' cyber systems and their methods of operation".
Gantz referred, among other things, to al-Sayed's recording of Hamas captivity: "A video aimed at blackmail  on the back of a humanitarian issue".
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed, "We foiled an attempt to poison the water systems".
Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke at the International Cyber Conference of the Cyber Center at the University of Tehran this morning, where he revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to hit UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another hit by Iran and Hezbollah on Lebanese civilians and the stability of the country", Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hamas captive Hisham al-Sayed in Gaza, released by the terrorist group's military wing: "Yesterday a video was released aimed at extortion on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four boys captive in violation of international law, in violation of morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal behavior of Hamas".
He added that "the State of Israel is acting by various means, and continues to turn every stone to bring the boys home.
As we have said before, this is a humanitarian issue, that's how we see it, and on that basis we will continue to act.
Extortion attempts and mind exercises will not affect our attitude and behavior".
He further revealed a joint activity of Iran and Hezbollah: "Iran is also activating its disruption in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today, that recently activity of Iranian security forces in cooperation with Hezbollah has been detected, to undermine the activities of the UNIFIL forces in Lebanon.
This was done by conducting a cyber operation that was intended to steal materials on UNIFIL's preparations in space, and use them by Hezbollah.
This is another blow by Iran and Hezbollah to the Lebanese people, and to the stability of Lebanon".
"Israel knows its adversary's cyber systems and their methods of operation.
We have seen in recent years a phenomenon of Iranian hacking groups operating against Israel and other countries", Gantz continued.
"The new shipments are terrorists with a keyboard who are judged like other terrorist fighters.
We know who they are, we're hitting them and their desktops, and even today they're on our radar -- and not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack on Israeli civilians will be on the agenda today.
And the responsibility lies with the aggressors and the state that funds and sends them.
A cyber attack can be responded to in a variety of ways in cyberspace and beyond".
Gantz continued in his attack on the nuclear power: "Iran is leading cyber terrorism and making moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the US presidential election and other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Operations such as that of the Shahid Awaah unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries, were carried out under the direct directive of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards as revealed in the investigations".
He added that "in recent years we have made many attempts to break into private and public companies, in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber responsibility' and punish companies and bodies that do not act according to guidelines".
Gantz went on to outline Israel's next goals in the face of threats: "Our top mission, in the military, in the industries and in the various security organizations is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The chief and I have made this issue one of the key tasks in the relevant units.
We're looking at power building all the time, both in terms of manpower, both in terms of training and also in terms of assignments.
In the coming years, we will also have to examine the form of organization, management and operation of cyber warfare, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system.
Finally, the Minister of Defense concluded by calling for cooperation with the world: "Our cooperation with the world against Iran is also of great importance in the cyber dimension.
The same partnerships that we are building in the region with Iran in terms of defense against various threats, we are also expanding in the cyber dimension".
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed, "We foiled an attempt to poison the water systems".
Uri, the deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit's first public appearance at such conferences, that Israel had foiled an attack on the water systems.
"The deterrence of cyber threats is a central part of our operations.
Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, to be able to identify him and act to eliminate his capabilities", said Deputy Commander 8200, adding, "So sometimes we also find victims outside Israel and then we contact other agencies if necessary.
We do this both independently and in collaboration with industry and other agencies, through the implementation and use of tools that we've developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed".
The threat to Israel's water systems and attempts to poison Israel's citizens was revealed: "We foiled an attempt to seize Israel's critical water systems and poison them several years ago.
In another case, we also identified that an adversary had attacked Israel, and in the process we identified that the same attacker was also trying to target power plants in the United States.
That was the first indication of this attack.
This threat has been prevented by working closely with our American partners".
Watch: This is how police are trained to eliminate terrorists from the civilian population
The Jerusalem Police Department is setting up a new "Assaf" facility to simulate shooting in a crowded crowd in response to a series of attacks in recent months.
The MGB's Counter-Terrorism Guide Surrounds Jerusalem: "Development, providing a relevant response to the threats and simulating the reality on the ground"
A look at the Assaf facility.
Preparing for the next attack: A series of terrorist attacks carried out this spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, killing 19 people and wounding about 70 civilians, led the Border Guard to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to storm terrorists within the civilian population and fire on the move.
"Israel Today" exposes: A look at the Assaf facility
Popular terrorism focuses on targeting civilians and aims to undermine the sense of security necessary to lead a normal civilian life.
The severe wave of attacks this year, with attacks in Bar Sheba, Badra, Bani Barak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that occurred in early April on Dizinghoff Avenue in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist who was embedded in a crowd, led the police to think creatively about developing a tool that would allow a trained fighter to attack terrorists within a civilian population.
The thinking was led by the police training wing and the Border Patrol.
These competed in different police districts under the title of "Leading Learning Commanders", in which each district was required to develop means to help improve the policing and combat skills of its warriors, officers and commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need to train MGB fighters to fight in shooting training in motion and in this kind of situations, Asaf Ben David, a counter-terrorism instructor for the MGB surrounding Jerusalem, developed the "Asaf device", which consists of a dynamic target, connected to a telescopic mount on which is a lever that can be leveraged by the instructor.
Their job is to guide the bearer to our death, he can practice the warrior in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be emphasized that in recent years, Border Guard fighters have faced many attacks in which the attacker, shooting and posing a threat, moves through areas saturated with innocent civilians.
"Asset device", in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic rod that's upgraded and integrated into the device is taken out of maintenance and cleaning.
The device can simulate shooting in motion within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling a traffic stop, selecting a path of progress, selective firing including practice of preventing harm to non-involved personnel.
Sergeant Asaf Ben David, whose facility is named after him, says, "The facility we've developed is a breakthrough in the education and training of soldiers and police.
Development, providing a relevant response to the threats of the relationship and simulating the reality on the ground.
The development benefit versus the relatively low production cost gives us a significant competitive advantage".
State comptroller warns: "Central Election Commission is unprepared for cyber threats"
Medhiyo Angelman warned at International Cyber Week of Israel's unwillingness to respond to crackdowns.
"World War III will be a hacker war, but the world is not ready for it".
State visitor Metindjo Angelman attended the annual Tel Aviv University cyber conference today (Wednesday) and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
"We are exposed.
Our data is exposed to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it".
Engelman said that the cyber-security checks carried out by his editorial office found significant flaws: "Over the past year we have conducted penetration checks at the Jerusalem traffic control center, hospitals and tax authorities systems.
We found significant deficiencies in the reviews, including the fact that very few penetration tests were conducted by public bodies and some of them only conducted penetration tests during the review.
There were also weaknesses in the Central Election Commission's cyber threat preparedness".
"We at the State Auditor's Office are committed to continuing to address this significant issue in greater detail, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world", he concluded.
"I came to Jerusalem for the purpose of obtaining titles"
Choice in red: "From the first moment they showed me they wanted me, I'm built to lead a big team"
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: "I felt I had a place, I wanted to be in the Eurobasket team" •
And the Maccabean period: "I learned to focus only on what I could control".
Oz Blazer in the interview.
Oz Blazer will leave today with the Israel national team players to Poland, where they will meet the local team in the prelims of the 2023 World Championships (Thursday, 21:30 Israeli time).
Three days later, the national team will host Estonia in a full team room.
In addition to his intensive training with the team, Blazer has been working on his future for the past week, until he signed a two-year deal in Jerusalem.
"I have a peaceful head now that I found a group", he tells Israel Today in his first special interview since signing.
"I'm under a little pressure right now because I have to move in with my family after we settled downtown and it's not easy, but there are no phones anymore and professionally I'm a lot calmer".
You haven't been on the team in four years, how happy you are to be back, and how much you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to enjoy the team and I come in an attitude of contributing in any way I can, whether it's from my experience or whether it's on the field.
Of course I'd love to play, but when it comes to the team, everyone has to put their ego aside and do whatever it takes to make the team succeed.
I'm here for whatever they need me for".
Now you're 14 players, and the European championship will be joined by Danny Abadia, Gaby Cachavilli returns, and maybe there will be more changes.
Did you make it your goal to be on the championship team?
"I'd love to be on the field and contribute".
The 29-year-old blazer has played the last two seasons for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
By the end of the season, it was clear he wouldn't continue in yellow and after a few weeks he moved to the capital, preferring Jerusalem to the mall.
You had other offers. Why did you choose the Jerusalem operation?
"They showed a very great willingness for me to be there, so it was a relatively easy negotiation.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I knew this was the place for me.
The situation also seems good and appropriate to me.
I'm here to lead and be a meaningful part of the team.
I talked to the coach and he has a hard-working, winning mentality, and that's exactly what I'm bringing.
I've always loved playing in the arena, because I get energy even with the crowd is against me, and now that they'll be on my side it will be even better.
I'm sure it's going to be a fun, committed group, and I wanted to be a part of it".
Expand on your conversation with Coach Djokovic.
"Professionally he believes in a lot of movement without the ball, he plans to bring good morals with high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energies in defense and offense and with the audience in the arena it can work".
I've been looking at your career and I've seen that every team stays at least two years, if not more.
Do you feel that even in Jerusalem you can stay a few years?
"Wherever I go, I like to connect and give it my all, and people appreciate that.
Since I signed in Jerusalem, my phone hasn't stopped ringing and buzzing.
I've got a lot of messages waiting for me.
So I believe we have a good time".
Do you think Jerusalem could be a more significant player than the MEK?
How would you summarize your two years in the AA?
"Unfortunately, there were things I couldn't control last season.
Everybody saw that I stayed professional all along, and no matter how much I got, I always gave it my all.
I'm proud of the way I did last year, and now everyone's going their separate ways".
If it were up to you, would you want to stay in Maccabi?
"After last year, it was clear to both sides that we were headed for a breakup, but that's part of the deal.
Towards the end of the season, I got a little injured in the minutes and my status went down, even though I had a great season in the middle of the year, but they decided to go in other directions.
After I figured out the situation there, I realized it's less the place for me.
Working in Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it".
Finally, what are your goals for next season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the semi-finals last season when I yelled at the Beeton people, 'That's why I'm here,' so that's why I came to Jerusalem to get degrees".
Wade Baldwin may be joining the T.A.
The Yellows have been in contact with the Baskonia star this past season and are hoping to add him to complete the backline for the 2022/23 season.
Are the TA's on their way to buy a glitter?
Guard Wade Baldwin could join the Yellow Jackets and complete the backline of the Cheerleaders for the 2022-23 season.
Baldwin (26, 1.93 m) played last season at Baskonia and averaged an impressive 14.1 points, 4.4 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game.
Previously, he played for Bayern Munich and Olympiacos, and also spent time in the NBA.
If he signs, Baldwin will join Alex Powers, Guy Penny, Darren Hilliard, Austin Hollins and Bonnie Coulson who signed earlier this summer.
Raphy Manko and Josh Nivo have also closed and are expected to officially sign soon.
Adam Ariel is moving to Tel Aviv?
The Reds are interested in signing the 27-year-old forward if he is released from the Jerusalem-based outfit.
A man's razor may be borrowed to the city of Zion
In Jerusalem, they decided not to pursue the option of Retin Obashoun.
The Tel Aviv worker is considering the possibility of adding Adam Ariel if he is released from the Jerusalem worker.
As you may recall, we reported a few days ago that the 27-year-old forward's future at the Jerusalem club is in doubt and that the club may exercise the option to terminate his contract, with a final decision to be made in the next few days.
Now it turns out that if he doesn't stay in D.C., Agent TA will try to sign off on her lines.
And in Jerusalem, the club's board decided not to exercise the option on Rutin Obasohn's contract for another season and announced his release from the team.
In the meantime, a tight end might be loaned to the Miracle Zion after asking to leave the Reds to get more minutes of play.
It was announced in the T.A. that Novatos Mirochi was sold to the Belgian company Zolta.
The 19-year-old Tanzanian international, who joined the youth department in the 2020/21 season, will play next season for Zolte and will also play in the Belgian league.
The Tel Aviv Mavs announced tonight (Tuesday) that they have reached a conclusion with Zolta and Arema from the Belgian league on the sale of Novatos Miroshi.
The 19-year-old Tanzanian international joined the youth department of Maccabi Tel Aviv in the 2020/21 season and played 14 games in the youth team uniform.
In the 2021/22 season, Miroshi was loaned to Tel Aviv Bet-Media. He scored a goal in 26 appearances.
Miroshi is a member of the senior Tanzania national team. He has scored 2 goals in 8 international appearances.
The shiny acquisition:
The Yellows are nearing completion: Last season's Baskonia star is expected to officially sign soon and join the backline of the Cheerleaders.
Tel Aviv's Maccabi on the way to a glittering acquisition: Guard Wade Baldwin has summed up his terms and is expected to soon officially sign and complete the backline of Anadolu Ketsch for the 2022/2023 season.
Baldwin (26, 1.93 m) played last season at Baskonia and averaged an impressive 14.1 points, 4.4 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game.
Previously, he played for Bayern Munich and Olympiacos, and also spent time in the NBA.
Baldwin is expected to join Alex Powers, Guy Penny, Darren Hilliard, Austin Hollins, Bonzy Coulson, Raphy Manko and Lorenzo Brown who signed earlier this summer.
Senator Josh Niebu has also closed his terms and is expected to officially sign soon.
All or nothing: 1:1 between the actual Jerusalem and the actual room
Guy Hadid scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but was able to correct with a draw 10 minutes later.
Next, the link is removed in questionable red (74) •
His room also remained ten players behind red for the duty of Iddo Levi (87)
The professional staff of the Jerusalem Worker book tonight (MTC) well well the number of foreigners on the lawn of Teddy, much more than once, it should be noted, and at some point they even discovered one player less (Gia Khadija was eliminated).
This time, to their delight, everything was in order, and their 1:1 score against the room worker will not be taken away from them by the union court.
Before the Red took pity, he managed to capture a goal of his own and tie to settle a costly point for Leo X.
Already in the 33rd minute, the private performance of dear Guy began.
Plekouchenko raises the net, and the net goes up and backwards and the ball gets stuck in his team's net.
0-1 to a room that enjoyed its own sense of connection.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadida managed to fix it and Bek Bekbekbekovic caught air and the link this time went to the right and exposed net.
One to one, Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadid also managed to score a second yellow and red, this time after slipping in Marmentini's direction.
Daniel Bar-Nathan decided on a questionable red and sent the link straight to an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar-Nathan sent Eddo Levi in the red and evened the balance on the grass.
Elet defeated Holon.
60:85
Ariel Bethlehem's team scored their third consecutive victory, this time particularly impressive.
Hoover and Schumann were outstanding.
The recovery journey of the worker Illit continues this evening with an impressive 60:85 victory over the worker Holon on the way to a 0:3 season balance in the meetings between the two.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel Bethlehem's team has already won three in a row, which is actually a surprise only for those who have not seen the game.
We haven't seen a place this bad in a long time.
All of this before the opening game against Shakhtar at the Champions League play-offs: just 60 points, first half no 3-pointers and 11 percent three-pointers in the game.
Bottom line, an unimpressive night for all the players on the team (except Murphy Manco, who hit three home runs), including safety Chris Johnson.
On the other hand, Elat is in much better shape thanks to the Hoover and Joaquin Schockman.
The first one came back in the last period and the second one came back to bloom and also impressed with a three-quarter field goal.
Give them a chance: the Israelis of the MTA saved the Sporopolis
After losing the Derby and the eighth straight in Europe, a draw at the Classico against Jerusalem - would seem to have ended the long romance between Maccabi and the Greek coach.
So who does Janis have to send flowers to tonight?
To his Israeli team, who was in charge of 42 critical points in the Arena.
And also: Why the Yellow Club needs to change its Americanization strategy, and take a live example from the model of Ariel Bethlehem in Eilat.
It's hard to remain cynical about the tearful eyes and the warm, strong hugs that Yanis Sporopoulos gave his players at the end of tonight's game in the Arena, and especially in the face of the close bonding and secret exchange with John Debretulmao, through whom he saved the Greek coach's job, and maybe the entire season.
Because after losing at home in Derby and eight straight in Europe, to lose at the Classico in Jerusalem and walk away from it for three table victories?
That would have ended the Israeli-Greek romance by tonight.
So in the meantime, he's with us, and he's got a lot to learn from this game, even in the realm of urology.
First, the T.A. team came in with a radical change in their offensive and passing habits.
The ball moved with determination, with a lot of movement and practice, and Scotty Wilbuckin, in a demonstrative way, left the focusing job to Evans, as he drilled very little, and mostly passed blocks and went for shots.
Although he scored very poorly (2-9 from the field), Wilbkin contributed defensively, and most importantly, the Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in their brains, the team went back to their old habits, and the attacks went back to drops and shelling, and in the most critical attack, with 2 and 40 seconds to go, Scotty drilled himself into a half corner and threw a one-legged floater that almost lost the game.
The wisdom is to keep playing drills and dedication moves especially in the clash moments, and that has to go into nature and the group DNA.
The important lesson is gonna be made by Yanis and the club about using Israelis.
The ones who became water pumps and towel wavers at the European Games.
Tonight they scored for the coach who stopped believing in them over half the team's points (42 of 83), and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four of the top five shots in the Maccabi were Israeli.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.
In the first half, it was mostly Oz Blazer, who's been screaming for a month that he needs to play more.
Shooting, morale, fighter under the basket, seven rebounds, six feet of defensive steadiness and game-wise.
Isn't that enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen starred, with excellent percentages from all quarters, cool wind from the line, and cover for the injury of the Jazz, and especially John Dee, who in a 70-63 stint for Jerusalem changed the momentum by five points in a row.
With Yvette Zhu, Liannis has a complicated relationship, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and he burdens him too much, to the point of risking loss.
It's happening at the urological, and it's happening tonight.
But the important lesson should be for the club, about its Americanization strategy.
Fact: senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Gardina and Mar Meder went to Europe but not for the Maccabees, Rafi Manko returned to the Holocaust, and now enjoys a speaking role in Jerusalem, or maybe rejected by the Maccabees.
And it's happening because the Maccabees are gradually leaving fewer places for Israelis, because of the club's informed and radical choice to base itself on Americans.
Makbi will soon arrive at the waterfront, where no Israelis will want to play in it, and then she will look for Jewish children to get citizenship, and press the manager/union to increase the number of foreigners even more.
But it's a fatal mistake by the club.
And the game we've seen should remind the Maccabees that she's overreacting to strangers, much because of the tax cut.
Of course, we're not arguing that Israelis alone are enough, but they're good enough to support four great foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight midrange ones, you can get five great ones.
For example, the season, with the money of Williams, Nunnally, Owens, Reynolds and Taylor, could have brought two effective and stable stars (centre star and top forward) alongside Scotty and Jazzy.
It would be more efficient, it would be more accurate, it would be more Israeli, it would be more beautiful and interesting and it would be more identifying.
It's true there are two crowded frames and a long season - so you have to trust your Israelis.
And also because you're an Israeli group, pretending to represent Israel, and even getting a tax break from the state for its so-called representation in Europe.
The basketball association/league executive can help the Maccabi, and come to their senses with some foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
Six Brewster, four on the form, maximum three on the field at a time.
Is it because of the continuing failures (seven years in Europe already), just because of the Maccabi, the league is flooded with foreigners?
And the Players Association, what about you?
Is that why you're here?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there's one?
Like George Costanza in the pilot of Seinfeld.
Bargain for less?
The old Russian law was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reinforcement in the above direction, the operator came in early and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and 4 more Israelis who were only two in the youth teams (Huber, Ben Moshe, Rowena and the fighter Shoukman), she dismantled the club (second in the table!) Second time in the last two weeks.
It's a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run in Dan Shamir's day and a lot in Sharon Drucker's.
The short team is simply a more balanced and efficient team, unlike Ariel Bethlehem, which started out on the open fields of Samuel Hill, demonstrating and reminding us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everybody's at their best, everybody's playing together, and all the Israelis are learning and improving their game.
Strangers are only complementary.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather come back from their knee injury, it's gonna be a hell of a team.
A song I dreamed about a mule.
And Macbeth can learn from him in the right direction.
Yellow Celebrations: "It felt like the whole world was against us"
The yellow ones are happy after 78:83 about the Jerusalem Arena worker: "We came back to play like the Maccabi TA should play".
The first positive diagnosis of Zizzi's injury and management's approval of the acquisition.
A great sense of relief is being felt this morning among the people of Makkah after yesterday's important and prestigious 78:83 at the Jerusalem Workers' Arena.
The players and the management hugged coach Yannis Sporopoulos who seemed very excited at the end.
Zoe and Buzz Blazer poured water with enthusiasm on Derrick Williams, the star of the game, and the rest of the club smiled a big smile of joy that showed how much pressure had been released after the last losing streak.
They, too, feared defeat at the hands of a great adversary who would further undermine the system.
The fans also stayed for long minutes to celebrate in the stands.
"There's an incredible connection between Janis and me in the dressing room", Oz told Laser.
"We know it wasn't easy for him either, a lot of pressure was released.
We've been looking forward to it, even the way we played.
We're back to playing the way the T.A. should play, with heart and fight, we're behind him.
He made us motivational calls and talked to us".
Before the game, team manager Adam Beaton walks into the locker room and brings exciting stuff to the players.
"His stuff had a big impact on how we came out and how we played on the court", Maccabi players said.
Despite all the excitement, the Maccabi are headed to the big game against Baskonia on Thursday and want to break a long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us", added Laser.
"We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the last few games we were under a lot of pressure, Yanis told us if we were released we would win these games.
I believe this victory will take us forward.
A lot of eyes on us and it was the feeling of the whole world against us, I'm proud to go into this war, we're disconnecting everything around us and looking only at ourselves".
Aneta Žižić, who injured his right knee during the last quarter, was examined by the medical team in the locker room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
The doctors will see how the knee responds today and then figure out how many rest days he'll need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Basconia.
In addition to the strong backing given by the Spartak administration and the professional staff, in a meeting held on Thursday, professional manager Nikola Wicic was given the green light to bring in one or two players to strengthen the team, and the Yellows are hoping to soon add a quality acquisition.
Anthony Bennett released from the Jerusalem labor camp
The No. 1 pick in the NBA Draft has been unable to adapt to the Capitals.
"Anthony reaches into all our hearts, thanking him for his time in action".
About four months after signing the Jerusalem act, Anthony Bennett was released from the team's staff today.
Forward (28, 2.03) who was selected first overall in the 2013 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He averaged 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games in the Champions League, as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight games in Major League Baseball.
"Jerusalem and player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a mutual decision to terminate the player's contract at the club", a club statement said. "Anthony touches the hearts of all of us and we would like to thank him for his time at the club.
I wish him nothing but good luck".
Study finds that Zoom meetings hurt creativity
Some 2,100 engineers and academics from around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem. Some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings.
The result: Virtual meetings undermine creativity and thinking outside the box.
Lead researcher at Columbia University: "Visual focus on a screen interferes with the process of creating ideas"
There's no harm in productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of video conferences on creativity of participants, compared to face-to-face meetings.
Unfortunately, we find that creativity does suffer in virtual meetings through screens.
The question of the study -- led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University -- was whether computer-based remote meetings preserve the creativity that occurs in office brainstorming meetings, or whether the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of distance.
The study itself began as early as 2016 but received a major boost in the two years of the coronavirus, when many workers moved to work from home.
"People in a face-to-face meeting move around the room, use objects, and help them think creatively", says Brooks.
"In a computer session, however, focusing on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative brain activity.
Visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on video when interacting, which hurts the broader idea-making process".
The space is shrinking.
To test the results of the experiment and see if they would repeat themselves, they were tested twice -- once at Columbia University and once in real life -- on engineers who knew each other from early acquaintances.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 faculty and students into two parts: one asked the subjects to meet in person and develop solutions to a problem, and the other asked them to do so via a computer.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide up in a similar way and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, there was a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually via video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher on ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
He believes that in mindfulness activities, people often look around to help generate ideas, whereas in video conferencing, thinking concentrates on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows for creativity.
"When people are in the same room, they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can evoke new associations.
But the research shows that computer interactions change our attention so that we're more inward-focused and screen-focused, and that this way reduces innovation and idea-making through looking at the environment and thinking outside".
There's no harm in critical thinking.
However, before managers rush employees back to the offices, the researchers note that "working through a computer did not harm productivity itself or people's critical thinking about innovative proposals, when they had to pick the best idea from a set of ideas.
I mean, the impact is only on creativity and not other forms of computer work".
Professor Ellen Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also disputes the findings.
She says, "There is a difference between mere creativity, like new uses for PRIZBY, and work solutions.
It's also possible that when employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or when they work from home, creativity actually improves".
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson have also proposed a future study in which meetings like this would stop thinking states and wander around a room to see how this activity would affect the end result.
Dr. Olson also suggested that the study would only result in brainstorming sessions for employees to return to work and generally suggested that one study should not be frightening, but that more research should be done in the field.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forcibly laid off and not be happy. That's a bigger injury", he says.
Musk waits for Trump's return: "It was wrong to block him"
Twitter's new buyer said he would reverse the decision, which led to the blocking of the former US president's account.
"I think it was a mistake", he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently acquired Twitter in a $44 billion deal, said Tuesday he intends to bring Trump back to the social network, which blocked him while he was president, following riots by his supporters on Capitol Hill after losing the election to Democratic nominee Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to arrest Donald Trump.
I think it was a mistake", he said.
"If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and a suspension - a temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban", Musk explained.
By 2050, the world will have lost 80% of the water available for agriculture.
A new global study predicts a significant decline in the next 25 years
The Solution: Proper Water Management
A disturbing new study recently published in the journal Earth's Future predicts that by 2050, the amount of water available for agriculture will shrink by 80 percent if the rate of water use and population growth in the world continues at current usage trends.
In the study, which involved scientists from all the world's science agencies, scientists summarized the total amount of rainwater, rivers and freshwater resources in the world and compared it to humanity's need for agriculture.
The grim findings of the study show that the rate of water consumption is now doubling over and over again in the last 10 years, while global warming is causing less rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the study's data, 84 percent of the world's agricultural land will experience severe rainwater shortages.
One of the key findings from the study is that farmers around the world should adapt their farming to climate change and seasonal changes, and switch to farming methods that focus on water infiltration into the soil to prevent the process of water depletion that leads to widespread waste of rainwater.
The researchers also recommend that farmers working near saltwater sources use rainwater harvesting technologies to prevent it from flowing into the sea.
Information about many students from Bar-Ilan University leaked online
Hackers who attacked the Bar-Ilan University database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the students' information unless they received a ransom.
The threat was carried out and the information was published all over the Internet.
Students at Bar-Ilan University are under attack by hackers when their personal information is published online by a cyber-attacker called Darkrypt who posted a ransom demand from the university a few weeks ago and threatened to release the information under his control if he is not paid an unspecified amount of money.
Estimates of the amount of money the attacker demanded are that it started in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked, it went up and before the information was released it was already in the millions of dollars.
Facebook groups of university students and faculty are full of angry messages and chaos is celebrated there, as students are unable to log into their personal information systems and are unable to perform routine student tasks.
The university sent out an e-mail announcing the attack on the academic institution and that they were working intensively to mitigate the damage, while detailing some of the information leaked online.
No specific instructions were given to those whose information was leaked and it said the university had taken a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's ministers.
In line for 40 settlements, optical fiber arrives in Benjamin
The trend of peripheral high-speed Internet access continues and now optical fiber is reaching the Council of 40 communities in Binyamin •
The council's joint venture with Telran, X-Fiber and Internet Grenade will launch immediately after the holidays.
The Benjamin Council signed a wide-ranging agreement over the weekend to install fiber optics in all of the council's communities.
The agreement with the NetFiber project in partnership with Internet Rimon, Telleran and X-Fiber was signed after a major bidding process was completed at the council in recent months.
Work will begin after the holidays and residents from 40 council towns who are interested in connecting to the fiber-optic infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 giga as well as an advanced home edge that will allow for strong WIFI reception, as required during these times.
Participants will be able to choose between high-speed fiber-optic Internet or high-speed fiber-optic filtered Internet provided by the Grenade Internet.
The council made sure the market remained open to competition under any circumstances.
The head of the regional council in Benjamin, Israel Gantz: "This is real Zionism.
That's big news for the residents.
The experience of living in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to learn remotely if necessary, it will be possible to work from home and set up progressive businesses in communities that will have quality Internet without delays.
I want to wish the cherished companies success in their assignments in the settlements.
The people are waiting for you".
Gantz added: "We will soon have decent conditions of the best high-speed Internet in Israel.
We've been working for many months to lay the foundation for the fiber installation and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank the Minister of Communication Yowaz Handel who started the project with us in his previous term and now we are reaping the fruits of our labor, the Minister of Communication's team, the council members who were loyal to the details of the center and the CEOs of the companies that have won the center a professional quality among the best in Israel. "
Rimmon Internet CEO, Iriv Far: "I thank Council President Israel Gantz and his team for immediately lifting the gauntlet to bring the news to the thousands of Council residents who will switch to using high-speed Internet that will improve the quality of life in the fields of education, economy and of course leisure".
Telran Communications Group CEO, Sheh Aslan: "We welcome the decision of the Binyamin Council to connect to high-speed and powerful internet infrastructure and I am confident that with the group's vast experience we can provide residents with high-speed internet just like in the center of the country".
X-Fiber CEO, Israel Elishor: "The establishment of communication infrastructure in Benjamin is the goal of 2021, X-Fiber is proud to take part in the establishment of the new infrastructure in the biblical areas of Benjamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with the areas of YUSH in general and Benjamin in particular, we will meet any engineering challenge to bring high-speed Internet to every home across the council".
We looked: What do the side effects of the coronavirus vaccine mean?
Many people who inject feel weak, feverish, and tired after receiving an injection, while others do not feel a thing.
Could this indicate a stronger immune system in those who do experience these symptoms, or is this just a disproven rumor?
While more and more people are vaccinated, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are false.
Is the immune system of those who developed side effects stronger than those whose bodies responded less severely to the vaccine, which may prove that their system is unable to fight off a foreign body entering the body?
"There are several levels of responses to the vaccine", says Dr. David Devere, chief of primary care at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a member of the CDC's Advisory Committee on Epidemiology, and reassuringly: "Headaches, fatigue, sore spots, these are the immediate responses of the immune system.
That's how the body responds to foreign bodies entering the system".
Is there a link between the levels of antibodies that develop and the side effects?
"There's no correlation between sensitivity and the development of antibodies to the virus.
About 60 to 50 percent experience side effects, but about 90 percent develop immunity to the virus.
We didn't find that people who developed stronger responses were more protected".
"There is no correlation in the medical literature between immediate response and vaccine levels.
In some of the trials where people also received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It's also a psychological component -- how a person reacts to the vaccine, if they expect side effects.
Many of the events that occurred could also have occurred normally, but because the public is immune, they attribute the response to the vaccine itself, and this is a misconception that we see about vaccines in general -- the attribution of events that occur near and attributable to the vaccine".
According to Dr. Deaver, the causes of the reported well-being symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
On the subject of myocarditis, opinions are divided.
"There are all sorts of theories about it, but it's worth noting that the virus itself causes higher rates of mycorrhiza than the vaccine.
One theory is that it's a strong immune response".
Is there even a way to gauge the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, it was shown that those who did not sleep or were under higher stress were more susceptible to infection.
Besides, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there's a drop in the immune system, you can see it immediately.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone's walking around with a weak immune system and not knowing it.
These are people who come to the clinic because of recurrent episodes of infectious disease, and what affects the system are mundane things: stress, diet, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want a too strong immune system, because it can cause autoimmune diseases".
MRNA vaccines will soon appear in more contexts, thanks to the vast amount of information that has been accumulated about them in recent times.
"It will certainly pave the way for other such vaccines.
This technology is being tested for a lot of applications beyond vaccines -- for treating oncological diseases, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance stays in the body for a very short time -- enters, does its job, and then breaks down.
This technology isn't new, but it's received a major boost in response to the overwhelming need for rapid vaccination.
Now, for example, we know that the three-week gap between doses is too small, and some vaccine experts say that after a third dose, we may not need another vaccine anytime soon, so it's not clear if we're going to get to a six-monthly vaccine or if a third dose will give a bigger gap".
Serious privacy breach on Route 6
Customers on Route 6?
Your personal information, including your full name, addresses, payment amounts and full details of the trips you have booked, may be revealed.
According to the Privacy Authority, Via-Earth violated the Privacy Act and its regulations.
Following a report that a company operating Israel's Route 6 road, Via Aretz, had reported a security incident at the company, the Privacy Authority began enforcement proceedings.
As part of the event, security vulnerabilities were discovered on its payment website, which allowed for the exposure of a large amount of information from the member's customers' accounts, which were exposed to the public.
Among other things, customer bills were exposed over a relatively short period of time and these bills included personal information, including first and last name, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates and times.
Furthermore, because a transit company did not log access to its systems as required by law, it is not possible to know exactly how long unauthorized parties could access the company's systems.
In the breach letter, which the Privacy Authority sent to the company, the Authority emphasized that most companies and large organizations in the economy are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and that as threats and risks evolve, the organization has an obligation to carefully consider the updated risks and act according to the updated security measures accepted in the circumstances, depending on the nature and quality of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations have an obligation to update their systems and conduct risk reviews and penetration tests to assess and prepare for changing risks.
Companies and organizations are also required to use an automated recording mechanism and must provide training to employees, in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy (information security) regulations.
Based on the findings of the review, the Authority determined that the company had violated the provisions of the Privacy Protection Act and its regulations and required the company to take a number of corrective actions.
"The matter has been handled in accordance with the strictest requirements".
Warning for Istanbul: Surprising news for Israelis from Turkish Airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change the destination or time of their flight.
News for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: Airlines will allow flight times to be changed.
REMEMBER: Earlier this week, the Counterterrorism Headquarters raised the travel alert to Istanbul to level four.
This is the highest level and means "high threat level: no entry to this country and in case of stay, leave the country immediately".
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have announced that they will allow Israelis who booked their flight before the travel warning, i.e. before June 13, 22nd, to change the destination or time of their flight.
It's a way of addressing the airline.
Tourism Minister Rezabozov said: "Israeli citizens should not have to pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
I am glad that major airlines like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have responded to our request and I hope that other airlines will respond similarly to all Israeli citizens who canceled their holidays in Turkey because of the severe travel warning".

Saudi Arabia's name is coming up: Israeli companies are preparing to reinforce lines east
Summary: The airline is planning to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe
Israel's largest airline is planning significant changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we reported in Israel Today, the estimate is that Biden will announce the granting of permission to Al Ala and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the UAE.
What the deal means is that you can ask if you can fly shorter routes to destinations in the Far East and Australia.
To do that, the company would have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations to divert planes to new destinations.
The destinations to which flights will be canceled starting next November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations that have a sizeable Jewish population, but at this point they're less profitable to society.
By contrast, the new targets being examined by Al are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and other places in the Far East.
Here's how it's gonna work: Dreamliners flying to Canada will be released in favor of long-haul flights east.
Boeing 737s flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred to destinations such as London and Paris, to which Al operates flights using Dreamliners.
So basically, the company can unleash larger planes to fly to more destinations in the east.
At the same time, Ba'al expects discussions to take place in the coming weeks regarding the possibility of Israeli airlines being able to return to flying to Turkey, where the company will be able to operate flights using the airline's Boeing 737 aircraft.

Exemption from quarantine for vaccinated and recovering non-red states, foreign tourists are returning.
The country's residents have received notifications from the Ministry of Health that they are exempt from the requirement of isolation if they receive a negative response to the coronavirus test.
It was only afterwards that the ministry issued an official statement saying that only travellers from orange countries were affected, although returnees from red countries also reported receiving the message.
Also: Tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
At the height of the pandemic - an end to the isolation of returnees from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent messages to those returning to Israel this morning, stating that they are exempt from quarantine if they receive a negative response to the coronavirus test they took after landing in Israel.
We're also talking about returnees from red states.
Some of the messages sent out told returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative answer or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after receiving a negative answer.
Only after that came an official announcement from the Ministry of Health stating that starting at midnight, 4.1.2022, vaccinated or cured, returnees from orange countries will be tested on PCR and quarantined for 24 hours or until a negative result is obtained (the earliest of them).
The decision will be anchored in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be submitted for approval to the Knesset Health Committee.
The ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovering people who have already returned to Israel from an orange country and received a negative result from the PCR test they performed upon entering Israel, will complete the isolation at midnight tonight and are not obliged to perform a second test.
Nevertheless, passengers from red states reported that they also received the message.
Anyone who has not been vaccinated or recovered and returns from an orange country will go into home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening isolation with a negative result in a PCR test taken from the 7th day of landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to lift most of the restrictions on flights and especially on the vaccinated comes a day before a meeting at the BGTC that was submitted by the association of travel agencies, the headquarters for open skies and the hotel associations.
At a hearing tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand that all other countries be removed from the red list, with Professor Itamar Grotto backing them up in his opinion.
Foreigners can come in too.
The Prime Minister and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism and Transport agreed that starting on Sunday, January 9, 2022, vaccinated/recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) from orange countries will be allowed to enter - this is subject to filling out an online form in advance, taking a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, taking a PCR test upon entry into Israel and then entering quarantine for 24 hours or receiving my test response (the earliest of these).
Unvaccinated/unvaccinated foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, except those you have approved by the Committee of Exceptions, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The team roster won't be updated at this time.
What about the red states?
The Committee for Country Classification in the Ministry of Health recommends to the government that the Committee recommend removing from the red list of countries and moving to the orange list the countries: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The remaining countries currently on the red list are the United Arab Emirates, the United States, Ethiopia, the United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option the health department is considering is to exempt vaccinated people returning from red states from quarantine.
It's unclear at this time if there's a connection between the messages received this morning by those returning to Israel and the guidelines that may be accepted by the Ministry of Health on this issue.
There's been no response from the health department.
The skies are beginning to open: the Ministry of Health changes the restrictions on the country gates
Vaccinated people returning from orange countries will be required to quarantine for 24 hours.
The United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates will be marked in red.
After long weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to which one could fly without restrictions, and after all returnees from abroad were required to quarantine, along with a ban on tourists entering Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on RTA.
The Ministry of Health has decided to recommend lifting the three-day quarantine requirement for Israelis returning from orange countries.
Until now, anyone vaccinated or cured as defined by the Ministry of Health returning from an orange country - is required to quarantine for three days, subject to two coronavirus tests.
Now, the quarantine required for vaccinated and recovered people returning from orange countries is 24 hours at the most, or until the results of the coronavirus tests taken after landing in the Philippines (first come first served).
Anyone who is not defined as vaccinated or recovering will still be required to enter a seven-day quarantine period subject to two coronavirus tests, or 14 days without the second test, even if they returned from an orange country and if they returned from a red country.
Anyone vaccinated or recovered who returns from a red state must also be in full isolation.
The updated list of countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs to be approved by the government, includes the United States, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, except Turkey, the average positive who entered the country in the last two weeks is more than 5% of total arrivals, which automatically puts them on the red list.
Turkey's rate of increase is rapid, with a positive recovery rate of just over 4 percent, so it was decided to add it to the red list.
The prominent countries to be removed from the red list: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
Meanwhile, starting January 9, tourists who have been vaccinated as required by the Ministry of Health will be able to enter Israel without the need for quarantine, similar to conditions for Israelis returning from an orange country.
In this case, too, the decision is subject to the approval of the government, which will discuss the matter in the coming days.
It is important to note that there are few instances where the government does not endorse the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
Tourists against restrictions.
The travel agents' association, the Open Skies headquarters and the hotel associations have petitioned the BJC to lift the flight restrictions.
The country lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but as mentioned, it left eight significant countries on the red list.
At a hearing in Jerusalem this morning, the petitioners are expected to demand that the country be removed from the red list.
The one who will support the petitioners' position is Professor Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Yuval Rezabozov, who in recent weeks has supported easing all restrictions on foreign tourists entering Israel, said yesterday: "Lifting quarantine for vaccinated returnees from abroad and returning tourism to vaccinated travelers is the right and just thing to do at this time.
I thank my friends in government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the harm outweighs the benefit.
Vaccination is the best answer to the pandemic, and as such - the vaccinated public deserves to lead a healthy lifestyle alongside the coronavirus".
With an investment of 200 million shekels, the new resort will be opened near Lard.
Desert Flourishes: Another luxury hotel due to open in three years
Chef restaurants, private swimming pools and 110 rooms are only a small part of what the hotel has to offer
All the details in the article
7MINDS from Beth Fatal and the White City Real Estate Company have jointly acquired a plot of land covering about 20 acres in the Judean Desert, where they will build a luxury resort with an investment of about 200 million shekels. The hotel will be built on the same site as a hotel that was built by her and demolished about a year ago.
The resort won't open for another three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three communal pools, a spa, chef restaurants, an entertainment complex, a gym and more.
Whoever's going to be in charge of the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ren Smuelli from the Claro Restaurant.
A Somali chef will be the one to create the menu which is expected to have a concept from a resort-specific perspective.
The mayor of Arad, lawyer Nissen Ben Hamo, congratulated the project: "The decision to build a new and luxurious hotel near Arad gives the official stamp to the amazing contribution that Arad has made in the tourism sector in recent years.
I am proud of the choice of the entrepreneurs and I am convinced that it will be a joint success as it will unlock huge tourism potential".

Almost everyone nowadays has an "old" tablet or smartphone lying in a trash can.
Just because a slightly newer and more sophisticated model came out, any device can have a Spotify player instead of a WhatsApp connection.
Older devices can be traffic cameras, a remote control to operate appliances in the home, and many other uses.

That's too bad.
It was more interesting to hear how many people received allowances at the Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the requested city centers) was worth, and how much the workers were paid (minimum).
Israel's post office must not be privatized.
The question is, how many packages have arrived and how many have been distributed?
'Cause how many missing them
You order packages, and they disappear into the ICU...
There should be a five-pack tax. They don't just start a shitload of shillings and load up the mail.
It mostly indicates the high cost of living in the country.
Thanks to the King of Shit who made it better to buy everything from China.
We're a household and we try to stay away from the mail and hope that they don't get any mail and the hatred of the mail has led us to give up everything that has to do with the possibility of mail.
Have a good week.
Fire all postal workers, and start re-establishing the post office by a private company.
Employers are arrogant and some are racist!
People talk differently on the phone, and when you come in for an interview, you see their real faces.
No wonder they can't find workers.
They're looking for slaves.

So sad that Tel Aviv's Maccabi rely on foreigners and the Israelis heat the bench
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners, so they won't make it with all the stars scratching from around the world.

And the note about Zoe-- we saw last season that he's a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he can't be a leader, but the decline in his ability in the league also indicates that he has lost confidence (which is not surprising after the treatment he received after two bad games in the Euroleague, as if no one else had such games) and the use of it may also be wrong, and it is the result of the determination and the laziness of the coach.

Scientists don't care about warming or who rains.
They're just interested in population growth.
They're working on more and more vaccines and asshole methods to wipe out the world's population, so they tell us bogus stories about warming and all the crap they make up.
There's no problem with dropping water in unlimited quantities.
They said that 50 years ago.

I don't believe any research that talks about global warming because that doesn't exist.

For centuries, the world's population has been growing at an exponential rate, and it's only getting better.

The Saudis are doing the same thing and succeeding too (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).

Does proper water management mean a reduction of at least 70% of the world's population?
It's surprising that COVID comes and surprising that most of the population is being injected with experimental material whose effects over the five to 25 years on the injected are completely unknown.
I'm also surprised that the 2030 Agenda is on its way and now this?
I'm really wondering the whole thing! - What?
He's full of shit.
Stories of a thousand nights and nights, all the fears and of course nonsense of the left trying to rule the world through media control, five years ago they announced there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two.
They said that even in the land it did not rain anymore and the drought is constant and here it is raining.
They also said that Rabin didn't murder Jews in Atlanta and that Price didn't know that they were stealing children from Tamim.
Moses Dane, of course, didn't steal antiquities and helped Weizmann not mess with his soldiers.
It's obvious you're promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
This is disgusting bullshit.
They'll also take care of the antenna array, power outages and voltage drops, and we're on the move.
"It's real Zionism", like opening a Remy Levi branch in Rome is Zionism.
Following rogue Bennett, the rest of the politicians will draw a line in the sand.
Even if you give me free flights, I'm not getting anywhere near Al-Alai, or more accurately, "Alai Shoe".
It was very nice to say goodbye and not say goodbye.
You won't even see us in your dreams.
One more big shame, we in Israel are being held captive by a company that owns all the direct flights, which owns pigs.
Some focus on this whole eastbound thing.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows Aleel to fly over their territory, then it won't add to the Israeli economy more than a few tens of millions, not such a big game changer.
It's better to focus on more interesting achievements like energy supply, acquisition of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE, tourism that allows Israeli infrastructure companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
That's a lot more interesting than 30 flights a week saving an hour each.
It's more important that they let the air force deploy in the Persian Gulf to hit Iran and that we arrange for the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Egypt and Morocco to drop weapons on Iran non-stop for a month until all of its military infrastructure is completely destroyed.
And another air force squadron to be stationed in northern Saudi Arabia and hit Iranian forces in Syria and eastern Iraq from a less densely populated area.
After we're done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti and the Comoros to make a peace deal with Israel and get a majority of the Arab League countries to join the peace.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and the replacement of Erdoğan can also help Saudi Arabia overthrow the regime in Qatar and finally eliminate the subversion of this country, and its support for other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these shared interests are over, we can talk about a few more Aleel flights if Aleel even survives by then.
I don't need to close up.
Selling tickets for flights that don't exist.
The worst part is there's no way to get a representative.
"There is no customer service".
Anyone who buys a ticket at the fair and wants to change or cancel it should forget about it, the loss is certain.
See, you've been warned.
Air Canada is better.
They'd rather fly abroad anyway.
Arrakis has gone from company shit to company hell.
Even God is on the down low.
You better call a cab.
The driver will load the bags for free.
And you're suing the train to the field.
40 euros a bag of Brinaire is much cheaper than Wizz.
You can lift an eight-pound backpack.
Why are you lying?
Wizz Air on cargo and seating take a much more significant!! - What?
One big whisper
Just for example. I just got back.
Weight allowable is 100 pounds.
And a seven-pound troll.
And every extra pound is $30.
Go check in with him.
All companies steal the customer.
Advertisements are very cheap, but it's a bag the size of a school bag.
Trolley's already costing money and a suitcase is very, very expensive.
It's a good thing the airlines don't ask us to come on a flight with underwear and body so there's no weight on the plane.
The price is not cheaper, but 50% off booking up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not at all surprised.
The Israelis were and remain combinators, in a successful way.
A land that eats its inhabitants and eats.
You have to add genetic miserliness to that.
It's also a disgrace for our country to let foreign airlines lure Israelis...
There's no government and everyone here does what they want.
So what did you learn today that wasn't enough to pay for an expensive card?
Prepare a surprise for all of us.
Pay extra for the wheels, the windows, the luggage that doesn't arrive, the food, the drinks, and they'll probably add on the toilet.
In short, you stay home and prices go down.
Or big. Get out in the boats.
The journey will take a few days.
Throw up and then you'll probably come too.
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and hurt in Israel, and still gain exposure and support from his new fans.
Open it now?
It's not a coincidence.
Just when it starts to get messy, there's a waiver. Just fuck what's going on here.
It's not the peak of the epidemic.
Simon, it's not for you.
The number of confirmed cases is going up. It doesn't mean the number of patients is going up.
Stop screening for all this nonsense. Stay home if you're not feeling well.
That's it.
A government of madmen.
The government and Bennet are mostly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
Mostly stupid.
And confused the public.
Only more damage than good.
It suggests that you open a new corner: "Daily deaths and accumulated at the beginning of the fifth wave.
The face and the pictures behind the screen".
Your ratings are going down.
You don't understand why the Treasury Secretary doesn't pay tourist workers for pizza.
From them, another patch.
They don't care about the people.
8,500 dead so far
Something about it?
They bury us, especially the elderly.
We became Russia/North Korea.
If you don't talk about it, it doesn't exist! - What?
The main thing is that the citizens put money into the state coffers to grow the ministers' horns and asses!
Turns out Duberman and Abbas are the prime minister! - What?
Very well, the omicron stay was relevant for the first week, now -- there's no reason to isolate half a nation, and there's no point in trying to stop the omicron -- which is more present here than Israel.
When someone comes from an orange country, they're statistically less dangerous than someone who's already here.
It's the first time I've seen any sensible steps by the Israeli government in the fight against Corona.
As if someone actually sat down and counted the numbers, and not like Bibi - did what he thought would look better in the paper (and failed in all the sections).
The dream government at its best:
The Treasury Secretary who told road teachers to find a new profession two weeks ago, floated the opening of the skies to tourists.
The Education Ministry from now on is beating up on the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and setting its own policy, which puts all the schools in total chaos!
Foreign minister, clown who comes sick with Corona to a cabinet meeting.
And the most clownish prime minister we've ever had in this country, out of control and losing his mind like the last of the hooligans.
Just a government with no leadership, no direction, in which the entire nation of Israel has lost faith.
Go home and be nice an hour early! - What?
I mean, maybe it's coming from a bad place. Maybe it's a place of loss of control.
Now the prices of apartments there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Well, where are all the weathermen?
They're building a bus station and they believe it's gonna affect all the houses.
Besides my custody fees.
The hotel will return to its former white elephant.
It looks amazing.
Good luck with that.
I feel like it.
What about the art of taking pictures completely naked?
Giving Up the Garbage
A serious fight for a fair field.
Why don't they give benefits to women in the Galilee occupied by the Muslim Brotherhood of the Harbinet?
All of you, go to the gallows.
In the present reality, is the South still ours? - What?
Do you need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
I'm sure the Knesset will be there too! - What?
How about a people's hotel for people?
Congratulations on investing in the South.
Arad is thriving and prospering and all due respect to the mayor who, since the beginning of his term, has made a splash for the good and glory of Arad.
Cultural life, society, education and more on the heights
Just a great mayor who made the city better!
Good for you.
I wonder how much Bedouin sponsorship the resort owner will pay.
Have you got any money for sponsorship?
Wow, that sounds good.
Who can only afford a super company with the best service and security in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai? - What?
Don't worry about the tin company.
Neither socially nor economically.
In the last few weeks, she canceled flights back from abroad, you know, texted Israelis saying the flight was canceled, ruined the whole trip on the spot, told passengers to leave a message on the W.App or the messenger and we'd be back, came back after a day or even three.
The trip's ruined.
Besides, it's better to land planes on the ground, rather than fly back into the country, and also avoid economic damage?
Are there any more suckers flying in?
You didn't fly with them for nothing either.
Have they returned the millions of customers they took captive?
Easyjet to Geneva and back for 70 euros.
A one-way ticket is $560.
From a crooked religion who runs a company with his fucking son I don't buy for 10 bucks, cheating nonstop...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their implementation would be in addition to the price change.
Whoever buys tickets at the airport puts their money on the wing.
It's a tin company.
It's a low-cost company exercise.
No luggage, no seat selection, probably no taxes and no food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all the members of the guillotine... on me!
Nature makes fools thin! - What?
