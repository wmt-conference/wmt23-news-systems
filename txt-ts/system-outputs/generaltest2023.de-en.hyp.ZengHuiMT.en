Geesthacht: New bed signs are intended to encourage replanting.
Franko Stein( FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe( Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds of the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blooms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht is blooming" is an action of Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, businesses and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been brought into the earth since 2015, with the participation of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, businesses and institutions. Goal: In the Geesthachter city area, flowering islands are to be created over a wide area, on which insects can find food at any time. "When the weather is favourable, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food, " says Friedhelm Ringe of Nabu in Geesthacht, saying. He himself has beehives on the property.
To ensure that the undertaking does not remain only an action by nature conservationists and the city's environmental service, but also draws wide circles into private gardens, explanatory boards are repeatedly placed on the plants. So far, there are about 50 signs. Passers-by should be able to find out in this way what is blooming so beautifully here right now. The hope is that amateur gardeners will replant at home in a targeted manner.
In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started already at the start of the season.
More recent dates are shrubs such as winter scented hedge cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the bucket on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, showing the first delicate flowers in white and pink without leaves and have recently been given further signs. "The winter scented hedge cherry is a very broad bushy shrub and can become between two meters high and three meters wide, " can be read there under further information, for example, about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that, however, it is not only the bedding plants that now show flowers that do not only show flowers. In the first week of January, the wild hazel season started already at the start of the season. It blooms particularly lushly on the Richtweg at the incline, in Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young"
Munich dance god Fred Astaire would certainly be proud of them if he looked down from the sky at Munich's Ostbahnhof.

Wikipedia: The tap dance took place in the 19th century. Developed in the U.S. in the century and is now known everywhere in the world. With two metal plates each, more durable than the initially used wooden soles, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing that fit the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English expression for this is noisy tap dance and the French Claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dancing. The tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a clearly audible sound when dancing.

Analogue in Dialogue - The Limits of the Digital One.
As digitization progresses, the desire for analogue is growing again for some.
According to DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick, the speed with which our everyday lives became digital hardly gave us time to set up rules for dealing with them and to adapt our methods of communication and work accordingly, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden broke out with Dresden. If you wanted to make a phone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either one belonged to the six percent of the lucky ones who had a private connection. Or one belonged to those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could call the relatives there for a bottle of Radeberger. Or they were looking for a phone booth or looking for a phone booth. Unforgettable the smell of the plastic piece and the click of the small coins in the machine. My biggest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when I called  video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be like.
As in Moldova, so on. 14 days for a new government

The 48-year-old business expert now has 14 days to do so. So far, Recean has been one of the president’ s advisors.

The president thanked Gavrilita for her "enormous sacrifices".
Moldova is a neighbor of Ukraine and is suffering from the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS ( Party of Action and Solidarity), founded by President Sandu, has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 out of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian politicians - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular, with support from the Kremlin - becoming more popular.

The biathlon icon, which is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Cup gold medals.

Meanwhile, nothing ran together with Doll again. After the veteran had missed all chances of a medal at the start with a penalty round in the mixed relay and there had been only sixth place, things didn't go any better three days later, three days later.

Biden receives Lula: "We must stand up for democracy"
A meeting between US President Joe Biden and his Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, will focus on the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
US President Joe Biden insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit by his Brazilian colleague Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test, " Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington, D.C., saying. “ We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength.” Lula replied with a view to his right-wing predecessor Jair Bolsonaro: “ Brazil has isolated itself for four years”,
Left-wing politician Lula had prevailed against Bolsonaro in a runoff election at the end of October. On the 1st In January, Lula took office. The change of power was accompanied by heavy riots. Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the U.S. Capitol just over two years ago, in which supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently invaded parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. His predecessor did not give much attention to international relations. ‘ His world began and ended with fake news, morning, afternoon and evening,’ said Lula, Lula. "I think I know, " Biden replied  an obvious reference to his predecessor in office, Trump.
Short note about the press- the Friday.
Someone still remembers the RAF wanted posters. It showed the members of the Red Army Faction released for denunciation and shooting down.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed before Corona, public sentiment was created against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. ( Nothing here about the really dangerous stuff in pinstripe suits and ties )
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually more after Raudis in the S-Bahn or onanists in the park, is giving a new edition with the" war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is poorly informed, because in this world there are perhaps more "Russian friends" to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong than the StZ has room for pictures.
But that's not the point, but: In 1st to 5th place ( ) Ms. Wagenknecht stands, then Mrs. Schwarzer follows.
Well, I don't know anyone around me anymore who reads this paper. If so, it would be high time now. We have reached the known level where nothing is below that.
And now at the latest, well dialectically, Ms. Wagenknecht should not yet be completely stupid the most popular politician of all, d. hm there we go Be a peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. ( And now no more differentiation is needed.) )

Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing considers further interest rate hikes in the fight against the high inflation rate "absolutely" necessary for "absolutely" further interest rate hikes in the fight against the high inflation rate. " Inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can easily rise again and China's opening up can also temporarily boost prices, Sewing told Welt am Sonntag, Sewing told Welt am Sonntag.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank( ECB) raised interest rates in the euro area for the fifth time in a row and added a further increase of 0.5 percentage points for the meeting on the 16th. Looked forward to March. The key interest rate in the euro area is now 3.0 percent. The deposit rate that commercial banks receive when they park money at the ECB is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can slow down demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. Higher lending rates can also lead to postponement of investments and thus weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. “ The consequences of sustained high inflation are far more serious than higher financing costs for some countries,” Sewing said. “ Of course we have to keep an eye on that, but a high level of debt must not stop the ECB from acting consistently.”
The ECB aims for price stability in the euro area in the medium term with an inflation rate of two percent. That target has been a long way off for months now. Although inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area of the now 20 countries were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month last year.
Higher inflation rates reduce the purchasing power of consumers, because they can then afford less for one euro less. Sharp increases in energy prices, which are a key driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption "will collapse sooner or later, " warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks ( BdB) . "I currently see this as the greatest threat to the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario” .
Bosch boss Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "Germany pace" in infrastructure projects proclaimed by Chancellor Olaf Scholz( SPD) . "There will need to be a political and social dialogue on this, " he said. And he may also be a bit more controversial, " he told the German Press Agency in Stuttgart. He hopes a set of rules will eventually emerge in the end, which will not necessarily need to be as fast as the LNG terminals that went into operation around the turn of the year, but also not as slow as before either.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas ( LNG) was opened. The aim was to close a gap in gas supplies due to a lack of Russian gas supplies. Federal Chancellor Olaf Scholz( SPD) had spoken on the occasion of a new "Germany pace" on the occasion. In addition, the federal government had recently initiated an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it's very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. However, that should not automatically mean that from now on we will always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will, " said Hartung, saying. Therefore, there must still be a process of negotiation as to what is right and wrong as a society.
In the past, they tried and failed with the classic set of rules. ‘ We should think again, whether the previous approach was so correct.’ Maybe we overdid it with the set of rules and made it too complicated for ourselves."
In view of the many open tasks, such as the expansion of the power lines, he does not envy the federal government and the companies involved, said Hartung, but said Hartung. “ As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as it gets.”
The union warns of breaking up the Bayer group.
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a breakup of the group after an announced change of management at Bayer. "From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three pillars, is perfectly positioned to meet the challenges of the future, " said Francesco Grioli, union board member and Bayer supervisory board, of the "Rheinische Post" ( Saturday edition), the "Rheinische Post" ( Saturday edition) .
This refers to the pharmaceutical business with prescription drugs, the consumer health business with over-the-counter drugs and the agricultural business. “ The transformation of the industry can only be managed with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability  not hedge fund activism.”
The background to this is the change of management at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. Controversial boss Werner Baumann will vacate the post this summer. The ex-pharmaceutical boss of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been the subject of criticism. The 2018 takeover of the US seed producer Monsanto for 63 billion dollars depends on the manager after the manager says. With the purchase, the Leverkusen-based company had brought expensive legal disputes into the house about alleged cancer risks from the weed killer glyphosate. Bayer shares have been plummeting for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to discharge the CEO at the Annual General Meeting.
It had been known for some time that Baumann would not seek an extension of his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024 and, in fact, would not run until 2024. Pressure had been exerted by long-term strategic investors. Most recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also participated. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for the group to be split up.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for its aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the value of the company, " said Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, the Rheinische Post. On the other hand, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger agricultural division Crop Science to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate against pension reform.
Paris.
On Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The trade unions are opposing a government project with the concentrated protest on the streets. Hundreds of thousands want to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are expected across the country on Saturday to demonstrate against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, trade unions are mobilizing against the centre-right government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 years. Twice already, more than a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750 were honed. 1, 000 participants in protests counted. A turbulent debate has been going on in parliament for a week about the controversial reform.
Already, many people in France work longer than until the age of 62, if they have not yet paid in long enough for a deduction-free pension when they reach the age limit. In many strenuous professions, people could hardly work any longer, say the opponents of reform. In addition, employees wanted to be able to enjoy their well-deserved pension and not completely wear out their health on the job.
Macron: Threatening deficit in pension fund.
Macron justifies the reform with an imminent deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older, employees would have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order for the height of the pension to be kept stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics question the government's calculations, demanding that the state find other sources of funding to keep the pension system in balance - the pension system.
But it's not just the retirement age that the government wants to work on. The increase in the necessary payment period for a full pension, which was already decided years ago, is to be accelerated. Furthermore, individual pension schemes with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is expected to rise to around 1200 euros.
The pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was stopped; even then, there were massive protests and strikes. Already several presidents before Macron tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protest and strikes were certainly all of them.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push through the reform with the help of the conservative republicans, who have announced support. However, some of the MEPs - even from Macron's group - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote, Macron's fear of crippling strikes is likely to be at the moment. Before the renewed demonstrations on Saturday, the president said he could count on the sense of responsibility of the organizers to keep them calm and not to lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather is expected - lots of sunshine at high altitudes.
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. So, that means a lot of sunshine is to be expected everywhere.
Offenbach Offenbach.
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye, " explains meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service on Saturday in Offenbach. " Although this high will shift a little to the east in the course of the next week. But it continues to determine the weather in Germany"
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, says Übel, says. “ Such a high can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands dreary high fog gray for days, while there is pure sun in the high altitudes of the low mountains.”
Thus, Sunday starts foggy and cloudy in most regions. According to the DWD, it can also rain a little from the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria. Especially on the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover loosens up as the day goes on and the sun comes out more and more often. In the rest of the country, it remains heavily cloudy or overcast in high fog. Temperatures reach 4 to 9 degrees, near Rhine by 10 degrees.
"On Monday, then the gradually getting stronger sun nibbles at the high fog again and can dissolve it more and more during the day, " says the meteorologist, saying. At the edge of the Alps, in the highlands of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia sun is expected all day, elsewhere it will only have to fight its way through the high fog cover. The maximum values are 5 to 9 degrees, on the Lower Rhine around 11 degrees, in the permanent gray in the southeast, on the other hand, only around 3 degrees are expected in the south-east. In addition, weak winds blow from different directions.
On Tuesday there may again be only tough dissipation of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be clear after the fog has cleared. In high altitudes, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and on the edge of the Alps, the sun is forecast to shine all day all day. Depending on the sunshine, temperatures climb to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominatorin hadert: Again no World Championship medal for Goggia.
The defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia was very disappointed after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't perform as well as I can, " said the Italian on ZDF after she had threaded at a gate and was eliminated. After all, the 30-year-old was just able to prevent a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill skier in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the season's six races in this discipline so far. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she won silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, still has to wait for a World Championship medal in her parade discipline, but Goggia, who is known for her risky driving style, will have to wait further. She was absent from her home game in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
“ I was actually thinking I’ d be fine. It was a matter of hundredths of a second, " Goggia said after the surprising victory of the Swiss Jasmine Flury in the French Méribel now. “ I’ m disappointed. I gave it all. But that's how life is" but that's the way life is. Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected and ultimately missed by all the experts: " But they aren't" but she said.

Zelensky and ministers oppose Russia's participation in the Olympics.
Kiev. With the demand for the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from the 2024 Paris Olympics, sports politicians from 35 nations have increased the pressure on the International Olympic Committee ( IOC) .
They agreed on a joint conference call to write a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Ministry of Sports said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues, " said Minister Jurgita Rozugždinien retakenly.
The video consultation had taken place on the initiative of Great Britain. British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter that it was a very productive meeting. “ And I have made Britain's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus cannot be represented at the Olympic Games. We will now issue a joint statement on this subject"
Earlier, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky protested at an international video conference of sports ministers and other high-ranking representatives against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. “ While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions,” Zelensky said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of the Russian war of aggression, a neutral flag was ultimately soaked in blood and not wearable because of the Russian war of aggression.
Ukraine threatens to boycott.
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a party to the war because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Zelensky called on officials to work to protect Olympic principles and prevent Russian athletes from being admitted to competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee( IOC), which has "unfortunately lost its honesty", which has "unfortunately lost its honesty".
The conference was prompted by the IOC's announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott if the IOC allows the athletes.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a position.
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, subsequently stated that it had also reaffirmed during the consultations that it would refuse the start of Russian and Belarusian athletes in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competitions. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to enjoy the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's effort to reinstate Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way, "a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said in a dpa request.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser( SPD) had already emphasized at the end of January: " Sport should be clear in its condemnation of Putin's brutal war against Ukrainian civilians. Great sporting events do not take place in "air space" Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be separated from.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they are clearly committed to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that an exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" violates the prohibition on discrimination.

According to estimates by the US Department of Defense, the Russian army has already lost half of its main battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine. "Probably half of the Russian army's main stockpile of tanks has been "destroyed or confiscated by Ukraine, " said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary of State for International Security Affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander machte bei einer Online-Veranstaltung der Denkfabrik Center for a New American Security keine weiteren Angaben zur Zahl der nach US-Einschätzung beschlagnahmten und zerstörten Panzer, die nach US-Einschätzung beschlagnahmt und zerstört wurden.
Ukraine is poised to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. Britain has pledged to supply Kiev with Challenger 2 main battle tanks for March. Germany, in a coalition with other states, wants to deliver a battalion of Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, in all likelihood, their delivery will take much longer.
Russia will Nachlegen.
In response to Western military aid, former Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev promised the construction and modernization of thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging abroad for planes, missiles, tanks, " Medvedev, who is now vice-chief of the Russian Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk, during a visit to the country of Omsk. ‘ It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase the production of various types of weapons and military technology  including modern tanks.’
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be more closely aligned with the needs of the army. This means, for example, that individual sectors can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil over Army postings.
Because the post that the former director of the Museum of Military History ( HGM) Christian Ortner will hold in the future was not advertised. The staff representative of the Academy Herwig Jedlaucnik suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klasius Tanner( ÖVP) defends the action.
A tender is not necessary because the appointment is to a previously vacant position, the minister said, because the appointment is being made to a previously vacant position. She does not want to comment on "speculations by a liberal staff representative", which she does not want to comment on. Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he was confronted with serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these are purged from Tanner's point of view.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. He is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current security policy issues.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the" unusual ordering process" The decision was based on the "appearance of Postenschacher, " says SPÖ military spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos are calling on Tanner to withdraw the appointment. The ÖVP is “ still up to its neck in the swamp of corruption”, said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense, said. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Karneval: First fools go to their knees before costs.
Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen, unlike the state capital, wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are also difficult to cope with in Wasungen, says carnival President Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total cost of the move.
In Brandenburg, no carnival parades are cancelled. The "Train of Happy People" in Cottbus, probably once again East Germany's largest, takes place for the first time after the pandemic. Also at the Swabian-Alemannic Fastnacht no removals were cancelled.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to the traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We're going through our event, " says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But here, too, financial worries are pressing: If more sponsors weren't found or the existing ones contributed even more, reserves would have to be touched - "that doesn't happen every year" - "that doesn't happen every year". The current deficit: about 200 for the time being. 000 euros.
And inflation: In the case of confectionery, there is sometimes a price increase of up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther of the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. By luck, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. For the move, however, it is already certain that it will be more expensive. Security requires twice as much staff as it did in 2020.
If you stand by the side of the road at the Rosenmontagszug in the Rhineland, you could get fewer camels than before. Because sweets have become more expensive, some train participants do not have so much in them. Camel or not, the number of visitors is likely to be large: “ I think that if it doesn't rain from pots that day, then we can definitely expect an increased crowd,” says Cologne train manager Holger Kirsch. "This is due to the fact that for two years there was no regular Rose Monday procession. Of course, the train can't be replaced by anything".
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment on costs in detail. However, the train is "generally" deficitary, that's no secret, that's not a secret.
Ukraine diary: Dreams and home-made vodka.
Ukrainians are not considered hard-drinking for nothing. There is domestic beer such as Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. No Kulmbacher, but other large breweries such as Krombacher or Warsteiner or Warsteiner. I can't tell a big difference in taste. The same is true with vodka, which is widespread. They burn here, especially in the villages themselves. They call him Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by an incredible 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here as well how little you can believe the Russians. They say as tourists, you should be careful with it. But it is only when he goes on a mass sale that applies only when he goes on a mass sale. Then there will probably also be a patrol of people.

Biathlon-WM: The Federal President sees the favorite victory and praises Oberhof.
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot" Flocke" at the airport by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger.
Oberhof.. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Championship sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was not possible to see from the VIP stand on Saturday whether the targets at the shooting range were actually falling. “ I had to get the results on my phone,” Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, pointing to the clouds of fog that kept drifting into the stadium, which severely impaired the viewpoint on the Rennsteig for the spectators.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed attending the 10 km sprint race at the Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof and received numerous tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "I've been fascinated by biathlon since the Olympics in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, " he revealed, also praising Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The refurbished arena is great and offers ideal conditions, offering ideal conditions. That's what the athletes say - with thanks to those who have tackled here since the World Cup was awarded "all right now". In terms of sustainability, too, the site is now "one step ahead" of many others and thus "safe" for the next few years and even decades."
In terms of sport, the Norwegian Johannes Thingnes Bö once again outpaced the competition. Despite a penalty loop after a shooting error, he secured himself in 23: 31 in the morning. 7 minutes - the sixth victory in the sixth sprint of winter - and thus his second world championship title at Oberhof. Behind him, his flawless brother Tar Kranken( 14.8 seconds back) and Sturla Holm Lägreid( 1 penalty round/ 39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale( 1/ 43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
One day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph, the local ski hunters could not intervene in the battle for medals. Johannes Kühn finished with a 1:04 deficit after a shooting error and a 1:04 deficit. 8 minutes as the best German, eighth place. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth ( 1:14) . 6) Two bright spots behind the gray veil. On the other hand, Benedict Doll disappointed again. After its botched mixed deployment on Wednesday, the Black Forest left five discs this time and disappeared as 55 in the form of 55. deeply disappointed and without comment in the cabin.
Bö was 14 years ago. 300 spectators entered the race with the number 1 and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However: On his last two standing shots he had the luck of the brave; they each landed on the edge of the discs and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the victory together with his five-year older brother: "It's the best feeling to be standing here with him, " said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes"
There is little doubt that Norwegians will also dominate Sunday's persecution, too. For women, on the other hand, German hopes rest on Herrmann- Wick. ‘ If you start with number one, the goal is not to come in tenth, but not to come in tenth. There's only full throttle and attack to defend the No. 1, sporting director Felix Bitterling took his “ locomotive” to task. The organizers expect for the double event( 13) . 25 and 15 respectively. 30m. / ZDF and Eurosport live) an almost sold-out arena.
Brych dislikes" swarm of bees" on the pitch.
Felix Brych referee Felix Brych decides on referee ball.
Aggressive players or complaining coaches. Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Germany's top referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in cooperation on the field on the pitch. "I do think that there are new behaviors of the players who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area, " said the 47-year-old of the German Press Agency. “ We discussed that during the winter break. We have decided we do not want to accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to this again - and will also sanction it."
Most recently, two coaches had also been considered with referrals. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup loss to FC Bayern. For Freiburg coach Christian Streich there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "The trainer's behavior also falls into the realm of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has also increased in this area, that the behaviour towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive, in the case of referees. We also want to punish such unsportsmanlike conduct consistently,” Brych said.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed out that coaches and referees work together in a fundamentally good way. "Overall, the ratio fits well. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. This will then require the person concerned to live. That should not be anything earth-moving, " said Fröhlich to the German Press Agency.
" Emotionality can certainly lead to conflicts in the course of the game. But if emotionality spills over into personal denigration, then you have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referees,” said Fröhlich. In recent cases, those involved would have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be important if a general rethinking process were to get underway that such behavior is simply not appropriate, " said Fröhlich on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed out possible implications at another level. "Of course, events from professional football always rub off. There is a role model effect, which results in imitation. In the most recent cases in the Bundesliga, referees have consistently reacted to negative behaviours,” said Fröhlich. “ Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful.”
Combiner Oftebro wins in Schonach.
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race by the Norwegian Jens Luraas Oftebro in front of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third was Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.

Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile strikes. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile strikes is once again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's energy grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants were damaged, the head of the Ukrenerho power plant, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Friday evening on Ukrainian television. The situation in the Kharkiv region is particularly bad for electricity supplies. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor unit had to be shut down at the Khmelnyzkyj nuclear power plant, and production at the Riwne and southern Ukraine nuclear power plants was curtailed.
President Volodymyr Zelensky condemned Friday's Russian attack with about 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. However, in a video message, he told his compatriots how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Zelensky does not want to abandon the small town of Bachmut.
It will be on the 24th. February will have been at war for a year. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. However, the danger of Russian missile strikes continued on Saturday night. In the capital Kiev, an air alert was triggered late Friday evening for the fifth time for the day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones, " said the military administration of the Kiev region. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down across Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for grid company.
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, during the election campaign to spin them off failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, the compromise of an infrastructure company had been agreed, which, however, should be oriented towards the common good in the future. That is, it does not need to generate and transfer profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros.
The two consulting firms are intended to help the federal government accompany this process. The refurbishment backlog in the rail network is a major reason why the railway is currently running very late in time. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this grievance with the complete renovation of entire railway corridors. The investments required for this have so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to more recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, they are more likely to be up to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023- Gold for Denise Herrmann- Wick: " Please can someone pinch me? “
The external circumstances had apparently not spoken for Herrmann- Wick at all. She would have slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited", the pulse had not come down as soon as the run-in. "Such a race, " and that at home world championships, " you can't describe it in words, " she said. 11 3000 spectators cheered to booming pop music with German flags, caregivers and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoying biathlon", that's what she had planned.
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old was the biggest, if not the only, German medal hope away from the seasons in the World Cup. Herrmann- Wick is the only German to win two World Cups this winter. In the overall World Cup, she is currently in fifth place. And even though the power density is significantly higher among women at the top than among men, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians currently dominate, you had rather others on the list for this sprint victory as a result of that sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison.
The bishop is a prominent critic of the left-wing leader. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been strained since 2018, with high levels of tensions since 2018.

Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of conspiracy with the US government to overthrow him, along with the US government.
Bundeswehr: The armament industry is calling for more orders from special funds to come in.
The first armaments projects have therefore already been canceled, and further projects are threatened with the same thing, as the" Welt am Sonntag" reports. Which investments would be omitted in concrete terms, however, could not yet be said at present. "There is no need to assign concrete procurement measures to a possible need for savings at this point in time, " reads a response from the federal government to a question from Member of the Bundestag Ingo Gädechens ( CDU) .
The reason for the falling investment sum is rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which was approved by the Bundestag in June 2022, must bear the interest burden on the loans itself. If these increase, less money is available for the concrete purchases for the Bundeswehr. In addition, due to the currently high inflation, the purchasing power of the remaining sum decreases.

Stuttgart Palace Square commemorates the victims of the earthquake disaster.
Many Stuttgart residents followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening.
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria occupies the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people remembered the victims at Stuttgart's Schlossplatz and prayed for them.
Many parishioners followed the call of the Ditib mosque community in Feuerbach, young and old, women and men. They all listened earnestly and silently to the prayer of the Imam. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this disaster as well.

The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border area is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish Islamic Union( Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt has collected donations in kind over a period of several days in Glockenstraße, which are to be trucked to the earthquake areas by truck. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat inlay Ebersberg - Ebersberg.
‘ After eating, you shall rest, or take a thousand steps.’    The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it in practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. Because those who are not sitting in the middle of a rocky desert thanks to the home office, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now use the lunch break either after the quick snack in front of the screen or just as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least you could get that impression around Lake Egglburg, where between 12 and 2 p.m. not only dog owners cavort about themselves for a long time between 12 and 14 p.m.
One reason, of course, could also be that modern people can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things in the course of an optimal time slot use. Because why not on the occasion of a short march through nature, news from the settlement is heard by the neighbor who has not been seen for a long time. Or meet your girlfriend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the old cinema. Work and private life could also be combined in this way - who says that the appointment with the tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor cannot take place outdoors. As long as there are no foreign ears nearby, of course, they are not close by.
What can also be done excellently is the acquisition of natural resources. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands on a table by the side of the road next to a cheese on the side of the road table. Or potatoes and meat. It's only stupid if you haven't thought about the purchase in advance and taken appropriate precautions. Thus, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer with empty hands and regret in their voices. “ Sorry, we unfortunately forgot the money” .
The disappointment can be felt, as you have a companion with a wallet yourself, but not a transport container. What makes the sympathetic chance acquaintance known. To which the man replies: "But that is not true, but that is not true. You are very likely to have a bag with you. "In this case, he points to the hood of the jacket, which was quickly thrown over before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional headgear superfluous. "My wife always puts everything in there, always pulling everything in her hand. “
And so it happens that you start the way back with meat inlay and on this midday short trip you have not only been enriched by a saddle of lamb, but also by a decidedly practical idea. It is quite possible that a second walk will be due that day - after dinner - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured.
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road in the direction of Hailfingen and, for reasons as yet unexplained, left the road in a left-hand curve, according to the police report, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a guide post, crashed sideways into a tree and stopped a few meters away. The collision trapped the driver in his car in the middle of the collision. The fire brigade freed him with heavy equipment. The emergency services took the seriously injured to a hospital. Because there was a suspicion of incapacity for driving, a blood sample was ordered. According to a police report, total damage in the amount of 1000 euros was incurred at Audi.
Donald Trumps Steuerunterlagen: Point for the rule of law.
The U.S. Department of Justice has ruled: The tax authority must hand over the ex-president's tax returns to parliament.
Trump in 2018, then still in office as president of the United States.
The Treasury Department must instruct the IRS to release the confidential documents to the Finance and Tax Committee, the ministry's decision on Friday said.
Contrary to U.S. political custom, real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax return public either as a candidate or later as president. He defended himself all the way to the Supreme Court against a release. A prosecutor's office in New York has since received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public - unless there was a trial.
The release to Congress is probably more delicate for Trump: There, the circle of authorized users is somewhat larger and, under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the Committee's investigation. In addition, confidential elements also repeatedly penetrate from parliament to the outside world.
The leader of the House of Representatives, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, immediately welcomed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law" as a "victory for the rule of law". Access to the Republican's tax records is a national security issue, she wrote on Twitter. ‘ The American people deserve to know the facts about their conflicts of interest and their erosion of our security as president,’ Pelosi said, explaining to Pelosi.

Cabaret stories from the Big Apple.
Vince Ebert has a mission: The studied physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, by his own admission, loves Viennese humor, breaks a lance for science in his cabaret programmes. This is the programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" that fits. Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic skepticism about science remains to be seen here. In any case, his humor suits Vienna very well.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's recent life story, as he tried to gain a foothold in New York for a year in 2019 as a stand-up comedian. Now, however, he is back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but he also explains what knowledge actually is and what it can and, above all, what it cannot do. Corona, of course, also occurs, but also German thoroughness in the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question many postpone: What is really important is what is really important. It's all with a huge wink, unagitated and very ironically. And so they are not only well entertained, but can also learn something new.

1 General
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a vector or X/ Y monitor as well. This game illustrates the combat action from the perspective of a tank driver. The battles are fought in a wide valley completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley level, there are rock pyramids and rock blocks, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is depicted by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which become increasingly difficult to hit as the game progresses. In addition, UFOs still appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five( 5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction process, the game initiation process, the game AB, the initial input to the highest scores, and the self-test process. The latter mode of operation is a special procedure for checking the operating elements and the computer function.
4 isn’ t that amazing! Gameplay.
The game sequence is triggered when the START pressure switch is pressed. The LED switch remains illuminated and the game sounds become audible. If the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is finished. The game starts with slow-moving tanks that become visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of the respective enemy tanks or missiles by observing the displayed text in the upper left corner of the cockpit by displaying it in the upper left corner of the cockpit. An indication can, for example, be. B HEERE'Z A QWESHCHUN FER YA. In addition, on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP tone, a dot is visible that represents the enemy's position.
The upper, cone-shaped surface on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is well targeted on the screen. Furthermore, ENEMY IN THE FIRE area is simultaneously displayed in the upper left hint display.
At times, UFO's will appear on screen flying over the battlefield. These are safe missiles that observe combat and cannot eliminate either the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. The UFO's are designed to round out the combat and distract players, as they would usually appear simultaneously with enemy tanks or missiles at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. A shot by the player brings that 5 to him. 3000 points. If an opponent is hit, the following points are reached: 1 for a slow-moving tank: 3000 points, for a rocket 2 3000 points and 3 for a super tank. 3000 points. A super tank drives and turns twice as fast as the player's tank or an opponent's slow-moving tank. Several options give the operator the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks for a game sequence 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks. In addition, a bonus tank is released after reaching predetermined scores and the appearance of the rocket is varied for a further more difficult game design. Details and the exact switching positions of the game sequence selector for this setting option are shown in the figure.
5 Initial entry for maximum results.
If a player exceeds the minimum number of points in the table of maximum scores, HE or SHE can enter three( 3) personal initials in the table after the end of the game. The instructions for this are self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that triggering a self-test, pressing the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector PCB or interrupting the mains voltage will erase the table with the highest results. As you delete( RESET), the ten( 10) highest scores are obtained with their initials and re-enrolled on the screen to challenge more players. Every score in excess of 100 are scored. 1, 000 is lying, additionally marked with a tank icon, followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter their initials within 60 seconds, the computer will automatically write strokes. After that, the device switches back to the attraction gameplay. ROIGHT, SO, I'Z FIXED ME 'EADACHES.
1 New parts.
The BATTLEZONE device has five( 5) new components. If you already have experience with ATARI video devices, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a reconstruction of the ATARI switchblade. It was strengthened by several additional ribs in the inner and outer housing part, making this unit more stable and ensuring proper functioning of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering belt, which, like a centering spring, repeatedly puts the control lever in the middle position. The microswitches ter are now fixed with self-locking nuts for easier replacement, for the sake of easy replacement. B Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuit has been extended to two ( 2) interconnected boards, including two ( 2) interconnected boards. These are the analog vector generator boards and auxiliary boards. With the help of clef-switch technology k, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, which results in an even and calm picture. C. The power supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly engineered power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by expanding the circuit, depending on how the circuit is expanded. D The device house. Due to the new design, it was now possible to set up a new cash register with greater coinage capability. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, intended as a podium for smaller players, thus making it easier to play. At the same time, this console ensures maximum device stability at the installation site.
These new components, as well as all other main assemblies of this device, are shown in Figure 1 as shown in Figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2 Equipment inspection.
After removing the package, this new entertainment device is ready to play. However, you should do some verification to finalize the quality controls, only to do so. In order to ensure that the device has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be carried out: A NOTICE: Do not yet connect the device to the 220 V network yet. A: Inspect the outside of the housing for damage. B Open the device's maintenance flap and check the components within the device as follows: ( 1) Check all wiring harness connectors for correct and firm connection. Eventuals were open or open, respectively. loose plugs linked to each other.
NOTE: Never forcibly make plug connections. The plugs are provided with a forced guide, so that a correct connection is established. A connector twisted 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
( 2) Check plug connections to the game PC board for correct and fixed-seat seats. ( 3) Note the manufacturing number of the device on the type plate on the back of the device. Check that the punched-in production number matches that of the Battlezone Analog Vector Generator PC Board, Auxiliary PC Board, Controller/Audio II PC Board and TV Monitor. An illustration of the location of the production number can be found on the backboard side of this manual. This number should always be provided when you call your dealer for more service information. ( 4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control console and the TV monitor for proper assembly when assembly is not proper. ( 5) Finally, the device must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the player's viewing glass, it can be checked whether the radar screen is also in the bright, orange circled opening of the disguise. If the opening is not precisely centered, the lining, which is attached to the case with tape, must be loosened and re-oriented, and the lining must be re-oriented. Before the device is connected to the mains supply, it must be ensured that the voltage selector plug is on the power supply 1( s) . bc of that i almost cried🙏 im so happy bro. 3) matching the local mains voltage. Checking the cable color on the plug and checking the connection values as listed below:

INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT.
The desire to develop video games has been sparked in me by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a whole host of new possibilities, and it seemed to me to be a new means of expression with which to push the world to its limits. She represented a way for me to develop new horizons. ‘ I came to be like a caterpillar at the beginning of the 20th, I was like a caterpillar.’ Centuries ago: On the one hand, I struggled with the still immature technique, but on the other hand, I was aware that everything was still to be discovered - in particular a new language that had to be both narrative and visual - to be both. To be honest, I wasn’ t able to satisfy my hunger for the next ten years, to be honest. I had a vague sense that video games exploited a tiny fraction of their amazing creative power because they were too focused on "action" to forget a fundamental element of the human experience world: the sensations of the human experience world. Meanwhile, the technology continued to progress rapidly. Fahrenheit is my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that conveys feelings. Although this could have taken place in a completely different form, of course, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that real questions are raised here, and concrete answers are offered. Fahrenheit is proof that you can certainly create an interactive gaming experience based not only on fighting despicable monsters in dark corridors, but also on boxing for ammunition, but on far more demanding and profound content. It is evidence that both a story and a game content can be offered without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements because of it, without sacrificing the narrative or interactive elements. I hope both fancy gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are more skeptical about video games, then I can hope that driving can help change your mindset of this. May other developers also feel the desire to embark on this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspiration, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy, and offers a chance to discover everything first and only. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a great deal of our lives, representing an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, in which we repeatedly saw ourselves as having been forced to question many of the principles previously deemed indestructible. I would be happy if driving  similar to books, movies and songs that have made a lasting impression on you  also isn't going to go smoothly on you, too. David Cage..
THE README FILE
A ReadMe file is included on the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM for viewing the license agreement and updated information about the game. We recommend checking this file so that you can take note of any changes that have been made since this manual has been printed. To view the file, double-click it in the Fahrenheit directory on your hard drive ( usually C:\Programms\Atari\ Fahrenheit) However, you can also access the ReadMe file by first clicking on the Start button on the Windows® taskbar and then selecting “ programs”, “ Atari”, “ Fahrenheit” and finally the ReadMe file.
SETUP AND INSTALLATION.
1 Start Windows® 2000/XP. 2 Put the Fahrenheit DVD-ROM into the DVD-ROM drive. 3 If the “ AutoPlay” option is enabled, the title screen should appear. If "AutoPlay" is not activated, or the installation does not start automatically, click the Start button on the Windows® taskbar, and then click Run. Type D:\ Setup, and then click OK. Note: If your DVD-ROM drive is assigned to a letter other than "D", use it accordingly. 4 isn’ t that amazing!

SERVICE PROGRAM
Generally. For programming and testing, the 4 switches in the device, the self-test button and the LEDs on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display is used to select the language ( English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The "Sub-Test" switch can be used to set the languages. When the desired language appears green, press the" Test" switch to switch to the next program display. Deployment programming. This indicator can be used to determine the difficulty factor for the game. Furthermore, this can be used to discontinue a" maximum amount of credits" that may be before the start of the game" before the start of the game. The lettering to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch ( appears green), the desired value to this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. By pressing the "sub-test" switch several times, the factory or factory can be used separately. Basic setting is achieved when the bottom line ( RESET lines) lights up green, "Up" button is pressed. Values are reset, the pointer( called the green lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can take place. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000] is used to transfer the high score point to the next program display until "high hit rate so far" This value determines the required number of points/focus scores a player needs so that his own initials ( names) and the hit points can be entered onto the screen. The "maximum number of credits" determines a coin acceptance limit for the device. When the border is crossed, - if a coin block is in place - the coin acceptance is closed - if a coin lock is in place - the coin acceptance is closed. This can set a limited number of games for a player to play. This value is 1-69 for each other. It should not be so tightly tuned to 99, so by throwing a coin in it, the loans cannot become zero if over 99 is added. An example mode can be selected by setting "maximum loan" on O. Other programming: “ number of games” : Number of markers per credit.
" Threshold": Level of the % number that must be reached in order to switch to the next passage.
" Time limit": Release for additional Sparx.
"Difficulty": Game Sequence Difficulty.
"Pull-on tone": at "0" no sound during standby mode during standby mode.
at" 1" sound also at stand mode( animated sound) " table model": at "0" stand model at" 0".
at" 1" tabletop unit.
The loans per coin are discontinued on the" insert slot programming" ad. High-score program display ( highest hit rate so far") . The scoring points and initials of the player appear, including the next 10 scores, as well as the next 10 scores. Values are used to set to high score selected on the previous display ( set from "Back"), which was selected on the previous display. Press the "Up" switch to discontinue the initials QIX Standard by pressing the "Up" switch. By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears. The" Overall Evaluation" By pressing the "Up" switch, it can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of loans paid. The total number is not set to 0. If 1 had to do so. lmao its just me nvm 000 is achieved, the count starts over again. The total number can only appear at 0 when the battery or connector W1 is removed, when the device is switched off, if the battery or connector is removed. Left-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the left coin slot. Medium Coins: ( not available) right-sided coins: Number of coins inserted in the right coin slot. Paid credits: Number of credits given for purchased ( revalued coins) . Secured credits: Number of credits given by the device. % Free Spiele: Granted credits( paid+ Granted credits per 100) Played minutes: Number of minutes played. Won minutes: Number of minutes, in extended or won game. % Leisure: Won minutes/played minutes per 100. Average playing time in sec. : minutes played / paid + provided loans.
High Score ( Trefferquote) : Number of times a player had hit rates high enough to oust other players from the high score list. By pressing the" Up" switch, the values are set to 0". By pressing the "Test" button, the next program display appears.
Insertion slot programming/ normal money setting. Using this display, a standard coin setting can be selected by the operator, or another setting can be programmed.
If a default setting is provided, the programming is selected by pressing the "Up" and "Down" buttons, while the top digit lights up green on the screen. Size values change as the digit changes. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the" Test" switch, the setting is adopted. If a setting that does not correspond to the standard setting is desired, the values can be set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that your own setting is possible. Since the lower scores are unchanged the programmer can reduce his adjustment efforts by choosing a setting that captures his desired scores and changing only the scores which are not appropriate. As soon as the setting has been made, any newly set size can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. When pressed unintentionally, the default setting will appear when pressed. The "Up" and "Down" switches can increase or decrease the values. By pressing the" Test" switch, the process is finished. The coin multiplier (“ coin unit”) says how many coin units are given for every coin inserted through an assigned slot. Coin units “ credit” shows the number of units required before a loan is issued. "Bonus" coin units show the units required before a bonus loan is issued. “ Min, thank you” he said. A " coin" is a value that accumulates loans until a set minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value will not find use of "0" 0". CMOS MEMORY ( memory) AUSFALL.
If "Memory Failure- Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM, in which all programming is stored, has failed. All values stored in the RAM are reset to factory default. This condition probably shows failure or failure of the battery.
TROUBLESHOOTING and SETTINGS.
Beginning of the test method. Press the" Sub- Test" switch or the" Self Test" button( SW 1 near the LED display) . All LEDs should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered for the respective program display, by pressing the" Test" switch the next program is displayed each time. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice so that the video test begins in auto-test mode. For this program, the device will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off until it is turned off. If the "Open Coin Door to Test" ad appears, the program plug J 19, 1-2 must be inserted, 1-2 must be inserted. When the J19 plug is removed, the memory ( memory) is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off/ I = a / X = test results.
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device will stop and the value of the ROM with the wrong checking sum will appear on the LED's. If the check sum ROM is error-proof, U 10 is displayed first U 10 is displayed. If this test does not succeed, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks ( series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decoder plug ( 26- 00002- 016 for 2716 or 26- 00002- 032 for 2732) . Communications RAM from the Video Board.
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM, then checking whether the memory was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the box with the o is now in place. a Holding a display, an error was discovered. If the communications RAMs fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by defective wiring ( RAM) or errors in the data board. To locate the error, remove the data board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: Fault in the U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM.
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is checked in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test was passed, all memory locations are set to their previous value. LED- Value: 00 0011 If the device with the o is, if it is the unit. a If the display is held, there is an error in front of it. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or circuits, respectively. decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers will be checked for correctness when reading back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, an error is present. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video-Board ( Anzeige RAM) The display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each page. The results of these descriptions are compared with the original pattern. Any discrepancy will halt the program, and the LEDs will show the faulty RAM on to it. If a display RAM fails, identify the problem and replace the RAM. If this error diagnosis does not show a RAM failure( 00 0101 on LEDs), it is indicated that the next test will be started( Data Hardware) . The data processor must be connected, and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed.
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics on it. So that's also the reason for star #1. The 2nd for getting the right jacket without any apparent seam defects arriving at it. BUT I was probably looking forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. Had oriented myself from the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since she's supposed to be this tight, and I didn't want to fight her way into an S or M with my nails.    In the end, it would have fit from the length and at the hip, both.   the rest of it soo i could swim in it. In addition, the food material came towards you as soon as you opened the package and spread everywhere. It’ s just a shame.  It will be sent back: /
Fast delivery and good workmanship.
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear them well on both sides. We ordered her for our daughter, she is totally thrilled, she is totally thrilled. She wears the 158 otherwise and she fits the 36 quite well in this case and will certainly be worn next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality.
I opted for the rubber pad c because I always work with wood on my remote, and that's not optimal after that. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the edition doesn't quite fit. But what I am wrong is this Then I slightly changed it so that it would fit. The overlay looks very robust and you can no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the whole area. worked without any problems. There's nothing like this which will slide anymore. I would buy it again immediately.
Too big for less than 1 year, unfortunately.
The product itself is okay for me, but not for a year. Since the area to chew is far too large for the small mouth after all, it is much too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months old and he couldn't use him because of his size. We take him back by 12 months now and he can use it again. Has also not yet been able to bite anything with his already few existing teeth. And when he was in the fridge, it calmed him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient/ Unfortunately goes back.
I have probably been blinded here by the partly exaggerated reviews. so basically for A's i notice im already using 2 of my irl buds ( back & forth sometimes) . A very large one ( to keep the equipment) and a pretty small one for the most important, everyday things that you just take with you. So that's when I get the Sigma 70-2002 right now. I bought 8, the little Lowepro has finally gotten too small, and I need a replacement. On Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price ( just under 29 euros) and I was actually very happy about this purchase, but I had read through many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack arrived yesterday, the sobering followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, that can not be said. But he ( as many reviews have written) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices    Man, this is just not true, people. I was really hoping that was the case, but there really can be no mention of that, but I don't know. The padded walls are much thinner and don’ t give the same protection as my Lowepro. Oh, the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more labby. Overall, the feel of this backpack can't be compared to that of my Lowepro. Also, the travel closures and the materials of the compartments for the small material are not exactly of high quality. So I opted for the backpack to go back in. If I buy equipment of many thousands of euros, then I unfortunately also have to take the money into my hands for a reasonable backpack, then I also have to take the money for a reasonable backpack. Quality apparently has its price here. As somebody that doesn’ t want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is definitely a good choice, but not for me, And it's not like I found the decision difficult. When I was packing up the backpack, after 2 minutes I knew it was going back. What I really liked is the color inside. Here you will definitely find his things much faster than with a grey interior life. The backpack is definitely a great thing to do with someone who has different demands on a backpack, but for me I’ m going back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part.
So far, I’ ve had the electrical series of E. L. Todd liked it best, but my opinion was revised with this book. I found the first two books very strong and also recommendable and had been really looking forward to the third part? The part is about Volt and Taylor's feelings all the time, and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has been raving about Volt for so long, finally admitting everything and is then like a small child in every argument and ripping off.  At the same time there were also discrepancies in my feeling, because at the end of the second part Volt tried and didn't believe Taylor's ex and when he said Taylor was going for him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and that he heard it himself. But by the start of the third part, Volt seems to have forgotten everything and is struggling with Taylor, saying Taylor. T got her hopes up, then its the last part of the series, and I think that this part is the weakest, and also quite unnecessary, but we do see the need. I will still read the fourth part and hope that will finally come out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is Volt's ex. It would bring more tension back to history.
Man destroys everything, does not appreciate anything and does not learn to do so. First off, the movie's not as bad as many write now. Of course, of course, the story is totally constructed, and always designed according to the same scheme F, again and again. If you have seen the beginning, you know what the end is like when you see the beginning. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and does not appreciate anything, and does not learn to do so. And that's exactly what the film wants to tell us. How many times have I just thought about this movie ( and that even though I know it’ s just a film, and the animals come from the computer) : Oh my God, the poor animals, there are often tears in your eyes ( often the tears in your eyes) . That's why the Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom has already been really neatly made. It's just a shame that people just don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream film, it's still a bit of a reach. We are consistently destroying the animals and the environment and ultimately our planet and ourselves in this regard. Out of greed and greed for profit, and out of stupidity and arrogance Empathy for the environment and living beings: misrepresentation. 4 stars because the film is well made, but unfortunately always according to the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema still.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This movie is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't even want to be a Hollywood blockbuster. This film is above all "French" - it's also calm, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic.
Taste like quench from the 90's, because of orange, but it doesn't matter either that. 5 days every morning a package: nothing moved, but nothing at all. I am 12 cm in my belly circumference. Flatulence like never before After that, diarrhea 5- 8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea remains for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller packaging size, only 2 stars were given( unfortunately only seen too late), with the larger full 5 This is very, very weird, this one.
terrible stench and low outcome. I dyed my blond hair a chocolate brown in October with an intense tint, and in February/March I used this hair color remover in February/March. I have used the product twice now. The first time I noticed directly that it smelled terrible. However, there was still a not too bad result, a chestnut brown ( somewhat darker) came out. Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it again, as in the instructions even if the result was not satisfied, another time. This time it was a waste of time. It didn’ t make a difference, my hair looked like it did the first time I tried it. Worst of all, it still stinked weeks after use.  No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn’ t go away.
Highly recommended.
I’ ve been taking the tablets for a long time now, and I always take one every 5 days. My vitamin balance had been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and even a prolonged additional illness. That's why I wanted to help my immune system not only through a healthy diet but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 a little on the jump. It also works in a very good way. I feel fitter and much more comfortable living. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also consider how long you can take the tablets. Highly recommended.
not working properly   After 3 months of using the battery case, I discovered the following gross deficiencies which I find very annoying: 1) The case has problems "connecting" to the phone over time: This means no longer charging even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and putting it back in solves the problem in 70% of cases, but this creates a new shortage. 2) Due to frequent removal and reinserting of the phone in the case, the lid is now so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times now. This is not a big deal my issue is, but I think that the battery enclosure should be perfect right now and I am very disappointed with the product for the 30€ worth, especially because I have only been using it for 3 months now.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing.
I don’ t know how all this good stuff comes up against me. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you get from every optician in a slightly smaller form gift. Cleanup effect is as good as a kitchen towel, and no better. I have promised myself a lot more of these scarves, it is also really very thin, it is also very thin. Since I have used it, I can unfortunately no longer exchange it. I am disappointed and cannot recommend it from my side. The price for these towels is far exaggerated. You shouldn't give more than 2 euros.
I doubt the frequency response.
I bought this speaker for a shower when, unfortunately, my smaller free speaker which I received as a giveaway broke which is not good enough. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof ( I got shcon in the shower), reproduces bass like bass, Bluetooth works great, Bluetooth works great.   Of course, you have to water the suction, otherwise it will dissolve.  he can play sound very loudly   yes its not even just me nvm  What I see critically is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is played as bass and not made to a higher frequency, instead of being converted into a higher frequency. However, that causes one problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of the vocals hurt almost in the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough to be heard. My old speaker didn't play bass well as a bass, but the frequencies were presented fairly naturally at volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with Onforu, which I think is a bit annoying. So I have to deduct one star from that and so on. I have now expected more from the frequency response.
very bad very much
The paint had chipped off in a few places and if you just went over it with your hand, the paint went off in some places as well. We wanted to have them picked up for free because we didn't want them anymore but unfortunately only at our expense but they would only replace the damaged parts as if both commode were damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon did all this for us and transferred the money back to us. A LOB on Amazon.
Better to spend a little more money on them.
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in quality. Individual parts are provided which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope made of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the postman literally stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I have not processed it because I desperately needed this product to work with. The supplied adhesive hardly holds, but sticks properly for it - like chewing gum, which, however, does not become hard. Already one day after gluing almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out ( at least it was still not dry 5 days after gluing), you have to be very careful not to stick everything together. The templates are partially incompletely punched out, partly incomplete. Okay for a one-off, and as a joke for a party, but for a wedding, I’ d invest a little more money and get into a high-end product when I got into a wedding.
I’ m not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear, even if the instructions are not so clear. + Magnetic clasps + beautiful look + stable when set up + shelf can be positioned any way you want.
- Doors slam through magnets ( maybe you can compensate with rubber knobs) - some unclean places.
- supplied dowels are much too small and wobble ( had no others and have them since no cup was in the house, glued with craft glue) - the holders for the shelf wobble a bit ( I wrapped it with some paper and balanced it) Conclusion: If it didn't look so good and had such good dimensions, I would give less stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. Also, I think that it is a bit too expensive for this purpose as well.
I like the coffee.    but
there are only 3 stars 4 The taste is subjectively good, but I think the original capsules are better ( but also much more expensive) . In that respect, I would have given 5* due. Unfortunately, the coffee doesn't flow evenly ( if at all) . ) Also the additional plastic waste ( individually packaged s. Photo) will mean for me a star deduction from the photo. I hope the manufacturer changes this and gets full marks soon.
I'm getting on my nerves.
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: natural sounds sound terrible, and super loud at that. I couldn't turn them down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, so I immediately fall out of bed and get off the bed immediately. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up with my face in my face, because I thought it was already tomorrow, because I thought it would be tomorrow. However, when it comes back and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. I liked the colors and also the color change, unfortunately, you can't dim the colored light. I also liked the battery it was designed to have, so if you don’ t have to, you don’ t have to re-enter the clock and chill once you get out, it’ s not overpowered. However, I went back for the reasons mentioned above.
Light super, workmanship insufficient.
I have replaced four lights in the house with these lights. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a version  instead, a circuit board is laughing at me at this point.   There was nothing in the box either. "6 payment 4 get" is not a good deal. I'm sure Amazon would have settled this quickly and accommodatingly, but I didn't find out until after the return period. So that's why I see this as my fault and live with it. Yet it's not a good indication of the quality of these lights - the only reason two-star deduction has so far been for the only reason for two-star deduction. The light itself is super light The rooms are now very brightly illuminated and evenly illuminated. The light color tends to go in the direction of cold white. Perfect for hallway, study, study, laundry room, etc. For living spaces, I personally would go out with warmer lighting. Quite comparable to a good old 100 watt pear. However, other lamps can do the same and I may also get intact copies there according to the order. If my grade is helpful, I would be happy to have a positive score. I try to answer questions quickly.
Great.
I’ ve gotten gestures and I’ d like to share my first look, then, I’ d like to share it. On a positive note, this would be useful. I've been thinking for a long time whether or not I will order this set or not. ** The material is stable and it fits well in the hand. ** The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang them** The soft silicone does not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially practical to use on panels with coating. ** They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440°F. ** They also do not pass the heat and can therefore be touched directly and thus can be touched directly. ** However, the dishwasher sometimes leaves water stains on the black silicone. But just after swipe, they'll be gone. Finally, I have to say I am very surprised and I can only recommend it.
B-goods sold as new goods.
Amazon Prime shipping is just top notch. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet, unpacked and all the parts checked, all of the parts checked. In doing so, we found that the part had already been installed before. We had to find considerable scratches and abrasions on all assembly parts. The hose fittings/connections were all damaged. Nevertheless, we installed the part in the sink( unfortunately) . Only now did we see that scratch marks/streaks can also be seen on the chrome-plated faucet itself. This part has probably already been delivered and sent back. We keep this faucet in there and put it in the sink in the basement because that doesn't matter what it looks like. Our conclusion; Never again do we order such goods via Amazon, but rather spend a little more on the hardware store where we get orderly goods. I just think it’ s sad for customers to be fooled like that...
Product itself top, outdoor sensor unfortunately broken after only 6 months after only.
Basically, I am quite satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, with no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple, and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame like a small picture frame. the only thing that is annoying is after anyway which Is why the hell happened. For a six-year period of use, the device, which measures the values on the outside, seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be still intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably gone, because completely astronomical values of outdoor humidity are always displayed. This is a huge BUST, as the device has been placed in a shielded place on the outside, and also the reason why I give this product only two stars for this product.
Strong mower with a weak grass collector.
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery as of today is still happily driving through the Republic with Hermes without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, Amazon’ s service was outstanding with the triggering of a replacement delivery as always. The mower arrived quickly and made a valuable impression on me, making a good impression. The engine is strong and there is a nice clipper. The volume isn't exactly impressive, but ok, but it's okay I guess. Unfortunately, the big drawback is the catcher. On the one hand, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and in between fabric. If you just drop it off completely, then of course it will be compressed, and parts of the content will fall out of it. Worse, however, is that the actually practical level indicator shows red even when the catch basket is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Always emptying the basket on a large lawn when it is only half full cannot be the solution now. So I cleaned the device as best I could and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the grass catcher makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring.
I have two of these devices which are both. The device can be easily integrated via the app. The supplied plug-in sensor cable is very good, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built in a solid structure. Space temperature and humidity are displayed, but only once to three times a day ( adjustable) are displayed in the app to save battery power ( adjustable) . I am giving only 4 stars for the following reason: - The soft rear wall of the device, which also closes the battery compartment, can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with fairly thick walls. This device loses connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device itself does not reconnect, even if you place it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and re-position them after a short break, then it connects again. It should actually work without removing the battery and not with the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a little louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY.
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not been able to level the Hotbed properly until today. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high there and the front right screw falls out, since it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low, although the hotbed is still too low. The bars that hold the car are straight, as well as the table also. Maybe someone knows what you can do, because that's how it's impossible to print anything. For construction: The construction was quite problem-free, you could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you would have to lay them again several times, which is very exhausting, which is very exhausting. I have also already written to support but still haven't received a response after a week of waiting. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to send it back. expected a little more.
robust and precise am positively surprised.
My old caliper unfortunately gave up the ghost after many years, so a new one had to be made. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Two batteries are included, so you can start right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but fully fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measuring methods. I can only give it a full score for it and I think it will last at least as long as the old caliper goes. There is a clear purchase recommendation from mit and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, permanent smell.
Bought the bracelet and have not worn it for the time being because it emits a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell is not gone, although it has been constantly "aired", although it has been constantly "aired". Once it was no longer possible to return it, I disposed of it. Rate from purchase.
Ok for the price
The stars and balls on this chain are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks pretty massive. The larger balls are free to move, which in turn I think is quite nice. However, the chain is very simple overall, so I've already torn open the clasp twice now. So far I’ ve been able to repair him again and again, but I don’ t think that’ s going to last long. But for the low price, you simply can't expect anything really high quality either.
Very nice piece of jewelry.
A beautifully crafted bracelet and the simple clasp actually holds true. You just have to pull the end through your mouth, it can't open, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather conditioner, which makes it a little softer and more cuddly. Only: who has something magnetic on the arm: The clasp is made of steel.
Unfortunately, scrap metal. I was disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that these were used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after some gimmick.    if you stick to the instructions it doesn't work at all only after I removed a battery from the base station again and reinserted it, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy about it didn't last long, because after only an hour the connection was gone again, even though the stations were next to the base station, although the stations were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three stations was very different. All in all, not to be used for me like that. The thing went all over the place :-( In any case, should advise against buying, will only bring trouble.
Transport damage.
Hello, I've had this garden pump before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off after 3.5 years. I bought it again for one reason only, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections for the gas pump as well as the discharge line would fit. I hope that the shaft on the previous pump had a production defect and that the current pump will do its job a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had transport damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the ventilation slots were broken. The box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway because, as described above, I was in desperate need of the pump and the cracks in the plastic housing didn't affect the pumping performance anymore.
You could have thought better. I often have to deal with a lot of different keys, so I thought that such an organizer would be more enjoyable than walking around all the time with a huge bunch of keys. At first everything went quite well too! However, the paint went off quite quickly and always the screws had to be tightened. It's nice that you can do that with a penny coin, but also only with a penny coin. I have not found a suitable slotted screwdriver which would not have ruined the whole screw immediately. Now to the most annoying thing about the whole thing: the attachment of the keys. It is nice that you can use the different parts, the screw at different sizes or sizes, respectively. Lengths can be set, but if you have screwed the whole thing together for the first time, you need pliers to disassemble the whole thing. Making the key in itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill, all about being a game of patience and balance. Finally, the third time I installed it, the screw in the thread broke, making the whole thing unusable. Conclusion: If at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the given dimensions.
Smooth-running zippers, the material looks robust and all that featherweight. Since I have no comparison ( my first organizer set), I will not be able to actually evaluate the goods until after the first use. In advance, I can say that the height is lower than indicated. At the moment I can't really think about it so much like there literally full up B packed for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really large parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before or so - as before. It should still be noted that not 8 but 10 parts were delivered as the round cosmetic bag contained two smaller bags/bags still inside. Not high-quality workmanship, I wanted to mention that anyway, I wanted to mention that. The fact that the cosmetic bag is a different color and is made of different material than the other bags doesn't really bother me personally cuz I personally feel like I'm not in the way of a cosmetic bag. Price-performance ratio I see as a trial price and it is fine.
So Fucking kill me.
So, ordered before Christmas and it worked until after Christmas also. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it wouldn't do it anymore. Battery. Exchanged But it still doesn’ t work. So, I could have thrown the money directly into the garbage can, too.
Care is always good. The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush so as not to damage the needle. I couldn't hear an improvement in the sound in my very high quality turntable.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Two black cables were included. The battery life is very long enough. Definitely fully adequate sound. I liked that the headset doesn't hurt even after wearing it for a long time, and so it's very comfortable being done by a lot of people. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Recommendation for purchase in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is easy to wear for a wide variety of occasions.  The price-performance ratio is fully consistent here, especially since I also bought it in the flash offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I didn't order it smaller ( been recommended) . I just wished the neckline wasn't so deep and also the sleeves could use a little more fabric ( if you don't have a very narrow upper arm like the model in the picture) But all in all a chic dress for many opportunities.
Get your fingers off me. It doesn't get worse than that. I genuinely and seriously did not expect such a junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports provide sufficient power. Nevertheless, trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVDs usually go, Blu-rays are recognized as unreliably as much as possible, and Blu-rays are recognized as unreliably. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes Rödel sounds like the way people haven't heard them since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes, you can either restart the computer because nothing will work or the disc will finally be recognized. But then you can't press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language or anything during the movie or anything at all. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze that cannot be fixed. In addition, of course, no Blu-ray software is included. Additionally, if you purchase PowerDVD or the like for a fee, the price of this drive will double.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to emphasize that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there for charging any devices and is therefore relatively useless. I didn't know that when I bought it, which is why I was a little disappointed. I really needed a second port and if I had just bought a decent extension I probably wouldn't have bought this shapeless lump with golden plugs. But apart from the optics and my misjudgement, the extension does its job very reliably, And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick also does not simply dangle around in the area, as with a completely normal extension cord. So not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is narrow :-)
Small but sad. I purchased this product so that I could have an audio output on the iPad ( Pro) as well as a display to connect to it. With IOS 12, you can now also move data back and forth, too. so thats kinda neat imo Furthermore, the audio edition was as expected. Unfortunately, other adapters that I had already had to send back could not send this back. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller on the tablet via BT and that of the HDMI on the TV. Being prepared at the same time is not a problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. For what do I still use my PlayStation: P There was a small adapter that can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. So that doesn't fit the adapter with my case. Naja also holds so secure and has contact from there and from there on.   All in all, although a bit expensive, justified by the full range of functions. In addition, the whole thing is very small and made stable in one piece of aluminum. Price performance fits.
Lots of power.
Top device. Has been running for months with no problems. Is not exactly light or quiet, but brings decent performance. I think the middle position of the temperature ( emu setting) is a bit too cool, so I am always on leg 2 ( 2 level), so it will be on the waitlist. Has also fallen on the tiled floor several times and survived well. And I like the simple design too that. Competitive products like to look like spaceships.
Very good.
The workmanship of the brush head made a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a favorable impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can recommend them without reservation.
Great product with weak battery life.
We've had the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode the location is accurate to what feels like 0.5m in live mode. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, however, it likes to jump a few meters at a time, which is not disturbing but is not annoying. I would buy it again anytime I wanted to. However, what would be great would be a battery which lasts longer. He currently lasts about 1.5 hours a day. Here's a great solution which would last 7-14 days. There is an XL version but unfortunately it is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not have to last with us at all and we also find it impractical to change it every day. You shouldn't deal with the dog with his collar :-) The app also worked perfectly for the product.
Garbage after a few weeks garbage.
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They match well and seem to be comfortable too. However, life expectancy is increasingly decreasing. Although my son only wears the shoes in physical education class, the sole breaks after only a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. So with the last couple, it was also in normal use that they didn't last long, but I was thinking for class it would be enough. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original, it fits perfectly. My last pair of Crocs broke after 5 years, so I was happy to order new ones. Unfortunately, these here are poorly processed at first glance at first glance. Comfortable though, they are just like the one I used to have before. There doesn't seem to be a difference at first glance either, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly made and the strap is quite loose on the heel, and it's very likely that they won't last five years like my previous one. I'm curious to see it go.
Surprisingly good.
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was very skeptical at first. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and I would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it with good luck. For delivery, the mattress and a car air pump were included. About the mattress: I put them in the car( Citroen Berthold) by testing them. Just kind of realized that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it off and hopefully it won’ t reappear. In the inflated state, a lying test was carried out directly in the inflated state. It's easy to lie on and fits great with the festival, which is great. Of course, this mattress can’ t replace your own bed, but the one for days at the event is the pure luxury it is. The mattress comes in great with my car in it. Before that, we took out the seats in the back. So it fits perfectly at the moment. The air pump: The air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump is plugged in the car's cigarette lights. However, the plug was defective( something at the solder point) . Since my friend is skilled at it, he was able to repair it, and reassembled, the good part worked great and pumped up the mattress in zero comma Nix. Overall, I am very enthusiastic about the mattress. I'm then curious for the hardness test at the festival. I hope she doesn’ t lose air and lasts a long time. Just like he's not reappearing Schimmel again After the test I can definitely recommend it once. So, if I have any other experience, I will update the review accordingly ( if possible) .
Definitely not worth more than 10€   ‘ Unfortunately, the calendar only gets two stars from me.’ :( 1 For fast shipping. 2 Because of the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar has been torn open by the läppling processing directly on day 1 over several doors on days 1, unfortunately. It will be on 21st. There were no more doors to the door and I had to more or less allow my son to take out the rest of the parts accordingly, since they had already fallen towards him, quasi already fallen towards him. The parts often come out of a mess, which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to attach the parts. After the car is completely assembled, parts fall off while playing. ( Most of the time, the windshield will come with it.) This is also very difficult to bring back. ) In itself, I wouldn't buy this calendar anymore, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either, Eventually, the manufacturers are rethinking the way they designed the calendar for the next issue and making it better to do so, making it better for the next issue. :\
a real drone
I’ m so excited about the drone. My 7 year-old daughter flies with it. Inside, it flies very well and 5 minutes for flying very well. Flight time is usually sufficient at all. That hair gets stuck in it and the drone breaks very quickly I didn't expect otherwise at the price, but falls from the ceiling onto the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. If you have any questions, please contact us.
Game ok but only playable with compulsion to Steam. I didn't see when I bought it that it wasn't a game CD, just a code to download the game. That would be fine so far, but you're forced to install Steam in order to play it at all, which is outrageous. Since then, the computer has been constantly hanging up, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails because of the battery life.
I had been really looking forward to the clock. Design and optics great, news etc were displayed without any problems. Service worked well.    and yet I'll send them back in. Drr big hook: the battery and its runtime Charged in the evening, placed only on drm cabinet overnight and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. I received a lot of messages during the day, the battery was already at the end of the day/early afternoon and then you can't even read the time again. Therefore, for not being usable of me. Sorry.
Noble case with limitations.
For the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+, you should definitely get a case for yourself. I recently liked cases in which you can also insert your credit card. So that's what the shell is talking about here. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it will be too much, then the lid will be a bit high. One is enough for me to have. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well-made. She looks noble. In contrast to many other cases, the phone is embedded all around, only savings from the connections are made. Otherwise, you can operate on-off switches and volume controls on the sides well through the case. Disadvantage is that on some QI chargers, it is not possible to charge the phone due to the thickness of the case. Even with the leather-lined QI station of TORRO, it doesn't work even for TORRO. Accessories - such as the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged if the case is off. Otherwise really chic and well-made
high quality case with bulletproof glass film
Robust case with a real bulletproof glass as protection for the screen in a classic design offers all-round protection for the entire iPhone 11 11. Fits very well and is easy to put on, too. The material is comfortable to hold on and does not cause dirt. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good value for money. This case gives the phone some grip. It's not too bulky and fits snugly on the phone, not too tightly. Overall a good buy.

Persistent cellular microchimerism may play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma( SSc) .
Microchimerism arises from the transport of fetal cells across the placenta during pregnancy into the maternal circulation and their survival due to extensive HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in the maternal circulation and of fetal cells in the affected skin tissue was detected in the form of Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences.
Persistent microchimerism could trigger SSc in certain patients via a fetoantimaternal graft-versus-host-like reaction.

Still's disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease does not begin until adulthood, which is then referred to as Still's disease with onset in adulthood ( "adult onset Still's disease") .
Diagnostic criteria include characteristic exanthema, joint symptoms, fever flare-ups and leukocytosis, as well as liver dysfunction, sore throat without detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen and lack of titers for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two adult patients who had been ill for a long time and whose skin symptoms led us to the diagnosis of Still's disease.
The exanthema of the M. Still is a symptom of high sensitivity.
It manifests itself in red, sharply defined maculae, which are very transient.
Slight friction can trigger erythematous Köbner phenomena in the exanthema flare-up, which, as we describe here for the first time, sometimes persist longer than the rest of the exanthema.

The assessment of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnostics in dermatohistopathology.
Uniform and reproducible histological criteria are required for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma or melanocytic nevus that can be considered for differential diagnosis.
In the case of malignant melanoma, the prognostically relevant tumor parameters that are important for the therapeutic procedure must be recorded completely and uniformly in the histopathological report of the findings.
The recommendations of the working group on histopathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma are summarized below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in immunocompromised children pose a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective therapy and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
The cause is infections with a variety of pathogens, in addition to the usual bacterial pathogens, Pneumocystis carinii( Pc), cytomegaloviruses( CMV), fungi, tubercle bacteria and respiratory viruses are in the foreground.
In 25-30% of cases, however, the respiratory symptoms are based on non-infectious causes.
Medical history, lung X-rays and blood tests are often of little help in making a diagnosis.
Often, however, the analysis of material from the respiratory tract leads to the diagnosis:
Nasopharyngeal secretion, sputum( possibly) . induced by saline inhalation) and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage results in 60-80% diagnostic clarification, the remaining cases must be diagnosed by a mostly open lung biopsy, if the clinic is appropriate, by a mostly open lung biopsy.
Affected are predominantly younger to middle-aged women.
In the German-speaking world, this clinical picture has not yet been mentioned in the literature.

IMDE is probably a special disease from the group of elastolytic diseases, in which immunological mechanisms in etiopathogenesis can be discussed.
Using the pre- and postoperative computed tomograms ( CT) of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures supplied by USS ( universal spine system), we performed a planimetric evaluation of the spinal canal by means of a planimetric evaluation of the spinal canal.
Our aim was to check the efficiency of the direct reduction of stenosing trailing edge fragments performed under intraoperative sonographic control.
51%) than in the cases without neurological disorders( reduction of ASP: ASP:
The spinal canal is wider below L 1 than between Th 11 and L 1 and thus tolerates greater narrowing.
In the case of fractures without neurological deficits, fragment reduction promises to prevent late damage to the spinal cord in the sense of myelopathy and spinal claudication.
A preliminary examination should clarify whether there are indications of ultrasound analgesia depending on the prescribed power density ( LD) in patients with non-radicular back pain under serial application.
An overview of the existing literature shows that complicated mandibular fractures that are difficult to replace have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, while simple and only slightly dislocated fractures in the distal portion of the mandible can also be successfully treated using monocortical miniplate osteosynthesis.
The collection of preoperative and intraoperative parameters, which describe the character of a mandibular fracture and additively form a ranking value for the classification of a trauma, seems to be groundbreaking for a suitable differential indication between both therapy concepts.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - such as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations for describing a mandibular trauma that all studies conducted to date with their small number of cases can at best provide a rough differential indication.
As long as there is no prospective multicenter study available that could provide a decision-making aid in the choice of osteosynthesis procedure, preference should be given to functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications in the flowing range between "simple" and "difficult" fracture.
Comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic method that enables the comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and underrepresentations of DNA segments.
In order to be able to make quantitative and reproducible statements about the genetic aberrations, software has been developed that enables the objective recording of the location and type of changes.
The result is presented in the form of a CGH cumulative karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these investigations is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype on the basis of cumulative karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Surgical interventions can be precisely planned and simulated with the help of three-dimensional ( 3D) reconstructions of the anatomical bony structures, created from a patient's tomography data, and precisely planned and simulated.
Computer-aided navigation systems or robotic systems can provide assistance in the intraoperative implementation of the previously planned as well as in spatial orientation in the surgical site.
After successful centralization of laboratory analysis for more than 30 years, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in undiluted whole blood and the reduction in the size of laboratory analyses are increasingly leading to a renewed re-dezentralation in laboratory medicine today.
Point-of-care testing ( POCT) is performed close to the patient outside of centralized or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT are faster turn-around times ( TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and transport problems, and the need for only small sample quantities.
While these benefits are often highlighted, they are not accompanied by a clear clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT such as improper handling and/or maintenance of the analytical equipment by untrained station personnel, lack of or lack of calibration and/or quality control, costs of maintaining multiple instruments and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation and difficult comparability between POCT results and routine laboratory results, are also apparently obvious.
In the opinion of the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should only be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians in order to ensure meaningfulness and high quality of the analyses.
Taking into account the local situation( 24 h central laboratory, etc.) . ) should the parameter spectrum of POCT be strictly limited to vital functions.
The necessary analytes for this should be:
Hemoglobin or Hematocrit, Activated Whole Blood Clotting Time, Blood Gases, Sodium, Potassium, Ionized Calcium, Glucose, Ammonia and Lactate.
The concept of controlling invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures by MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
Adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety aspects are prerequisites.
Fast and ultrafast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast agents and thermosensitive contrast agents are discussed.
Clinical applications range from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MR tomography is still in its very early stages of development.
MR tomography may be of considerable importance in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
Characteristic skeletal changes occur in patients with chronic renal failure.
The aim of the present investigations was to completely record the bone mass changes of the spine during long-term hemodialysis of C2- L5 from C2- L5.
From 9 autopsy cases with a dialysis duration of 4 to 15 years, spines were completely examined.
With a newly developed preparation technique, the combined two- and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that in addition to the histological image, the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed directly in addition to the histological image.
Quantitatively evaluated were vertebral body heights( SDI), bone volume( BV/ TV) and intertrabecular linkage( TBPf) .
The" spine deformity index"( SDI) shows vertebral fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy( ROP), despite a trabecular bone volume( BV/ TV) in the normal range.
BV/ TV shows a distribution over the spine known from the skeletal healthy control collective.
However, the plateau-like curve decreasing from the cervical to the lumbar spine is 5% lower for the ROP for the ROP.
The BV/TV of the 2nd. LWK is between 51.2% and 74.1% of the value measured in the corresponding iliac crest biopsy.
The cases with prolonged haemodialysis have higher BV/ TV scores regardless of age and gender, BV/ TV scores.
Normal BV/ TV is not synonymous with physiological cross-linking of the cancellous bone and functional statics.
The three-dimensional analysis in ROP reveals a much stronger restructuring of the architecture compared to the controls than can be deduced on the 2-D sectional planes and the trabecular bone volumes.
The findings underline the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and thus functional cancellous architecture in patients on chronic hemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described for the first time a form of inguinal hernia that did not correspond to what was previously known due to its disease course as well as the sectional findings made by Littré himself.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this bulging of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, the judge described the intestinal wall fracture in a scientific paper on "fractures" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity "Richter-Littré hernia" in German-speaking countries.
On the basis of a case report, the historical reappraisal of this form of hernia takes place.
Asperger's syndrome is an autistic disorder that was first described by Hans Asperger in 1944, but received little attention in the following decades.
It was not until the 80s that the clinical picture received increasing attention and was only included as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 in 1988 and in the DSM-IV in 1994 as a diagnosis.
The cause of the disorder is unclear.
A patient with the typical characteristics of Asperger's syndrome is presented, in whom epilepsy and internal abnormalities existed at the same time.
Possible concomitant diseases of Asperger's syndrome such as epilepsy are discussed in addition to the diagnostic criteria and the therapeutic procedure.
Yersinia infections in childhood usually manifest as febrile gastroenteritis or pseudoappendicitis in childhood.
A child is reported in whom Yersinia infection manifested as tumor-like lymphadenitis localized in the mesenteric root with long-lasting persistence.
The diagnosis was made by the repeated detection of specific antibodies against various outer Yersinia membrane proteins.
Only after therapy with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks did all clinical findings normalize after treatment with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks.
The use of pulse oximetry in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively investigated under 23 preclinical resuscitation procedures.
The questions which conclusions can be drawn from the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation and which consequences result from these findings were investigated.
The investigation shows that pulse oximetry appears to be suitable for quality control of the resuscitation measures carried out in a high percentage.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure during resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death ( SID) .
This also applies if an autopsy could not clarify the cause of death.
A wealth of scientific data was presented at this workshop, highlighting the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year-old female patient, signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumptive coagulopathy and fever developed in the early postoperative phase after vaginal hysterectomy, followed by septic shock.
Staphylococcus epidermidis was also detected in this autologous blood reserve, and Propionibacterium acnes in the second.
The source of contamination of the canned food was not identifiable.
It turns out that autologous hemotherapy also carries a risk of infection that should not be underestimated and that the retransfusion of autologous blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of a severe infection caused by Candida albicans.
We describe a mature newborn with VACTERL association who developed fungal bezoars in the renal pelvis after candidasepsis, leading to hydronephrosis with onset of postrenal renal failure.
Normalization of excretory function occurred with antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine and direct irrigation with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy.
With increasing frequency of systemic Candida infections, especially in neonatology, the possibility of bezoar formation should also be considered as a differential diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in order to be able to initiate early and effective therapy.
High-dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method for the treatment of acute exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
In the meantime, it has been shown that some patients do not respond to this therapy, or respond only inadequately to this therapy.
In the present retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 responders or 20 responders were analyzed, respectively, in the present retrospective study. Compare non-responders.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to the following parameters:
Skin type, minimum erythema dose, single doses and cumulative doses of UVA1, peripheral blood eosinophils, peripheral blood eosinophils.
On the other hand, the non-responders showed a significantly increased atopy score, increased titers of total IgE and specific IgE compared to the responders.
In addition, the non-responders showed comparatively more frequent colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and of the intestine with Candida albicans.
These findings show that high-dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterized on the one hand by a particularly severe atopy syndrome and on the other hand by complicating superinfections.
The latter finding suggests that these patients may benefit from a combination of high-dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal treatment.
Lupus erythematosus profundus is a rare variant of lupus erythematosus.
On the basis of two typical case studies, the association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus is shown.
Clinically, subcutaneous nodular and plate-like infiltrates are present, which can lead to ulceration and scarring retraction.
Histologically, lobular panniculitis is found.
A positive direct immunofluorescence examination( lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM and complement components at the dermo-epidermal border and the vessels is also considered a further diagnostic indication.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology are of particular importance, as lupus erythematosus profundus can precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Clinical and morphological findings are reported in an 81-year-old female patient with many years of chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that has existed for more than 45 years.
The patient died under the clinical signs of a cardiac low-output syndrome as a result of a vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy confirmed by autopsy and toxicological analyses.
The pathogenesis as well as the morphological and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
In the last 5-7 years, there has been intense research interest in the mechanisms of atrial fibrillation and the development of new treatment options for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapeutic methods is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This review summarizes the results of experimental and clinical studies regarding the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse shapes for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of scientific progress in medicine, more and more patients with pre-existing conditions, old age, restricted cardiac pump function, after previous heart surgery and under emergency conditions are being operated on under emergency conditions.
This requires risk stratification, which divides the surgical risk into "low", "medium" and "high" flt.
A distinction can be made between preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative patient, structural and treatment-related factors.
On the basis of this prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized through individually tailored, pre-, intra- and postoperative, multi-professional and interdisciplinary management.
Patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumors, v. a Spinaliomas and basal cell carcinomas.
We report on a 65-year-old female patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, one spinalioma, and one lymph node metastasis from a malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by complementation analysis, which resulted in an assignment to complementation group D.
Occasionally, patients with malignancies of the breast, thoracic wall and/or abdominal wall that have not been treated for years and have in the meantime been exulcerated present plastic surgeons with the need for large defect coverage after tumor resection has been carried out.
By using silver-containing activated carbon fleece ( Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer pads ( Allevyn), an infection could be avoided after flank replacement with omentumplasty as part of the resection of an extensive basal cell carcinoma.
After secondary mesh graft coverage, fibrosis and calcification of the omentum resulted in a stable trunk wall even without the use of plastic mesh.
The 2000 health care reform in Germany does little to change the structural deficits of the German health care system.
The quarters of hospitals for inpatient care and of contract doctors for outpatient care will not be touched.
Hospital budgeting will remain.
In the future, mandatory catalogs will be specified for outpatient operations that may not be performed on an inpatient basis.
The obligation to ensure quality assurance will be specified and tightened.
A new DRG-based pricing system will be introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multiple organ failure represents a complex immunological process which is influenced by local and systemic pro-inflammatory stimuli, occurs system-wide and whose activity is only minimally reflected in the amounts of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis involves the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is enhanced by activation of intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B ( NF-B), which induces synthesis of mRNA coding for many of the pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-, IL-8, and inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause parallel activation of the heat shock protein( hsp) cascade, which inhibits the activation of NF-B in and minimizes the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes appears to control cellular immunoreactivity, both locally and system-wide, in both cases.
Characterizing this immune reactivity may ultimately help to better understand the determinants of the inflammatory response and potential immunotherapy.
Symptoms of odontogenic tumors are usually nonspecific.
Radiologically, often only whitening in the bone, sometimes also isolated or diffuse radioopacities can be detected.
Root tip resorption may be another important finding.
After a brief historical outline, a short report on the current state of knowledge is given for each individual type, building on the currently valid WHO classification, on the current state of knowledge.
The therapy concept valid today is then developed from this, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent and non-recurrent tumors.
Generalized cheerfulness disorder ( GHKS) is a mental illness that is often recognized at a late stage and is characterized by a uniformity of mental experience in the face of circumstances that normally cause depressive mood, despair, great fear, self-accusations or aggression directed against others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of the person concerned and prevent adverse individual and social long-term consequences.
Acute purulent meningitis is still a life-threatening disease that requires rapid diagnosis with immediate therapy.
Despite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a therapy regimen that specifically intervenes in the pathogenesis of inflammation is able to minimize neurological consequential damage and preserve the patient's life.
This article presents the current state of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy with special attention to molecular pathophysiological processes in inflammation of the CNS.
Die CT mit multiplanarer Rekonstruktion des Kiefers ( Dental-CT/ Denta-Scan) ist die Methode der Wahl zur radiologischen Untersuchung der Mandibula und Maxilla.
It is particularly helpful in distinguishing bony lesions from adjacent anatomical structures.
Therefore, this technique allows a precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique allows accurate characterization of pathologies, including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions, including infectious, metabolic, congenital and neoplastic lesions.
In ignorance of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis( IC), causal treatment is currently a causal treatment. not possible.
The majority of the currently available studies on oral IC therapy have not been randomized, double-blind or placebo-controlled and therefore do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
To date, therefore, there is no uniform standard for oral therapy of IC.
We report on a 39-year-old Turkish man who developed multiple verrucous papules on his back after a severe sunburn.
Clinic and histopathology show the typical picture of disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin lesions and are clinically similar to dyskeratosis follicularis Darier, seborrheic keratoses, or plane warts.
Ultrastructurally, keratinocytes show premature and defective cornification.
Epidermolytic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin lesions and must be distinguished from severe, congenital keratinization disorders that show the same histological phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
Today, to reduce intra- and postoperative blood loss, antifibrinolytically active substances are frequently used in cardioanesthesia during procedures with extracorporeal circulation ( EKZ) .
At the same time, however, there are concerns about their potential to trigger thrombotic complications.
Therefore, the present study aimed to compare the efficacy of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery under ECCs.
The imaging diagnosis of manubriosternal joint arthritis in the context of psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient is described.
Involvement of the manubriosteranl joint( sternal synchondrosis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional X-ray diagnostics and arthrosonography of manubriosternal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
In the period from January 1994 to June 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy for endophthalmitis at Leipzig University Eye Clinic due to endophthalmitis.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first patient group of the" Endophthalmitis vitrectomy study" in the first group of patients.
In this retrospective work, the functional results of the surgical treatment should be examined.
Heinrich Heine experienced the episode of a Pseudologia phantastica in his childhood.
The determinants of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this thesis.
The efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late forms of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis as well as the therapeutic effect depending on the characteristic HLA B27 will be examined.
In the present study, the medical history of a patient with since the age of 14 is analyzed. Year of life of existing severe obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
It is not an independent obsessive-compulsive disorder, but a schizophrenia masked by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
Under the therapy of the in the 31st. Age-exacerbating schizophrenic symptoms with clozapine are found in the one-year history of neither psychotic symptoms nor any significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
While the literature increasingly refers to obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication, mostly in the indication area of chronic schizophrenic psychosis, the rare case of obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenia improved by clozapine is described here - as far as the author is aware - the rare case of obsessive-compulsive symptoms improved by clozapine in schizophrenia is described here - as far as the author is aware - the rare case of obsessive-compulsive symptoms improved by clozapine.
The importance of the differential diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive phenomena for an adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed using the example of the individual case.
An isomorphic stimulus effect( Koebner phenomenon) is a disease-specific skin reaction to non-specific skin stimuli.
The triggering of such a Koebner phenomenon in a 32-year-old psoriasis patient by UV-B light testing with intensities above 0.055 J/cm2 is reported.
Furthermore, the case of a 28-year-old patient is described, in whom new psoriasis foci developed in the viral efflorescence after a varicella infection in the viral efflorescence.
Since the person concerned was planning a stay abroad in Africa for several months, a detailed medical history, clinical and laboratory tests were carried out.
The presentation was made to rule out an oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to develop such a disease according to genetic risk factors, and to ask whether rheumatoid factors can occur as a vaccination reaction;
Initial experience and results with 13 single-stage reconstructions of large complex defects in the head and neck region with 8 microvascular anastomosed forearm grafts and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major island flaps are reported.
Complete flap losses did not occur in any case.
Better functional and aesthetic results were obtained with the free forearm graft, but the operative times required for the reconstruction were relatively long.
Disadvantages of the pectoralis major flap are, above all, poor modeling and a limited radius of rotation.
It has been used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular graft would have been associated with a greater risk due to local and general problems.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli that can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically leads to an activation of endothelial cells in the dermal vessels, which is characterized by an increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This enables the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
While up to now the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines has primarily been regarded as a prerequisite for the development of inflammatory reactions, there have recently been indications that exogenous factors can put endothelial cells into an inflammatory state even without the mediation of cytokines, exogenous factors can put endothelial cells into an inflammatory state even without the mediation of cytokines.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Thus, endothelial cells are not only subject to the control of tissue-specific mediators( cytokines, biogenic amines u. a ), but their function can also be directly influenced by external skin stimuli.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, especially after combined cataract/glaucoma surgery, are an indication for the local administration of rTPA.
We report our findings.
A case of the benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node described for the first time 5 years ago and not yet documented in German literature is presented ( synonym: synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
In addition to the structure of palisade-like myofibroblastic cells ( with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin) arranged in sections to the periphery, their diagnostic criteria include accentuated hemorrhagic zones and the occurrence of characteristic amianthoid structures ( "amianthoid fibers"), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense network of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumor entity is important for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasms.
Due to the increased strength of 2 parallel inner splints, obstruction and kinking could be reduced and a regression of the congestion of the proximal hollow system could be achieved.
Furthermore, in addition to the flow of urine within the splints, this technique allows an increased flow between the splints, which is considered a crucial mechanism of urine passage in lying ureteral splints.
In cases of extrinsic ureteral compression in which the insertion of a singular inner splint does not result in sufficient regression of ectasia of the upstream intra- and extrarenal cavity system, simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral internal double-J ureteral splints should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication therapeutic alternative that may save some patients the insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive measures.
Of the so-called intervertebral discs available for the treatment of lumbar herniated discs, which are available for the treatment of lumbar herniated discs. minimally invasive procedures( percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/ APLD/ laser decompression/ chemonucleolysis) represent the intradiscal application of chemopapain the method with the longest clinical application duration and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful attention to the indication and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis enables an efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
To investigate in a prospective study the value of diuresis sonography compared to the diuresis ephrogram( " gold standard") in children with urinary transport disorder.
Today, micrographic surgery is an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basal cell carcinomas.
The method has been further developed and modified over the past 20 years.
There are currently three variations to choose from:
All three methods have the same goal:
radical tumor removal while sparing the unaffected surrounding tissue.
However, they exhibit substantial differences with regard to the technique of tumor excision, the consolidation of histological sections and the histological preparation evaluation.
A methodological review is made and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency period between primary trauma and malignant transformation is approximately 30 years.
The" Marjolin ulcer" is characterized by a more aggressive behavior towards other squamous cell carcinomas.
In a case of a 65-year-old patient with the lesion on the back of the right hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report on the combined radiation and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after correspondingly wide local excision was treated with a retrograde pedicled A. Radial valves covered.
Opioids close to the spinal cord cause good analgesia in a wide variety of surgical and non-surgical pain conditions.
There are fewer central and systemic side effects than with epidural administration of local anesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique as well as the combination of opioids and local anesthetics in postoperative pain therapy is presented, also in the context of patient-controlled epidural on-demand analgesia ( PCA, "patient-controlled analgesia") .
The intrathecal mode of administration is said to have various advantages over the epidural mode.
A variety of factors play a role in the choice of opioid.
It appears that the neurotoxicity of opioids depends on different forms of administration.
In terms of quality of analgesia, serious side effects, amount of opioid administered, or postoperative lung function, there is no clinical advantage of thoracic over lumbar injection.
There are indications that the type of pain therapy has a significant influence on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and/or opioids is the method of first choice for patients with a high preoperative risk and at the same time cost-effective and effective.
Through the cooperation of the German Contact Dermatitis Group ( DKG) with the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics ( IVDK), the results of standardized epicutaneous tests at the participating centers are recorded centrally in Germany.
For the present study, data from 24 clinics ( 19678 patients) were retrospectively evaluated separately for 1995 and 1996, respectively, in 24 clinics ( 19678 patients) .
In descending order, nickel, fragrance mix, Peru balsam and thiomersal showed the most frequent reactions;
For 1995, differentiated allergen lists were also compiled for defined patient groups ( by gender, age, eczema localization, geographical region, occupation, sensitization) and special questions.
In percentage terms, there were strikingly fewer positive reactions to nickel, fragrance mix and balsam of Peru in men than in women.
Younger patients reacted more frequently to thiomersal, and older patients to medical externals.
Medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema, while occupational allergens were found more frequently in hand eczema patients.
Nickel and fragrance mix allergy sufferers had higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens compared to the overall population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not recognizable.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve the quality of the diagnosis and prophylaxis of contact allergies.
At about 95% of all people with M. people who have been infected( who have come into contact) do not openly cause the disease to break out.
The clinical presentation is determined not so much by the direct effects of the bacterial infection as by the T-cell mediated immune response.
This review article takes into account current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment and diagnosis of leprosy.
Recently, a large number of studies on the quantitative investigation of the tyndall phenomenon in aqueous humor using laser tyndallometry have been presented.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of the BKS in comparison to the Tyndall intensity in the KW in uveitides of different localization, it should be investigated by way of example to what extent the Tyndall increase is actually caused by a BKS disorder in each case.
The present experimental study investigates the influence of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator, and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E on the neurological deficit after incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
The attempt to treat nerve defects with so-called nerve defects. Bridging nerve prostheses has failed to this day.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglactides, capractones and other polyglactin-containing substances has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The pronounced defense reaction against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units, which are absolutely necessary for the regeneration of neurites.
Positive animal experimental results do not stand up to clinical scrutiny, as inferior regeneration performance can occur in animal experiments despite an impeded regeneration pathway.
Morbidity caused by acute and chronic genital infections and their long-term effects is the greatest gynecological risk for HIV-infected women.
Two-thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of genitourinary infections, and one-third developed cervical dysplasia.
In a quarter, chronic complaints and long-term effects of ascending genital infections occurred during the course of ascent genital infections.
Although the increased incidence of cervical cancer ( up to 5%) has been included in the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other opportunistic infections typical of AIDS, but it usually occurs before the actual symptoms.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea( 17%) or hypermenorrhea were observed more frequently.
Complications in pregnancy are mainly premature labor( up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, premature birth, depending on the social structure.
Progression of maternal HIV infection through pregnancy has not been observed.
Risks for peripartum transmission of infection to the fetus include advanced maternal HIV infection with high HIV RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia and CD4+ cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with delivery such as preterm birth, preterm labor, amniotic infection, duration of rupture and labor, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood contaminated with amniotic fluid.
These risks of an increased maternofetal HIV-1 transmission rate can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis ( 6-8%), primary low-contamination cesarean delivery ( 4-6%) and most successfully by primary sectio and simultaneous prepartum, intrapartum, and postnatal administration of AZT ( < 2%) avoid.
Dendritic cells play a central role in the initialization of the immune response because they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system that can activate T lymphocytes via the MHC receptor.
Initial clinical studies in patients with therapy-resistant melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells sensitized in vitro with tumor antigen can be successfully used in vivo for immunotherapy in vivo.
Since hardly any basic data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in tumor tissue and their function are known for laryngeal carcinoma, the localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and glottis, was investigated immunohistologically in the present study.
The results show that, in contrast to T lymphocytes, dendritic cells are mainly detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
A comparison with the clinical parameters shows that the patients in whom the number of dendritic cells in the carcinoma was low( < 100/ cells/ mm2) had the lowest postoperative survival time( 1 year) .
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma is a favorable prognostic factor of the disease.
Elevated homocysteine is considered a major factor in the increased incidence of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic renal insufficiency.
In the present study, in addition to homocysteine, the metabolites of its two degradation pathways transulfuration( formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation( formation of methionine, methyl malonate and 2-methyl citrate) were determined in patients with renal insufficiency.
We report 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The suspected diagnosis is based on cat scratches in the history and the typical findings with lymph node swelling in the area of the primary lesion.
In order to gain an insight into the frequency and clinic of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of the patients cared for in 1984-94 at a university polyclinic or university polyclinic. a dermatologist's practice on the basis of patient files and, in some cases, follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was then 0.05% of cold urticaria.
Of a total of 56 affected patients( 31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
The mean age was 41.0+/- 15.6 years, the mean disease duration 7.9+/- 5.8 years, and the mean disease duration was 7.9+/- 5.8 years.
46.4% of patients had atopy, 23.2% suffered from other forms of urticaria( cholingeric, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic and heat-induced urticaria) .
Laboratory tests were positive only in isolated cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with mostly only moderate symptomatic improvement.
During treatment with antibiotics( penicillin 1-2 million IU/ d for 2-4 weeks, n= 18 or 18, respectively, respectively) . Tetracycline 2 g/ d for 2 weeks, n= 10) was completely remission in 13 patients and an improvement was achieved in 8 patients.
Spontaneous remission occurred in 20 of the symptomatic patients( 46.5%) over a 6.5-year follow-up period.
The surprisingly good treatment successes using antibiotic therapy underline the need for further clarification of the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
Summary The case of a 56-year-old female patient who presented primarily with lumbalgia is reported.
Laboratory chemistry, radiology and histopathology were primarily suggestive of the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebra, dorsoventral stabilization was performed.
In the repeatedly obtained sample excisions, histologically the picture of a non-specific inflammation was found histologically.
It was only during the biopsy performed during implant removal that a highly malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could be detected histologically.
Chemotherapy according to the CHOP scheme and radiotherapeutic treatment were performed.
Lymphomas of the spine should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, especially in progressive courses, as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex( NEO fractures) are associated with midface fractures and/or fractures of the frontobase in over 90% of cases.
Accompanying skull base fractures run in up to 70% of cases through the roof of the ethmoidal cells or ethmoidal cells. of the Lamina cribrosa.
Different concepts exist for the treatment of isolated NEO fractures as well as combined NEO and skull base fractures in midface fractures.
In the period 1990-1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Clinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Lucerne Cantonal Hospital.
In the remaining 25 patients with NEO and midface fractures without skull base involvement, reduction and treatment were performed via a subcranial access route.
47 patients could be followed up for up to 4 years and their data evaluated.
The Lucerne therapy concept for the extra- and transcranial treatment of fractures of the ethmoid bone involving the base of the skull and the midface is presented.
however, it is associated with a high risk of bleeding intra- and postoperatively.
In an obese 50-year-old female patient with familial hypophosphatasia and V. a Phlebothrombosis should be treated surgically for a femoral neck fracture.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden drop in endtidal CO2 partial pressure, an increase in paCO2 and circulatory arrest.
Resuscitation measures with cardiac massage and intravenous administration of adrenaline and orciprenaline were initiated immediately.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was terminated with a temporary wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
It’ s on V. a Complex pulmonary embolism was performed with continued cardiac pressure massage by systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA.
After 21/4 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11/2 hours after the start of lysis, moderately stable hemodynamics could be achieved with continuous, highest-dose Katecholamine administration and volume substitution.
Massive transfusion was required as a result of lysis and loss coagulopathy.
It will be on the 28th. The day after resuscitation, the patient could be transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of "pulmonary embolism" was made on the basis of the clinic, capnometry, blood gas analysis and ECG.
Due to the emergency situation with ongoing resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were dispensed with.
During anesthesia with the new inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total amount administered is metabolized.
The extent of the resulting serum peak levels of inorganic fluoride is determined v. a the hepatic defluoridation rate, the total amount of anesthetic administered, and the solubility of the anesthetic gas are expressed by its blood-gas distribution coefficients.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies investigated whether fluoride exposure to sevoflurane could lead to increased renal complications.
However, neither in animal experiments, nor in routine clinical use or protracted anesthesia duration, nor when used in renal insufficient patients, could an increased renal hazard potential be demonstrated for fluoride exposure after sevoflurane.
The recently demonstrated low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane - in contrast to enflurane and especially methoxyflurane - is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 μmol/l, which has been used in the literature so far, was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane, but is not valid in connection with the anesthetic gases sevoflurane, but also enflurane and isoflurane, but is not valid in connection with the anesthetic gases sevoflurane, but also enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those in you. a After anesthesia with sevoflurane, it is therefore to be classified as clinically harmless.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence for direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
For the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease, the choice of macroscopic preparation method is of fundamental importance.
The best results are provided by the base-parallel lamination of the heart ventricles to be carried out after the fixation and the transverse lamination of the possibly later lamination of the heart ventricles. additionally decalcified coronary arteries, even if postmortem coronary angiography cannot precede it.
With this procedure, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, length, circumference and transmural extent of infarcts, their age and sequelae can be better detected and assigned to the respective coronary supply area than in the case of conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the blood flow, which is better.
On the coronary arteries, the degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenosis, plaque hemorrhages, parietal and occluding thromboses can be assessed intact, as can therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This procedure is particularly important in the case of acute cardiac death and territorial ischemia survived only briefly.
By systematically taking transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can also be detected in correlation with the coronary morphology and the coronary supply area.
However, recent prospective randomized studies show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy after R0 resection does not bring any additional survival benefit.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus as well as adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, esophagogastric junction and stomach have not yet been concluded.
In patients with potentially resectable tumors, several phase III studies did not show a convincing prognosis gain through preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy or combined radio/chemotherapy compared to resection alone.
However, a survival advantage with this multimodal approach can only be expected if the patient responds to the previous treatment and subsequent complete tumor resection.
Compared to preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radio-/chemotherapy improves the response rate, at least in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, but also leads to increased postoperative morbidity and lethality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should therefore only be carried out in the context of prospective studies on strictly selected patients in specialized centers with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This disease, which is unusual for children, is usually associated only with certain metabolic diseases.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders or" hysterical" symptom formation can be understood as processing traumatic childhood and adolescent experiences such as abuse or maltreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization, and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Memories of trauma that cannot be assimilated have a retraumatizing effect and must be warded off, for example through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-injurious behavior or social" acting" to them."
On this psychodynamic background, we present a trauma therapy that implements experiences of hypnotherapy and catathym- imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparation phase, a safe inner place and contact with inner helpers is created in the imagination in a resource-oriented way, as well as contact with inner helpers.
The actual trauma work consists of a dosed, stable confrontational, but as little retraumatizing introduction to the traumatic scenes as possible, followed by inner comfort and leaving oneself behind.
The final phase is again about the resource-oriented turn to creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record the developments at a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the last 20 years with regard to diagnoses and the proportion of multiple disabilities.
Chronic, benign intracranial hypertension can have a variety of causes.
In addition to the etiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women ( "pseudotumor cerebri"), venous outflow obstruction is possible as a cause of the outflow.
The extent to which visual acuity remains stable in the long term after vitrectomy in diabetic retinopathy was investigated, and which causes and risk factors for deterioration of visual acuity can be identified.
HIV is easily inactivated by the majority of disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the entrance gate.
After inoculation, HIV replication can start after 24 hours, and HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody tests can be used to detect the budding HIV infection within four to twelve weeks; under therapy, the antibody response is weakened;
with nucleic acid tests, detection succeeds approximately from the eleventh day onwards.
In almost 100 years of development, countless endogenous, exogenous and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the currently favored autologous tissues, the central patellar tendon has a quadruple tendon graft of the pes anserinus( M. M.) . semitendinosus/M. gracilis) and a central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.
With some restrictions, the use of cadaveric grafts is also justified.
The individual grafts have specific differences in terms of biomechanical properties, primary fixation and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical studies, a clear superiority of one of the mentioned grafts could not be verified.
When selecting a graft, the different anatomical and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments must be taken into account in graft selection.
In the treatment of complex ligament injuries and revision cases, careful, preoperative planning with, if necessary, preoperative planning is important with complex ligament injuries. Modified graft selection is required.
The rare course of development of myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the small salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
Over the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrence tumor developed 2 malignantly in the area of the left corner of the mouth.
The histological work-up showed a myoepithelial carcinoma of the small salivary glands, parts of a pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be detected.
The clinic, diagnostics, therapy and histological features in light of the literature are discussed.
Coronary calcium is an indication of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately with electron beam tomography.
The clinical significance differs depending on whether calcium screening is performed in patients with already known coronary artery disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically important aspect of coronary artery disease.
In this thesis, frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects, with regard to ergometry, are presented, as well as indications for prognostic evaluation and conclusions for practice.
We report 3 patients with a combination of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus ( IDDM) or 3 patients, respectively. Prediabetes.
In the 3 patients, the two diseases occurred in the context of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
In contrast, among about 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM, we did not observe any case of ITP.
Therefore, in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, other diseases of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II should be excluded.
Securing the airway after upper airway surgery can be problematic in certain patients.
Care must therefore be taken to ensure safe reintubation if necessary.
Two patients are reported to have relapsed due to a papillary thyroid carcinoma recurrence or recurrence, respectively. inoperable hypopharyngeal carcinomas have considerable intubation difficulties and thus high risk factors for intubation and, if necessary, intubation. Reintubation in general anesthesia was found in general anesthesia.
A fiber-optically placed endotracheal guide wire served as a post- or post- or post-tracheal guide wire. Preoperative Reintubationshilfe
Both CT and MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and staging of tumors of the larynx.
A very precise knowledge of the submucosal tumor spread pathways, diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration and their consequences for staging and therapy are indispensable for the interpretation of CT and MRI.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive examinations for the detection of neoplastic infiltration of preepiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottis and cartilage.
However, the specificity with both methods is less high than initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumor spread, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumor spread.
The very high negative predictive value of the two cross-sectional imaging methods is important from a clinical point of view, as it makes it possible to exclude neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucosal tumors, both CT and MRI provide valuable information on a possible etiology, extent of submucosal growth, and appropriate biopsy site.
Implantation of cardioverters/defibrillators( ICD) reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with end-stage renal disease have an increased incidence of coronary artery disease.
There are only a small number of cases of myocardial revascularization using PTCA in patients on chronic dialysis, which suggest a high periinterventional complication rate and a high restenosis rate overall.
We examined the rate of restenosis in 23 patients with end-stage renal failure ( 17 men, 6 women, mean age:
52.5+/- 18.3 years)) .
After primary successful PTCA, recoronary angiography was performed in all patients within 6-12 months.
Prior to angiographic control, 12 patients complained of recurrence of pectanginous complaints.
Laboratory tests showed that the patients had hypertriglyceridemia ( 265+/- 160 mg/dl) and hypercholesterolemia ( 258+/- 53 mg/dl) with a low HDL fraction ( 34+/- 14 mg/dl) with a significant increase in the fibrinogen concentration ( 481+/- 114 mg/dl) .
The case of a 64-year-old female patient is described, in whom complete instability of the pelvis developed within a year as a result of increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic rings as a result of increasing fatigue fractures.
A minor trauma to the pelvic area was retrospectively assumed to be the triggering event.
Due to the X-ray morphology of the multiple pseudoarthroses, the suspicion of a malignant event was the main focus of the differential diagnosis.
Hip pain in childhood can be caused by a wide range of different diseases.
The focus is on non-traumatic causes in the differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, medical history, clinic and laboratory parameters, an imaging diagnostic algorithm is designed in order to avoid unnecessary examinations on the one hand, and not to miss necessary therapeutic steps on the other hand.
Exemplary examples are used to demonstrate some common, but also rarer clinical pictures.
The iatrogenic termination of the greater trochanter in the prosthetic treatment of the femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg during prosthesis implantation from the so-called prosthesis. "Back access" could be predisposing.
In the few literature sources, early functional conservative treatment is recommended for the isolated traumatic trochanteric dislocation used here for comparison, even in the case of significant fragment dislocation, early functional conservative treatment is recommended.
The importance of patient satisfaction in psychotherapeutic care remains controversial.
The present work presents the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy and acceptance of therapeutic measures.
After an overview of different methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are examined in more detail using data from quality assurance.
Based on ZUF-8, relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, patients' further utilization behavior, and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship are examined.
This shows that the relationship between treatment outcomes and satisfaction is not particularly large.
In the further utilization behavior, dissatisfied patients differ from satisfied patients.
The relationship between satisfaction and the therapeutic working relationship is partly clear for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The effects found are very large in relative terms, but in absolute terms these effects are rather small.
This is v. a on the background that very few patients express dissatisfaction following their treatment.
Changes in male aging resemble changes in younger, hypogonadal males.
Although testosterone levels fall on average with age, correlations between middle-aged and older symptoms and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low, while testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
this kinda snuck up on u a with methodological limitations of existing studies, the high variability of testosterone levels with age, unclear reference values for older men and diverse influences ( health status and behavior) on testosterone levels together.
A 68-year-old patient with dyspnea that had existed for five days underwent sonography before the planned lysis therapy according to nuclear medicine evidence of stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
A right atrial floating thrombus was found.
In the presence of acute vital danger, ultra-high-dose streptokinase short-term lysis ( UHSK) was performed with 9 cases of acute vital danger. lmao its just me nvm 000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin initiated.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely resolved and the thrombosis of the leg had largely resolved.
The patients treated were predominantly male( 70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in traffic accidents.
A single fracture was identified in 50% of the patients, the remaining patients had either concomitant injuries or polytrauma.
Hospitalization time averaged 17 days and crutch use averaged 21 weeks, indicating a relatively rapid healing process.
In the majority( 85%), treatment was without complications.
Chronic post-traumatic osteitis developed in patients with an open fracture in 9( 1.8%) and in patients with closed fractures in only 2 cases( 0.4%), which is within the usual norms.
Based on our results and experience, we believe that the treatment of fractures of the femoral diaphysis with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared to other treatment methods.
The scope of remote metastasis diagnostics in head and neck tumors is still controversial.
In the present retrospective study, the courses of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract were used to investigate which factors influence the frequency and localization of distant metastasis.
A total of 130 patients( 12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 times( 1.6%) at the time of primary tumor diagnosis.
The rate of distant metastases correlated positively with the initial tumor stage( p< 0.001) as well as with the manifestation of a local and/or regional recurrence( p< 0.001) or a second tumor outside the ENT range( p< 0.0005) .
The parameters 'primary tumor localization' and 'histopathological tumor grading', on the other hand, had no independent predictive value, but essentially reflected different frequencies of tumor stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, the search for distant metastases in T1- 3 N0 tumors may be limited to an X-ray examination of the chest.
Further diagnostics, consisting of abdominal sonography, skeletal scintigraphy and/or computed tomography ( CT) of the thorax, is indicated for locoregionally advanced tumors, for recurrences and for second tumors outside the ENT range.
However, one should always ask oneself the question of the therapeutic consequences in individual cases.
This article provides a brief overview of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the 19th century. Century to our time.
Ernst Simmel belonged to a small circle of early psychoanalysts who worked with great enthusiasm and in "productive orthodoxy" for the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine.
Consequently, he founded the first psychoanalytic polyclinic in Berlin in 1919 and the first psychoanalytic hospital( " Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") in Germany in 1927 in 1927.
Rediscovering him as a pioneer can also be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of the most diverse historical divisions of the professional societies.
He is a credible professional identification figure across generations, especially for the new specialist in "psychotherapeutic medicine" .
Nevertheless, Simmel's emphasis should not lead to the fact that the approximately 60 other pioneers of psychotherapeutic medicine, who were forced to leave Germany because of their Jewish descent, are no longer duly remembered.
In principle, 4 post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be influenced by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip dislocations and subluxations, femoral head necrosis, pseudarthrosis, deformities.
The clinical, overview radiographic and computed tomographic/sonographic analysis of the leg geometry is of central importance here.
Given the diversity and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfectly tailored solution can be the answer to a completely individual problem.
The aim of the study was to meta-analytically review all available randomized controlled trials in which dexamethasone was used alone or in combination with other antiemetics for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative phase( PONV) .
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur as part of numerous systemic diseases.
In certain cases, subjective symptoms and vision-threatening complications can only be addressed in the long term through systemic immunosuppression.
Movement disorders of the vertebral joints lead to unilateral compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since the herniated disc occurs on the compression side in more than 80% of cases, a causal relationship can be assumed.
Since this disorder also reduces the size of the intervertebral foramen, the lack of space in the event of a herniated disc becomes even greater.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation, developed for malignant changes in the area of the head of the pancreas, is very extensive and burdened with high perioperative morbidity and lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the more organ-sparing duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for benign tumors of the pancreatic head.
This operation could be performed in patients in a blood-saving manner and with almost no complications.
At a median follow-up time of 3 years, 6 out of 7 patients were symptom-free, and one patient who was operated on for gastrinoma was found to have elevated gastrin levels late postoperatively.
Compared to preoperative functional testing, both endocrine and exocrine function were found to be only slightly impaired by surgery.
If the indication is strict, benign tumors in the area of the head of the pancreas can thus be adequately treated by duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection with sufficient radicality, few complications and no persistent restriction of exo- and endocrine functions.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable procedure in the treatment of symptomatic and/or prognostically significant bradycardic cardiac arrhythmias.
Approximately every sixth patient dies of sudden cardiac death after pacemaker implantation, which is predominantly attributable to the progression of the pre-existing underlying cardiac disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become clear that permanent electrical stimulation of the heart can pose the risk of triggering and/or aggravation of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
Especially with advanced myocardial damage, u can do it. a stimulation-related R-on-T phenomena, "short-long" sequences and perception defects z. B during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, stimulation-related secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias are triggered.
In view of the fact that such pacemaker-related events are an avoidable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding of the pathomechanisms involved and a corresponding awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable, but above all safer for the patient, but also, for the patient.
Das Staging, d. hm there we go determining the extent of the disease, serves for the selection of patients who are suitable for surgical therapy with curative objective or for surgical therapy. to define those carcinoma carriers that do not benefit from surgical intervention and are supplied with alternative forms of therapy ( chemotherapy, radiotherapy) .
Computed tomography( CT) of the thorax( including the liver and adrenal glands), ultrasonography of the upper abdomen and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiological examinations for staging bronchial carcinoma.
For specific questions, e.g. B which is after a chest wall infiltration and in patients with a contrast agent allergy, magnetic resonance imaging( MRI) can be performed in addition to or as an alternative to a CT scan.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as Positron emission tomography with [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ( FDG-PET) for the assessment of lymph nodes and distant metastases, in-111-octreotide/somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma, and thallium-201 SPECT, whose clinical significance is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly being used for staging lung tumors.
Methods that are still being tested in experimental studies, such as those currently being tested. B Genetic-molecular MRI contrast agents or nuclear medicine methods based on tumor receptors could play an important role in the staging of bronchus carcinoma in the future.
After tumor surgery in the abdomen, retroperitoneum and small pelvis, damage to the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs can occur.
Since these are often patients of sexually active and reproductive age, the prevention of such concomitant symptoms is of particular importance in tumor therapy.
Impairment of the erection or disorders of ejaculation can occur after surgical, radiotherapeutic or drug therapy of various tumors.
Through an in-depth understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now preventable in a high percentage.
If damage to the corresponding nerve pathways cannot be avoided due to the radical nature of the surgical intervention required to treat the tumor disease curatively, sexual dysfunctions are a significant restriction of the quality of life for these patients of sexually active and reproductive age.
However, both ejaculation disorders and erectile dysfunction can be treated by a number of therapy modalities in almost all cases.
The subclavian artery is increasingly used for arterial cannulation in extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known so far about the perfusion characteristics of the cervical vessels at different cannulation sites.
It is reported about a truck driver after crushing trauma to both legs who developed atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia( HIT) under drug thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin;
in addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with thrombocyte increase with positive antibody detection against heparin:
At our first patient contact on the 6th. The day after the accident, a deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and an impending compartment syndrome was also surgically split on the left lower leg.
After exclusion of possible other causes for these reactions, antibodies against heparin ( heparin platelet factor 4 complex detection) could be detected 2 days later.
Immediately after rinsing an intravenous access with less than 50 IU of an unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed the full picture of an anaphylactic reaction, which could be immediately broken by cortisone administration.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, which is otherwise characterized by HIT, is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction against heparin, which takes place on the cell surface of thrombocytes.
Accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the various forms of heparin allergy type I-IV.
Type I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without thrombocyte drop and type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
In 1991, basal cell adenocarcinoma is an entity in the 2 parts. The edition of the "Histological typing of salivary gland tumors" of the World Health Organization( WHO) has been recorded.
The first description is about Ellis u and I. Wiskovitch ( 1990) from the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology ( AFIP) .
This tumor entity makes approx. 2.9% of all malignant tumors of the salivary glands are from.
The Gl. parotis is the site of this tumor in 90% of cases.
Enoral manifestations are described only as casuistries;
The case presented here concerns a middle-aged woman with basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.
The therapy consists of surgical tumor extirpation with sufficient safety distance and histologically controlled tumor freedom of all resection margins.
According to current knowledge, basal cell adenocarcinoma is associated with a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenic metastasis rate of 10% up to 10 years after initial manifestation.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In the present work, a modified animal model of renal xenotransplantation was developed, in which the course of a hyperacute rejection reaction is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys as donor organs were transplanted to Wistar rats as recipients, with end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta, or end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta, respectively, or end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta, respectively. V. cava and ureteral drainage by means of splinting were used for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation using the soluble complement receptor type 1 ( sCR1) on renal xenografts.
A total of 24 xenotransplants were performed and randomized with 3 ml of 0.9% NaCl ( control group) or randomized, respectively. 50 mg/kg sCR1 treated as 3-ml-Bolus ( treatment group) .
Soluble complement receptor type 1 ( sCR1) was effective in prolonging graft survival ( from 10.5+/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity in the sCR1 group was observed, which is attributable to a modulatory effect of sCR1 as a result of sCR1s modulatory activity.
As early as 10 minutes after the start of reperfusion, histological evidence showed masses of platelet aggregates, fibrin deposits in the capillaries and interstitial infiltrates in the control group.
In contrast, the kidney transplants treated with sCR1 showed significantly reduced intravascular thrombus formation and lower interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistological study showed an equally reduced deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and in the interstitium in the therapy group.
To date, 52 laparoscopic procedures have been performed on the gallbladder, stomach, colon and inguinal hernia using the robotic arm for optical guidance controlled by the surgeon's voice.
The field of view is determined directly by commands from the surgeon.
In all interventions, the control of the robotic arm was precise, the speech recognition accurate, and without technical problems, without any technical problems.
29 interventions could be performed by one surgeon alone as "solo surgery" .
In a further 20 procedures, in addition to the surgeon, only one assistant was used.
The robot can be used easily and successfully by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room without any problems.
The clarification of vascular complications by DSA in kidney and pancreas transplants requires invasive intervention in vessels that are usually diabetic, and the use of iodine-containing contrast agents can show nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis should be included in differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated on the basis of a case of coxitis tuberculosa, which was treated in cooperation between the trauma surgery department and the medical department of the Minden Clinic.
A differentiated diagnostic procedure with imaging and microbiological methods allows a targeted planning and implementation of a combined therapy consisting of surgical endoprosthetic hip replacement and antituberculous chemotherapy.
After a critical evaluation of the therapy result and discussion of the literature, the presented procedure is successful, both with regard to the local remediation of the infection and with regard to the functional outcome, and with regard to the local remediation of the infection.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce the quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for the safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intensive research.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective non-pharmacological treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding to date regarding the mechanisms underlying the procedure.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using modern optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization that favor disruption of the wavefronts underlying atrial fibrillation.
The mechanisms of atrial cardioversion thus appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether cardioversion mechanisms in chronic atrial fibrillation differ from those in acute atrial fibrillation.
Neurological complications of clavicle fractures are rare.
They occur as primary, more often as secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with narrowing of the kostoclavicular space.
Casuistically, the observation of a late lesion of the brachial plexus as a result of a clavicle fracture with pseudarthrosis and excessive callus formation is reported.
Type I diabetes mellitus is one of the autoimmune diseases and often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases.
The subject of our investigations was to determine the coincidence of celiac disease and type I diabetes in the hospital of the Diabetes Outpatient Clinic of the Children's Clinic of the TU Dresden.
A granulomatous inflammatory reaction is reported after the use of absorbable interference screws for fixation of a patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament replacement surgery, which led to a spontaneous fracture of the tibia.
Radiologically, osteolysis was found in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was sterile inflammation with evidence of foreign body giant cells.
Primary plasmacytomas of the kidney represent a great rarity.
To date, only 6 clinical cases have been described in the literature.
A 64-year-old patient is presented, in whom an operated kidney tumor turned out to be a plasmacytoma histologically.
Based on this case, the procedure for this disease is discussed.
In multiple myeloma with kidney involvement, nephrectomy is indicated only for renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary kidney involvement by plasmacytoma is unclear.
In a multicentre, prospective, clinical study from 17 German clinics, 646 documented distal radius fractures in adults were found to have a treatment indication or treatment indication corresponding to the fracture type, respectively. a suitable therapy method was chosen.
The success of the primary treatment was evaluated by establishing a practice-related score.
To date, numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases are known to follow the pattern of Blaschko lines.
In 1992, Moulin et al. described.
[ 40] 5 patients with an acquired striped, atrophic and pigmented skin disease, which he identified as a new entity.
We report on another patient with this dermatosis.
The main criteria are strip-shaped skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without a previous inflammatory stage and without subsequent sclerotherapy or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of Blaschko lines.
We propose the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this disease.
It includes rules of conduct and, to improve the muscular situation, a special exercise program that can also be carried out safely as home training, also safely as home training.
In a group instruction, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained by practicing simple movement sequences and basic knowledge of anatomy, arthrosis development and knee-friendly and relieving behaviors is imparted.
The efficiency of the" knee school" as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis was proven in a prospective randomized study.
Correct alignment and size of the implants are of paramount importance for successful and permanent knee replacement.
The effects of the individual components on the femoropatellar joint section are presented.
In the context of the Erlangen glaucoma study, the blue-on-yellow VEP has been shown to be suitable for separating confirmed patients from confirmed controls.
As part of a retrospective analysis of air rescue, the out-of-hospital first aid of 274 acutely injured( 58%) or acutely injured( 58%) was initially performed, respectively. ill( 42%) children up to the age of 14 ( 14) . Year of life with regard to the temporal occurrence of the interventions, compliance with the assistance period, age and gender distribution, severity, the causes of trauma and injury patterns, the type of acute pediatric disease, the pre-hospital emergency diagnostics and therapy as well as the means of transport and the target clinic on the basis of the emergency medical documentation examined.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Orthopaedic University Hospital Mainz has reviewed the clinical pictures in which low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy can be used sensibly.
The composition of the bone marrow changes with age, but also with pathological processes.
As a basis for the interpretation of patient examinations in diseases of the hematopoietic system, the age- and sex-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow space were analyzed in subjects in the present study.
Therapy control is currently not possible for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and post-cardioversion condition due to atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, patients without an actual tendency to recurrence are sometimes unnecessarily exposed to an antiarrhythmic therapy regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic side effects.
A mandatory prerequisite for P-wave analysis under sinus rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
P-wave triggering must take place, the filtering of the P-wave must be carried out bidirectionally or with an FIR filter.
Standardization of the method is highly desirable.
In fact, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in P wave duration from patients without this arrhythmia.
Sotalol as a class III antiarrhythmic drug does not affect the P wave duration, but the spectral analysis of the P wave is significantly different.
In summary, after optimization of the method, signal averaging of the P wave enables identification of patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent atrial fibrillation.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis( EAU) shows similarities with human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
A prerequisite for efficient pain therapy is knowledge of the genesis of pain.
In most post-traumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and the nociceptive affections are passed through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is based on injuries to the nervous system.
Central sensitization mechanisms at the spinal cord level and sympathetic nervous system involvement can lead to chronification of such pain.
The therapy of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is presented using treatment algorithms.
In addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, coanalgesics and opioid analgesics are of particular importance, especially in chronic pain.
When prescribing these substances, defined pain therapy standards must be observed.
Blockages with local anesthetics as monotherapy for chronic pain are now obsolete.
In the case of post-traumatic pain, on the other hand, a defined series of peripheral nerve blocks or trigger point infiltrations can be useful as an adjuvant measure.
Sympathetic blockages are of particular importance in the diagnosis and therapy of sympathetically maintained pain ( SMP) .
The importance of irradiation of the pelvic lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific questions are not available or are methodologically controversial( RTOG 75-06 and 77-06) .
In T3/ 4 carcinomas, additional irradiation of the paraaortic lymphatic drainage pathways compared to pelvic lymph node irradiation alone does not improve overall survival or overall survival, respectively. of progression-free or tumor-specific survival and is obsolete.
Data on long-term side effects are only available from studies using outdated irradiation techniques.
Radiotherapy of the lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is not a standard therapy but an individual decision and should be included in studies ( e.g., studies B ARO 95-3) will be performed.
However, because of the ambiguity of the clinical picture, only the pathomorphological examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
In the following, the pathomorphological criteria of acute appendicitis as well as its special forms are presented and in particular the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be definitively treated by thin-caliber drainage.
In contrast, in the case of a complicated pneumothorax, a large-caliber Bülau drainage is indicated.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinic, e.g. B in ventilation patients, the burden must be relieved immediately before further diagnostics.
A haemothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be treated quickly with Bülau drainage due to the risk of severe blood loss and, if necessary, a Bülau drainage system should be used. Surgical care is provided.
A spontaneous hemothorax also requires drainage and internal clarification.
The doctor in an internal intensive care unit must be able to diagnose and treat pneumothorax and hematothorax.
The question of this prospective single-case observational study in 12 intensive care patients was whether routine determination of procalcitonin ( PCT) in intensive care patients provides additional information on clinical findings, routine laboratory tests, microbiology and radiology.
Likewise, lethality, overall injury severity, the likelihood of bleeding complications, and the proportion of pelvic concomitant injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, ie are complex pelvic injuries. hm there we go the pelvic injury with concomitant peritoneal soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture( floating hip) represent a special situation.
The hemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organ lesions is at the forefront of the interdisciplinary therapy.
Acetabular fractures pose a particular challenge as joint fractures.
Surgical therapy with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long-term results.
As the number of these additional pathologies increases, the long-term outcome worsens.
Primary accidental cartilage damage appears to have a significant influence on the long-term outcome after acetabular fractures.
Isolated calcifying arteriosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused typical symptoms in a 56-year-old female patient, such as aortic isthmus stenosis.
What is remarkable about the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta, as well as the extent of the calcifications.
The initial findings of angiography and computed tomography( CT) of the thorax suggested a differential diagnosis of a calcifying aortic tumor, a secondary calcified wall dissection or an expired aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium( RPE) regulates the lipid metabolism of the photoreceptors by catalysis of external segments and is exposed to the regulation of blood lipids via choroidal perfusion.
Since uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids occurs via specific low-density lipoprotein ( LDL) receptors, expression and regulation of this receptor type in the RPE were investigated and regulated in the RPE.
With reference to changes in educational and social structures, medical habilitation as an academic qualification has recently been called into question.
In the discourse on the application and development of reproductive techniques, the experiential aspects of those affected recede into the background.
Many people only ask for help outside of medical treatment when they are exhausted or very disappointed by unsuccessful attempts at treatment.
The skeleton is one of the most common metastasis sites in metastatic breast, prostate and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic therapy methods depends on the histology, the detection of extraskeletal metastases and the general condition of the patient.
For receptor-positive breast carcinomas and prostate cancer, hormone therapy is the therapy of first choice.
Chemotherapy is indicated for receptor-negative breast cancer, after failure of hormone therapy or if liver metastases are detected, chemotherapy is indicated.
Chemotherapy should always be carried out for small cell bronchial carcinomas.
Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinomas are accessible to radioiodine therapy.
In the case of metastatic non-small cell bronchial carcinomas or renal cell carcinomas, the indication for systemic therapy is rather cautious and is limited v. a to younger patients and patients in sufficiently good general condition.
Difficulties exist in the imaging detection of a response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Newer methods of determining bone resorption products in urine could prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and therapy of childhood back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve stretch pain should be investigated.
The risk of being professionally infected with HIV is often subjectively considered to be high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
Hepatitis B, for example, is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccination, there are z.g. vaccination. B a clear recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination of hospital staff.
In case of injuries with HBV-containing material, post-exposure combined active and passive vaccination is performed post-exposure.
There is no drug post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
Early therapy with interferon when HCV RNA is detected appears to have a high success rate with HCV RNA.
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis was diagnosed in a 26-year-old woman from a lung biopsy obtained by videothoracoscopy with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
The pulmonary changes had led to recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right-sided kidney tumor had been removed and diagnosed as angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strong positive reactions both in the muscular differentiated tissue of the angiomyolipoma and in the smooth muscle proliferates of the lungs.
The targeted search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation in the left frontal brain measuring up to 5 cm in diameter.
Polytopic organ manifestations and histomorphological findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in the kidney, lungs and probably also in the brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international discussion on questions of euthanasia as well as developments in Australia and Oregon indicate an increasing tendency to give preference to medical assisted suicide over active killing - not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The 1994 decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on assisted suicide of a psychiatrist gives rise to an examination of this problem from a psychiatric point of view.
Nitric oxide( NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase ( bNOS and ecNOS) were investigated histochemically and immunohistochemically in 14 normal non-obstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate preparations.
A differentiated nitrinergic innervation of the prostatic glands, the stroma and the vessels could be detected both by means of the NADPH diaphorase ( d) reaction and immunohistochemically.
In the case of preparations with obstructive hyperplasia, there seems to be a pronounced reduction in nitrinergic innervation, although no quantitative evaluation has yet been carried out due to the small number of preparations.
In the endothelium, a differentiated expression of NOS depending on the vascular section could also be detected by means of the NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemically.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the region of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscles, regional blood flow and secretion of the normal and hyperplastic prostate.
Due to heterogeneous patient groups and diverse causes of ileus, surgical indications and surgical procedure selection for small bowel ileus are difficult to standardize.
A uniform procedure for intraoperative handling of the intestine( stripping, insertion of an intestinal splint) and abdominal wall closure( technique, suture material) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques of small bowel plication continue to be used ( in a relevant minority of clinics), with Noble surgery largely replaced by Child-Phillips plication and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no confirmed indications or contraindications for plicatures, long probes and other surgical measures.
Given the frequency and socioeconomic importance of the small intestine, changing this remains an important task for the future.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive field of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results achieved by reproductive medicine and their public discussion can make it possible to increase its social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment, while at the same time preventing misunderstandings.
Such an analysis is also a valuable tool for reliable counseling of the couples concerned.
Gait characteristics and decreased muscle strength in depressed individuals have often been described in the clinical literature, but have hardly been empirically investigated to date.
We recorded various gait and strength parameters using simple and standardized methods within a theoretical framework essentially based on classical clinical observations of depression.
20 hospitalized, depressed individuals were examined using standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses recording step length, average walking speed, maximum walking speed and 3-min walking distance and compared with 20 healthy test subjects and compared with 20 healthy subjects.
The examination was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement in symptoms.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy were achieved. a in knee and elbow extension and also in all gait parameters examined, gait parameters were detected in all gait parameters examined.
The methods used for the first time for psychiatric questions in the present pilot study are suitable for the reliable and low-impact investigation of relationships between depression and motor skills and can therefore be used in broader studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
This can lead to an acute glaucoma attack in the sense of a ciliolenticular block or there can be chronic glaucoma.
YAG- idiotomy or basal iridectomy rarely lead to pressure regulation.
We report on the results after cataract surgery for subluxatio lentis and glaucoma.
In 12 patients with progressive scleroderma( PS), the influence of autogenic training( AT) on plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide was investigated.
Compared to healthy controls( N), the scleroderma patients had significantly increased substance P plasma levels( x+/- s: x+/- s:
PS-Patienten 7, 1 +/- 3, 2 pmol/l, N 1, 6 +/- 1, 6 pmol/l) .
With the exception of selective deviations, VIP plasma concentrations showed no significant differences from normal values( x+/- s: x+/- s:
PS-Patienten 10, 7 +/- 7, 1 pmol/l, N 12, 0 +/- 5, 3 pmol/l) .
We describe 2 unrelated, German, male patients with typical symptoms.
Both showed up to the age of 3.2 or 3, respectively, respectively. 4 years of progressive neurological decline, severe mental retardation, signs of dysostosis multiplex, and storage phenomena in lymphocytes.
L-fucosidase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was severely decreased( < 3% of normal) .
So far, the mutation G401X has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombi in the right atrium is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculoatrial shunt systems.
We report on a 4.6-year-old girl who came to hospital with signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci and increased CSF protein were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid.
The thrombus had to be removed by cardiac surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000( Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
This routine test was performed in the autopsy of three clearly as a result of freezing or freezing, respectively. Hypothermia of deceased persons receive strongly positive results for ketones without at the same time increasing urine glucose in the urine.
Headspace gas chromatography revealed excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/L in all three urine samples of 140, 1004 and 2703 mg/L.
A strongly positive Keto-Diabur test 5000 with normal glucose findings in the urine can thus serve as a diagnostic aid for detecting death due to hypothermia.
A prospective study in 94 patients with traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint examines the extent to which magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) can provide information about the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide information for the therapeutic procedure.
Infantile acrolocalized syndrome( Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in the context of various infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, eruptive symmetrical papules and papulovesicles appeared eruptively on the extremities.
Viral serology indicated a fresh Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV) primary infection, whereas serology for hepatitis B virus was negative.
Temporal joint dislocations occur as a result of trauma, articulation disorders, and changes in the muscular balance of the masticatory muscles.
The previous classifications are mainly based on the anatomical positional relationships of the dislocated temporomandibular joint surfaces such as dislocation, subluxation and disc dislocation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
TMJ dislocations have been described as a complication of a number of neurological diseases.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent temporomandibular joint dislocations as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the term neurogenic temporomandibular joint dislocation.
Port-wine stains can lead to considerable psychosocial stress.
The present study investigated a) the coping behavior, quality of life and body experience of patients with port-wine stains and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
A psychological test psychological examination was carried out on 70 patients with port-wine stains as part of therapy with the flash lamp-pulsed dye laser on the areas of coping with illness, quality of life and body experience.
The clinical target criterion was the degree of lightening of the port-wine stain during the course of therapy.
Patients with port-wine stains showed comparably high levels of social anxiety as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with size and darkness of the stain.
With regard to helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, the patients with port-wine stains were significantly less burdened.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and body experience.
Body experience is differentially influenced by coping with illness.
Since lightening in the course of laser therapy correlates significantly with reduced psychosocial stress, flash lamp pulsed dye laser therapy for port-wine stains can also be considered effective with regard to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma( PGIL) represents an independent clinical picture, since the biological behavior, prognosis and treatment differ from nodal lymphomas.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and staging of PGIL.
Gastrointestinal lymphomas show a variety of pathohistological manifestations and a wide spectrum of imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiological picture and therapeutic options.
A 43-year-old man had a nevus sebaceus in the area of the right temple since birth.
The histopathological examination revealed 2 adnex neoplasms associated with the lesion:
a syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined occurrence of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction is traditionally based on the history ( typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes ( ST elevations, T-wave changes, occurrence of Q-waves, new left bundle branch block) and elevated levels of the "classic cardiac enzymes" kinase ( CK) and CK-MB ( WHO criteria) .
Hypothyroidism is one of the most important causes of reversible dementias.
The present case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia within a few months in a patient over 80 years of age.
At present, it is not so much the psychopathological cross-sectional picture as the course of therapy of the disease that allows the differentiation between primary degenerative dementia in the presence of concomitant hypothyroidism and dementia secondary to hypothyroidism.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm and renal artery stenosis, a left subclavian artery aneurysm near the outlet could be successfully eliminated by implantation of a balloon-expandable JOSTENTQA peripheral stent graft.
The follow-up over one year showed a very good long-term result with a freely perfused stent lumen and a completely switched off aneurysm.
Control computed tomography revealed a completely thrombosed aneurysm sac balloon.
Intravascular ultrasound showed no evidence of neointima hyperplasia within the stent, except for neointima hyperplasia within the stent.
Pyoderma gangrenosum was first described as an independent entity in 1930 by Brunsting, Goeckermann and O'Leary.
Nevertheless, they can be found already in the first half of the 19th century. Century illustrations in an atlas by Marie Nicolas Devergie, which almost necessarily suggest a pyoderma gangrenosum, a pyoderma gangrenosum.
Devergie's Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique contains case histories of various forms of syphilitic affections of the skin as well as individual images of gangrenous ulcers that occurred completely unexpectedly under the mercury therapy customary at the time.
The rapidly enlarging ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as side effects of this extensive therapy with mercury, since they healed spontaneously after discontinuing it.
Thus, clinical descriptions and images of pyoderma gangrenosum can be found more than 100 years before it was first named.
However, the etiology of this clinical picture has not yet been sufficiently clarified to date.
Thus, the theory of a primarily bacterial genesis of pyoderma gangrenosum persisted in several publications well into the 60s of our century.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive functions are among the essential selection criteria of anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study addresses the question of whether the recovery of cognitive functions is faster after TIVA with remifentanil/ propofol( P/ R) than after balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane/ fentanyl( S/ F) .
Uniform estradiol concentrations are achieved as in the early follicular phase.
In oral estrogen replacement therapy, estradiol must be dosed 40 times higher than in TTS treatment in order to achieve effective but highly fluctuating drug levels with supraphysiological peaks and subnormal lows.
The high estrogen doses with oral administration are necessary because there is a pronounced estrogen metabolism during the passage of the liver.
What is the importance of ultrasound examination of the fetus and newborn in the diagnosis and therapy planning of Mekonium peritonitis?
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, small bowel atresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, and psychomotor retardation who has partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8 and has partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
The aim of the present study was to measure the physical resilience of patients with cystic fibrosis and to record exercise-dependent changes in oxygen saturation.
Reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions resp. Tumors of the urinary bladder were to better meet the biology of the different lesions as well as to complete a sharper separation between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The importance for diagnostics and clinics in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistochemical findings, is critically reviewed.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential, and papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include flat hyperplasia, atypia ( reactive or of unclear significance), dysplasia, and in situ carcinoma ( CIS)
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
In the present study, an attempt is made to show correlations between selected metabolic parameters and the course of inflammation of patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by intervention in the sympathetic nervous system.
This is then referred to as sympathetically entertained pain.
Typical diseases with a sympathetic pain component are the complex regional pain syndromes( sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), the territorial neuropathic pain syndromes and the acute herpes zoster.
For people with chronic sleep and back problems, there is a significant correlation between sleep quality and mattress quality.
Routine diagnostic work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes a multiphasic abdominal spiral CT and a chest X-ray.
In the case of unclear spiral CT findings in the question of intravenous tumor expansion, contrast-enhanced MRI can be a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI are patients with absolute or relative contraindication to non-ionic X-ray contrast agents, patients in the stage of compensated renal insufficiency ( not yet requiring dialysis) and patients with symptomatic polycystic renal degeneration.
Conventional cavography is obsolete in the age of ( multi-line) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common injuries to the eye in childhood are chemical burns, burns, eyelid injury, erosio corneae, corneal foreign body, eyeball contusion, blow-out fracture, perforating eye injury, endophthalmitis and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 to 100, respectively. 1000 inhabitants/year.
Thus, they represent the most common cause of unilateral blindness in childhood.
Risk factors for eye injury in childhood include u as risk factors for eye injury in childhood. a age( < 5 years), gender( male> female), and parental care known.
In addition to rapid and adequate therapy, the prognosis for visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is also influenced by psychosocial factors ( compliance with the use of visual aids or masking of the eyes for amblyopia prophylaxis) .
Deficits and imbalances of the spine-stabilizing muscles are considered significant somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back complaints.
Therefore, the aim of prevention and rehabilitation must be to maintain and restore the full performance of the muscles stabilizing the spine, in addition to training coordinative skills and learning how to behave in a way that is appropriate for the spine.
In addition to the various pain therapy measures, physiotherapeutic treatment techniques including neurophysiological-based procedures, physical-balneological measures and supplementary behavioral training, medical training therapy is an important procedure in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical training therapy includes the use of principles and methods of practice-oriented training theory and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
In its phase structure, various therapy goals, but in particular the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular system according to the rehabilitation course, are presented.
Indication and monitoring of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
Depending on the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, therapy goals and treatment concept are adapted in cooperation with physiotherapists and treating physicians.
The indication for spondylolisthesis surgery is pain, progressive slippage and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radicular dysfunction.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but the deformity persists and in the case of spondyloptosis, plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodesis mass can occur with further progression of sliding.
With the external fixator as a reduction instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, it is now also possible to reduce severe sliding processes and restore a normal spinal and trunk shape with an acceptable neurological risk.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed that, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, also aims at anatomical reduction of the gliding vertebrae in any case.
Depending on the extent of slippage, reduction and stabilization should take place in 1, 2, or 3 surgical steps.
Dorsal or ventral fusion alone is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
Combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended for grade II and above.
The aim of the evaluation study, the selected results of which are reported in this article, is to assess the effects of a geriatric psychiatric center( GZ: Gerontopsychiatric center) .
a combination of outpatient service, day clinic and counseling for the elderly) to the process of change from "intramural" ( inpatient) to "extramural" ( day clinic and clinical-outpatient, i.e., on a call for and justified in detail by the Federal Government's Commission of Experts. WTF IS GOING ON For the first time, we should empirically examine household-based) regional care structures with an empirical examination.
On the basis of extensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, changes in the regional care substructures of gerontopsychiatry ( subsystem A), general medicine ( subsystem B) and geriatric care ( subsystem C) are analyzed by comparing the care region of the city of Bielefeld ( without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh ( with GZ) .
With regard to subsystem A, the study shows that a GZ has a considerable influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extramural care, without selecting its clientele according to the type and severity of the mental disorder.
An effect of the GZ on the system of care for the elderly ( subsystem C) is possibly expressed in the fact that in the Gütersloh care region the rate of admission to a home after clinical inpatient treatment is significantly lower than in the Bielefeld control region. control region in Bielefeld.
A 62-year-old female patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis on the right arm with systemic signs ( fever, leukocytosis) and massive restriction of movement in the right shoulder joint.
In addition to edema of the skin and adipose tissue, sonography and computed tomography also showed extensive accumulations of fluid around the deep muscle fascia, in the interstitia and - less pronouncedly - in the shoulder joint.
Under systemic corticosteroid therapy, the skin lesions quickly healed, and in the further course also the mobility in the shoulder joint was restored.
In the case described, involvement of structures close to the joint in the context of eosinophilic cellulitis was demonstrated for the first time using modern imaging methods in the context of eosinophilic cellulitis.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide enables breast-conserving treatment for larger tumors that are not suitable for primary breast-conserving treatment.
The regression of the tumor can be monitored with mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
Good reproducibility and availability speak in favour of mammography.
Mammographically indistinguishable tumors can usually be visualized sonographically.
In MRI, the extent of the tumor is independent of the structure and density of the mammary parenchyma.
It also allows the recording of functional parameters. - The determination of the extent of tumor residues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited with all available methods, since microscopic invasive and especially non-invasive tumor residues can hardly be detected.
These do not regress even with regression of the invasive tumor and typically show intraductal, non-invasive tumor residues in intraductal, non-invasive tumor residues.
Guillain-Barré syndrome( GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents itself clinically with symmetrical paralysis, areflexia and pronounced vegetative disorders.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for transferring a patient with GBS to the intensive care unit.
Using the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome( MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, this report discusses the treatment of pronounced GBS in the intensive care unit.
In the case of morphologically suitable stenoses, stent implantation without pre-stretching appears to be able to apply a dissection immediately and thus prevent it.
Neurosurgical therapy methods for Parkinson's disease( PK) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, building on advances in basic research.
For the first time, a two-pronged functional model specifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei and thus makes them potential targets for neurosurgical procedures.
its pathological disinhibition becomes u. a caused by overactivity of the nuclear subthalamic nucleus( Nst) .
Experimental lesions of these nuclei were successfully tested in MPTP-damaged patients. - In the clinic, come in, for example. Z. both lesional and restorative and stimulative procedures for use.
The previously used techniques of pallidotomy and thalamotomy have become more precise thanks to better neuroradiological and physiological target location.
The former technique is used to treat rigidity, hypokinesia, and drug-induced dyskinesia, the latter method has proven effective in treating tremor.
Only fetal cell transplantation has been documented to produce new dopaminergic neurons and increased striatal dopamine release;
however, the procedure raises ethical and immunological problems.
High-frequency continuous stimulation of individual basal ganglia is the latest procedure and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most widespread is the stimulation of thalamic nuclei for the treatment of tremor;
The animal experimental approach includes xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells.
However, long-term comparative studies between the individual procedures are necessary in order to be able to determine the ideal ( combination) therapy of the future.
Acute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic alcoholism ( SESA syndrome) is a rare alcohol sequelae disease, along with more common diseases such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal convulsions, Wernicke-Korsakow syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurological deficits( hemiparesis, hemianopsia, or apnea), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures, and periodic lateral steep potentials in the EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted after several secondary generalized focal seizures of the right side of the body under the suspected diagnosis of encephalitis after several secondary generalized focal seizures on the right side of the body.
Laboratory tests showed increased values for gamma GT and MCV.
CCT and cerebral MRI showed microangiopathy and brain atrophy.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and triple anticonvulsant therapy, epileptic seizures and deterioration in the general condition continued to be observed.
Several EEG examinations revealed periodic steep left parieto-occipital waves.
Three months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died of pneumonia.
The clinical picture described corresponds to the criteria of SESA syndrome.
Solitary basal cell carcinomas in childhood and adolescence without association with basal cell nevus syndrome( BZNS), xeroderma pigmentosum, xerid nevus or following radiotherapy are very rare( 86 cases in the world literature to date) .
Etiologically, it could be an abortive form of the BZNS or the consequence of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Studies on repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage are not yet available in these patients.
A 10-year-old boy with a solitary nodular basal cell carcinoma of the right infraorbital region is reported.
Neither the anamnesis nor the clinical examination gave any indication of a genetic predisposition to basal cell carcinoma development.
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed in 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML) using iliac crest biopsies to compare morphological and clinical findings and to clarify the effects of interferon ( IFN) and chemotherapy and chemotherapy.
Based on the morphometric analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes including their progenitor cells and the fiber density could be calculated.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts with regard to the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was already observed in about 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
Similarly, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythropoietic progenitor cells, which can be related by the involvement of this cell line in iron metabolism, H‰ moglobin synthesis and the degradation of the normoblast nuclei that have been secreted normoblast nuclei.
Pseudo-Gaucher cells were detected in 30% of the biopsies before treatment.
Furthermore, significant relationships between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibrillation with clinical parameters such as hemoglobin levels, the proportion of myelo- and erythro- normoblasts in the peripheral blood, and spleen size could be calculated.
These variables obviously characterize more advanced stages of CML.
According to our morphometric evaluation, a classification was made into three different histological subgroups:
Corresponding haematological data were assigned to this simplified histological classification.
Sequence biopsies in 173 patients receiving monotherapy with IFN, hydroxyurea( HU) or busulfan( BU) showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN as opposed to a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main cell lines during treatment were best illustrated by a calculation of indices.
These included the ratio of quantitative differences of the individual variables in the repeated withdrawals and the associated temporal differences.
Thus, in patients with a complete h‰ matological remission after IFN administration, the regeneration of erythropoiesis together with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages including their activated subpopulation could be detected.
The histological subgroups revealed a transition from both a( non-fibrillated) granulocyte‰ ren and megakaryocyte‰ ren subtype to a myelofibrotic group in about 40% of patients.
This phenomenon contrasted with a numerical‰ fl reduction of the myelofibrotic type mainly in patients on HU therapy in 17 cases( 36%) .
In summary, the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies using appropriate methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 consecutive patients admitted to a medical geriatric department were to be diagnosed with a naturalistic design with regard to mental disorders.
On the basis of the clinical examination as well as the values in the mini-mental state examination( 2), 51 patients were assessed as not eligible for examination.
The remaining 74 patients were clinically and with screening scales( Geriatric Depression Scale( 11);;
Dementia developments were possible. detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests.
Mental disorders of disease value( mostly adjustment disorders or depression) were found in 41 patients, in more than half of whom the disorder was relevant for the overall treatment in the clinic.
The screening instruments used proved to be reliable, so that they can be recommended for further use.
However, it remains open, as is the case after this result with every 5 people. up 6 Patients can be guaranteed required therapy for the mental disorder in the setting of a medical geriatric department.
Inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondyloarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis are considered problematic in the early stages, since the sensitivity of conventional X-rays is very low here.
Magnetic resonance imaging of sacroiliac joints is able to detect both acute inflammatory and chronic changes at all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method are investigator dependence, lack of standardization to date, and the still relatively high costs.
Therefore, the "Working Group on Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatology Center Berlin", which consists of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists and orthopedists, has developed an overview of imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis, in which, in addition to the clinical background, technical details are also explained and radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness are taken into account.
Hyperimmune globulin E syndrome( Job's syndrome, Job's syndrome, Buckley's syndrome) is a rare disease of the immune system that can show characteristic manifestations in the ENT area.
The clinical picture is characterized by recurrent urticarial exanthema, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphatic organs and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Strongly elevated serum IgE concentrations in the absence of evidence of allergic and parasitic diseases are diagnostically indicative.
Therapeutically, treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin( IVIG) proved to be excellently tolerated and highly effective.
More than a year after the single therapy, the symptoms are persistently improved.
The current state of knowledge and the available treatment options for hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In hyper-IgE syndrome, a therapy trial with IVIG should be an option of first choice.
The present work presents the results after laparoscopic floppy Nissen fundoplication in 70 patients based on quality of life data 3 years after surgery.
The individual sub-dimensions of the GLQI record corresponding point scores.
More than 98% of all patients rate the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo another antireflux operation if necessary.
Persistent side effects of the operation that did not impair quality of life were reported by 4 patients.
No patient required re-drug antireflux therapy.
Laparoscopic refundoplication was necessary in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months due to persistent dysphagia within the first 3 postoperative months.
The effectiveness of surgical treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease by means of laparoscopic "floppy Nissen" fundoplication can be documented not only by objective findings, but also by the subjective assessment of the patient and by the measurement of quality of life data and can be proven in the long term.
The clinical symptoms with neuroglucopenia are groundbreaking, proving the inadequately high insulin and C-peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the hunger test.
Standard surgery is enucleation of the tumor or, depending on size and location, resection.
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia, which are burdened with a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotale Resektion plus Enucleation scheinen selektiver Tumorentfernung überlegen.
In the case of malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolization and systemic chemotherapy are available.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable under Section 216 of the Penal Code;
it is also ethically unjustifiable from a medical point of view.
This is not changed by the various tendencies to make "killing on demand" exempt from punishment under certain conditions, as in the Netherlands, even in Germany under certain conditions.
Nutrient components as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both the proliferation and the differentiation of different cell components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be mentally distinguished from immunologically active cells of the intestinal associated lymphatic tissue ( GALT) .
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and an essential supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine becomes v. a significantly in the case of serious illnesses
The amino acids arginine and ornithine have v. a as starting substances of NO and polyamine synthesis importance for the eutrophy of immunocompetent intestinal cells.
Fermentable carbohydrates are bacterially fermented in the lower intestine to form mainly the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
These keep you practicing. a by improving blood flow, it exhibits a trophic effect on the colonic mucosa by improving blood flow.
Among the food-independent substances, they are v. a the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon as well as various growth factors that contribute to the maintenance of a eutrophic mucosa.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on the physical and mental condition.
By using a diary as a measuring instrument, it was possible to identify individual assessments of situational factors influencing nursing care on the one hand and stress-promoting factors in the nursing process on the other.
The results show both large individual differences with regard to the assessment of stress factors and their effects on the physical and psychological condition.
Continuous fractures of the talus are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis for acute and chronic ankle pain.
Early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus significantly influences the long-term outcome.
Computed tomography( CT) is indispensable for a definitive diagnosis and for the indication of the therapy to be taken.
Dislocated fractures, treated conservatively, as far as presented in the literature and according to our own experience, lead to pain and restriction of movement and thus to arthritic remodeling of the subtalar joint in the long term.
In the indication position for a surgical procedure, however, it can be seen from the sparse literature that large fragments should be anatomically refixed in order to enable healing without consequences.
Comminuted fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, although the long-term course cannot be estimated due to possible changes in joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria is still largely unexplained, there are a number of recent findings on the basic pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
Thus, an increase in dermal mast cells and an upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines can also be detected in unaffected skin and increased P-selectin in the serum, which indicates a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we were also able to detect activating point mutations of the mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional skin mast cells in indolent mastocytosis of adults, but not in childhood forms.
Contrary to popular belief, acute urticaria is rarely caused by IgE-mediated allergies ( 0.9%), while associated acute respiratory infections ( 39.3%) and drug intolerance ( 9.2%) are more common
In chronic urticaria, on the other hand, pseudo-allergies to food( 73%) and, more rarely, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract( 11%) usually play a role, with long-lasting remissions in avoidance( diet) or diet( diet), respectively. Elimination of triggers.
In contrast, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are mainly secondary and not disease-causing.
A scapulothoracic dissociation( SD) is a complex injury to the shoulder girdle, usually associated with a vital threatening injury pattern in the context of polytrauma.
The 3 case reports are intended to illustrate the variability of the possible injuries together with the scapulothoracic dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, which can usually only be treated in trauma centers.
The 3 cases are reproduced in the chronological sequence of polytrauma management, as well as the differentiated possibilities of care.
Reports of previous working groups in the context of multicenter studies with only a small patient collective show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus to define it as standards, the currently valid guidelines for this are explained, whereby cross-references to management are made together with the mostly polytraumatized and accordingly vital threatened patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed.
Of 74 of these 78 patients, the postoperative course over 2 months to 35.2 years is known( median 3.6 years; median; 3, 6 years;
A weak or weak point. negative e-Cadherin-Expression( <= 20 %) fand sich bei höheren T-Stadien, es bestanden vermehrt synchrone Lymphknoten- und Fernmetastasen.
In the statistical analysis, the e-cadherin expression( <= 20%/> 20%), synchronous distant metastasis( M0/ pM1, cM1) as well as the radicality of the intervention( R0/ R1, 2) proved to be prognostically relevant( R0/ R1, 2) .
Our data suggest a prognostic significance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps and rubella are increasingly becoming a danger for adults due to the postponement of the age peak.
The MMR combination vaccination is an effective method for the prevention of this disease and its consequences.
Measles and mumps can be eliminated by the 2-malignant consistent MMR vaccination and rubella embryopathy can be made a disease of the past.
The aim of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adulthood ( ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and satisfied aging in both middle and older adulthood.
A comparison of age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness and agreeableness.
A regional comparison revealed personality differences in the areas of neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness as well as in subjective well-being.
Meaningful interactions between age group and region emerged for openness and in some subtests of cognition measurement as well as physician judgment.
Intra-abdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ in more than 80% and occur mostly after abdominal surgery.
In terms of anatomy, they are divided into intraperitoneal, visceral, and anterior retroperitoneal space related abscesses.
Today, sonographically or CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage is an effective procedure with few complications and a success rate of approx. 80% is.
Liver abscesses are predominantly treated interventionally, pancreas, spleen and Crohn's abscesses are almost always treated surgically.
Specific infectious diseases with intra-abdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors( tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amebiasis) are diagnosed late because of their rarity and offer pathological-anatomical, diagnostic and therapeutic peculiarities.
Since the mid to late 1980s, various research groups have been trying to improve the prediction of premature birth in prematurity through immunological diagnostics - in particular cytokine detection - through immunological diagnostics.
However, it turns out to be a disadvantage that this prenatal diagnosis has so far only been made from the amniotic fluid, i.e. fruit water. hm there we go due to amniocentesis, but can not convince from the serum of the pregnant woman.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier is almost impermeable to cytokines, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the high range of fluctuation of the individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts have been made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
Possibly, cytokine detection from the cervix of the pregnant woman, guided by PCR- technique, is a viable option for the future.
The load on the internal fixator for the spine was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for various activities.
The highest loads were found during walking and lateral flexion while standing and standing.
During ventral flexion of the upper body, implant loading changed only slightly.
No higher fixator loads were measured when sitting than when standing.
There is therefore little to be said against allowing patients in whom the spine has been stabilized mono- or bisegmentally to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand up, as soon as they are allowed to stand up.
Due to the additional ventral stabilization with bone chips, the load on the bisegmental implants was often significantly changed.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often much higher after ventral stabilization than before than before.
A corset or girdle did not reduce implant loading.
Therefore, it is not necessary to provide patients with a corset after mono- or bisegmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningiomas are among the most common intracranial tumors in adulthood.
The so-called one. In 1993, atypical meningioma was added to the revised version of the WHO classification for tumors of the central nervous system and is intended to designate meningiomas with an increased tendency to recur compared to usual meningiomas.
Since the same qualitative histological criteria are given for this meningioma as for anaplastic meningioma, a purely histological diagnosis appears to be fraught with certain uncertainties.
We searched for other prognostically relevant parameters:
With the help of the morphometrically determined core-surface-related Ki- 67( MIB1-) index 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningiomas of all 3 grades( N= 160), which proved to be valid in comparison with the" recurrence"- free intervals" in comparison with the" recurrence"- free intervals".
Histologically, the so-called ones are characterized by this. Atypical meningiomas due to a poorly structured, "syncytial" growth pattern and large prominent nucleoli from major prominent nucleoli.
Optionally, nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis and mitotic figures were found.
Cytogenetically, the so-called showed that the so-called Atypical and anaplastic meningiomas, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and unsystematic clonal changes, in 50% of the cases a distal piece loss on the short arm of a chromosome 1( 1p-) .
Histochemically, we were able to show that in meningiomas, the tissue-unspecific form of alkaline phosphatase( ALPL), whose structural gene is located on 1p, can be used as a progression- and recurrence-associated marker enzyme( loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas) .
Instead of the term "atypical", which is ambiguous in everyday clinical practice and can give rise to misinterpretations in connection with tumor grading, we propose the term meningiomas of the intermediate type for this group of tumors, which are located between the usual and the anaplastic meningiomas, and are relatively at risk of recurrence.
Due to the special anatomical situation, joint process fractures occupy a special position within the mandibular fractures because of the special anatomical situation.
Computed tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnostics.
Surgical treatment is indicated for severely dislocated or dislocated fractures.
The surgical approach is the pre-sicular, sub-, or sub-, or surgical approach. perimandibular, retromandibular and oral access established.
Only functionally stable methods, such as the miniplate or tension screw, should be used to fix the fragments.
Analysis of the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced, biphasic spiral CT compared to native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with V patients. a focal liver lesions prior to possible liver surgery.
We report on the manifestation of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basal cell carcinomas as well as palmoplantar keratoses after treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenic-containing cerebrospinal fluid Fowleri( Fowler's);
a Laugier- Hunziker-Baran syndrome was also diagnosed as an incidental finding.
Background and questions.
Despite the great importance of dermatoses in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is completely inadequately represented in the basic health services established there.
To investigate the long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the primary health care system in terms of the prevalence of skin diseases.
The growth rate and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The aim of the study was to determine the acute and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR) within and outside of a single primary care hospital.
Due to the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities, the PhotoDermVL enables a wide range of individually selectable treatment parameters.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations( essential telangiectasias, nevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, spider nevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichoses can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Breast cancer metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumor in women.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, to identify risk factors with regard to the occurrence and to evaluate the benefit of early therapy for this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumor manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in acute relapses.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic forms are often difficult to control.
In addition, numerous therapy-induced side effects occur during the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants.
We report 2 cases of acute exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus, which could hardly be controlled even by administration of high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/azathioprine.
In addition to immunosuppression, both cases were treated with IgM-enriched high-dose intravenously administered immunoglobulins.
In both cases, the immunosuppressants originally used in high doses ( prednisolone, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine) could be tapered off to minimal maintenance therapy.
After each 9 cycles of therapy, the patients remained under minimal immunosuppressive maintenance therapy with prednisolone free of appearance during the follow-up period of 1 year.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, making it one of the most common complaints in childhood.
Nevertheless, our knowledge of this syndrome is still very incomplete in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp ( 340-450 nm, max.
365 nm) is mainly used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with typical fluorescence ( tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyrien and pigment changes), used primarily in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with typical fluorescence ( tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyrien and pigment changes) .
In addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs ( tetracycline), fluorescence under Wood's light has been applied by the addition of fluorescent markers in the application control of topicals.
Endocardial mapping is possible when hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms are induced as part of programmed ventricular stimulation.
Wichtigster Baustein der Lokalisationsdiagnostik ist die Identifikation von kritischen Teilen der Kreiserregung durch Stimulationsmanöver ( "Entrainment-Mapping") und Analyse des "Post-Pacing"-Intervalles.
In the case of clinical occurrence and induction of only singular ventricular tachycardia, acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in about 60-70% of cases by high-frequency current catheter ablation with termination and suppression of inducibility.
This success rate is much lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases, recurrence must be expected.
In the case of incessant ventricular tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia after implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator, early catheter ablation is indicated.
Currently, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is a therapy method that is complementary to drug treatment and the implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
Out of 1, 1 1985 to 31st. 12 In 1995, the influence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumor staging and local recurrence rate was retrospectively investigated in 386 patients with UICC stage I-III rectal carcinoma after conventional surgical procedures and R0 resection of the tumor.
In univariate analysis, we found a significant correlation between the number of dissected and the number of affected lymph nodes, and concomitantly a significant increase in UICC stage III( p= 0.013) and pTxpN2 category( p= 0.000) .
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate as a function of the number of dissected lymph nodes could only be demonstrated for UICC stages I and II.
In the overall patient population and in multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no influence on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in the local recurrence rate in UICC stages I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but to a stage shift within the framework of a more precise tumor staging.
This indicates the influence of other surgically influenced factors, in particular the total mesorectal excision for the development of a locoregional recurrence.
Echocardiography has so far lacked uniform standards for documentation of findings.
However, these standards are necessary to enable the comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings, so that the requirements for quality assurance in echocardiography are met.
Decreasing incidences of active tuberculosis in industrialized countries have pushed this disease out of the consciousness of many people.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis continues to be the most common fatal infectious disease worldwide.
In industrialized countries, factors such as immigration, increasing impoverishment and the increase in immunosuppressed patients, particularly due to the HIV epidemic, contribute to maintaining a reservoir for tuberculosis.
Cicatricial pemphigoid( CP) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with subepidermal blistering and scarring that manifests on the skin and mucosa.
Ocular involvement is present in about 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have long been known in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis( 2, 17, 18) .
The detection of these abscesses by echocardiography has already been described by Mardelli( 12) and others( 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16) .
Although asymptomatic courses are also known for endocarditis ( 18, 19, 20, 21), clinically asymptomatic abscesses have not yet been reported on so far.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 ( IL-7) in the few years since it was first described is increasingly affecting areas of dermatology as well.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 is particularly prominent in 2 areas of dermatology:
On the one hand, there is sufficient knowledge that makes IL-7 appear to be an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, particularly in the fight against melanoma.
A first pilot study with IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumor cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore z. Z. initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and appears to be able to significantly influence the residence and growth of normal T cells as well as lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
This review is intended to outline molecular, immunological and preclinical properties as well as perspectives for possible applications of IL-7 in dermatology.
It was investigated whether the high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA( gadodiamide, Omniscan) is suitable for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and whether dynamic studies at this dose enable an assessment of the response to preoperative chemotherapy.
The present work aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
After the introductory discussion of reasons for the increased attention to everyday competence in gerontology, six research streams relevant to everyday competence are outlined in a first part: The first part outlines six research streams relevant to everyday competence:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative conception of everyday competence is presented, which interlocks aspects of the six research currents with essential elements of the two everyday competence models.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumor control with increasing total treatment time of fractional radiotherapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during therapy.
Targeted inhibition of clonogenic cell proliferation during radiation treatment could therefore potentially lead to significant advances in radiation oncology.
In a brief overview, the possibilities for minimizing the time factor are discussed.
Inhibition of the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during radiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blockade of proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways or by pharmacological inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis is scientifically interesting, but its effectiveness in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiotherapy has not yet been proven in its effectiveness for minimizing the time factor on the results of radiotherapy. radiotherapy has not yet been proven to be effective in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiation therapy.
The only method currently confirmed is to carry out radiotherapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g. the only method currently confirmed is to carry out radiotherapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g. B by accelerated fractionation and by avoidance or Compensation for unplanned treatment breaks.
The acute inflammatory response probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis but also in the diagnosis and prognosis of acute coronary syndrome.
We examined 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome ( 59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour after admission and in the interval of 4-24 hours with regard to TnT ( Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP ( Autitis, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL) .
All patients were followed up to 6 weeks after discharge with regard to the primary endpoint of death or recurrence of acute coronary syndrome. Results:
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% in patients with positive CRP and TnT 42 days after discharge compared to 35.3% of TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
The logistic regression with regard to the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP( in each case after 4-24 h), age, sex and diagnosis revealed an independent influence of TnT( cutoff 0.1 ug/ L, p= 0.048, odds ratio= 7.5) and CRP( cutoff 0.862mg/ dL, p= 0.026, odds ratio= 5.3) .
Sensitivity/ specificity for the diagnosis of AMI were 69.6%/ 75% for TnT or TnT, respectively. 12%/ 72% for CRP in the first hour and 91.3%/ 68.2% for TnT and TnT respectively. 68%/ 72% for CRP in the 4- 24h course. Conclusions:
In addition to troponin T, highly sensitive CRP determinations are not very helpful for acute infarct diagnosis.
However, the assessment of the patient's prognosis by TnT is significantly independently supplemented by CRP 4- 24h after admission and thus significantly improved by means of CRP 4- 24h after admission.
Ein 51/2 Jahre altes Mädchen mit einem Optikusgliom und daraus resultierendem Hydrocephalus internus entwickelte 7 Monate nach Implantation eines ventrikuloperitonealen Shunts einen progredienten Aszites.
A high protein content was found in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the ascites fluid.
For the first time, a disturbance of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier was found to be the cause of the increased CSF protein by CSF protein electrophoresis.
The ileal conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary diversion with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, liver damage with portal hypertension increases the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit bleeding requiring transfusion.
While the diagnosis is simple, different treatment options are available.
In most cases, the source of bleeding is in varicose dilated vessels in the stoma, so that local sclerotherapy with 3% ethoxysclerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel is an option for local sclerotherapy with 3% ethoxysclerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel.
Resection of the varicose conduit portion is an option when bleeding is life-threatening or when the source of bleeding cannot be localized.
In the case of frequent recurrent bleeding, the removal of the conduit must also be considered.
A malignancy must be ruled out as the cause of any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumor cells are determined by mostly acquired changes in proliferation-relevant genes - protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes - whose detection can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningiomas and gliomas are among the most genetically characterized solid tumors:
A number of specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known species-specifically, which use clinical parameters such as clinical parameters, e.g. B the tendency of meningiomas to recur or the malignant progression of astrocytomas are associated.
The focal progression resulting in intratumoral heterogeneity, which is particularly typical of gliomas, is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumor cells, which are also co-determined iatrogenically by radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with increasing dyspnea due to thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
The patient had a mitral valve replacement 6 years earlier( St. Jude Medical) was performed for mitral stenosis III because of mitral stenosis.
3 years later, there was a valve thrombosis, which caused a valve exchange( St. Jude Medical) required.
Over the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become increasingly well understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of carcinoma cells from the epithelial association through loss of cell-cell adhesion, invasion of the extracellular matrix through proteolysis, and entry into the blood or blood, respectively. The lymphatic system is.
Intravasation of tumor cells is favored by angiogenic factors that can lead to degradation of the basement membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, exit from the vascular system, and induction of angiogenesis are further important steps in the metastasis process.
Furthermore, when a tumor cell enters the circulation, it will only survive if it escapes immunological defense.
The systematic identification of tumor antigens has opened up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic measures.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor disease of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and non-functional manifestations in the parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum and hypothyroid gland, rarely also in the stomach and thymus, and rarely in the stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene has been assigned to the long arm of chromosome 11.
This gene is believed to be one of the tumor suppressor genes whose allelic loss triggers the development of neoplasms.
The tumors in the pancreas, duodenum and thymus can metastasize, but usually have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 manifests itself most frequently between the 20s. and 35, respectively. Year of life, v. a due to hyperparathyroidism and/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies have focused on the reduction of endothelial cell density after perforating keratoplasty using different preservation methods of donor tissue.
The interpretation of the results was usually problematic here, since very variable follow-up intervals were summarized despite long known dynamic cell loss despite very variable follow-up intervals.
The aim of this study was to perform a long-term endothelial diagnosis on the same dates, taking into account 2 different preservation techniques, taking into account a long-term endothelial diagnosis at the same time dates.
Patients undergoing long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have varying levels of perioperative thromboembolic risk requiring continued prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of anticoagulation ( PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time) .
In elective procedures, coumarin administration is discontinued 2-3 days preoperatively; in emergency procedures, vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma substitution may be necessary.
Surgery in patients receiving heparin therapy or prophylaxis is less problematic, as the heparin effect subsides within a few hours upon discontinuation as the heparin effect subsides within a few hours.
Results from various epidemiological studies are available on the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany.
Transferring the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies to the total population of Germany results in estimates of 67 from 67 of them. 3000-138 000 Multiple-Sklerose Patients
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be the most different. due to problems of patient identification, the epidemiological area and the structure of the respective population.
To avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was recorded by means of a representative survey of physician groups relevant for the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of possibility to clarify the diagnosis.
The extrapolation and subsequent consolidation of the results of the survey of the individual physician groups resulted in a number of approx. 122; 000 Multiple-Sklerose-Patienten in Deutschland.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100, respectively. 000 inhabitants and is in the area of Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category" questionable MS" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
It was examined here how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant constellations of findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which subsequently produce increased growth factors in the area of the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be seen as a new promising technique of in situ tissue engineering, the clinical application of which can be expected in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by the family doctor.
For diagnosis and therapy, the quality of the doctor-patient conversation is of decisive importance.
While in the 70s the doctor's conversational style was regarded as a personality variant, current empirical studies on doctor-patient conversations suggest that the doctor's conversational behavior should be understood as an interactive process in which both communication partners ( doctor-patient) coordinate their conversational behavior with each other.
Training programmes to improve basic general practitioner psychosomatic competence often show little success, as they do not sufficiently take into account the importance of improving interactive competence.
This is at the heart of Düsseldorf's training and education program for basic psychosomatic care.
Finally, the training concept and experiences with it are presented and discussed.
Data on the prognosis of heart failure have so far been based on population epidemiological and retrospective hospital epidemiological studies as well as clinical intervention studies.
All of these sources can only be transferred to everyday clinical practice to a limited extent.
Programming the speech processor of a" cochlear implant"( CI) in young children, especially determining the stimulation strength that corresponds to the maximum acceptable volume( MAL), is often difficult.
Overstimulation must be avoided at all costs, as this can have a traumatizing effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex ( SR) thresholds triggered by the CI and the MAL and hearing thresholds established during postoperative speech processor setting in 27 wearers of three different implant types.
It was investigated whether the ESR threshold provides an applicable, objective instrument for simplifying, refining, and accelerating speech processor programming in practice.
For the Med-El and Clarion implants stimulated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as percentiles of the mean ESR threshold current level over all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex thresholds showed z. T’ s. large deviations from the thresholds effectively determined by behavioral audiometry.
Thus, it was not possible to determine the MAL and the hearing threshold reliably and easily by calculation on the basis of the intraoperative SR threshold.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold, in addition to an intraoperative functional control, can contribute to a computational restriction of the area to be tested.
However, the determination of the exact MAL will have to be done in a different, provisional behavioral audiometric way.
A 35-year-old patient developed itchy swelling in the red portions of a multicolored jewelry tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction was impressive, which could be distinguished from a true lymphoma by electron microscopic, immunohistochemical and molecular biological examinations.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate is possibly a consequence of dermal allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
Therapy of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
Presentation of new diagnostic possibilities in the area of the kidney by means of fast magnetic resonance imaging( MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old patient, for 8 years in the left anterior axillary line, a chicken egg-sized bud or bud had bulging skin in the left anterior axillary line. wartless supernumerary mammary gland develops.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desirable.
In connection with endoprosthetic operations, damage to arterial vessels adjacent to the joint can occur.
On the basis of 4 case studies, both highly acute and masked complication possibilities as well as the applied therapy are described.
Before and after endoprosthetic surgery, a vascular status of the extremities should be assessed.
Delusion is understood to mean intersubjectively alienating beliefs with a tendency towards subjective certainty, which lose their alienating character as an object of psychiatric experience with the knowledge of their dependence on a mental disorder.
Imaginations from which delusion arises are dynamically loaded according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure to update, which weighs on the imaginations and is increased in psychotic states, is a prerequisite for delusion.
Added to this must be the failure of de-realization brought about by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
Considerations explained by a casuistry, which start from the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion, are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of chronification.
The inflammatory pseudotumor usually occurs singularly and is a benign tumor first described in the lungs.
The case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal breathing obstruction due to thickening of the anterior septum is described.
Macroscopically, a cauliflower-like tumor was seen in the area of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected and completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Based on an overview of the relevant literature, differential diagnoses are discussed.
The therapy of choice is complete surgical resection of the tumor.
In the presented study, we therefore present examination possibilities of finger and fingertip arteries in healthy volunteers with color-coded duplex sonography.
The question was whether a standardized representation of such small vessels is technically possible with the color Doppler system we used.
As a result, we found that the representation was possible in all subjects examined ( n= 10) .
Furthermore, it is shown by way of example in a patient with endangiitis obliterans that pathological variations in vessels of this size can be detected with the method - with appropriate equipment and examination technology - with this size.
The aim of this retrospective study is to assess the need for cardioverter/defibrillator generator ( ICD) reimplantation in patients with pulse generator battery depletion and no clinical arrhythmia episode during the functional life of the initially implanted system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instruments, as well as the use of intrathoracic visualization systems makes it possible to perform operations on the mitral valve via a limited right anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses.
They are aggressive, locally infiltrating but non-metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Trauma, endocrine and genetic factors play a role in the cause.
Preferred localizations are the trunk and the limb parts close to the trunk.
By combining different imaging techniques, in addition to determining the size and extent of the tumor, the number of differential diagnoses can also be limited to a few.
Whereas in earlier years surgical resection had a monopoly position, adjuvant therapeutic measures such as radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are becoming increasingly important.
Programming interventions and interventions with subsequent loss of function are justified only in the event of the occurrence of repeated, uncontrollable recurrences.
The treatment concept for atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological basic therapy in combination with a time-limited exacerbation-oriented anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, systemic therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response of topical therapy or to achieve remission in therapy-resistant courses.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and acyclovir are used for microbial superinfections.
In many cases, exacerbation can be successfully counteracted by phototherapy, especially by UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutics such as glucocorticosteroids, cyclosporine or azathioprine can usually be dispensed with in the treatment of atopic eczema or can usually be dispensed with. represents a therapeutic alternative only in a few exceptional cases.
The present casuistry describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented to the ENT department of the BwK Ulm for clarification with watery nasal secretion, recurrent epistaxis and a slowly progressive, left-sided nasal breathing obstruction.
The clinical examination as well as the CT scan of the paranasal sinuses showed a tumor that filled the entire left main nasal cavity and apparently started from the middle nasal passage.
The tumor was resected in toto via midfacial degloving.
Histological workup revealed the diagnosis of a neurinoma.
Based on this case report and an overview of the literature, the diagnosis and therapy of this rare nasal tumor is presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversial treatment method for lumbar disc prolapse.
Statistically, complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than with surgical therapeutic procedures for lumbar disc prolapse, but they lead z. T’ s. to significant impairment
The most serious complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal hemorrhages, and transverseyelitis.
This must be taken into account when determining the indication for chemonucleolysis and when informing the patient.
Six patients with granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated with cryosurgery.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is resistant to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy is an effective and low-impact treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as an alternative therapy to systemic treatment with Dapson.
Based on the questions of need, use and effectiveness of psychosomatic consultation/liaison services, the effectiveness of a psychosomatic dermatological consultation activity was examined in more detail for the first time in the present study.
The extent of compliance after treatment recommendation was recorded and its relationship to possible influencing factors such as frequency of consultation contacts, predisposition and satisfaction with the consultation as well as clinical and demographic characteristics was examined and its relationship with possible influencing factors such as frequency of consultation contacts, presetting and satisfaction with the consultation as well as clinical and demographic characteristics.
Two years after the consultation, follow-up questionnaires were sent out for this purpose and medical records were evaluated.
A sample of n= 69 patients with a recommendation for action resulted in a compliance rate of 78.3%, and a rate of 69% for the subgroup with a psychotherapy recommendation.
There was no significant correlation with clinical or demographic characteristics, nor did the frequency of conversations have any influence on the frequency of conversations.
In 70.5% of the cases, only one conversation was conducted.
A positive attitude towards the consultation and a pleasant conversation experience had a positive effect on compliance.
Overall, a high level of effectiveness could be achieved with relatively little time and effort.
A 29-year-old female patient with an unusual pigment mark of the face is reported.
From a clinical point of view, the pigment lesion corresponded to a nevus spilus, in histological diagnostics the existence of multiple blue nevi could be confirmed, in addition, there was a slightly pronounced lentiginous component as well as dermal melanocytosis melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, the melanocytic cell elements showed an expression of the S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB- 45.
The change thus proves to be the unusual combination of lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and dermal melanocytosis.
Patients undergoing vascular surgery often require far more fluid intraoperatively than can be expected from preoperative sobriety, intraoperative fluid loss, and ventilation.
Changes in the Starling forces - in particular the vascular permeability - possibly play a role here, without these having been investigated in more detail to date.
The discussion about the results of open surgical procedures on the spine, in particular about surgical complications, e.g. B the so-called one. In the past, post-discotomy syndrome has led to the search for and use of less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation.
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are techniques that build on different intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as e.g. B of discography, retroperitoneal disc windows, or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures and partly endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed since the 70s to clinical maturity since the 1970s.
Patient-treatment outcomes vary from approx. 30% good and very good up to almost 100% good and very good results depending on the author and study.
It is striking here that the prospective randomized trials that have comparison groups - whether conservative or surgically treated patient groups - are very rare.
Here, the results of the intradiscal treatment procedures are assessed more critically and with lower success rates than those z. T’ s. retrospectively, representations of individual techniques were examined, which, while often have very large numbers of cases, cannot stand up well to hard scientific criteria of study design.
Overall, it can be stated that percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only treat a partial region of lumbar disc disease, since a limited indication is required for successful therapy.
At present, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures tend to have to be limited to a smaller number of cases compared to endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With more than 1 million applications worldwide, arterial occlusion systems have established themselves as an essential part of invasive cardiology.
This review compares the four closure systems available today: VasoSeal( VS), Angio-SealTM( AS), Perclose, Inc., etc.
( PC) and DuettTM ( DU) in their significance when used after coronary interventions for use.
The published data on the application success rate for VS, AS, PC and DU are 88%, 91%, 90% and 98% to 100% respectively.
Hemostasis times are 5- 13', 2- 4', 11- 19' and 4- 14' with mobilization times of 6- 9 h, 6- 8h, 4- 7h, and 2- 6h, with mobilization times of 6- 9 h, 6- 8h, 4- 7h, and 2- 6h.
Minor complications are described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3% and 2.1%, major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4% and 2.6%, major complications in 5.3%, and 2.6%, respectively.
Although none of the closure systems was able to show a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared to manual compression, all have documented a significant decrease in hemostasis time.
The increased well-being of the patients is mainly due to the removal of the lock immediately after the coronary intervention.
Arterial occlusion systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by shortening the length of stay.
For the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended that vitrectomy include the posterior vitreous cortex and, if necessary, the vitreous cortex. remove epiretinal membranes from the retina to relieve the macula of the presumed intravitreal traction forces.
In addition to these structures, we have also been pulling the internal membrane limitans ( MLI) from the retina in the vicinity of the foramen for some time now.
The clinical results and ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomized trials comparing thrombolysis and primary dilatation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left bundle branch block, non-diagnostic first electrocardiogram, a Pr‰ hospital time of>= 12 h, or an unknown Pr‰ hospital time.
In order to describe these patient groups and to compare the influence of lysis and primary dilatation, we examined the data from the" Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction"( MITRA) study.
Drug addict who died in a hepatic coma 5 days after the onset of initial symptoms of fulminant viral hepatitis.
Serological diagnostics revealed healed hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C and superinfection with the delta virus ( delta hepatitis only detected postmortem) .
This has led to a protracted fat embolism( above ground) in the pulmonary circulation with consecutive extravasation and deposition of the fat in alveolar macrophages.
In 40 Alzheimer's patients, 5 patients with dementias of other causes and 36 cognitively normal control subjects, the tau protein in the cerebrospinal fluid was determined.
Of the Alzheimer's patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease ( sum value in the mini mental state test 25 to 28 points) .
A significant increase in tau was also measured in these compared to the control subjects.
A less pronounced increase in tau was seen in patients with other dementias.
In Alzheimer's patients, there was no quantitative correlation between the increase in tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficit determined by SPECT and SPECT.
The results are an indication that tau may also be elevated in the pre-dementia stage of Alzheimer's disease and is suitable as a biological indicator for early detection.
In the last decade, an unusual bilirrobial intertriginous dermatosis has been described in a total of 16 patients suffering from an autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was sterile pustular dermatitis v. a in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically, subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophilic pustulations were impressive.
The present work describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosis remains a major problem after reconstructive vascular surgery.
Proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation, and remodeling processes are accepted as underlying pathogenesis mechanisms.
Decreased programmed cell death ( apoptosis) could also contribute to restenosis by prolonging the survival time of intimal cells resulting in cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy samples of 25 primary and 14 restenosis lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were analyzed by TUNEL test ( TdT- mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling; TdT- mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimal hyperplasia correlated more with re- than with primary stenosis origin and was thereby due to an increased density of smooth muscle cells ( mean cell densities: cell densities:) .
As a key finding of this study, hypercellular restenosis tissue showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques ( 14% vs. 14%) . 27 %;
Interestingly, ultrastructural studies showed a significantly lower proportion of intimal plaque cells, especially smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological features for apoptosis( 3% vs. 3%) . 13%;
In contrast, there was no difference in the incidence of necrosis between the two types of plaque ( 0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/cell;
Thus, our data point to apoptosis rather than necrosis as the underlying form of cell death, with differences between both lesion types with significantly reduced apoptosis in cell-rich restenosis.
The present findings suggest that decreased apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimal hyperplasia, as commonly detectable in human restenosis after angioplasty after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas that can manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
Cytotoxic lymphocytes are followed by a detailed description of clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphomas.
The current incidence of microbially caused( infectious) endocarditis( IE) is seven cases per 100 with seven cases. Accept 1, 000 people per year and have been rising continuously for years.
The prognosis is largely dependent on rapid confirmation of the diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy.
In the case of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the clinical examination, which is usually diagnostic.
Culture-negative endocarditis requires either the cessation of an untargeted antibiotic therapy and verification of the blood culture techniques used or the application of serological/molecular biological techniques to identify the causative pathogen.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with a potentiating toxic effect are used.
Large ( > 10 mm) vegetations on the mitral valve are associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, so that they usually represent an independent indication for surgery, especially if the minimum bactericidal concentration of the most favorable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 μg/ml.
In the first three weeks after the manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolisms are associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral embolisms are not a contraindication to heart-lung machine surgery if a primary cerebral hemorrhage has been ruled out by cranial computed tomography and surgery early before a post-apoplectic blood-brain barrier disorder develops ( < 72 hours) . ) is performed.
A significant improvement in prognosis through early surgical intervention has also been proven for disease progressions complicated by myocardial insufficiency ( particularly as a result of acute valve insufficiency), by the occurrence of acute renal failure, by an infection of primary aortic valve vegetation on the anterior mitral leaflet, or by sepsis persisting for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy are complicated by persistent sepsis despite antibiotic therapy.
Transvaginal ultrasound is particularly good at examining the embryonic brain, as the large, " cystic" brain ventricles can be imaged relatively easily with transvaginal ultrasound.
However, embryology describes not only the normal embryonic anatomy, but also the development of malformations.
2 Altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with disproportion of the brain sections in which one finds either an increased or decreased amount of fluid.
4 isn’ t that amazing! Irregularity of the contours of the back.
The Infection Protection Act puts the system of notifiable diseases in Germany on a new footing.
Certain clinical pictures in the event of suspicion, illness or death must be reported ( essentially by doctors) as well as laboratory diagnostic evidence of pathogens ( to be reported by laboratories) .
The law regulates which information must be provided by the reporting parties with the report.
It also specifies which information may be forwarded by the health department.
In particular, in the case of suspicious reports or the reporting of pathogen evidence, not all of the information that is required to be transmitted will always already be available through the report, so in these cases the health authority itself must carry out investigations in order to be able to transmit the corresponding information in order to be able to transmit the relevant information.
The health authorities also have the task of merging incoming reports from doctors and laboratories and transmitting them as individual reports.
Case definitions were developed for this purpose. The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which makes it easier for the health department to compile the information that is required to be transmitted.
The transmission to the RKI then takes place via the competent state authority designated by the state.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there has been an increase in the number of tumor diseases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, almost 213 died in 1998, according to data from the Federal Statistical Office. 3, 000 people as a result of a malignant disease
Cancer patients usually suffer from a variety of physical and psychological dysfunctions that, if inadequate or absent treatment, lead to a significant loss of quality of life.
Pain is the dominant symptom with correspondingly serious effects on the patient and his relatives.
Although there are therapy concepts for sufficient pain therapy from various organizations, these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
This article therefore comprehensively presents pain therapy as a crucial cornerstone in palliative medicine.
Due to the central importance of the liver as a site of synthesis of essential hemostasis components and its functional role in the retikoendothelial system, liver diseases lead to reduced values of hepatically synthesized hemostasis factors and signs of increased turnover of plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolysis by laboratory analysis.
In the case of compensated hemostasis disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic therapy of the hemostasis disorder.
If this unstable condition is further disturbed by various noxae, bleeding usually occurs clinically with more or less constellation of findings similar to consumption coagulopathy or hyperfibrinolysis and only exceptionally thromboembolism occurs.
Avoidance of astigmatism induction after sutureless corneal cataract surgery.
As part of fall prevention, u will be used as part of fall prevention. a a routine review of the medication is required.
In a random sample of 276 hospital patients over 75 years of age, it was investigated how often drugs are prescribed that can increase the risk of falling by possibly causing dizziness.
Between the individual cardiac centers, the amount of bleeding differs up to 8 times from the same mediastinal drainage after cardiac surgery in adults.
Excessive postoperative bleeding leads to increased blood transfusion rates in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically assessed in detail.
Avoidance of preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin, use of autologous blood, and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogeneic transfusions.
Perioperative maintenance and rapid restoration of normothermia significantly improves hemostasis.
Recognition of a medical discipline as an independent specialty at European level depends on its inclusion in the European Union medical directives.
Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989 with perseverance and great effort.
The UEMS Section for Stomatology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was the forum for discussion of the relevant problems among the representatives of the Member States and with the services of the European Commission.
Thanks to their work, MKG surgery is today, at the end of the 20th century. In the 19th century, in 11 European countries with about 3800 specialists, it was recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with about 3800 specialists.
The development of otomykosis, especially after local antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
However, the spread of fungi into the middle ear can lead to serious complications.
Therefore, especially preoperatively, a rehabilitation of the external auditory canal is absolutely necessary.
However, all antifungal ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous solution of miconazol as an alternative.
Three comparative solutions, "E 153"( 3), a full electrolyte solution to i. v. Infusion, as well as Alcon- BSS( 1) and Alcon- BSS- Plus( 2), 2 balanced solutions developed for surgical procedures on the eye, were examined with regard to their possible influence on the postoperative course of inflammation after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, a cardioverter/defibrillator( ICD) was implanted in 340 patients.
The median age was 64+/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 were female, 278 were male and 62 were female.
As an underlying cardiac disease, 60% had coronary artery disease and 31% had dilated cardiomyopathy.
The ejection fraction was 38+/- 14%, and the ejection fraction was 38+/- 14%.
Indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57% and survived ventricular fibrillation resuscitation in 43% in ventricular fibrillation.
A single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients and an AV sequential or dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
A subcutaneous patch or array system was implanted in 25 patients and an epicardial patch system in 2 patients, the implantation site was abdominal in 92 patients and pectoral in 248 patients.
A total of 34 probe-related complications occurred in 33 patients( 9.7%) .
18 of the patients with a probe-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of probe-related complications was 12% for the dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators, three times that for the single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators at 4% ( p=0.05) .
In more than half of the patients( 55%), the diagnosis was made primarily on the basis of a routine X-ray examination, in a quarter( 24%) clinically( inadequate therapy deliveries, pain) and in a fifth( 21%) on the basis of electrical parameters( electrical parameters) .
The effectiveness of radiosynoviorthesis in the therapy of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, in particular chronic polyarthritis, was investigated.
In contrast to conventional computed tomography( CT), electron beam tomography( EBT) does not mechanically rotate an X-ray tube around the patient, but directs an electron beam to targets arranged semicircularly around the patient, at which the actual X-ray radiation is then produced, at which the actual X-ray radiation is then produced.
With this ultrafast technique, it has become possible to obtain axial cross-sectional images of the heart in 50 resp. To generate 100 ms and to precisely image all structures of the heart with a spatial resolution< 0.5 mm2< to precisely image all structures of the heart with a spatial resolution< 0.5 mm2.
The acquisition of 30-40 axial, ECG-triggered cross-sectional images ( layer thicknesses 2-3 mm) in a short period of apnea allows the complete, three-dimensional imaging of the heart of a patient.
The detection of coronary calcification with EBT must be regarded as currently the most sensitive non-invasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis including its early forms.
The method is particularly suitable for assessing the course after angioplasty and aortocoronary bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method are to be seen in respiratory and movement artifacts as well as superimposition of the coronary arteries by veins and by pronounced coronary calcifications, assuming a stable sinus rhythm.
Nevertheless, clinically assessable, non-invasive imaging of coronary arteries has already become possible with EBT so far, and these may be optimized by further technical progress.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has become the vessel of choice over the past 25 years.
In addition to the established method of angiography, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a non-invasive imaging method for examining this vessel.
In the preoperative evaluation of 117 patients, a high proportion of patients showed a consistent examination result compared to angiography.
While in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile corresponding to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle is dominated by a high systolic component, a postoperative adaptation to the coronary arterial flow bed occurs in the form of an increased diastolic flow component.
These non-invasive findings of transthoracic duplex sonography could be confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is also a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography in the assessment of the revascularization result postoperatively.
In view of the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this non-invasive procedure should become increasingly important.
Dissektions of peripheral arteries particularly affect male, hypertonic patients over 60 years of age, who characteristically have cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are a distinct rarity.
Here, young patients with or without a history of immediate trauma predominate.
Based on a case of traumatic dissection of the A. The etiology, pathogenesis, symptoms and morphological findings of aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed, taking into account cases described in the literature, in a 7-year-old girl.
The article shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adaptation of old-age and nursing homes.
The adaptation is intended to strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, profile their core competencies and force the management of core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposed ideal models; rather, it is the task of the management bodies to develop and enforce home-specific solutions, taking into account the respective framework conditions, and to follow suit.
A phenotypically female newborn of the 37 is reported to have been a newborn. SSW, which under the picture of renal insufficiency on the 14th. Day of life passed away.
The child showed a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and an unusually pronounced, diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic testing ensured the diagnosis of Drash syndrome.
Since the late 1960s, accidents have been among the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in Western industrialized nations.
While accidents involving older children and adolescents mostly occur in road traffic and are consistently recorded or recorded. No current epidemiological data in Germany are documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infancy and toddlerhood, which preferably occur during domestic activities.
As part of a study on the efficacy of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we were able to prospectively assess the frequency of accidental hospitalizations in 10 cases between 1991 and 1994. 271 infants and toddlers in Germany are recorded and analysed.
2 cases( female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts are reported, which had caused a long-standing lumbalgiform complaint.
In both cases, there was a micturition disorder in the sense of pollakisuria.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Imaging magnetic resonance imaging( MRI) can detect the passage of contrast-enriched blood through the heart muscle and even allows a quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical use of this method is delayed on the one hand by the difficulty of image evaluation and on the other hand by the fact that only one slice per heartbeat can be imaged with conventional techniques.
New developments in both magnetic resonance imaging and accelerated imaging strategies make it possible to assess perfusion over the entire heart muscle with a resolution in the range of 2 mm.
As an example of such an imaging technique, a fast ( 130 ms per image) segmented gradient echo planar sequence with a preceding saturation pulse is discussed and results in an infarct patient are presented.
The clinical benefit of MRI-based determination of perfusion for the diagnosis of coronary diseases is enhanced by the diversity of MRI methods for determining cardiac function parameters.
Since the blood flow conditions in ligament ruptures are an essential parameter, especially with regard to the chances of success of surgical care, the vascularization of the medial knee ligament should be presented in the present work.
The special blood flow situation was investigated by means of microangiography on 21 cadaveric specimens by means of microangiography.
This showed a supply from proximal through 1 or 2 main vascular trunks, which ran preferentially in the ventral parts of the ligament.
Vessel density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
In view of the lower vascularization of the distal ligament components, we would recommend ligament reconstruction by means of fibrin bonding here, which allows atraumatic restoration without the risk of suture-related vascular strangulation.
Every year in Germany approx. 75000 patients with coronary heart disease( approx. 75% of all heart operations) surgically treated) .
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, mainly the great saphenous vein, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive vein harvesting techniques have revolutionized bypass surgery, but today saphenectomy is largely performed by continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin for the open preparation of the great saphenous vein.
Wound healing disorders after open saphenectomy are discussed repeatedly and are the subject of every cardiac surgical follow-up treatment after coronary surgery and a reason for the appreciation of new, minimally invasive removal techniques.
The technique presented ( modified "bridge" technique) shows desirable results, in particular a very high patient satisfaction with regard to the cosmetic result and the only minor restriction by the saphenectomy wound( n) .
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation of the ventral thoracic wall with aplasia of the sternocostal portion of the m. pectoralis major, ipsilateral symbrachydactyly and occasionally associated other defects of the thoracic wall, nipple and breast.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of the co-occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been described so far.
We report another patient with this rare combined malformation.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether sICAM-1 and sE selectin levels can predict impending sepsis and the severity of sepsis at an early stage.
The range of ophthalmological journals on the World Wide Web( WWW) is already very extensive.
However, the online offerings of the various journals and publishers vary greatly in terms of quality and quantity.
In contrast to conventional publications, online publications offer many advantages, including these, e.g. B low production costs and fast, location- and time-independent availability of information.
It can be assumed that the online publications will not replace the print versions, but will be a useful addition to the existing range of information.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who had the rare form of a purely lateral elbow dislocation after a "police grab" occurred in the case of a purely lateral elbow dislocation.
The present casuistry describes the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a secondary aortoenteral fistula type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after implantation of an aortic tube prosthesis.
The preoperative diagnosis was made by upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography.
The value of preoperative diagnostics and the 2 alternative surgical therapy methods, in-situ reconstruction and extra-anatomical revascularization are discussed.
Präimplantationsdiagnostik ( preimplantation genetic diagnosis, PGD) wird in Deutschland zzt. not carried out
According to opponents of PGD in Germany, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics in Germany.
Proponents are of the opinion that, from a certain legal point of view, the Embryo Protection Act would not preclude PGD.
Against the background of this situation, PGD has not yet been carried out in Germany.
The discussion, which has been going on in Germany for a long time, is difficult to convey to scientific circles abroad.
Based on casuistries, it was to be assumed that the muscle relaxant potency of Atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracic focus of pus.
This hypothesis should be tested in a prospective clinical study.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fever of unclear genesis( FUO) as an illness developing over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature of over 38.3 degrees C on at least three days, which remains etiologically unclear even after one week of inpatient evaluation.
A quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most often hidden abscesses, endocarditis lenta, and tuberculosis.
In the present work, profilometry, a modern method for determining the skin surface structure, is presented.
With the help of a rapidly hardening plastic material applied to the skin surface in a defined measuring area, impressions of the skin are made which correspond to its negative image.
In the subsequent measurement method, the "roughness" of the skin impression is measured with the "profilometer" and the result is recorded as a diagram.
By means of a statistical program, the measurement data can be analyzed, stored and compared.
We tested this method to demonstrate possible improvements in skin surface texture after application of estrogen-containing creams to the face.
Summary The serum-whole blood water distribution ratio has been set at 1.2 in the forensic blood alcohol determination guidelines for converting serum alcohol to blood alcohol.
In an extensive multicentre study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the group of people in whom blood samples are ordered in connection with offenses under the influence of alcohol, an average distribution factor of 1.16 with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21 was measured.
In 96% of the cases, the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19, respectively. In relation to the mean, the deviation of the quotient is less than 3% in 96% of cases.
Paradoxical embolisms are well known in theory, but quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure and consecutive right-left shunt via an open foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect typically underlies the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure and consecutive right-left shunt via an open foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect.
Polymorphic diseases of children that change during growth due to reinnervation, plexus surgery and replacement surgery are difficult to classify.
A significant comparison of the different forms of therapy is only possible through the use of generally accepted evaluation standards.
Vascular injuries were diagnosed after hospital admission by palpation of the wrist pulses, clinical assessment of vascularity, and Doppler signal derivation over the wrist arteries.
Emergency surgery included fragment reduction and fixation with crossed K-wires via extensor access in the first step in all 10 children.
The subsequent assessment of the blood flow showed a pulse recurrence in 2 of the 10 children ( passive, dislocation-related vascular occlusion) .
In 8 of the 10 children, the pulse was absent, which is why the vessel had to be explored as an emergency.
Intraoperatively, we saw vascular spasm with functional vascular occlusion in 1 of these 8 children with functional vascular occlusion.
In adventitial strangulations( 2 of these 5 children), the pulse conduction to the hand occurred immediately after severing the connective tissue, strangulating tissues.
In intimal damage ( 3 of these 5 children), the affected vascular section was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with vein patch plastic.
We saw a combined vascular occlusion( mechanical-functional occlusion) in 2 of these 8 children.
At the follow-up examination, the wrist pulses could be palpated in 9 children, 9 children had a physiological signal by color duplex sonography, 1 child had a pathological, monophasic signal above the A. brachialis, A. radialis as well as A. ulnaris..
Late ischemic damage( cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann contracture) was not found in any of the children.
The assessment of elbow joint mobility revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees( range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees( range 0-15 degrees) and a lateral, normal pro- and supination of the lateral, normal pro- and supination.
The load-bearing joint axis was normal in all children compared laterally.
Cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is not very helpful for pediatricians, since pathogens can only be cultivated in 30-60% of whooping cough patients and the result is available after 3-5 days at the earliest.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.
In a randomized, double-blind parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E( 3x400mg RRR-- tocopherol acetate/ d) against diclofenac sodium( 3x50mg/ d) in inpatients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis was tested in inpatients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis.
After three weeks of treatment, a significant improvement in all clinical parameters examined was observed both under vitamin E therapy( n= 42) and under treatment with diclofenac( n= 43) .
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90min to 68min under vitamin E therapy and from 68min to 30min under diclofenac intake, from 68min to 30min under diclofenac intake.
The joint index according to Ritchie went from 56 to 46( vitamin E) or 46( vitamin E) respectively. from 49 to 34 ( diclofenac) back
Grip strength increased in both the vitamin E group and the diclofenac group.
Similarly, a significant reduction in the severity of pain was observed in both groups, assessed using a 10cm visual analogue scale to assess it.
The overall assessment of physician and patient regarding the success of the therapy was similarly positive for the two drugs.
Especially against the background of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the intake of high-dose vitamin E represents a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they can be air-filled or even over-inflated if there is a fistula to the esophagus or stomach.
Such an observation in the newborn is presented.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary anterior anomaly.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic lung processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by esophageal rupture and by Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic was repeatedly exposed to severe diabetic ketoacidosis( serum bicarbonate 7.9 or 7, respectively) within a few weeks as part of intoxication with synthetic drugs( ecstasy and speed) . 4, 3 mm / l) .
In the case of decompensated diabetic metabolism ( HbA1c initially 11.7%), insulin injections were omitted under the influence of drugs.
In addition, when the first ketoacidosis manifested, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party without adequate fluid intake at a techno party without adequate fluid intake.
The clinical picture showed peritonitic symptoms in addition to desiccosis and tachycardia;
disturbances of consciousness with agitation or agitation, respectively. Hallucinations and Hallucinations and Hallucinations are essentially related to drug intoxication.
Therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte, and insulin substitution.
The processes were uncomplicated.
A case of ball variance of a Smeloff cutter prosthesis in aortic position 24 years after implantation is reported.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiogenic shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed pronounced degeneration with yellowish discoloration, groove and crack formation with swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in terminal prosthesis dysfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
As part of a prospective study, 36 patients underwent outpatient arthroscopic treatment for osteochondrosis dissecans of the talus roll and were followed up according to a standardized protocol after 4 and 12 months.
It was found that the conventional radiological preliminary examination allows a statement about the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although more than half of the foci were located in the dorsal portions of the talus roll, these could be achieved without ankle osteotomy, tibial cannulation, or distraction.
Arthroscopy also allows partial synovectomy for concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes on the anterior edge of the tibia.
The low complication rate, short rehabilitation period, and objectively and subjectively good surgical outcome make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the upper ankle joint.
In addition to decompensated chronic heart failure, acute heart failure includes acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock.
The former can be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, while this is already greater in the case of pulmonary edema.
Therapeutically, in addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, various mechanical support systems are used.
Nevertheless, the mortality from cardiogenic shock whose cause cannot be treated is > 85%
In a double-blind study with 31 subjects, cognitive impairment was quantitatively assessed after a single oral intake of a therapeutic dose of 15 mg midazolam using a standardized and validated test procedure ( SKT) .
The disorders partially corresponded to the clinical picture of a moderate to severe transit syndrome or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, complete anterograde amnesia without a tendency to clear occurred in all subjects without a tendency to clear.
Motor coordination disorders were particularly evident by the detection of a coarse rotational nystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the period of the first 3 to 6 hours after midazolam ingestion.
Presentation of the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for the distribution of images and findings and for video conference applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows a qualitatively very good representation of the extracranial carotid current pathway in magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA) and is used in routine clinical routine angiography.
With the preferred time-of-flight ( TOF) technique, vessels can be imaged without contrast medium.
The use of ultrafast gradient echo sequences ( GES) with intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium allows first-pass imaging of the carotid arteries from the aortic arch to the skull base in less than 30 s of measurement time in less than 30 s of the measurement time.
In this thesis, the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.
For a qualitatively optimal contrast-enhanced MRA ( CE-MRA), the correct timing of the amount and flow rate of contrast-enhanced ( CM) injection and the tuning of the sequence parameters to the relatively rapid blood return from the venous sinus into the Vv. Take into accountlares.
First, a model and computer simulation were used to determine the optimal time of data acquisition regarding the presence of KM in the arteries.
This showed that 90% of the contrast is defined in the middle 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space lines.
By stepwise variation of spatial resolution, measurement time and KM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed on subjects and some patients, which enables the clinical use of CE-MRA in the area of the extracranial carotid current pathway.
The best qualitative results were achieved with a double-dose technique at an injection rate of 2 ml/s.
The time reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving the resolution.
Further investigations into the optimal KM application at the still very early state of the art are still pending.
Various preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative measures are used to prevent this complication.
Preoperative measures include delaying the date of surgery until the end of the inflammatory phase after initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program, and appropriate patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include the exact placement of the drill channels, including an arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of a graft impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension at the time of tibial graft fixation must be avoided.
postoperative measures include immediate passive stretching of the knee joint, early initiation of an exercise program, and regular clinical checks.
From the experience of our own clinic, the development of arthrofibrosis after anterior cruciate ligament surgery can be largely avoided if the above measures are taken into account.
Within the framework of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasms, surgical therapy options have essential tasks to play.
The restoration of the passage, ensuring the drainage of secretions and the reduction of pain are in the foreground.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination with the integration of all conservative therapy options.
Thus, in many cases, unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality and long hospitalization can be avoided.
The present work describes and discusses the current surgical-operative and endoscopic techniques for palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in the sick elderly is one of the most common and understudied diseases in hospitals, nursing homes or home care settings.
Depending on the type and composition of the patient population examined, a prevalence of malnutrition of up to 60% has been reported.
This leads to a lack of energy, especially in times of increased energy demand, such as acute or chronic illness, and thus combined to general malnutrition.
To accurately diagnose malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical nutritional parameters.
These enable tailor-made nutritional therapy.
The most important deficiencies in sick elderly people concern proteins, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospitalization, causes enormous healthcare costs, and is associated with a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase in the elderly, the problem of malnutrition will become more acute.
Malnutrition should therefore be given more attention by being taken seriously as a disease in its own right and integrated into the curriculum of training for doctors and nurses.
Die multivariate Hazardanalyse nach Cox weist die ELND neben Tumordicke ( Breslow) ( alternativ pT-Kategorie), Tumorlokalisation und Geschlecht des Tumorträgers als unabhängigen Prognosefaktor aus als unabhängigen Prognosefaktor aus.
In der Stratifikation nach den genannten Prognoseparametern unterscheiden sich die "beobachteten Überlebenskurven" nach Kaplan Meier "mit" und "ohne ELND" in folgenden Risikogruppen signifikant voneinander ( 5% Irrtumswahrscheinlichkeit) :
Women with> 2.5-4 mm thick melanomas on the head, neck, chest and acras;
Men with> 1.5-4 mm thick melanomas of the same localization as well as with> 2.5-4 mm thick melanomas of the arms, legs and abdomen( except acral and genitoanal localization) .
The limits of the risk area with prognostic benefit can be further specified by testing concrete risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Applicants for a driving license are not only required to have adequate eyesight, but also legally to use it "reliably".
The nystagmus patient strives for this by, for example, making him feel better. B a head- gaze compulsory posture or use other compensation mechanisms or other compensation mechanisms.
However, it is precisely these that are available to him in accordance with the applicable examination guidelines( Appendix XVII, §§ 9 a ff) . StVZO) is not allowed) .
Eruptive vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retained vellus hair in children and young adults.
A 23-year-old patient with asymptomatic comedone-like papules on the face, neck and chest is reported.
Histopathologically, epidermal cysts were found in the middle corium with preserved stratum granulosum, centrally retained keratin, and numerous vellus hairs.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex differ histopathologically and therefore represent independent clinical pictures.
Bacillary angiomatosis( BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs predominantly in HIV-infected patients.
By means of molecular biological methods, both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana were identified as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be visualized histologically using Warthin-Starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or cutaneous diseases, respectively. subcutaneously located, z. T’ s. ulcerated nodes
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bones, liver or spleen can also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with BA who had multiple cutaneous nodules and bony changes.
Treatment with erythromycin resulted in regression of all disease symptoms.
In 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries, stabilization and spondylodesis of the ventral column was performed using the thoracoscopic technique.
Due to the increase in experience, the operation times could be significantly reduced.
At the beginning of the series, conversion to the open procedure was performed in 2 patients.
Our own experience proves the basic feasibility of minimally invasive care.
Significant advantages over the open method are reduced access morbidity, reduced need for painkillers, early functional recovery and a shortened inpatient stay.
Operationsziel Übungsstabile Osteosynthese des Humerus mit solidem, intramedullären Verriegelungs משתagel in nichtaufgebohrter Technik.
Mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to narrowing of the subacromial space is considered a possible cause of supraspinatus outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method for the improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and for the assessment of acromion shape in three-dimensional reconstructed computed tomography( CT) .
The acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal sections and compared on the healthy and diseased side.
The acromion shape was compared with the Bigliani classification in the conventional X-ray image.
The term primary chronic osteomyelitis encompasses various clinical pictures that should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the first are often bacterial, the second can be found in the second. Group no pathogen detected.
Especially the multifocal forms ( chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) tend to recur, have a long course and can also show skin involvement ( SAPHO syndrome) .
The biopsy serves primarily to rule out a tumor and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
Histological differentiation between these chronic forms of osteomyelitis does not exist.
Social work with the elderly is not justified per se in a demographically aging society, but must prove its social usefulness under the changing conditions of age structure change.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding need for professional orientation and has triggered the search for a consensual and more attractive performance profile in the fields of action of social work with the elderly.
Using the method of direct immunofluorescence, we were able to detect linear deposits of IgG-lambda-L-chains, an early component of complement C1q, and discrete C3 deposits along the preserved elastic fibers in the dermis, especially in the stratum papillare, in the patient the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and valvular glands and in the walls of the small vessels.
In this regard, our case can be considered unique in the literature.
The hand is extraordinarily exposed in daily use and thus highly exposed to injury.
In addition to vitality and sensitivity, the diverse functions of the hand also require undisturbed motor skills and stability.
In the case of the most severe injuries, very often only residual or replacement functions can be gained.
Complex trauma to the hand results in combined, extensive damage to the soft tissues and bony skeleton with acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
In principle, comprehensive first aid is sought.
Due to the multiple damage, extensive debridement is in the foreground.
The destroyed tissue parts are primarily reconstructed as far as this is possible.
This is followed by microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves at the site.
In the case of exposed bones or tendons, the skin mantle is replaced by a pedunculated or free microsurgical skin flap.
In the case of a long period of ischemia, this concept is departed from insofar as the blood flow is restored first, the blood flow is restored first.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are presented in an overview.
In the healing outcome of a complex hand injury, every recovered or created function of the hand counts.
It is therefore not justifiable to take care of such a serious injury in a special department without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local requirements.
Treatment of symptomatic coronary artery disease with balloon dilatation( PTCA) or bypass surgery is possible according to the results of 5 large, randomized trials with comparable clinical success and risk.
After PTCA, however, the number of reinterventions is significantly higher after PTCA.
In the long-term course, according to the BARI study, mortality in diabetic patients was lower in the operated group in diabetic patients.
The individual therapy recommendation by the attending physician has also proven to be an important factor in the prognosis of the patient.
The influence of the newer techniques ( stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomized trials.
A 34-year-old patient with the rare clinical picture of parakeratosis variegata is reported to have occurred 4 years after pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta after a period of 4 years after pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta.
For a possible pathogenetic relationship of these diseases from the group of parapsoriasis changes with each other and with regard to each other and with regard to parapsoriasis changes. To investigate their relationship to low-malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T-cell type, we performed histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic analyses by means of histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular genetic analyses.
While both diseases showed characteristic histological changes as well as a predominant lymphocytic epidermotropic T cell infiltrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor within both changes could not be confirmed.
Thus, we interpret both diseases as separate entities and in this case without reference to low-malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T cell type.
A histological statement on the location of a tumor-suspected lesion in the biopsy and its relationship to the resection edge ( R 0 or R 1) must be as accurate and free of doubt as possible.
We report on 2 technical aids that, in our experience, are particularly useful on breast excisions:
1) Radiopaque sutures, applied intraoperatively, facilitate the correlation of postoperative X-ray findings and biopsy replacement.
Contact of sevoflurane with the CO2 absorbers of the anesthetic circuits produces compound A, which could have nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been conducted in volunteers aimed at analyzing the effects of Compound A on kidney function.
A total of three studies in volunteers investigated the effects of 8-hour anesthesia with a sevoflurane concentration of 3 vol. %, with fresh gas flows of approx. each 2 L / min were used.
The first published study by Eger et al. Increased excretion of protein, glucose, and enzymes from renal tubular cells in the urine of subjects was described after sevoflurane.
Subsequent investigations then found either irrelevant changes or even no changes at all in the renal excretion of these parameters of renal function.
Another study also examined 3 volumes in subjects. % Sevoflurane administered over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min had been administered.
No significant excretion of protein, glucose or renal enzymes was found.
In any case, the transfer of these results into clinical practice must take into account the experimental nature of the anaesthesia performed in these studies.
Although the topic of low-flow anesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, the studies in the volunteers, as well as the results of new clinical investigations, indicate that renal function after surgery under low-flow conditions behaves similarly to that after isoflurane under low-flow conditions.
So far, there is no published experience in the therapy of paraphilias ( pedophiles, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulse actions with LHRH ( lutein-releasing hormone) agonists in German-speaking countries.
In this study, we describe 11 patients treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate in a 12-month study period.
During the treatment period, there were no further sexually aggressive acts and, according to the patients, a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges, and fantasies occurred, according to the patients.
One patient died by suicide by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic methods seem to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its possible carcinogenic effects.
Therefore, we examined five different intraoperative warming measures for their effectiveness.
Baker and co-workers first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the ultrapulse CO2 laser, an advanced device is available that enables other applications in ophthalmology.
The diagnosis of thrombosis in the peripheral veins is now possible with almost 100% certainty using both phlebography and duplex sonography.
It is linked to the high qualification of the examiner.
In Germany, both methods are available nationwide.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnostics, but duplex sonography has become of paramount importance due to its lack of invasiveness.
When special questions are involved, phlebography cannot be dispensed with.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the application of the two procedures is practiced as a "golden partnership" when it comes to comprehensive documentation.
Chronic rejection is the most important unresolved problem in kidney transplantation today.
The aim of the present study was to clarify whether reendothelialization or reepithelialization by extrarenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the transplant remains allogeneic.
Against this background, we examined 9 explanted transplant kidneys from opposite-sex donors using non-radioactive in situ hybridization ( NISH) .
We used biotinylated centromere-specific DNA probes for human chromosomes Y and X. In a further step, mono- or mono- were performed, respectively. polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, actin, factor VIII and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in graft vasculopathy.
Our study was able to show that even several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular, and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the transplant were the inflammatory cells, which are mainly composed of T lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, Doppler sonographic detection of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the German Medical Association as one of the methods shortening the waiting time until the final diagnosis of brain death.
The aim of a survey was to clarify the extent to which Doppler sonography has been used in this context since then and what experiences have been made.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurological( 272) and neurosurgical( 128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used as a decision-making tool to determine brain death, mostly in conjunction with other methods.
When asked whether false positive findings had occurred, "yes" was ticked 5 times.
The discussion revealed that borderline situations were deliberately reported by the investigators, in which borderline situations were e.g. T’ s. the prerequisites were also not fully met in the first place either.
In none of these cases was ultrasound used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a not inconsiderable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision-making aid for the diagnosis of brain death, essentially to further secure the diagnosis, less frequently than the sole method shortening the waiting time.
Microsomal heme oxygenase( HO) is exclusively responsible for the endogenous formation of CO, which is present as a constitutive enzyme( HO-2) and in a stress-inducible isoform( HO-1 or heat shock protein 32) .
Therefore, in the present work, the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducible isoform of the enzyme was investigated after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy.
Glycerol leads to a transformation of crystalline lipid structures in the stratum corneum lipids into liquid-crystalline states.
Especially when used in O/W emulsion, it improves the hydration of the horny layer to a considerable extent that is well above the urea effect, especially when used in O/W emulsion.
In addition, it promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the horny layer and thus horny layer exfoliation.
especially in the case of long-term use, the deformation of the skin in the suction test can be intensified by glycerol.
The roughness of the skin surface is also influenced by glycerol-containing preparations in the sense of smoothing.
When used in O/W emulsions, glycerol also has a protective effect against surfactants and lipophilic pollutants when used in O/W emulsions.
This is probably due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerol causes a flux from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, glycerol, similar to urea, can lead to an improvement in drug penetration.
Stabilization of posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by means of a posterior bone block and capsular plasty.
Complications of the long-term course resulting from degeneration of venous grafts can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to prolonged operative times and increased surgical trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have so far only been used in exceptional cases.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques( skeletonization of arterial conduits/ T- graft configuration) .
Material and methods:
Between 3/96 and 7/99, 405 patients with coronary multivessel disease underwent complete arterial revascularization in our clinic.
Alle Operationen wurden mit maximal 2 skelettierten Grafts durchgeführt, in 105 Patienten ( 25, 9%) bilaterale Arteriae thoracicae internae, in 299 Patienten ( 73, 8%) Arteria thoracica interna und Radialarterie und in 1 Patienten ( 0, 3%) 1 Radialarterie 1 Radialarterie ( 1 Patienten ( 0, 3%) 1 Radialarterie.
In 346 Patienten ( 85, 4%) erfolgte die Implantation der beiden arteriellen Grafts in T-Konfiguration.
On average, 4.1+/- 0.9 coronary vessels were anastomosed per patient.
Hospital mortality was 2%, the hospital mortality rate was 2%.
Sternal wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
Complications after removal of the radial artery were not recorded except for temporary paresthesia.
In angiographic control 1 week postoperatively, 96.7% of coronary anastomoses were free of stenosis> 50%>.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletal arteries and the T-graft technique is a safe procedure for the treatment of coronary artery disease.
Low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow their routine use.
The different treatment methods for periprosthetic femoral fracture after endoprosthetic replacement of the knee joint are discussed.
A new method of treating such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system( LISS, Synthes) is described and the first clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has been given a key position within neuromonitoring, although intracranial pressure does not allow the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron to be registered directly and only with a time delay.
A prerequisite for a reliable measurement of intracranial pressure are specific properties of intracranial pressure probes, which will be investigated in the following.
These are to be analyzed and categorized from a metrological point of view in order to gain a better understanding of their different functioning and measurement properties.
Partial sphincterectomy is practiced in the context of cataract surgery with a very narrow pupil( < 3 mm) .
We assume that the narrow pupil is mainly caused by a fibrosis ring of the M. sphincter pupillae is caused by sphincter pupillae.
While the health-related quality of life of adults has been increasingly researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
In the present work published in the literature, works on the topic of health-related quality of life of children are evaluated with regard to focal points and methods of research.
The overview shows that empirical work has been rare so far, and the existing measuring instruments for children's quality of life are described.
Increased research activities are necessary in order to be able to use the recording of children's quality of life in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were recorded during the last 5 days before the onset of acute renal failure and compared with a control group.
Andy Warhol underwent dermabrasion in 1957 because of skin changes that must be classified as incipient rhinophyma on the basis of the available biographical material, a dermabrasion was performed in 1957 by Andy Warhol.
Throughout his entire artistic creative phase, the artist's preoccupation with aspects of plastic surgery, particularly in the nasal area, can be demonstrated.
As one of the founders of Pop Art, Warhol has had a significant impact on modern society with his entire work, thereby also influencing our demands on aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the program HepaVision ( MEVIS, Bremen), specially developed for the 3D visualization of the liver, was used and evaluated for the individual planning of extensive liver resections and living liver donations.
Experience with the program is available so far for> 50 volume data sets of biphasic spiral CT examinations.
After active non-specific immunotherapy has had an adjuvant and palliative effect on the survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It involves gene transfer, which can be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma, the options include:
Vaccination with tumor-specific, HLA-associated antigens by means of peptides or "naked DNA", vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with a cytokine gene or with B7, adoptive immunotherapy with in vitro propagated specific T cells, transfected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or Transfection of tumor cells in vivo with a tumor suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of falsification tendencies ( "defense") of some patients on the evaluation of therapy results could not be accurately assessed so far.
In 309 inpatients treated with conversational psychotherapy and followed up one year later, it is shown to what extent raters on the CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES scales can be influenced by defensive attitudes of the patients measured with validity scales of the personality tests MMPI- K, FPI- R and Giessen test: The validity scales of the personality tests MMPI- K, FPI- R and Giessen test were measured:
the tendency to put oneself in a favorable light( " social desirability"), and the tendency to appear inconspicuous- normal) .
Their relative improvements( effect size rating scales) are smaller as their openness increases( validity scales) . - Inpatient talk psychotherapy strengthened the immune system in aggravating patients and reduced it in dissimulating patients.
Despite early conservative and subsequently timely surgical treatment of congenital clubfoot adapted to the severity of the deformity, approx. 25% reported recurrences and residual deformities requiring treatment.
The main cause seems to be the lack of concentric reduction and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
Forefoot adduction and supination is shown to be the most common deformity.
From the experience of 94 operated recurrent/residual clubfeet( patients< 10 years), the age-dependent surgical procedure is presented.
whats going on lol oh wait i can just google it. up 10 For years of age, midfoot osteotomies, correction according to Ilizarov with external fixator and, as a last resort, triple arthrodesis are used for the application of triple arthrodesis.
Nevus cell nevi show a pronounced variability in their clinical morphology.
We report on a 77-year-old female patient with a pedunculated, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus on the trunk.
We propose the expression" nevus corymbiformis" for this grape-like appearance.
For ethical and socio-economic reasons ( cost explosion in transfusion, individual patient fate), the further development and consistent application of blood-saving measures in medicine represents a challenge for anesthesiologists, surgeons and transfusion physicians.
The combination of different methods, such as: B Preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative hemodilution, choice of anesthetic procedure, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics and machine autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, allow to spare transfusion of allogeneic blood even to patients with large intraoperative blood losses.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis( 1798-1848), director of the Kiel Birth Center and the Midwifery School, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetric medicine.
He focused his research and teaching on the empirically comprehensible.
His major work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determination of the pelvic dimensions and inspection of the Michaelis diamond named after him provided him with a reliable prognosis about the risks of the birth process.
Honesty and conscientiousness were the hallmarks of his research:
Self-critically, he published medical failures, critically examining new theories.
He was the first in Germany to confirm Semmelweis' teaching on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
Out of despair over the death of many patients in the childbed, for which he was partly responsible, he committed suicide in 1848.
In one case, the tumor is likely to be responsible for a long-standing known conduction disorder ( AV block) and for the sudden onset of death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS) is a non-invasive, painless procedure that can be used to trigger temporary stimulus effects in circumscribed cortex areas in humans.
New applications for functional-anatomical questions on language lateralization, memory functions and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and previous experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations for safety of application are given.
Neurinomas of the N. Facialis are rare, benign tumors that usually occur in the course of the distal intratemporal section of the nerve, grow extratemporal, and are then noticed as an extracranial mass.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial nerve palsy.
The patient complained of diffuse dizziness, progressive left sensorineural disturbance and mild peripheral facial nerve palsy without deficit of tear secretion.
The neurinoma was detected by computed tomography( CT) and magnetic resonance imaging( MRI) .
Via an extradural" middle fossa approach", the tumor became without injury to the motor N without injury. The face is removed.
This is the first report of an isolated neurinoma of the N. major petrosus without affection of the facial motor nerve.
Status epilepticus( SE) is when there is a continuous seizure or multiple seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness, between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
The initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients, if unsuccessful, phenytoin and phenobarbital are used if unsuccessful.
Refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialized intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the most appropriate course of action is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are alternatively applicable active substances.
For the treatment of an obsolete rupture of the tendon of the M. Either tendon transposition or tendon transplantation is recommended for tibialis anterior is recommended.
The surgical treatment with an augmented reversal plastic is described on the basis of a case study;
3 years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively symptom-free with a good functional result.
Reverse plastic surgery has the advantage that there are no functional losses compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance provides valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment strategies for many clinical pictures.
The main purpose of recording this parameter in intensive care patients is the analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well-defined and tested in large prospective studies.
In contrast, ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and prognosis in chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intensive research activities.
The aim is to validate the validity of these clinical pictures.
Sepsis and MODS, diseases that are particularly relevant for intensive care medicine, are also associated with an impairment of autonomic function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability, and are also associated with an impairment of autonomic function measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
The limitation of heart rate variability in such patients is an indication of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ( "Uncoupling of biological oscillators") .
This idea seems to be gaining increasing appeal in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report 3 patients with acquired green discoloration of scalp hair.
History revealed that all 3 patients regularly bathed in the private swimming pool.
Examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed an excessively high copper content as the cause of the green discoloration after the green discoloration.
Based on our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic link between this exogenous hair discoloration and the absorption of copper by swimming water in our own swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction and subjectively assessed health before and at different times after heart transplantation ( HTx) .
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint form, assessment of global quality of life, Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List ( MLDL), Expected resp. underwent changes after HTx.
In the evaluation, individual measured values were represented by median( Me), mean( M) and standard deviation( SD) .
Preoperatively, 84% of terminal heart failure patients rated their quality of life as very poor; Preoperatively, 84% of terminal heart failure patients rated their quality of life as very poor;
already 6 weeks postoperatively, this parameter improved, and 74% of the transplant recipients found their quality of life to be very good to excellent.
Patients were also very dissatisfied with their physical performance ( 87%) and health condition ( 80%) preoperatively, too, with their physical performance ( 87%) and health condition ( 80%) .
Six weeks after transplantation, these areas improved significantly, with 76% of patients showing a high level of satisfaction with health status and 51% with physical performance.
Although the patients rated their psychological well-being as good even before HTx, this parameter improved postoperatively and reached significantly higher values after one year ( preoptive
Range ( R) =3, 78 vs. 12 months. loool - now, I think my girlfriend pronounces this, but she says that this one would rhyme with "spool" but I think it's the drawn out "o".
Quality of life correlated best with health status before HTx( r= 0.61, p< 0.01), 6 months after transplantation best with satisfaction with health status( r= 0.76, p< 0.01) .
The areas of sexuality, professional situation and leisure activities improved after HTx only at approx. 28% der Patienten.
90% suffered from one or more complaints after transplantation, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal heart failure, all areas of quality of life with the exception of mental well-being improve significantly as early as 6 weeks after HTx, except psychological well-being.
Despite excessive expectations and postoperative complaints, heart transplant recipients are significantly more satisfied with their postoperative life situation.
A 36-year-old man suffered isolated traumatic brain injury( SHT) with skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma, and contusion hemorrhage after a bicycle fall[ Abbreviated Injury Scale( AIS) :
The space-occupying hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP levels necessitated a barbiturate coma over 10 days.
To make matters worse, the patient developed on the 8th. Day after trauma, septic lung failure.
The patient showed a protracted course and could only be transferred to neurorehabilitation 57 days after the accident.
Subsequently, the patient developed a massive restriction of mobility in both hip joints ( extension/flexion:
0 Grad/10 Grad/20 Grad, links:
Abduktion/ Adduktion:
10 Grad/0 Grad/25 Grad, links:
The pelvic overview and computed tomography revealed ankylosing heterotopic ossifications( HO) of both hip joints( Brooker type IV) .
The HO were removed 2 years after the accident in two stages via a Smith-Petersen approach in each case.
The HO recurrence prophylaxis was carried out by means of a single preoperative irradiation ( 8 Gy) and a postoperative administration of indomethacin ( 150 mg/day) over 3 months.
The range of motion at the hip joints is 15( left) or 15( left) respectively. 12( right) months after resection as follows:
20 Grad/0 Grad/30 Grad, links:
Abduktion/Adduktion:
30 Grad/0 Grad/40 Grad, links:
Radiologically, there has been no recurrence of HO so far.
The patient can pursue light activities as a farmer 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) was developed.
The primers "TR1" and "TR2" flank a 581 bp long sequence within the gene encoding the small ribosomal subunit ( 18S rRNA) of fungi.
By means of PCR, the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes could be amplified, as well as that of some yeast and mold fungi.
Hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides enabled the identification of dermatophytes and Candida albicans.
Restriction fragment analysis allowed dermatophytes to be differentiated from yeast and mold fungi.
The specificity of PCR for fungi was tested on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermis samples as well as on selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were examined by PCR and culture using PCR.
Dermatophytes were detected in 35 of the 38 positive patient samples with PCR and in 28 of the 38 positive patient samples with culture.
The sensitivity of PCR( 92%) was higher than that of culture( 73%) .
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture in detecting dermatophytes.
Wrist arthroscopy has contributed to the development of a better understanding of the anatomy and pathology of the wrist.
A special diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the assessment of kinematic stability.
In addition to functional radiological procedures, wrist arthroscopy is of crucial importance here.
Injuries to the ulnar disc and scapholunar ligaments are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications for arthroscopic surgery.
The analysis of mitochondrial DNA has found increasing application in forensic medicine, archaeology, evolutionary and population genetic studies over the past decade.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA with special attention to the non-coding hypervariable regions is described.
Furthermore, the importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biological investigations is discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases and requirements for their scope and structure are explained.
Results of experimental work aimed at obtaining mitochondrial DNA from soil-bearing teeth, hair shafts and contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases are presented, which could be clarified with the help of mtDNA analysis.
The aim of the presented work is to present the findings reported in the literature as well as own observations.
Microperimetric investigations after surgical extraction of choroidal neovascularization membranes( CNV) in age-related macular degeneration( AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma develops in the area of the resulting loss of pigment epithelium.
The surgical effort must be weighed against the possible functional results of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging( MRI) with its high soft tissue contrast is the imaging method of choice for imaging the intra-articular structures and the surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for diagnosing labrum lesions of the hip joint.
MR arthrography( MRA) of the hip joint allows direct imaging of labrum lesions by distension of the joint space and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional ( 3D) sequences enable assessment in the crucial cranioventral sections.
Labrum lesions can be classified into different, clinically relevant stages with MRA.
In addition, the visualization of concomitant lesions ( intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress edema) is also possible.
In a study we conducted with surgically verified cases, MRA showed excellent sensitivity( 90%) and accuracy( 91%) .
No complications have occurred in the more than 100 arthrographies performed to date.
Based on this experience, MRA is the method of choice for imaging diagnostics of labrum lesions.
In this review, we present the technique and results of the MRA method we use.
It was shown that the varicose vein wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, of which the vein wall below a still intact venous valve was also affected.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength lay in the vein wall and here in particular in the components of the extracellular matrix.
In the synopsis of the mechanical experiments and the immunohistochemical results, the theory of primary valve destruction and subsequent varicose remodeling of the vein cannot be confirmed; it is much more likely that a change in the vein wall occurs first and thus also valve insufficiency occurs.
Arterial injuries as a direct consequence of trauma usually lead to bleeding or ischemia.
In the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries, acute ischemia may be absent.
Hypothenar-Hammer syndrome is an occlusion of the distal A. Ulnaris as a result of trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually gradual and only a targeted duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to a diagnosis.
There are no proven therapy recommendations.
The diagnosis of the occlusion of the ulnar artery as a consequence of the accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible in the first place.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the medium-term regulation of eye pressure after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
The combinations of anesthesia induction and anesthesia maintenance with propofol result in a reduced incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( PONV) in total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA) compared to other anesthetic drugs or techniques ( PONV) .
This article will show how best to take advantage of the antiemetic effect of propofol.
The possible effect of propofol on the cortex cerebri and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems are discussed using results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol with regard to incidence reduction of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
Prediction of postoperative soft tissue aesthetics after combined orthodontic prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic edentulous upper jaw by a repositioning osteotomy with sinus lift and insertion of endosseous implants is rarely included in preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept was determined in 23 patients on the basis of the preparation of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skull and a soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging, with special consideration of anterior tooth aesthetics.
In 8 patients, the surgical and/or prosthetic treatment concept was modified due to the preoperative planning, due to the surgical and/or prosthetic treatment concept.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and aesthetic results achieved.
Profile prognosis with video imaging means a useful decision-making aid when planning rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla in order to take into account the mutually influencing factors - extent of maxillary advancement, insertion direction of endosseous implants and type of superstructure - to take into account the mutually influencing factors - extent of maxillary advancement, direction of insertion of endosseous implants and type of superstructure - in order to take into account the mutually influencing factors - extent of maxillary advancement, direction of superstructure of endosseous implants, and type of superstructure - of superstructure.
A large nodular multicenter juvenile xanthogranuloma is reported, whose unusual clinical and histological aspect initially did not allow the diagnosis.
The spontaneous regression, which has now lasted more than 2 years, with the change from the primary monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells, as well as the lack of detection of specific cell organelles, were able to secure the nature of the disease.
Thymus preparations, among others, are offered on the German pharmaceutical market for the treatment of rheumatic diseases.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with inadequate and sometimes ethically questionable study design, as well as studies that do not allow a scientifically substantiated statement due to the short study duration and the small number of patients.
A medically justifiable therapy recommendation for thymus preparations for rheumatic diseases( e.g. B in rheumatoid arthritis) cannot currently be derived on this basis with a sufficient, according to the state of knowledge, positive benefit-risk assessment, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the A. Hepatica dextra in a 64-year-old female patient.
After initially uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding had occurred up to shock symptoms, the cause of which was difficult to determine in the condition after Billroth II gastric resection.
Die superselektive angiographische Embolisation intrahepatischer Aneurysmen ist eine risikoarme und erfolgversprechende Therapiemöglichkeit.
Studies on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic insult have shown that optimal conditions exist when the early symptoms of stroke are recognized quickly and treatment is initiated within 3 h of the onset of initial symptoms.
Valuable time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
The symptoms are not noticed or trivialized by patients, relatives or witnesses.
The increase in this number can be achieved through intensified training measures that take into account both the public and emergency medical personnel.
The standard of care in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure management, and therapy for hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.
In the context of maintenance therapy with synthetic opioids, the efficacy of sublingually administered buprenorphine in tablet form was compared with orally administered methadone in 40 opiate-dependent patients over a study period of 24 weeks.
In the randomized study, the retention rate ( = percentage of patients who remained in the study programme for the entire duration of the study and completed it as planned), additional consumption and length of stay were defined as target parameters ( = percentage of patients who remained in the study programme for the entire duration of the study and completed it as planned), additional consumption and length of stay.
At a mean daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and a mean dose of 63 mg methadone, there was a tendency regarding the retention rate( p= 0.06) in favor of the methadone-treated group.
The failure rate tended to be higher in the buprenorphine-treated group ( n=20) with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated group ( n=20) .
With regard to the additional consumption of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine, no significant difference could be found between the two during the course of treatment.
Methadone turned out to be the more successful substance in terms of length of stay in the study( p= 0.04) in terms of length of stay in the study( p= 0.04) .
How important and how meaningful clinical parameters and locoregional therapy failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinoma are for the probability of occurrence of hematogenous metastases.
Between 1 8 1990 and 1st. 10 In 1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and examined with regard to clinical parameters, reflexotalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T- category, lymph node involvement and enjoyment habits.
29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy treatment.
In 25/139 patients, a radical neck dissection was performed according to the therapy concept after completion of radiotherapy.
10/ 139 patients were later treated with an "opération de rattrappage" afterwards.
Der mediane Follow-up betrug 24 Monate( Range 4 bis 74) .
In 77/ 139( 55%), the suffering could be controlled locoregionally.
Tumor was not controlled in 62/139 patients( 45%) .
The two groups of patients, 62 patients with local therapy failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumor disease, were comparable in terms of Karnofsky index, age, gender, histological differentiation, alcohol consumption, pretherapeutic diagnostics, total dose ( Gy) and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles ( Gy) .
Tumor control was significantly co-determined by the parameters reflexotalgia( p< 0.0078), growth structure( p< 0.012), T- category( p< 0.03) and smoking( p< 0.0285) .
The median survival time of patients with locoregional therapy failure was 17 months, which was 17 months.
At that time, 81% of locally controlled patients were still alive.
Distant metastases were detected in 23%( 14/ 62) of the locoregionally uncontrolled patients, whereas only in 4/ 77( 5%) of the locoregionally cured patients( p< 0.0026) .
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most commonly lung metastases, reached a plateau after 24 months.
Locoregional tumor control, determined by several clinical parameters, is a crucial indication of the likelihood of distant metastases developing.
Failure of therapy is caused by the biological aggressiveness of the tumor.
With the introduction of multi-line detector CT ( MDCT) into clinical practice, a new dimension in volume detection and spatial and temporal resolution in CT is achieved.
However, the new technical possibilities of MDCT require a redefinition of examination strategies in order to improve existing CT applications and open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 as well as 3 own case observations were evaluated according to symptoms and current therapy of viper bites ( Vipera berus) .
The main toxic effect is the development of sometimes threatening edema;
If there are no signs of poisoning more than 2-3 hours after the event, the probability of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II reports on the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation ( EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of reparative and reconstructive procedures on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint.
The MPT fixator was applied in assembly form A in 44 patients and in assembly form B in 23 patients.
Deep infection occurred in 4 patients, which in 2 cases was caused by the fixator in 2 cases.
The 63 patients treated with the MPT fixator wore the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
5 patients with partial patellectomy and transosseous refixation of the ligament were followed up. patella in caudal debris fractures and 12 patients with transosseous suture refixation of the ligament. patellae in tearing and tearing at the lower patella pole or suture adaptation of the ligament. patellae in the case of intraligamentary rupture, in which no other supplies were made to the knee joint apart from extensor surgery, no other supplies were made to the knee joint.
In 2 patients, the result was classified as normal according to the IKDC score, in 10 as almost normal and in 4 as abnormal.
Isokinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients showed a strength deficit of the extensor muscles on the operated leg of 10-20% compared to the opposite side, compared to the other side, in only 5 of the 17 patients.
In summary, it can be stated that EPTT with the MPT fixator has proven itself in continuity-restoring procedures on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee joint and represents an efficient alternative to patellotibial dissection with wire or synthetic band material.
Thromboembolic diseases of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Newer diagnostic possibilities as well as the development of diagnostic algorithms make it possible nowadays to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic pulmonary embolism and describes diagnostic strategies whose benefits have been investigated in clinical trials.
Based on the casuistry of a 6-year-old boy, hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis caused by UVA exposure with possible eye involvement in children, is presented.
In light-exposed areas, numerous haemorrhagic blisters occur acutely at the beginning of the light-rich season, recurrent until adulthood, which heal with scarring.
As part of a field test, we gained experience in the use of the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynecology.
The central type of image in X-ray diagnostics in oral and maxillofacial surgery is the panoramic slice image.
The reduction of the dose requirement is also due to further developments in equipment technology, X-ray films and new detection systems such as new detection systems such as, for example, new detection systems. B Sensors or imaging plates have become possible.
Diagnostic inadequacies of conventional imaging modalities make imaging using computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging unavoidable for numerous clinical questions in oral and maxillofacial surgery.
Although magnetic resonance imaging v. a It is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, now it also allows changes in the cortical bone to be mapped due to the shortening of measurement times, as well as changes in the cortical bone.
Now, for the specific questions like: B Changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine procedures allow an imaging-assisted functional analysis.
Body-oriented psychotherapy is now used in inpatient and outpatient settings, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are of particular importance for patients whose body awareness is diminished, whose emotionality is limited, or who, due to character resistance, are difficult to reach in verbal psychotherapy because of character resistance, are verbal psychotherapy.
The methods most commonly used today are given with brief examples, other methods are pointed out to be carried out, and other methods are pointed out.
The factors involved are the effective factors. a the connection of affects to the vegetative and arbitrary nervous system mentioned as well as the close connection of psychological and physical processes, which exists especially at the beginning of life, which is connected with the respective experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological effects.
In further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire a symbolic meaning that is important for therapy.
The relationship of body-oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy, especially to psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Approaches to empirical research are pointed out.
Psychotherapists live in a field of tension between family ideal and reality, which have been shaped by various current and previous experiences.
The role and function in one's own family of origin often influence career choices and personal life plans.
Although psychotherapeutic activity leaves a lot of room for the individual to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy, especially for psychotherapists, to implement a family model corresponding to them and their partners.
Three models are presented and their effects are described.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic activity on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
Psychotherapists should pay the same attention to their personal relationships as they do to therapeutic relationships with patients in their education and training.
With a prevalence of 0.1%, advanced heart failure is becoming increasingly important within the patient population with cardiovascular diseases.
The 6- to 12-month survival probability is significantly limited at 50-75% at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the therapy of choice for refractory heart failure.
However, the growing mismatch between supply and demand for suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive listing for heart transplantation.
Promising new conservative and alternative surgical approaches have been developed in recent years.
Conventional drug therapy has been improved by the use of angiotensin conversion enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive beta-blockers.
Surgical therapy for advanced heart failure has expanded with the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assist hearts, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricular reduction plastic surgery, cardiomyoplasty, and multisite pacing.
These therapy options are used either as a bridging measure or as medium- and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The success of the treatment depends crucially on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
This requires the creation of risk scores based on national and international patient registers.
Using the example of a 30-bed ward at the Orthopaedic University Hospital in Bochum, the volume of TLA procedures is compared with manual therapy procedures over a period of one year.
In contrast, 122 manual therapeutic procedures were performed on the cervical spine, thoracic spine and lumbar spine by the respective ward physicians who had completed further training.
While the TLA focused on the main predilection site of the respective clinical picture ( pseudoradicular cervical and lumbar spine syndromes), manual therapy primarily referred to secondary findings in other spinal levels in patients with the aforementioned diagnoses or with postdiscotomy syndrome.
The migration of an impacted mandibular tooth from its site of attachment to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report, we present the case of migration of an impacted lower premolar into the muscular process, documented over a period of 14 years, into the muscular process.
The migration along the ascending mandibular branch into the muscular process took place after the completion of root growth, after the 20th century. Year of life of the patient instead of
Neither radiologically nor clinically were there any concrete causes for such an extensive migration in this patient.
The incidence of prostate cancer and cases curatively treatable by radical prostate vesiclectomy is increasing.
The precise pathological examination of the surgical specimens determines the staging and thus the assessment of the prognosis as well as the further clinical procedure.
Since there is no standardized method for preparation processing internationally, the comparability of different scientific studies is made more difficult.
The precisely defined, rational preservation of the preparations proposed by us is intended to remedy these problems and to help improve interdisciplinary dialogue.
The flood of requirements for documentation, performance recording, cost-effectiveness and quality control require the use of IT tools in the clinic.
Since 1992, a client-server-based OP planning and documentation system ( MedXS) has been in use at the Orthopaedic Clinic of Justus Liebig University, Giessen, which has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, the clinical-scientific requirements of the clinically active physician have been taken into account in particular.
The application includes the basic functions of patient master data management, OR planning ( scheduling of procedures, resource planning), OR documentation ( coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, clinic communication ( e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
Due to the simultaneous integration of the WEB server in MedXS, content and functions can be retrieved simultaneously via any web browser ( NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM) from the intranet or Internet.
With the use of the application, important facilitations of clinical processes have been achieved and far better conditions have been created for budget negotiations with health insurance companies.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is due to nonspecific neurological symptoms as well as v. a facial dysmorphism signs characterized by facial dysmorphism.
However, the presence of congenital leukoderma ( piebaldism, partial albinism) is considered relatively typical and mostly indicative.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy( ARVCM) is a cause of ventricular tachycardia( VT) that should not be underestimated, especially in young patients.
The therapy focuses on the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and the prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death.
Individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM have manifest heart failure, which is treated with medication according to usual therapy guidelines according to the usual therapy guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization( CGH) is a new method that can be used to examine a tumor for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that captures alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal levels.
The question of a necessary patella replacement in the context of total knee prosthesis is generally still very controversial.
In this context, our need is to obtain more information about the spontaneous development of a non-replaced patella in the prosthetic environment than only in comparison to the prosthetic patella.
The fact that for almost 5 years we have been performing patella replacement only in special cases has made available to us a patient population on which this question can be studied.
On the basis of 30 total prosthetic knees documented with a 2-year follow-up, we carried out a survey of the patellar shift and tilt, focusing first on the natural and then on the prosthetic femoral patellar sliding bearing, and compared the results with the range of motion achieved after 2 years and the pain symptoms to be persisted.
An adaptation of the bony patellar silhouette to the prosthesis plain bearing was regularly observed with compression of the marginal bone contact zone with or without a fibrous placeholder layer;
7 patients were assigned to a"residual problem group" due to their clinical follow-up because they had residual symptoms( n= 3) or mobility of only 90/0/0 degrees of flexion/ extension or less( n= 5) .
Only in this group were there cases with postoperative shift above 5 mm( n= 2) and cases with postoperative tilt above 15 degrees( n= 3) .
Within this group, complaints with a pronounced preoperative tilt and reduced mobility were also correlated with a severe preoperative shift, also with a significant difference to the problem-free collective.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the patella( 16 mm/ 39 degrees) due to aseptic tibial prosthesis loosening.
After axis-correcting change of the tibial components, this patient also became symptom-free and mobile again without any surgical measures having been performed on the patella and although a considerable residual tilt remained.
Thus, it can be concluded that for recentering to achieve a residual shift of less than 5 mm, a greater effort seems justified:
In addition to common surgical steps that favorably influence the course of the kneecap during implantation, e.g. can affect the course of the implantation. B high quadriceps displacement or medial refixation of the detached tuberosity are required.
In contrast, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated, since the non-prosthetic patella shows an amazing adaptability to the prosthetic plain bearing by remodeling the bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative deformity, in which we had not performed a replacement because of good peroperative bone quality, we had to accept more late problems even with normalized patella progression, even with normalized patella progression.
Whether there is an extended indication for patella replacement in such cases remains open.
The quality assurance program of the VDR and the publications on quality assurance of the DGRh provide the framework for external quality assurance measures.
Through the introduction of comprehensive quality management in a rehabilitation clinic, the quality could be measurably increased.
The improvements were achieved by implementing targeted measures and changing clinic structures.
So far, the focus has been on measures related to patient needs and the processing of internal treatment processes.
In order to increase employee satisfaction and qualifications, rehabilitation-specific training series were carried out to increase employee satisfaction and qualifications.
New forward-looking perspectives could be developed together with other partners.
Aim of the operation Avoidance or elimination of compression on the nerve structures.
The present work provides an overview of oncocytic metaplasia and neoplasia.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that in oncocytic cells of the parathyroid gland as well as in the liver, cirrhosis causes increased defects in the respiratory chain.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear.
It can be assumed that oncocytic metaplasias differ pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasms.
In addition, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasms.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas are preferentially found in the thyroid gland, while they are comparatively rare in other organs.
The molecular genetic mechanisms responsible for this are still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin lesions in a patient on long-term parenteral nutrition.
Similar to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, the skin changes in this patient are also based on a zinc deficiency in the organism.
The substitution of zinc leads to an impressive improvement.
53 patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with atopic dermatitis and a skin-healthy sample of 52 people are compared with each other regarding their sexual behavior.
Questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership were used as test procedures.
The skin diseases examined differ significantly from skin-healthy ones in terms of impaired sexual life.
The exchange of affection is in both sexes, the ability to orgasm is highly significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatic patients feel more impaired compared to patients with atopic dermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of patients with atopic dermatitis have never been asked about their sex life by their treating physician.
However, despite all the problems of addressing this intimate area, the doctor for skin and venereal diseases should be a competent interlocutor for questions concerning the skin disease and its consequences for sex life.
Even today, the conventional X-ray must still be regarded as a basic examination when there is a clinical question of inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential includes not only bony inflammatory destruction, but it also allows us to assess their current activity.
Furthermore, the X-ray image is able to indicate a clinical relapse situation via the collateral phenomena and to show the inflammatory volume increase of the joints and tendon sheaths directly and indirectly.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, in particular through the detailed representation of cortical bony structures - complementary to MR - offers highly specific information for some special questions, in particular on the trunk skeleton and on individual large joints, partly for the definitive diagnosis, partly also for surgical planning.
This is for you. a for the sacroiliac joints, the sternoclavicular joints and the upper cervical spine.
Nowadays, the treatment of open lower leg fractures of the II degree and III degree with simultaneous soft tissue damage includes a wide range of surgical options for primary osteosynthesis osteosynthesis.
From the external fixator, the undrilled intramedullary nail to the primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this is done under the primacy of soft tissue coverage.
It was only through the associated successes that it was possible in recent decades to significantly reduce the hitherto high rate of disabling amputations and infections.
Initially, these were only isolated case observations, but there were increasing indications that these patients frequently had soft tissue problems in the lower leg ranging from recurrent swelling to leg ulcers.
On the basis of a clinical examination using venous occlusion plethysmography on 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and in comparison with 50 healthy volunteers, it could be shown that more than 50% of all patients suffer clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
The severity of this damage ranges from a simple tendency to swell to leg ulcers, and its clinical relevance increases with increasing time distance to the accident event.
To avoid further damage, including iatrogenic damage, strict adherence to surgical guidelines in primary care is required, postoperative prophylaxis is indicated, and postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Surgical goal Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal deformities of the tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of limb form and function
Mucins are highly glycosylated glycoproteins that have a variety of antigenic determinants consisting of carbohydrate and/or peptide sequences.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry provided extensive insights into their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in antigen profiles during neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues could be described.
A number of recent results also suggest that mucin-associated antigens play an important role in tumor biology, for example in metastasis and as prognostic markers.
The present work, including its own findings, reviews gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology.
Through the establishment of rheumatism centers in Germany, it has been possible in recent years to network outpatient and inpatient areas with the general practitioners, internal medicine and orthopedic rheumatologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and psychologists working in them, as well as the acute care and rehabilitation clinics and rehabilitation clinics.
Rheumatological control centres can contribute in the long term to further improving cooperation between all doctors, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatoid patients and to ensure continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatoid patients in the sense of comprehensive rheumatological quality management quantitatively and qualitatively.
Despite the increasing frequency of drug legal problems, knowledge about the nature and frequency of treatment errors after thyroid surgery is low.
The analysis of a collective of 21 people. 515 complaints from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the medical associations of North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg resulted in 222 complaints( 1%) after surgery of the thyroid gland.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the observation period.
In 36 cases ( 16%), expert committees found treatment errors in 36 cases ( 16%) .
The complaint concerned the surgeon in 95%, the anesthesiologist in 2%, both disciplines in 3% and an ENT physician once.
Of the complaints, 90% related to complications after routine thyroid surgery.
Typical surgical complications such as recurrent paresis( 50%), hypoparathyroidism( 14%), postoperative bleeding( 3%) and late recurrence( 1%) together accounted for 63% of treatment error allegations, but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors accounted for 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurological deficits( 10%), infections( 5%), left nodules( 4%), scar problems( 5%) accounted for 37% of the allegations but 70% of the treatment errors.
Disclosure deficiencies were present in only 11% of the treatment errors detected.
The detection of a treatment error was particularly frequent when reoperation was required ( p<0) . 001) when the surgical objective was not achieved ( p <0>) . 001) or if a complication was followed by an error in post-treatment ( p<0) . 001) .
The area" Environment and Health" is characterized by an interdisciplinary character and a resulting high need for communication.
To make matters worse, there are sometimes considerable problems in obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this field has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform in this field.
Recognized indications are bilateral renal tumors, renal tumors in patients with functional and anatomical single kidneys and in patients with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal insufficiency requiring dialysis after tumor nephrectomy ( imperative indications) .
Surgical strategy improvements - such as perfusion in hypothermia and workbench surgery - can save more than 95% of patients with multiple and advanced kidney tumors from nephrectomy with subsequent dialysis.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of over 80% after organ-preserving kidney tumor surgery in imperative indications, more and more centers are recommending the extension of parenchyma-sparing kidney tumor surgery to a selected group of patients with contralateral healthy kidney( elective indications) .
However, with an incidence of bilateral renal carcinomas of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears to be low.
The prognosis after manifestation of local recurrences is infaust in most cases.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy( CAR) is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has so far been described most frequently in small cell bronchial carcinomas.
We report on 3 patients with CAR in the presence of breast cancer or breast cancer. a carcinoid of the cervix uteri.
Background and questions.
In order to develop rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterially caused skin diseases was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognized standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regime is not only effective, but v. a low side effect.
In the following, a patient is reported in whom pronounced, long-lasting hyperpigmentation was observed in the healed psoriasis foci as part of this combination treatment.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy( ESWL) is the standard therapy for urolithiasis.
With largely the same technical principles, various lithotriptors have been developed.
In the current discussion, the so-called ones are in question. clinically insignificant residual fragments and the probability of recurrence, which make appropriate metaphylaxis further useful.
While the side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL alongside other forms of therapy are still pending.
After treatment of a fibrin reaction in the anterior segment of the eye by tissue plasminogen activator ( TPA), acute corneal calcifications were clinically observed in isolated cases.
The previously unknown pathomechanism prompted us to carry out the following investigations.
The co-occurrence of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization ( IVF-ET) and active tuberculosis disease can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case report, we present the symptoms, diagnosis and therapy of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF pregnancy.
different possibilities are discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, which were first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang[ 6] using the polymerase chain reaction.
By using two pairs of primers, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and, after restriction digestion, visualized on a polyacrylamide gel by means of silver staining.
The following allele frequencies could be determined in a southwestern German population group:
Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741 and allele 0 = 0.6556, respectively.
In 10 out of 280 people examined ( 3.57%), the examination method chosen here, which only takes into account nucleotide positions 261 and 703, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, since differentiation between the A and 02 alleles is not possible, since differentiation between the A and 02 alleles is not possible.
Chondropathia patellae usually does not require arthroscopic clarification.
The fact that exceptions must apply is demonstrated by the following casuistry.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain in the proximal/lateral patellar facet after a soccer game.
Arthroscopically, it was a solid, nodular, connective tissue-transformed hematoma that easily resolved with a hollow:
Hemorrhage had apparently occurred during the football game due to bruise or patellar subluxation.
The boy was symptom-free after arthroscopy, and the muscle atrophy quickly regressed.
Two-thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis( RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and lasting effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data are presented suggesting a longer-term effect ( longer than a year) are presented.
Recent studies clearly show a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of anti-inflammatory from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these recent studies provide additional insights into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical studies support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes that are only loosely connected by the underlying causes of RA, but develop independently of each other to some extent.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids could relate to different mechanisms presented elsewhere at this symposium.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenesis cells express and chain the 1-, 3- and 4- integrins as well as their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
The adhesion molecules( AM) show a pronounced intra- and inter-individual variation on the sperm surface, as well as different localizations.
The nested polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To this day, it is unclear whether AM have functional relevance for the interactions between sperm and oocytes or other sperm contact cells or whether they represent only" biological redundancy" or "biological redundancy", respectively. only the very last binding insurance( final insurance) .
Sperm AM labeling was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma, and microorganisms.
Melatonin( N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of adrenergic receptors and has a diverse range of effects.
The secretion of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, steady levels during the day and an increase in the evening and nocturnal peak between 2 nights at an interval of low, steady levels. 00 and 4, respectively, are the two. 00 o'clock.
In addition, due to its strong lipophilic properties, melatonin has the ability, independently of a receptor system, to diffuse freely through cell membranes and to act as a radical scavenger in the extracellular and intracellular space, due to its strong lipophilic properties.
The affinity for the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly high.
In dermatology, melatonin has prospects in some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
When applied topically, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of UV erythema.
There is some knowledge about the penetration properties through the skin and the oral availability, which can be supplemented by further investigations of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics in chronic inflammation lies on the one hand in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals, which allow localization of an inflammatory focus if the focus is unclear, since whole-body scintigraphy and SPECT technology are possible, and on the other hand in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals, e.g. the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals, e.g. B the detection of leukocytic infiltration enables evidence of leukocytic infiltration.
Both approaches are complementary in each case to X-ray morphological methods which can specify a found focus in more detail or which entail inflammatory scintigraphy if the findings are unclear.
Background and questions.
Cryosurgery has long been established as a method of treating capillary infant hemangiomas.
Surprisingly, however, detailed studies demonstrating its effectiveness in tumors that are regularly subject to spontaneous regression are lacking to date.
The patient's prognosis depends on both the primary mechanical brain damage and the development of secondary brain damage.
In addition to the intracranial mass due to post-traumatic bleeding and edema formation, as well as the resulting ischemia, inflammatory processes are discussed as causes of secondary brain damage.
Both in isolated SHT and after polytrauma with and without brain damage, an inflammatory "systemic reaction" ( SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single or multiple organ failure ( MOF) .
Individual injury components and functional disorders are usually survivable, but can be fatal in their combination and accumulation.
Hypermetabolic conditions after SHT are also understood as interactions of the CNS with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of SHT on the rest of the organism must be contrasted with the influence of multiple injuries to a polytraumatized injured person on brain function, whereby shock-related perfusion disorders can cause prognostic limiting hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized "whole-body inflammatory response" affects blood coagulation, metabolism and fracture healing.
The knowledge of the trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the whole organism, as well as the influence of the currently applied therapeutic measures, are still insufficient and require further clarification.
Ultimately, from this point of view, the choice of the right time for secondary interventions that do not directly serve the preservation of life and lead to an additional burden on the patient due to the surgical trauma must also be reconsidered.
This work tries to summarize important aspects in this field.
For better differentiation between benign prostatic hyperplasia( BPH) and prostate cancer, but also for early detection of prostate cancer, the molecular forms of PSA and recently also human kallikrein 2( hK2) have proven to be valuable decision-making aids.
Children with facial clefts have an increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems can be affected.
Literature data on the incidence of heart defects vary considerably.
46 psychotherapy dropouts were compared with 599 completers and examined with regard to conspicuous personality traits.
Furthermore, they were asked by questionnaire about their personal reasons for the termination.
Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema, or Oudtshoorn skin has been described as an early childhood manifest dominant hereditary dermatosis with partially circinary reed erythema, especially in families from the South African district of Oudtshoorn.
The seasonal association with the winter months and the characteristic histologically multiforme findings distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histological, and initial immunohistological findings in a 4-year-old patient that fit well with erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area could not be determined.
17 studies on the effectiveness of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis( CP), spondarthropathies( SPA), lupus erythematosus( LE), localized and systemic scleroderma( SD) were reviewed for their results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the papers reviewed reveal clear deficiencies.
The aim of this study was to examine whether visual acuity decreases as a function of performance time and whether normal persons and nystagmus patients are disadvantaged by these regulations in driving assessments.
Sudeck syndrome affects an extremity after microtrauma or surgery.
Currently, there is no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck's syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptoms of Sudeck's syndrome were caused by an excessive inflammatory response to injury or surgery to a limb.
His theory found no supporters, as most of the medical community believes that Sudeck's syndrome is caused by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We performed various clinical and experimental studies and also recorded the effects of anti-inflammatory therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
In this thesis, methods for the application of fast multislice spiral CT for cardiac imaging using ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition are presented.
Computed tomography enables superimposition-free imaging of the maxilla and mandible in addition to the radiological examination procedures commonly used in dentistry.
In addition to the already established use of CT in malignant diseases, its use in other questions has proven itself.
If the examination is carried out with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of impacted teeth in the jawbone and the damage to permanent teeth caused by the impacted teeth can be assessed, so that early therapy is possible.
If the periodontal gap of the retained tooth can be demarcated, an orthodontic classification is possible.
In inflammatory dental diseases, horizontal and vertical bone resorption must be precisely determined.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic masses can be detected with CT.
Before an intended implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by taking into account the remaining bone substance and the location of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape, and number of implants can be determined.
Septic encephalopathy( SE) occurs in up to 70% of all patients with sepsis.
The symptoms of SE are described on the basis of case studies.
The main symptom is clouding of consciousness up to coma.
Cranial computed tomography is usually also normal, a generalized cerebral edema can occur.
The electroencephalogram shows a general change, the extent of which correlates with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated defense reactions of the organism to bacterial products as well as bacteremia itself are essential etiological factors.
Due to a disturbance in amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered due to a change in amino acid metabolism.
A variety of other factors such as electrolyte shifts, hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, shock and ischemia, and liver and kidney failure may be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
Since early adequate treatment of sepsis is of decisive prognostic importance, SE is of particular diagnostic importance as a possible initial symptom of sepsis.
Despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy, endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general diseases and reduced general condition has an extremely poor prognosis despite modern antibacterial, antifungal and surgical therapy.
Films tell stories.
Above all, those scenes in which people are confronted with decision-making conflicts are exciting.
Medical ethical conflicts do not only appear in medical series or depictions of diseases, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedies, westerns, romance, gangster and crime movies, gangster and crime movies.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films draw on moral values and at the same time are seismographs for the social relevance of medical ethics topics.
However, in film, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical-ethical case study and is a helpful addition to the teaching of analytical and communicative skills.
The reduction in the rate of restenosis compared to conventional PTCA has led to stent implantation becoming the intervention most frequently performed initially.
Therefore, in-stent restenosis-especially the long-distance form-is a significant clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytical model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty with regard to these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The preclinical management of amputation injuries places great demands on the emergency services.
It is precisely the initial treatment of the amputate in the case of amputation injuries that, in addition to the initial treatment of the injured person, often decides on the success of the recovery measures.
The primary goal of laryngeal imaging diagnostics is the analysis of submucosal structures that are not accessible to laryngoscopic assessment.
Consequently, the general rule is to carry out imaging diagnostics of the larynx with knowledge of the findings of endoscopic diagnostics.
The topographical-anatomical conditions of the skeleton, the internal structures and the environment of the larynx will be presented synoptically.
Due to transpedicular stabilization with a screw-ring band system, the instability was eliminated with segmental functional maintenance.
In recent years, new insights into the post-traumatic changes after craniocerebral trauma ( TBI) and the associated pathophysiological relationships have been gained.
In addition to corresponding changes in neurotraumatological intensive care management, this has led to the development of pharmaceuticals that are intended to reduce the occurrence of secondary damage in the brain-injured patient.
Within the scope of this work, the more recent findings of the pathophysiological changes after SHT and the basic pharmacological intervention possibilities are discussed.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are in different advanced experimental and clinical trial stages.
Background and questions.
Stage IV melanoma patients with progressive disease present a significant problem for the oncological dermatologist.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the course of the disease in outpatients with melanoma.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been taking minocycline prophylactically for more than 3 years for pulmonary silicosis before symptomless blackish spots appeared on the face.
The other patient developed gray-black spots on both lower legs after only 6 months of taking minocycline due to follikulitis.
A trial treatment with the ruby laser led to a regression of pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The different clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed on the basis of case studies.
Surgical goal Elimination of the deformity of a digitus quintus superductus et varus.
Microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphological reconstructions in the facial area in recent years.
A major factor in this is the recovery of neural abilities.
Within the scope of this study, the sensitive regenerative capacity of the N was assessed. alveolar inferior after partial tumor surgical resection and reconstruction with the vascularized N. Follow-up of the thoracic longus.
Pressure and pain could be felt as early as 3 months, touch and vibration at the earliest 5 months and thermal stimuli at the earliest 7 months postoperatively.
The vascularly pedunculated N. The long thoracic nerve is thus a suitable nerve graft for bridging resection-related defects of the N. alveolar veins inferior in tumor patients.
Paracetamol ( acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) ingestion has been shown to be the most common cause of deliberate overdose of the drug in the United States and the United Kingdom, yet a large number of overdoses result in serious complications only with a relatively small number of serious complications.
Severe hepatic toxicity must be expected in any patient in whom the standard dose has been exceeded and the minimum hepatotoxic dose is 125 mg/kg( 7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a 60 kg patient) .
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible with N-acetylcysteine.
In addition, any patient in whom the strength or timing of the overdose is unknown, regardless of their serum levels, should undergo complete treatment with N-acetylcysteine.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine must be continued if liver function deteriorates.
At the onset of signs of severe hepatotoxicity, a specialist should be consulted to ensure optimal therapy or immediate transfer in the event of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has considerably improved the fate of a hitherto incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be made through closer cooperation between the referring hospitals and the liver disease special facilities.
Background and questions.
Itching is a side effect of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases that is difficult to treat.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid from the bell pepper plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option in recent years.
When applied topically after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation, capsaicin blocks unmyelinated, polymodal C and A nerve fibers, thereby selectively suppressing itching and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a urological clinical picture that is both diagnostically and therapeutically problematic.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are 55-73% and 55-73% respectively, respectively. 10-40% low.
We report on microsurgical testicular denervation as a surgical alternative for therapy-refractory testalgia.
12 patients were surgically treated by spermatic cord neurolysis after adequate environmental diagnosis:
The M Cremasteric is severed by bipolar diathermy, adventitia of the A by means of bipolar diathermy, and adventitia of the A by means of bipolar diathermy. Ocularis is detached under microsurgical conditions over a length of 2-3 cm.
With a mean follow-up of 20.6 ( 4-62) months, 11/12 patients ( 92%) are symptom-free
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic cord neurolysis should be included in therapeutic considerations in patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our surgical procedure can only be maintained if the indication is precise, so that a precise environmental diagnosis is indispensable to rule out a specific genesis of the testalgia.
In neurosurgery, too, the trend is towards less and less invasive surgical techniques in order to avoid large trepanations, to minimize preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord and nerves and thus to keep the risk of neurological and psychological disorders as low as possible.
Hospitalisation and incapacity for work can thus often be shortened.
The main "minimally invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
With its preformed cavities, brain chambers and subarachnoid space, the brain offers good conditions for the use of the endoscope.
The most common indication for neuroendoscopic surgery is occlusive hydrocephalus.
However, arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors and smaller intraventricular space lesions can also be effectively treated endoscopically via a small borehole.
By using special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, e.g. can be enable. B Cavernomas, completely removed, completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used for a number of spinal diseases and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as adjuvant in microsurgical surgery.
The aim of the work was to measure the diffusion coefficient( ADC) by diffusion-weighted( DW) MRI in vertebral body metastases and in MR- morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
DW-MRI measures the ADC specific to a tissue, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
In cell-rich tumor tissue with numerous intra- and intercellular membranes( d. hm there we go Diffusion barriers) is a low ADC, to be expected in cell-poor or necrotic tissue, a high ADC.
A 53-year-old man was found to have a melanotic lung tumor that had completely occluded the left main bronchus and whose base was localized in the bronchus of the left lower lobe.
After laser therapy, a cuff resection of the left lower lobe of the lung was performed.
Based on histological and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as malignant melanoma.
In the history, there was no evidence of a previous removal of a skin, mucous membrane or eye change.
Even the targeted skin and eye examinations did not reveal any evidence of a primary tumor localized there.
Thus, the neoplasm is to be regarded as a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases are considered confirmed so far.
The patient is tumor-free after the relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
So far, there is no experience with twilight vision after LASIK.
We therefore investigated twilight vision before and after LASIK to correct myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine stress echocardiography has established itself as a standard method for non-invasive ischemia diagnosis.
Ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging can be used to perform identical pharmacological stress protocols as currently used in echocardiography.
Cornea HLA-DR antigens are lost during organ culture storage.
This work investigated whether this is a down-regulation of the HLA-DR antigen or a loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells ( LZ) .
DNA cytometry has become a routine diagnostic technique, preferably used in breast cancer to assess ploidy and proliferation kinetics( cell cycle analysis) .
Static cytometry( microscopic cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry for reasons of lower informative value.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodologically sound technique with a low coefficient of variation ( CV) for S-phase determination.
Die gewonnenen Parameter, in 1 in 1. Line the S-phase and proliferation index, in 2, in 2, The line also the ploidy, are important prognostic and for therapy planning factors.
A precise knowledge of the method and the possibilities for error is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for determining proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information must be considered unclear at the present time.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric examinations and improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measured values.
Injection therapy is important in cervical syndromes.
This article deals on the one hand with general requirements and on the other hand with the various practical procedures for injection.
Summary The assumption of costs of post-exposure prophylaxis( PEP) for HIV by the statutory health insurance is unclear, whereby the question of the assumption of costs by private health insurance companies should not be considered.
The regulations on disease prevention ( § 20 SGB V), medical care ( § 23 SGB V) and health examinations ( § 25 SGB V) cannot be considered as legal bases for the assumption of costs.
PEP is medical treatment within the meaning of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment, PEP, has not yet been included in regular health insurance financing, as there are no corresponding recommendations from federal committees.
It would be desirable if appropriate recommendations were adopted soon to eliminate legal uncertainty in this area.
Under certain circumstances, there is an obligation to bear the costs in accordance with the principles of the legal figure of the so-called one. new methods of examination and treatment in consideration.
In itself, however, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP must be具体ized with regard to indication and mode of application and freed from ambiguities.
If a doctor does not use PEP for an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a treatment error, since from a scientific point of view there are still too many ambiguities.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplant immunology in transplantation immunology.
Organ culture storage leads to the loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The present work investigates the importance of prolonged corneal storage time for the success of perforating keratoplasty.
Based on our own experiences with 3-dimensional echocardiography, an attempt was made to reconstruct also ultrasonographic transfontanelle studies in a 3-dimensional manner and to examine them for their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent side effect in AIDS patients systemically treated with rifabutin due to Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report on a 37-year-old female patient who, after intensive therapy for a total of 105 days with 72 days of ventilation, had heterotopic ossifications in 5 large body joints with almost complete stiffening.
The reason for the intensive therapy was a double lung transplant in severe pulmonary hypertension.
Mobility was restored by resection of the ossifications in the area of the right shoulder and the equilateral elbow as well as both hip joints.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur in particular post-traumatic, after spinal cord injuries, after SHT, in the case of intoxications and in the long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is still unknown, a transformation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then cause new bone formation.
The diagnosis is made with the help of imaging techniques.
Prophylactically, drug treatment using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs( NSAIDs), irradiation or a combination of both methods can be carried out.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus ( CDLE), in whom we used argon laser for local therapy for the first time.
The patient suffered from long-standing skin changes that could not be influenced or only slightly influenced by established treatment strategies.
After application of the argon laser, complete and permanent healing occurred in the area of the treated lesions.
Histological and immunohistological findings suggest that vascular-mediated effects of the argon laser are important for the observed effect in LE-related discoid lesions.
In the context of these case descriptions, the effectiveness of the argon laser in the treatment of therapy-resistant discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is shown for the first time.
Complications of viral hepatitis are overall the most common indication for liver transplantation.
For the affected patient, it is often the only life-saving option.
Prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by polyclonal human antibodies against HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analogueamivudine is effective, but expensive, but expensive.
Reinfection with hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favorable prognosis compared to HBV reinfection compared to HBV reinfection.
Effective reinfection prophylaxis for hepatitis C has not yet been established and requires extensive studies.
In hepatitis C, after reinfection, the prognosis for the graft is less favorable, while the 5-year survival rate is comparable to other benign non-viral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity using a case study as well as the existing literature.
Therapy for these tumors consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiotherapy.
An exception are rhabdomyosarcomas, which also respond well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation for pre-excitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with a curative claim.
Accessory pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomical prerequisites for orthodromic or antidromic reentry tachycardias of varying incidence, duration, and frequency.
Understanding the mechanism of tachycardia and the role of the accessory pathway in tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of the other structures of the conduction system, and detecting other paraspecific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Abnormalities of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and coincident diseases of the heart should be evaluated prior to intervention by echocardiography and, if necessary, by echocardiography and, if necessary, by echocardiography. At the beginning of the procedure, contrast representation was examined.
In 300 patients with different variants of pre-excitation syndrome, own results of catheter ablation are presented.
In order to achieve a qualitatively better recording of complications in orthopedics and to have comparable statistics over the years, a standardization of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is necessary.
The Heidelberg University Orthopaedic Hospital Foundation has been leading since 1st. 1 In 1997, a complete, consensual register of all early complications of all inpatients.
The complications are prospectively recorded by the medical profession in a complication program according to a standardized nomenclature, and the information is checked, corrected and supplemented as well as classified by the quality management department of the clinic.
The guideline is intended to contribute to the discussion on a standard in the recording and evaluation of complications in orthopedics with the aim of building a consensus with the aim of building a consensus.
Acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the appearance of blisters in the acral region in the advanced stage of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, an obligatory impairment of dermoepidermal coherence during the course of treatment is likely to be the basis, which becomes clinically manifest in the form of bulging blisters due to mechanical stress.
Acrobullous photodermatosis must be differentiated from phototoxic reactions that occur as a result of excessive UVA irradiation or excessive psoralen concentrations.
On the basis of two cases, the clinic, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this clinical picture are presented.
In addition to autoptically confirmed findings of fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium, there are currently no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy( ARVD) .
In 1994, members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology developed criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD.
These criteria include structural, functional, histological and electrophysiological features, which have been divided into major and minor criteria.
On the basis of the following study on a collective of 24 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, the value of the developed criteria will be checked.
Global or segmental dilatations of the right ventricle in the sense of main criteria could be detected in 20 patients( 83%) by angiography or echocardiography.
4 patients( 16%) had only secondary criteria in radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disorders of the right ventricle.
In all patients, the typical fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium could be detected histologically by detection of the right ventricular myocardium.
T-inversions in right precordial leads as secondary criteria were present in 17 patients( 71%) .
A localized QRS widening of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 could be found in 8 patients( 33%), an epsilon wave in 6 patients( 25%) as the main criteria.
A late potential analysis by means of signal averaging ECG was only available in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases( 50%) in the sense of secondary criteria.
Left bundle branch block-like ventricular tachycardia, which were classified as secondary criteria, could be detected in 23 patients( 96%);
only one patient died of progressive right heart failure without any evidence of arrhythmias.
A history of unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as a secondary criterion could be collected in 3 of 19 patients( 15%) .
The task force criteria developed for the diagnosis of ARVD led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, although the importance of a confirmed histological diagnosis was of particular value.
Without adding histological data, the clinical diagnosis could only be made in 10 cases.
The question remains whether a more favorable classification of findings into main and secondary criteria makes a purely clinical diagnosis more possible.
Clear data show that severe hypoglycemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the influence of acute hyperglycemia on cerebral ischemia is controversially assessed in cerebral ischemia.
The conflicting results of clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained if different types of stroke are considered separately and the time course of blood glucose levels during the acute event is taken into account.
Hyperglycemia appears to increase neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia if there is insufficient collateral supply.
Furthermore, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is increased during this period.
In contrast, if there is only a moderate drop in cerebral blood flow, acute blood glucose elevation can protect nerve tissue from structural damage by improving substrate supply.
This situation is present in the area of the penumbra and with a good collateral supply.
We therefore hypothesize that both the negative and positive effects of acute hyperglycemia depend on local cerebral blood flow.
We present a non-invasive protocol for epilepsy surgery diagnosis, according to which 50 out of 173 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies underwent resective epilepsy surgery.
Localization agreement of findings from non-invasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance tomography ( MRI), interictal positionron emission tomography ( PET) and ictal SPECT ( single photon emission computed tomography) formed the basis of focus localization.
78%( n= 39) of all 50 patients became seizure-free or had seizures very rarely.
Extratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG examinations if circumscribed MRI lesions were present and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies, in particular temporal epilepsies, non-invasive EEG recordings are sufficient in presurgical diagnostics and thus the risk of invasive EEG examinations can be avoided.
History and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old patient presented to an external clinic with a newly emerged tachyarrhythmia absoluta.
Initially, the suspicion of an intracardiac mass was expressed by echocardiography, which was to be further clarified by means of transesophageal echocardiography.
In the ECG, a tachyarrhythmia absoluta with frequencies up to 146/min was found, intermittently a sinus rhythm was also documented.
This could also be confirmed in the X-ray examination of the thorax as a large mass projected onto the posterior mediastinum, projecting laterally beyond the right mediastinal margin, projecting laterally beyond the mediastinal margin.
Due to the displacing growth of the cyst with triggering atrial arrhythmias and to safely rule out malignant degeneration, the cyst was surgically removed by anterolateral thoracotomy by means of anterolateral thoracotomy.
Since then, the patient has been in sinus rhythm and only complains of isolated "dropouts", most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasy[ 3].
Atrial arrhythmias that appear to be primarily harmless can also be caused by rare causes such as thoracic, extracardiac or intracardiac masses that require specific therapy.
An overview of the development of intrathoracic cysts is given.
Acute cranial nerve palsy can have a variety of causes.
A rare trigger for paresis of one or more cranial nerves is a dissection of the A. internal carotid artery.
Early detection of carotid dissection, even with atypical symptoms, is important because timely anticoagulant therapy can prevent stroke as a result of dissection-related embolism.
We report 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous cranial nerves( Raeder's syndrome) as well as the caudal cranial nerves( Collet- Siccard syndrome) as a result of dissection of the A. internal carotid artery.
In addition to the cranial and caudal cranial nerves involved in our cases, failures of the middle cranial nerves ( VI-VIII) have also been described, so that any painful sudden cranial nerve failure must also make one think of a carotid dissection.
The wrong exit of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remains asymptomatic until old age, but can also become clinically manifest in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death until sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnosis and surgical therapy in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child, as well as on the need for surgical correction.
The suspected diagnosis was made by chance during echocardiographic procedures, the safety diagnosis by coronary angiography.
The operation consisted of transplantation of the coronary artery defect without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was without complications.
The indication for surgical correction is also recommended in asymptomatic cases, because of the coronary steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
Surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement( AO classification 41 A1, B1- 3 and C1- 3) places high demands on traumatological management.
The application of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the treatment of fractures close to the joint offers, among other things, the treatment of fractures close to the joint offers. a the possibility of achieving a good functional result from a small surgically induced soft tissue trauma.
The aim is to achieve at least exercise stability in comparison with the standard procedures, also in comparison with the standard procedures.
Thus, in addition to the low surgical soft tissue trauma, the exact intraoperative assessment of the joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intra-articular concomitant injuries by arthroscopy are of particular advantage compared to conventional methods compared to conventional methods.
Of a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients in our clinic between September 1993 and January 1998.
The follow-up of a total of 17 patients showed good results overall according to the Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
In a selected group of patients, we consider arthroscopically assisted minimally invasive osteosynthesis to be suitable even for fractures of AO classification 41 C1- 3 for fractures of AO classification.
We report on a 72-year-old patient who developed bilateral hypoglossal palsy without other neurological deficits after moderate craniocerebral trauma, which clinically regressed completely within 3 months.
Since computed tomography did not detect a skull base fracture in the area of the posterior fossa, we discuss a bilateral strain of the N N. Hypoglossal as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency describes a pathological situation in which the blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins to a sufficient extent under the conditions of daily life.
The backlog propagates from the large conducting veins through the smallest venules to the area of microcirculation and finally affects the metabolism of the tissues.
Typical clinical features are best offered as a basis for classification principles, which can be confirmed secondarily with a simple objective measurement method.
Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is defined as angiodermatitis developing at the bottom of arteriovenous short circuits.
In the area of the lower extremities, skin lesions that are reminiscent of Kaposi's sarcoma ( pseudo Kaposi's sarcoma) usually occur unilaterally.
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain and, rarely, hypertrophy of the limb in question.
The clinical picture is often rapidly progressive and leads to ulcerative nodules with bleeding and infectious tendency.
Causal therapy consists of elimination of arteriovenous shunts.
A surgical procedure is rarely feasible due to the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas.
Superselective embolization is more suitable, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis, it is more suitable.
The successful embolization treatment in a 32-year-old patient with Stewart's Bluefarb syndrome, which has been carried out a total of 8 times so far, is reported.
So far, in addition to the clinic and histology on the H&E section, the exact diagnosis of the very rare primary histiocytoses of the skin was based on electron microscopy( Birbeck granules) and immunohistology on the frozen section( CD1a) .
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffin-compatible markers now also enable a ( also retrospective) processing and precise classification of these diseases on formalin-fixed material.
With antibodies against S-100 protein and by means of the lectin peanut agglutinin ( PNA) and PCNA ( proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the classical cells of Langerhans cell histiocytosis ( LZH) can be distinguished from other histiocytic cell systems.
With the so-called ones. Non-langerhans cell histiocytoses ( non-LZH) did not have uniform electron-optical and immunohistological characteristics to date.
The infiltrates consist of several cell populations that are of great importance for cellular pathobiology ( monocyte/macrophage and dendritic cell subtypes) .
Frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and their reactions with the corresponding paraffin-compatible immunohistological markers can be very different within the different clinical entities.
Antibodies against factor XIIIa ( shown in the example of xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P ( shown in juvenile xanthogranuloma) seem to have diagnostic significance with regard to the differentiation from Langerhans cell histiocytosis.
Both markers show a positive reaction pattern with the epithelioid cells typical of the disease process.
In the following we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of administration of allopurinol and after re-exposure to this drug.
Verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder( pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old female patient who had been suffering from chronic interstitial cystitis( IC) with Hunner's ulcers for 10 years.
To date, 7 case reports of non-sbilharzia-associated verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder have been published in the world literature.
Although the development of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder as a complication of IC has not yet been described, the pathomechanism of the development of verrucous carcinoma seems to lie in chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
After exhausting conservative treatment options, radical cystectomy and supravesical urinary diversion were performed.
"NoToX Histological Fixative" is offered as a substitute for formalin/ formaldehyde for the fixation of tissue samples for histological examinations.
Intraoperative tissue and autopsy organ samples were used to test NoToX.
Conventional histological staining and accepted immunohistological staining, especially for tumor diagnosis, were used.
As a result of these investigations, which were carried out independently at 3 different facilities, it was found that tissue samples fixed with NoToX were more reproducible than conventional staining or staining, respectively. the visualization of immunohistochemical reactions show no differences to formalin-fixed tissue samples.
NoToX has proven to be a viable substitute for formalin.
Dose variables such as the computed tomography dose index ( CTDI), the multiple scan average dose ( MSAD) and the axis dose free in air are usually used to describe the radiation exposure of the patient in computed tomography.
The CTDI and the MSAD derived from it are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but say little about the doses relevant from the point of view of the doctor and the patient according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs and about the risks.
Axis dose alone is not a good measure of effective dose that allows estimation of risk.
The specification of an upper guideline value for the axis dose should take into account the dose requirement of the study region in order to ensure acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other hand.
As physical quantities, all 3 quantities are useful for characterizing and differentiating different examination programs and devices with regard to radiation exposure.
Nach einem Bericht der World Heart Federation/ International Society and Federation of Cardiology ( WHF/ISFC) Task Force zur Definition und Klassifikation der Kardiomyopathien wurde die Definition entzündlicher Herzmuskelerkrankungen 1995 erweitert.
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy have been newly included in this definition.
As a result, a number of infectious pathogens, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses and herpesviruses, appear to be important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory myocardial disease and dilatation of the ventricles.
It seems sensible to assign an independent place to shame as a general human emotion in distinction from guilt in general human emotion.
In addition to the defensive character, the "self-sustaining" function of shame should also be taken into account.
The occurrence of shame always points to the protection of the sense of value, even if it should not currently be recognizable in the patient.
The signal character of shame is discussed and the question of whether shame symptoms have a disease value is considered.
Attention to psychogenesis and unconscious shame dynamics broadens the view of potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This review provides a literature review of the very inhomogeneous treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, both in terms of crisis understanding and therapy methods as well as professional responsibility.
General treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disorder- and event-specific concepts and work on crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents from the last 10 years are described in detail.
In addition, the contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, insofar as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammatory response as well as the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune system in its pathogenesis has been the subject of research in recent years.
Arteriosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show increased inflammatory cells and a lower density of smooth muscle cells.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
increased programmed cell death( apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronary atherectomy samples from 26 patients with unstable angina( group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina( group 2) were examined immunohistochemically( TUNEL test for detection of fragmented DNA) and electron microscopy by electron microscopy.
The aim of this study was to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of the plaques, to detect and quantify cell death events, and to distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis.
In a study in vivo and on corpses specially fixed according to the techniques developed by Thiel in 1992, it was investigated in which position the transversalis fascia is located in relation to the balloon and what happens to it when the balloon is inflated.
In TEP, the fascia can at best be used laterally of the artery to reinforce the posterior wall of the inguinal canal or as an abutment for fixing foreign material ( mesh) .
We present 2 patients aged 50 and 84 years who presented with pronounced, itchy, generalized eczematous skin lesions.
The detection of numerous mites in the scaly crusts led to the diagnosis of scabies norvegica;
an underlying disease could be ruled out in both cases.
It is assumed that the therapy of the eczema in the sense of immunosuppression, which lasted for months, led to the exacerbation of the clinical picture.
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are being evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The effectiveness of hemoglobin solutions with regard to O2 transport and in particular the effective delivery of O2 to the tissue has been proven in a variety of situations such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.
Genetic and chemical modifications can stabilize the hemoglobin molecule.
This results in a clinically useful intravascular half-life of approx. 8- 24 h, adequate O2 affinity and lack of nephrotoxicity.
As a remaining side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated today, a certain vasoconstriction must be mentioned as a remaining side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated today.
Nevertheless, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are therefore well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This has been demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation, and also under resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important representative from the group of fluorocarbon emulsions, has also been used successfully in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of injured patients.
An introduction is expected in the next few years.
It is strictly based on clear physical laws and defined physiological laws.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally accepted indications for HBO therapy, for which it is either the only causally effective, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often decisive therapeutic component of a comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive therapy.
Among the potential side effects, in addition to barotrauma of the lungs, special consideration must be given to the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication.
The clinical application of HBO therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects and risks, a targeted and critical indication as well as the skills and abilities to safely control occurring complications with intensive care or emergency medical measures.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive therapeutic character should therefore be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anesthesiologist.
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues with regard to oncological therapy.
In this thesis, the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound could be used as an additional therapeutic technique for sonically accessible tumors because of its good depth imaging ability.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasound parameters.
New results show that magnetic resonance imaging is suitable for "online" monitoring of ultrasound-induced high-temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of non-invasive MRI temperature measurement can become an important tool for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumors be reviewed in carefully planned clinical trials.
In a group of extremely small premature babies, the long-term effects of prematurity on ophthalmic and otolaryngologic status should be demonstrated in a group of extremely small premature babies.
Since 1993, an IT system has been used at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Homburg/Saar for surgical and outpatient documentation and to support the general organization of the clinic.
The hardware used is a Novell network with DOS or DOS respectively. Windows-based PC's as a server and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based encryption of diagnoses and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its introduction, the data from 31 have been entered into the system. 500 patients were admitted and 8 patients were treated. 500 operations documented.
With the appropriate flexibility of the software, both the requirements of the medical field and those of the administration can be taken into account.
Through a further clinic-wide network, the University Hospital Homburg also offers the possibility of interdepartmental data exchange and the use of scientific networks as well as the Internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centers on the usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following procedure is recommended.
The aim of the study was to test whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupillary response.
Reference is also made to non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of the( mostly innocent) accident victims with the current compensation practice.
The aim of this study in sheep was to clarify whether the intra-articular concentration of free sulfated and non-sulfated glycosaminoglycans shows a correlation to the extent of experimentally induced arthritic damage, whether there is a temporal assignment, and whether the results provide evidence for the use of GAG as a prognostic criterion or prognostic criterion, respectively, if the results provide evidence for the use of GAG as a prognostic criterion or prognostic criterion. Arthrosis markers can be assumed.
21 sheep are randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 animals each:
The controls are the knee joints of the contralateral side and knee joints of animals from other approved projects( n= 54) .
The radiological score values between the groups TD vs. ME and MV are statistically significant( p< 0.01) different.
Compared to the control group, HA shows a significantly increased value in the ME and MV groups.
In the case of CS, there is a significantly increased level( p< 0.01) both for the measurement 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial separation.
Clinical Consequences:
The HA level allows - at least experimentally possible - a description of the degree of arthrosis to a certain extent, to some extent, to some extent.
The concentration increases with greater postoperative interval and increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic long QT syndrome can present itself in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope and seizures in childhood.
Therapy with blockers is considered standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
In the event of therapy failure, pacemaker implantation or surgical sympathetic blockade can be considered as options.
We report the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12 year old patient.
Additions and use of an epidiascope are described, which after minor modifications for the presentation of organ or organ, are described, respectively, after minor modifications. Organ discs in general and special pathology courses are suitable and complex video installations with additional lighting, etc. he saved it
Narcissistic problems are common in old age and of far-reaching importance.
These problems are related here to the instance of the ego-ideal and examined from the perspective of the increasing discrepancy between ego and ego-ideal in old age.
Pathological aggravations of the aging process, as they are often present in older patients, are shown in three aspects in elderly patients.
Subsequently, narcissistic forms of transmission in these patients are described and possibilities and goals in the treatment of elderly patients are discussed.
The treatment results of the muscle energy technique according to Mitchel for spinal complaints are presented.
Disorders of joint mobility in the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed with the muscle energy technique.
The therapy has a high level of success.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to chirotherapeutic techniques with impulse.
We report on a 26-year-old patient with one since the age of 10 years. Age known dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, which complains of arthritic knee joint complaints, recurrent diarrhea and sicca symptoms.
Clinical picture, serological findings and histologies of duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy result in a diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjögren's syndrome.
To our knowledge, a common occurrence of these different clinical pictures has not yet been described.
The initiation of a gluten-free diet leads to a rapid improvement in clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be regarded as the actual disorder in the structure of the individual immunological diseases.
In developed countries, it is medical conditions rather than food shortages that contribute to the development of malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly common in the elderly population, occurring in 5-12% of the independently living, 30-61% of the hospitalized, and 40-85% of the elderly living in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in old age requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
A physician's increased awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment are essential to prevent the consequences of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important with regard to the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
The reflected light microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junction/compound nevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 structural features for 12 structural features.
digitiform radial extensions, blue-grey reticular patterns, opaque alabaster gypsum-like lacunae, brown/black dots against a blue/grey background, pseudopodia-like marginal zones and so-called reticular patterns, opaque alabaster gypsum-like lacunae, brown/black dots against a blue/grey background, pseudopodia-like marginal zones, and so-called pseudopodia-like marginal zones. Blue-in-pink areas.
Nevertheless, specific reflected light microscopic phenomena are not yet known.
Therefore, a diagnostic evaluation of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumor is based on several individual features suspected of being malignant in combination.
The article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy methods in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Frequently used vectorial transport systems and strategies for the integration of therapeutic genes into the respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists provides new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Initial clinical feasibility studies in which such a gene ( IRAP) has been transferred are an essential step forward on the way to clinical gene therapy for osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment method for correcting hypoplastic mandibles.
We report on our experience with uni- and bidirectional distractors in both intra- and extraoral application in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia in the context of syndromic diseases.
These were 1 boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral mandibular hypoplasia in Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with Nager syndrome, and 1 rare case of a midline defect in 18p syndrome.
The duration of distraction ranged from 6-30 days, with a bone gain of 6-28 mm being achieved.
Older people interested in further education are increasingly recognizing the many opportunities that the Internet offers them in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Continuing education institutions and institutions for the education of the elderly are called upon to make it easier for older people to access the world of digital media through target group-specific offers, to support them in acquiring media competence and to design virtual learning opportunities that are interesting for them.
On the basis of experiences from the "Senior Info Mobile" information campaign, possibilities are described to give people over 50 access to the new communication technologies.
Using the example of the European network "Learning in Later Life" ( LiLL) and other projects, it is further shown how spatially and temporally decoupled, research-based learning of older adults in the sense of virtual working groups and networks could become the engine of a "new learning culture", which also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or further education institution or who cannot participate in local offers for health and other personal reasons. For health and other personal reasons, it can also include those who do not live in local offers.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by non-invasive MR angiography.
The rapid technical development of MR tomography in recent years has also opened up the possibility of new functional examination methods in addition to the possibility of new functional examination methods.
MR tomography of the heart is characterized by the combination of the simultaneous recording of morphological and functional parameters by a non-invasive procedure without radiation exposure.
Because of its high spatial resolution and reproducibility, cine MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the further development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, it is now possible to clarify many heart diseases in one examination.
MR spectroscopy is the only method that offers insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification round off the overall concept of MR cardiac diagnostics.
MR tomography is the only diagnostic procedure that offers complete clarification of heart diseases in one examination, both as an initial examination and for monitoring the course of the disease.
Due to the rapidly advancing development, still existing restrictions v. a the field of MR coronary angiography will be solved in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development of documentation and IT at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Heidelberg is given.
Since its foundation in 1967, 4 development phases can be distinguished: 4 development phases can be distinguished:
first medical initiatives, establishment of a basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, realization of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus control of the performance.
Planning and implementation were carried out in compliance with framework plans and concepts of the University Hospitals of the State of Baden-Württemberg.
We report on the deformation of a coronary stent as a result of extracorporeal cardiac massage.
This is the first published case.
We report bacterial arteryitis after PTA and stent implantation in an iliac artery with consecutive septic embolization, ipsilateral knee empyema and formation of an infected aneurysm spurium aneurysm.
Contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus must be assumed to be the cause.
Treatment consisted of resection of the inflamed vascular section with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem Six-year-old boy with unilateral type II cleft foot with oligodactyly and cloductyly of the second toe.
This review article deals with the current state of the controversy surrounding the indication for posterior surface replacement of the patella.
The current state of knowledge in the experimental and biomechanical field is described, as are design features of the various implant types and peculiarities of patella preparation.
In addition, the author deals with the main clinical studies on the subject of patellar back surface replacement and tries to provide the reader with criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, it is discussed why the indication for posterior surface replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for the replacement of the patellar posterior surface could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes for the migration and loosening behavior of hip arthroplasty are still unclear.
In particular, chronic mechanical overload of the boundary layers due to changed stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be ruled out.
Arterial hypertension is frequently observed after organ transplantation in adults as a result of treatment with the hypertensiogenic drugs cyclosporine A, tacrolimus( FK 506) or prednisolone.
There are hardly any studies on the behavior of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" denotes the absence of visible signs of fracture in conventional radiography performed for initial diagnosis with a fracture still present.
The diagnosis can only be made during the course of the disease or by means of further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT ( computed tomography) examinations carried out for this purpose have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging( MRI) is a method that allows both the early diagnosis of the "occult fracture" and the diagnosis of any chondral and ligamentous concomitant injuries.
In the present study, we report 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomical regions, in whom the diagnosis could be made with negative X-ray findings with MRI.
Atheroarterial embolism is a phenomenon described at an early stage.
The histological detection of cholesterol crystals in small terminal pathway arteries coined the term cholesterol embolism.
Because of the highly variable clinical picture and the diagnosis that could only be confirmed invasively or post-mortem, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe atherosclerosis of the aorta.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was more than 10% per patient-year in patients with these lesions.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of the proximal aorta is the cause of embolic complications during surgical procedures or catheterization of the aorta.
In patients with a particular variant of atherosclerosis in the aorta with pedunculated and mobile thrombi originating from circumscribed plaques, anticoagulants proved effective.
Embolic recurrences could be prevented and regression of the thrombi could be observed.
A 62-year-old female patient with a pronounced valgus deformity and extension inhibition of the right knee joint as a result of a supracondylar femoral debris fracture is reported, which had been osteosynthetically treated by means of a dynamic condyle screw 2 years ago.
Here, the indication was made for a varying and extending corrective osteotomy and osteosynthesis using a retrograde femoral nail.
The patient could within the 1st period. postoperative week fully burdened the right lower extremity with completed axis compensation.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable method to achieve good and load-stable osteosynthesis even during corrective operations.
Lacrimal duct operations at the University Eye Clinic Münster of 296 children from the years 1987-1992 were examined.
Histological diagnosis of prostate cancer is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytological criteria.
Pathological secretions( eosinophilic secretion, crystalloids, luminal, basophilic mucus formation) are always suspicious, but themselves do not prove a carcinoma.
Cytological criteria( nucleus size, hyperchromasia, nucleoli, cytoplasm changes) must always be evaluated in comparison to pre-existing benign glands.
The immunohistochemical findings with basal cell-specific cytokeratins must be critically evaluated in any case and can at best confirm a cancer diagnosis or ( in the case of positive detection of basal cells) reliably exclude it.
This review compiles the various diagnostic criteria and evaluates their value for routine diagnostics.
In another German study, a maintenance therapy of 14 days 20mg TNFR55-IgG1 igG1 was found in another German study. v. compared to a monthly dose of 50mg ( 50mg) .
Previously, the 60 patients in this study had received an initial dose of 100mg, an initial dose of 100mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed a rapid and significant improvement in all measured parameters as early as one day after the first dose.
Subsequently, despite further administration of the test substance, there was an increase in the inflammatory parameters despite further administration of the test substance.
At the same time, anti-TNFR55-IgG1 antibodies were detected, which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
A 13-month-old patient is reported to have developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal hemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulation disorder and spleen tumor already suggested a vascular process.
The healthy newborn is also entitled to optimal care so that any disorder of postnatal adaptation is recognized in time for any disorder of postnatal adaptation.
The introduction of painless simple yet reliable methods such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has greatly simplified the situation for all responsible persons.
Background and questions.
In view of increasing reports of increases in resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in gonococcal strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aquajogging is a technique that has been used for years in sports and rehabilitation, in which jogging-like movements are carried out in deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid ( vest or belt), are performed in deep water.
In sports, aqua jogging is used as regeneration training and as a" low impact alternative training" in strength endurance and endurance training.
In rehabilitation, aqua jogging is ideal for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and postoperative phase for diseases of the muscular system as well as for endurance and light strength training for internal diseases.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction are of a vascular surgical or prosthetic nature.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery has its place as the only causal therapy in a selected group of patients.
The most important criteria are age under 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
Contrary to initial short-term successes of over 80%, the long-term results had to be about 80%. 53-55% are corrected.
Vein surgery has lost its importance due to a drastic loss of long-term success ( on average less than 40%) .
penile prosthesis surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term survival rates of the implants and a patient satisfaction of 89% of the patients.
Nevertheless, the irreversibility of the procedure often forces this therapy option to take last place in the therapeutic cascade.
Depending on the type of device, complications can occur such as cylinder defects and perforations with 5-year survival rates of implants between 65-90 % and 65-90 %.
This cause can never be eliminated by perforating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbal grafts, which, however, have a highly immunogenic effect.
We report on our now 3 years of experience with the method of homologous central limbokeratoplasty developed by us.
Pentosan polysulfate is used relatively frequently for bladder instillation and significantly decreased nocturia frequency, while daytime micturition frequency remained unchanged in a controlled study.
Heparin also lowered nocturia frequency in an open-label prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosan polysulfate are virtually free of side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, this also applies to applications in radiology.
Thousands of radiological information web sites have been created and are now available online, competing with commercial offerings.
After the first experiences, the task today is to critically assess the possibilities and risks of using the Internet as a distribution medium for radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are among the normal reactions of parents after sudden infant death ( SID) .
In the following, from a psychiatric and forensic point of view, we report on 2 cases in which the mothers reacted with exceptionally severe depression after SID and accused themselves of having killed their child.
Finally, some recommendations for the care of affected parents are shared.
The review of 110 children admitted with Burkitt's lymphoma at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, within a 7-year period showed a preponderance of male over female patients ( 1.09.
1) and an age peak of 5 years.
The areas first affected by tumor were, in order of frequency, face and abdomen, and were first affected by tumor.
The spine, spleen and lungs were less affected.
It is assumed that an interaction between infections by malaria and Epstein-Barr viruses as well as malnutrition may play a role in the etiology of the tumor.
The main drug is cyclophosphamide.
The combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective at initiating disease regression, but is better than the single agent at preventing systemic relapses.
Follow-up examinations of patients showed a good survival rate.
Since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anesthesia, the Zwickau Clinic has been a widely known surgical centre for local anesthesia.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer preserved, continued and supplemented Braun's life's work.
Important impulses for general and local anesthesia, for hospital construction and clinic organization as well as for surgical teaching in words and pictures emanated from Zwickau surgery.
After a brief literature review, the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania that have so far been little described in an adolescent patient will be presented.
Against the background of early fears of abandonment, the renewed threat of being dropped occurs as part of the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness.
The symptom, which previously served to regulate diffuse inner tensions and fears, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematosquamous skin disease with a prevalence of about 2.5% of it.
The skin lesions, which are often difficult to treat, occasionally respond well to topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance which, however, can trigger pustular dermatitis as an adverse effect, depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity, depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report the occurrence of pustular dermatitis after application of a dithranol preparation of the magistral formulation that was erroneously 50-fold too highly concentrated in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renovascular hypertension is of particular importance because, as a secondary form of hypertension, it can be successfully treated and in some cases cured by interventional radiological or vascular surgical measures in many cases.
The frequency and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications after LASIK should be investigated.
An andrological patient is reported in whom the initial examination led to the detection of high-grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and ureaplasma infection.
The increased FSH value and testicular size, which was significantly below the normal range, indicated pronounced testicular parenchymal damage.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculate smear can be understood as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After antibiotic couple therapy with doxycycline and a subsequent 3-month recovery phase under a combination treatment with vitamins C and E as well as the trace element zinc, there was a significant improvement in spermiograms after antibiotic couple therapy with doxycycline and subsequent 3-month recovery.
After a further 2 months, intrauterine insemination made it possible to achieve pregnancy with the subsequent birth of a healthy daughter.
At this point in time, only mild teratozoospermia was found in the patient.
As part of a quality control, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different, established standard anesthetic procedures.
Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of a central serous chorioretinopathy during systemic therapy with corticosteroids will be described.
The X-ray of the pelvic overview still has its indication in addition to sonography in the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in infancy.
The toddler's legs should be kept in the middle position.
Lateral rotations and increased inclination of the pelvis should be avoided.
Looking back on 150 years, including 50 years of personally experienced development of septorhinoplasty, the most recently in the "open approach" with opening the tip of the nose a regression to the 19th in the "open approach" with opening the tip of the nose. Century took place.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
a sublabial approach to septorhinoplasty in the sense of minimally traumatizing surgery is recommended.
In the imaging diagnosis of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature newborns, the chest X-ray is the first priority.
Profound knowledge of the normal thoracic image and the possible physiological peripartum changes are a prerequisite for the interpretation of the neonatal thoracic image.
Kindliche Pathologien:
A variety of congenital and acquired changes faced by the radiologist in neonatology are unknown in adult patient radiodiagnosis.
Many of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or can affect the quality of life in his further life.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the pediatrician is therefore essential.
Here, an overview of the most important pathologies that the radiologist may face in daily routine is given.
The primary tumors were mammary carcinomas( n= 34), leiomyosarcomas( n= 20), pancreatic carcinomas( n= 16), hypernephroid carcinomas( n= 13), melanomas( n= 9), gastric carcinomas( n= 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinomas( n= 6 each) and 14 other tumors.
Extrahepatic tumor involvement( including synchronous primary tumors) was present in 69 out of 140( 49%) cases, of the 120 initial resections, an extrahepatic tumor was present in 51%( n= 61) .
Of the 120 initial resections, 82( 68%) were classified as R0, 13( 11%) as R1, and 25( 21%) as R2 resections.
Median survival was 20 months overall after initial resection, 28 months after R0 resections, and 8 months after R1/2 resections.
After second resection( n= 14), median survival was 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without an extrahepatic tumor at the time of initial liver resection, median survival was 32 months after R0 resection ( 5-year prognosis 25%) and 7 months after R1/2 resection.
The present results show that the resection of non-colorectal non-neuroendocrine liver metastases also promises a prognostic gain.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrences may even benefit from second or third liver resections.
In some cases, impressive long-term courses could be observed even with a rather unfavorable initial situation.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be reviewed in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself remained perplexed about the act, which was foreign to his personality and for which he had no explanation, he had no explanation whatsoever.
Three months later, while in custody, he suffers a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large aneurysm of the A. communicates to the front.
For the assessment of culpability, this course in connection with the witnessed behavioral abnormalities shortly before the crime therefore allows the possibility of a pathological mental disorder at the time of the crime to be considered.
This could have been an epileptic twilight state as a prodromal symptom of the later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon( PFCL) has also proven itself, among other things, for the elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens( IOL) dislocated in the vitreous body.
Due to the high specific gravity of PFCL, the IOL is bloated and can be repositioned in the anterior segment of the eye, where it is currently blown up, for example. B it can be refixed in the sulcus ciliaris.
What kind of contact PFCL makes with the IOL is unclear.
Since biotoxicity of PFCL is likely if it remains intraocular for a longer period of time, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of surgery.
A rare case of a solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of a chondrosarcoma is reported.
The metastasis occurred after a seven-year appearance-free postoperative interval.
In the course of further investigations, no clinically detectable metastases were found.
Nevertheless, taking into account the cases described so far, the prognosis is very poor.
Developmental abnormalities of the pancreas are due to the embryonic development of the organ and are caused by malfusion( pancreas divisum) or malrotation( pancreas annulare) of the two plants.
Pancreas divisum and pancreas annulare can ultimately only be confirmed by a gait representation of the pancreatic duct.
In congenital diseases, there are genetic defects in which other organ systems are usually affected and in which extrapancreatic damage is usually at the forefront of the clinical pictures.
Both developmental anomalies of the pancreas and congenital diseases lead to a wide variety of morphological changes in the organ, which can be detected using modern imaging techniques.
Books often contain not only the material written by the author.
On the basis of the table work of Bärensprung and Hebra it is shown that at second glance they also reveal some other facts relevant to the history of medicine.
About 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia/defect are asymptomatic at the time of birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report unusual findings in late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary funnel breast and a lethal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The informative value of sonography in bacterial coxitis was checked for bacterial coxitis.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis( n= 14), coxitis fugax( n= 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis( n= 12), Perthes disease( n= 92) and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris( n= 21) were examined sonographically.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, femoral head surface and periarticular structures can be assessed in the standard sectional planes of the DEGUM.
An intra-articular mass ( synovialitis, effusion) can be detected sonographically as joint capsule distension.
This capsule detachment was detected sonographically in bacterial coxitis, coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis and in the early stages of Perthes disease.
Since the joint capsule distension does not show any significant differences in the individual diseases, it is not possible to differentiate between these diseases on the basis of the sonogram in the presence of capsule distension without bony changes without bony changes.
Thus, bacterial coxitis cannot be reliably distinguished sonographically from coxitides of other etiologies;
capsular distension is considered a nonspecific sonographic sign.
If bacterial coxitis is clinically suspected, an immediate diagnostic puncture may be necessary, if necessary. under sonographic control required.
Due to additional bony changes in addition to capsular distension, epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes' disease can be distinguished sonographically in the condensation and fragmentation stages from both bacterial coxitis and coxitis of other genesis.
The diagnosis of the rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be made in the context of clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Since in both cases unusually highly differentiated tumor cells were present for gliomatosis cerebri, the diagnosis was made more difficult by atypical findings such as contrast agent uptake in MRI and clinical signs of intracranial pressure increase.
Clinical course, differential diagnoses and literature are briefly presented.
Various experimental designs such as cohort study, case-control study, and randomized clinical trial are presented, explained, and problems are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized trials are discussed in detail and it is shown that they are the only way to arrive at statements about causal relationships in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements for clinical research cannot be met by the application of complex statistical methods, but that, in this sense, good clinical research depends primarily on careful study planning.
A possible influence of tricyclic antidepressants on anticoagulant therapy has so far been evaluated differently.
In particular, the anticoagulant phenprocoumon, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is almost ignored in studies.
The present retrospective study was conducted under the question of a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics.
Summary From 1 4 isn’ t that amazing! 1996 to 30, 1996 to 30 6 In 1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with arteriosclerotic, symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenosis were treated by transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
Simultaneously, a thromboendarterectomy of the A was performed in one case. iliac external with profound plastic, in another case angioplasty with stent implantation of the A. carried out by the iliac Communist Party.
Technical as well as clinical success was achieved in all cases.
In an observation period of median 23 ( 7-33) months, there was no occlusion or clinical restenosis.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation for segmental abdominal aortic stenosis is a less invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
Summary A patient is reported who underwent infertility treatment for several years and became pregnant, although she did not actually want a child, although she did not actually want a child.
The various species of Aspergillus are ubiquitous pathogens.
Aspergillus flavus has historically been classified as rather apathogenic to humans in the past.
The case of a 72-year-old patient in whom Aspergillus flavus was culturally detected in the tracheal secretion after an aortocoronary bypass operation in the intensive care unit is described.
The serological test procedures performed, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and( Author:
is "monoclonal antibodies" correct or with monoclonal antibodies. ) monoclonal antibodies covered latex particles were negative several times.
A post-mortem Aspergillus test with a newer method, antigen detection by means of enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
Clinical and radiographic findings showed no evidence of systemic infection.
The patient died before antimycotic therapy was used, and autopsy revealed disseminated mycosis of both lungs caused by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of more sensitive antigen detection by means of enzyme immunoassay can facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
By correctly assessing the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated even with a single cultural detection of Aspergillus flavus in the trachea.
Epidemiological data show a decrease in the incidence of appendicitis and appendectomy in industrialized countries.
The peak age is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforation is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histological evidence of acute inflammation - especially in young women - and the high rate of perforation in young children and the elderly shows the low diagnostic certainty.
Analysis of epidemiological data does not allow a clear conclusion on the etiopathogenesis of appendicitis acuta.
After corneal refractive surgery and cataract surgery, ocular image defects ( aberrations) can occur that cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why maximum retinal visual acuity is often not achieved despite optimal correction despite optimal correction.
Recording these aberrations under clinical conditions would be an important first step towards documenting and correcting these aberrations using modern photorefractive methods of photorefractive detection.
For both methods, only static unidirectional tensile stress tests had previously been carried out experimentally for both methods.
Ecke and Hofmann thus came to the conclusion that a comparable stability could be achieved with flexible fixations compared to rigid procedures and that this should be preferred for the prophylaxis of ankylosis because of the preservation of mobility in the symphysis.
By simultaneous, multidirectional dynamic experimental investigation under gait simulation conditions, symphysis stabilizations were comparatively tested by means of DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire tension straps and PDS bandings.
The symphysis preparations were loaded synchronously in the sagittal and vertical directions with a frequency of 1.5 Hz over 55 500 load changes( steps during 6 weeks of mobilization) .
Neither wire traction taping nor PDS banding were sufficiently stable, although these methods allowed symphysis mobility beyond physiological limits immediately after the start of the experiment.
In the further course of the experiment, instability increased due to cutting of the cerclages and bandings into the bone or fracture of the wire cerclages in general until complete failure.
In DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, on the other hand, the stabilization success was dependent on the primary stability of the screw anchorage.
With the primary tendency of the screws to overthrow, the plate stabilization under dynamic load became increasingly unstable.
With primarily stable anchorage of the plate screws, the fixation remained fully stable over 55, 500 load changes with a load corresponding to the average half body weight.
For clinical application, it can be deduced from these results that neither the bridging tension belting with wire cerclages nor the PDS banding stabilize the ruptured symphysis sufficiently for early postoperative mobilization under partial loading.
If secure stabilization of the ruptured symphysis can primarily be achieved with the DC plate or the reconstruction plate by good anchoring of the screws in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person can be mobilized with an "open-book injury" with partial loading corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses( MIOL) have been implanted successfully for years.
Due to the distribution of light over several focal points, a smaller amount of light is available for each image for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or scattered light effects due to capsular fibrosis may lead to a deterioration in vision at an early stage.
In a 69-year-old female patient, a 5 cm large, moderately pleomorphic spindle-cell thyroid tumor was initially misunderstood as primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
Duodenal leiomyosarcoma with a diameter of 7 cm was discovered and resected by means of duodenopancreatectomy only in the course of an anemia investigation carried out 17 months later.
The reassessment of the primary histology led to the revision of the initial diagnosis and the classification of the thyroid tumor as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died another 6 months later of an apoplectic insult.
The autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of the tumor as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by the thyroid metastasis.
Drug therapy for erectile dysfunction includes oral as well as local application of pharmaceuticals.
The only approved oral substance with proven efficacy at this time is Yohimbine, a centrally acting alpha receptor blocker, which is now a centrally acting alpha receptor blocker.
Other oral drugs with a central target are trazodone and apomorphine, with apomorphine having significantly better efficacy than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both intraurethral ( MUSE) and intracavernous modes of application are available for local application.
At present, prostaglandin E1( Caverject) has largely displaced other pharmaceuticals as the substance used.
Currently, several promising substances with a wide variety of approaches and different dosage forms are under development as a therapeutic agent for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They alter the patient's state of consciousness and contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, as is particularly important for severely disturbed patients who cannot be adequately reached by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal, and death experiences are within their natural reach.
One of the most important long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormone therapy led to the establishment of a variety of different strategies summarized under the term immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates are usually between 20 and 40 %.
In addition, 30-40% of patients experience a temporary stabilization of the disease, which in some cases can last for years, in 30-40% of patients.
These are mainly results of uncontrolled phase II studies.
Cures are usually not expected, long-term remissions are rare( 5%) and high remission rates can only be achieved in selected patient collectives.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotherapied patients over non-chemotherapy or chemotherapy patients.
A survival advantage for patients with objective remissions is assured.
A standard therapy cannot be defined at present.
Even assuming a survival advantage, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of the current therapy protocols as well as their high costs must be taken into account due to the toxicity of the current therapy protocols and their high costs.
Due to the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in the currently achievable remission rates and the survival benefit for immunotherapied patients reported by some authors[ 15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential component in the therapy of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
As a rule, use should be in clinical trials.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, namely 262 men ( about half 44.4+/- 0.9 and 63.0+/- 0.9 years old) and 239 women ( half 44.4+/- 0.9 and 62.8+/- 0.8 years old), laboratory indices are calculated from the measured values of 12 clinical chemical parameters and checked for correlations with the biological age according to Ries.
Alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides are included in the calculation of the index.
Significant correlations between laboratory indices and biological age are found only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters also correlate significantly with pre-aging.
These include alkaline phosphatase, the LDL/HDL ratio, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose levels.
A 2 cm cystadenofibroma of the appendix epiploica of the distal sigmoid is described, which was discovered as an incidental finding during a hysterectomy with adnexectomy for endometrial cancer in a 72-year-old female patient.
It showed the same histology as analogous tumors of the ovary and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the appendices epiploicae and the left parietal peritoneum and cytological atypia in the peritoneal lavage fluid.
These findings are likely due to occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis.
The histogenesis, histology and localizations of primary peritoneal neoplasms of the Müller type are discussed.
Initially, it was hoped that this method would provide advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction, and restoration of proprioception in addition to an optimized position of the patellar tendon graft, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique has not yet been proven.
15 endoscopic and 14 open-operated patients were examined preoperatively and after 3 and 6 months postoperatively, respectively.
The score systems according to Lysholm and Tegner, the ligamentary stability ( KT-1000), the duration of the operation and the proprioception were collected using the angular reproduction test.
The absorbed dose of spiral computed tomography and orthopantomogram ( OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head region using thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube power recommended by the manufacturer of the CT scanner for dental CT has been gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured absorbed dose of computed tomography was 0.30 mGy( thyroid gland) to 29 mGy( skin surface in the beam path) at 187.5 mAs and 1 mm slices( 25 mm scan distance in the upper jaw, 30 mm in the lower jaw) .
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy( thyroid) to 6.9 mGy( skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawed jaw specimens were compared with corresponding CT measurements on a workstation at a workstation.
The average measurement inaccuracy was 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of CT by approx. 76% had no influence on the length measurement accuracy.
However, the energy doses of the CT scans, which are dose-reduced by 76%-3, are still on average 10 times higher than the energy dose of an orthopantomogram.
The importance of enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectified by the introduction of molecular biological techniques ( polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium in patients with a clinical suspicion of dilated cardiomyopathy enables a subdivision into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy( no evidence of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the WHO classification of 1995( 31) .
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as a myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory reaction, which can be detected using histological and, above all, immunohistological techniques.
Only by combining histological, immunohistological, and molecular biological techniques was it possible to carry out a subgroup analysis with regard to the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In addition to bacterial exogenous ( post-traumatic/postoperative) bacterial endogenous ( hematogenous) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of abacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis can be distinguished, which, in contrast to the others, manifests preferentially on the clavicle, in contrast to the others, manifests itself primarily on the clavicle.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicular osteomyelitis that we treated from 1978-1996, 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as casuistries.
Despite its rare occurrence, primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle must be considered in the differential diagnosis, since it is a domain of conservative, drug therapy after biopsy confirmation of the diagnosis.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
Despite modern drug and surgical treatment methods, it is often difficult to treat despite modern drug and surgical treatment methods.
The treatment of malignant tumors rests on the four pillars of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
Based on a literature review, the role of overall treatment duration and dose intensity in the optimization of chemotherapeutic protocols is investigated using the example of three important oncological diseases.
Both tumor models and the resulting hypotheses and, above all, well-designed clinical trials can enable advances in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases to enable advances in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases.
Castleman's disease ( angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined clinical picture from the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative substance, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules, thereby altering cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to reduced proliferation, migration, and signal transduction.
In this thesis, the in vitro and in vivo results from our research on paclitaxel are presented.
After comparing 3 different catheter systems ( porous balloon, microporous balloon and double balloon), the double balloon was favored for in vivo application.
The effect of paclitaxel in the smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall was demonstrated by means of staining of the cytoskeleton as well as electron optics in the smooth muscle cells of the vessel wall.
In rabbits, locally applied paclitaxel led to a significant inhibition of neointimal proliferation and widening of vessel diameter compared to balloon-dilated control animals.
In additional experiments, a drastic reduction in vascular contractile force after paclitaxel administration could be shown.
In addition to an age-dependent storage of waste products between the cytoplasm and basal membrane of the RPE cells ( "basal laminar deposits"), a cleavage of the Bruch membrane between the basal membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer is shown in various manifestations of early and late AMD such as drusen, choroidal neovascularizations and pigment epithelial elevations between the basal membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer.
Since the different membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, it was investigated whether an age-dependent regression of the adhesion apparatus could be detected.
Recent studies make it clear that vertebral arch dysplasia and spondylolysis arise as a result of impaired spinal growth.
To determine the symptoms of rheumatic hand flexor tendon disease depending on the site of the lesion and the type of vision affection in order to enable early surgical therapy with preservation of hand function through improved clinical diagnostics.
For the majority of common dermatoses, suitable animal models occurring in nature are lacking.
Transgenic technology, founded in the 1980s, closes this gap.
It was initially an instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also found its way into clinically oriented, specifically dermatological basic research.
It has made it possible to imitate HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatoses in the murine model and to gain insights into their pathogenesis.
Through targeted epidermally localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice showed similarities to psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, mice produced in this way can be used to study the wound healing process.
Furthermore, transgenic technology enables the induction of cutaneous tumors.
The availability of animal models of human dermatoses also allows targeted research into experimental forms of therapy, such as, for example, human dermatoses. B somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging( MRI) in carriers of artificial heart valves are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic questions such as processes in the posterior fossa, spinal abscesses and complaints inside the knee can be examined better by MRI than with other radiological methods.
MRI can directly affect carriers of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) movement and dislocation of the valve prosthesis, 2) heating and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electrical currents, and indirectly by distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI in patients with artificial heart valves does not appear to be sufficient.
Therefore, in 1998, a survey was conducted among twenty-five manufacturers of artificial heart valves regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of MRI of their respective valve prosthesis.
Some companies based their statements on studies that could not be viewed, or blamed the doctor performing the MRI on him.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prostheses.
Based on our survey, an overview of the technical aspects, clinical circumstances, and prerequisites for MRI safety standards in artificial heart valve wearers is given.
In an experimental study, intravenous CO2 or argon embolism with 10, 20 and 30 ml of gas was performed in 10 pigs with an average body weight of 18.9( 15-24) kg.
In the argon group( n= 5), two animals died after 20 or 20, respectively. 30 ml bolus dose.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after administration of 30 ml bolus.
In the CO2 group( n= 5) neither one of the animals died nor was resuscitation necessary.
Low-soluble gases such as argon should not be used in situations where there is an increased risk of gas embolism.
We report on a 56-year-old female patient with disseminated granuloma annulare with a known diabetic metabolic state of life.
In addition, there was renal insufficiency, which made us refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We performed balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoralen whole-body baths using the foil method, which after 30 treatments led to a complete regression of the lesions on the trunk and neck and to a significant improvement in the skin findings on the extremities.
Side effects did not occur.
Balneophotochemotherapy can therapeutically influence not only epidermal but also dermal localized processes.
Cat scratch disease( KKK) is an infectious disease little known in Germany.
Only a few years ago, the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, could be isolated.
In the majority of cases, there is a typical clinical picture with skin changes in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and benign lymphadenopathy.
Less frequently, other organ manifestations occur.
We report on a 47-year-old female patient who developed reactive spondarthritis with synovialitis of the finger joints, polyarthralgia of the middle and large joints and inflammatory lumbalgia after a cat bite.
The rheumatic symptoms were limited in time and responded well to NSAIDs.
To date, only a few cases of joint involvement in the context of KKK have been described.
However, since the infestation of cats with Bartonella henselae is high in Europe, it could be a more common cause of joint discomfort than previously thought.
Diagnosis of KKK has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We provide an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Continuous therapy optimization in recent years has significantly improved the prognosis of Hodgkin's disease.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a large number of possible long-term complications of which the attending physician must be aware.
Due to often long-lasting fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism and damage to the gonadal system with hemiospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the quality of life of the mostly young patients is permanently impaired in their quality of life.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasms after primarily successful therapy is a significant problem.
Starting from attachment styles as circumscribed patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations and willingness to act in attachment-relevant situations ( Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990) the aim was to adequately assess these patterns in the sense of their original definition, i.e. the original definition. hm there we go to operationalize as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles, secure, avoidant, and ambivalent, have been translated into self-descriptions by clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
Three scales were formed on the basis of factor analysis results:
374 inpatients( 56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the beginning of their psychotherapy.
Cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as attachment styles:
"safe", two variants of insecure-ambivalent ( "closed" and "clinging") and two variants of insecure-avoidant ( "closed" and "cooperative") .
The discriminant analysis of these clusters revealed discriminant functions similar to those of Collins u. Read ( 1990) and Ainsworth et al.
The presence of the clinical symptoms of progressive sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo and simultaneous radiological evidence of a contrast medium-absorbing mass of the inner auditory canal confirm the suspicion of the presence of an acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old patient with a history of Sharp syndrome and the initially typical constellation of findings.
The presented casuistry shows a case of a large lymphoma in the area of the cerebellopontine angle, which manifested itself with a peripheral cranial nerve failure in the ENT area and initially a lack of central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the failure of exclusively peripheral cranial nerves suggested the presence of lymphoma preoperatively.
The facial palsy that occurred within a few weeks and the typical occipital cephalgia radiating into the ear are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings as in the case described by us must challenge, despite the present guiding symptoms, to bring about a differential diagnostic clarification despite the presence of key symptoms.
The manifestation of solitary lymphomas in the cerebellopontine angle is considered a rarity.
Further therapeutic options available to gynecologists in practices, clinics and rehabilitation include balneotherapy and physiotherapy as primary or complementary treatment measures.
In gynecology, balneogynaecology as a natural healing method has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies.
Balneogynaecological and physiotherapeutic measures are to be used, based on the indication, primarily as supplementary measures.
Only in chronic conditions as well as acute muscular tension are they particularly suitable for pain reduction and positive tissue influencing as primary measures.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnostics currently require. ZTT an average of four weeks until the presence of a positive tuberculosis culture and subsequent susceptibility testing.
It takes seven to eight weeks to report a negative culture result before it is reported.
Faster results are achieved in individual diagnostic steps by new methods such as new methods. B Nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not yet have the desired high sensitivity.
The worldwide disturbing epidemiological situation of the risk of infection with tuberculosis leaves no doubt that the further development of methods is necessary which allow mycobacteria with high sensitivity and specificity to be detected, differentiated and tested for their sensitivity to antibiotics in the shortest possible time.
As part of a prospective randomized study, a non-joint bridging assembly of the small external fixator of the AO for the therapy of the distal radius fracture( A2/ A3 according to AO classification) is compared with the treatment by percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with plaster.
The collection of donated breast milk has a long tradition in Germany.
With modern screening methods, the transmission of infections is excluded.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favorable composition, milk from donors who themselves have prematurely born children is preferred for very immature premature babies.
In the last 20 years, a large number of day care centres ( TSn) and psychosocial contact and counselling centres ( KBSn) have emerged in Germany as complementary day care centres.
The widespread use of these facilities contrasts with the lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and on their working methods.
In the present study, 100 visitors of TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined.
Characteristics of the social situation, the psychopathological symptoms and the perspective of the visitors were collected.
Almost all visitors had previously been in inpatient psychiatric treatment.
The current psychopathological symptoms varied considerably with an average of moderate severity.
Two-thirds of the visitors were retired, most lived alone and had few or no friends.
As positive aspects of the facilities, the visitors mentioned v. a contacting other people and day to day structuring.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the disturbance caused by other visitors.
On average, TSn visitors were younger and had higher scores in the BPRS anergy subscale.
Otherwise, visitors to the two facilities hardly differed in the characteristics studied.
The results indicate that both institutions do in fact care for chronically mentally ill people with poor social integration, for which they are also designed to care.
For these patients, they partially compensate for deficits in the social network.
Limits and consequences of the results are addressed.
Funktionelle Untersuchungen des Gehirns waren lange Zeit lediglich mit nuklearmedizinischen Methoden wie der Positronenemissionstomographie ( PET) und der Single-Photonen-Emission-Computed-Tomography ( SPECT) möglich.
The use of fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast agent applications and special post-processing methods made it possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes by means of magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) .
T1- and T2*-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging sequences can provide information on tissue perfusion, microcirculation, and permeability of the blood-brain barrier using special, z. T’ s. Models derived from nuclear medicine are recorded.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in the tissue can be visualized with diffusion-weighted MRI, the macrovasculature, temporally resolved, with MR angiographic techniques.
With MR spectroscopic examinations, metabolic distributions in normal and pathological tissue can be recorded multidimensionally and metabolic processes can be observed over the course of them.
The advantages of MRI are the low invasiveness, the possibility of a three-dimensional representation of the data and an arbitrary repeatability of the examination with no radiation exposure.
The functional methods that can already be used clinically are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of their value in comparison with nuclear medicine methods.
In der Tumordiagnostik liefern die funktionellen MR-Techniken wichtige Zusatzinformationen für die Therapiefindung, Therapieplanung und das Therapiemonitoring.
Initial studies have shown that the methods are able to sensitively detect pathophysiological changes in dementia and psychosis.
It is the declared goal of the World Health Organization ( WHO) to place health protection as high as possible in the consciousness of all in the countries of the European Region, also in view of the constant political and economic change, in the European Region.
Environmental factors that are harmful to health are to be combated internationally through concrete measures or, better still, prevented or avoided, in a preventive manner.
An indispensable prerequisite for this is the agreement on international standards in the field of environment and health as well as coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
It must be ensured that governments and the respective populations develop a common perception of the important environmental health problem areas.
To ensure the smoothest possible flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen ( WHO/EURO) established a WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health at the Robert Koch Institute in Bonn in the summer of 1997, with financial support from the Federal Ministry of Health.
A 30-year-old patient is reported to have experienced right-sided amaurosis fugax with concomitant frontobasal fracture after a fall event.
CT and MR angiography were used to enable occlusion of the A. ophthalmic artery as a result of dissection of the artery. The internal carotid artery with ascending thrombosis is considered the cause of thrombosis.
There were no other neurological deficits, as adequate blood flow to the cerebral arteries was ensured via the cerebral artery circulation.
In the etiological diversity of post-traumatic amaurosis, such a rare cause should be possible. etiological, diagnostic, and therapeutic considerations can be found.
Suspicion of acute aortic dissection requires immediate clarification with appropriate imaging techniques, such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging or aortography.
In the case presented here, an asymptomatic patient was echocardiographically suspected of having an aortic dissection.
Due to the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used in addition to other cross-sectional imaging methods to diagnose evidence of haustration of the aneurysmally dilated thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of acute chest pain, increasing dyspnea and right ventricular cardiac decompensation with the image of right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
Further evaluation by echocardiography revealed a ruptured sinus valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary leaflet with a left-right shunt into the right atrium as the cause in a non-invasive way.
Cardiac surgery was carried out without complications while maintaining the aortic valve.
Six months later, echocardiographically, the right heart sections were normal in width, and color Doppler showed no evidence of shunt.
Acute cardiac insufficiency can also be a consequence of a congenital heart defect in middle age.
Echocardiography and especially transesophageal echocardiography made a precise diagnosis by non-invasive means.
Characteristics of rodent syndrome are mandibulofacial and limb malformations.
Hypoplasia of the mandible can lead to airway obstruction due to the tongue resting against the posterior wall of the pharynx, especially in infancy.
We present a patient with rodent syndrome who received nasal CPAP and sedation for 5 months due to persistent dyspnea.
After the soft tissues were pre-stretched by an extension treatment, mandibular distraction osteogenesis was performed at a body weight of 6 kg.
Both the functional and cosmetic results are good.
Airway obstruction and dyspnea were no longer observed after completion of therapy.
Successful thromboendarterectomies( TEA) of the A. Internal carotid artery leads to improved perfusion in the flow area of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular blood flow during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more doctors about the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the treatment of a specific case of illness by means of modern telematics.
The practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics ( initially ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform) .
The legal framework for teleconsultation in everyday clinical practice has been largely defined, but it is still unclear whether this independent medical service will be adequately remunerated.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on vision.
Today there is no longer any doubt that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to a reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be an immediate consequence of psoriasis is controversial.
In the following, we present a 38-year-old female patient who had been suffering from progressive effluvium in psoriatic foci on the capillitium for years.
Histologically, strand-like fibrosis instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis, which occasionally spread to the epithelium of preserved hair follicles, and signs of scalp psoriasis were impressive.
The clinical course and lack of evidence for another cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
Knowledge of this possible relationship is important because consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and thus presumably scarring development.
Reduced growth hormone ( GH) production is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves various clinical symptoms including the number of major pain points.
The reduced GH secretion is likely due to an increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus due to the hypothalamus of somatostatin release.
The hypothesis is presented that this impaired GH secretion is caused by intermittent phases of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin resulting in reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research indicates the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior ( SVV) .
Nevertheless, the efficiency of classical neuroleptics is questionable.
In open-label and controlled studies, the serotonin 2A dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone also effectively reduced SVV in the longer term even effectively.
The aim of the present study was to create an osteoporosis animal model by means of ovariectomy.
Before and after ovariectomy, osteodensitometric measurements of the upper and lower jaw were performed using DXA.
A significant decrease in bone density after ovariectomy was seen in both the maxilla and mandible.
10 patients with idiopathic, non-traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint were arthroscopically evaluated and treated.
The causes of the bleeding were manifold:
In addition to vascular abnormalities such as hemangiomas and meniscus lesions, we found evidence of bleeding from arrodated subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
Surgical, mostly arthroscopic therapy brought good results.
Toxic snakebite injuries in children in Germany are almost exclusively caused by adders ( Vipera berus) .
The adder injects a poison of various enzymes and hemorrhagic factors as well as neurotoxic factors.
Adder bites in children can be asymptomatic, but can also cause severe symptoms of poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings can be presented over a large area in their environment.
The transmission of sonographic findings to the therapist who is not present at the examination and the control of a finding, e.g. the control of a finding, e.g. B of a tumor, under therapy, are thereby significantly improved.
Viruses, in turn, have also become more mobile due to increasing human travel speed and activity worldwide.
At the same time, due to the rapid development of electronic communication technologies, more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world is being received in ever shorter periods of time due to the rapid development of electronic communication technologies.
In this thesis, four case studies are used to examine the factors that can influence an early or late time of initial diagnosis of dementia.
In all our cases, we have made the indication for surgery.
In each case, the perforation site was primarily sutured over and as well as extensively rinsed and drained.
In 2 cases, the seam was additionally treated by fibrin glue or fibrin glue. secured with an omentumplasty.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate sequelae.
On the basis of these own results and after evaluation of the current literature, the following conclusions seem justified to us:
If perforation is secured in the early stages, a definitive surgical procedure is indicated.
Even in the case of delayed diagnosis with advanced mediastinitis, a suture closure of the perforation site should be attempted.
An additional backup is recommended in these cases.
Resecting procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases due to the high surgical risk.
The standards and regulations valid in MRI for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
In children with horseshoe kidneys, Wilms tumors are observed 2 to 8 times more frequently.
Wilms' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that rarely have larger fatty tissue components.
We report on a 28-month-old girl with an unusual Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney, which radiologically could have also been a teratoma due to a large lipomatous proportion with internal calcifications.
The radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses in different cross-sectional imaging methods are presented.
Both differential diagnostic considerations found their correlation in the histological diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumor.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often misunderstood as a malignancy.
Because of the high lethality of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included in the differential diagnostic considerations at an early stage.
We report on a 58-year-old patient with a 6-month history, bloody purulent expectoration and considerable body weight reduction, who was referred to us under suspicion of a thoracic sarcoma.
The diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis could only be made via a diagnostic detour.
This was triggered by an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
Under antibiotic treatment, the symptoms were quickly regressed and ultimately led to the patient being cured.
Bronchoscopy is also an important component in the differential diagnosis of thoracic space-occupying lesions, which includes inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatous tumors and germ cell tumors, and bronchoscopy is an important part of diagnostics.
Arteriovenous malformations of the liver are a rare malformation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia( HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease) .
In addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, systemic consequences, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old female patient in whom percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavorable vascular anatomy for a long time.
Instead, adjustable banding of the hepatic artery was tested as a new treatment concept, but a adjustable banding of the hepatic artery.
After minilaparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the hepatic artery and an adapted throttling of the hepatic artery was performed via the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output were successfully reduced and heart failure was treated.
The described technique thus represents an alternative to ligation of the hepatic artery when percutaneous embolization is not possible or unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis has been made in biopsies of benign diseases in our own test material in 20 years in 3% of our own test material.
While puerperal mastitis in relation to the number of births today in approx. 1% is present, the different forms of nonpuerperal mastitis have come to the fore both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as accompanying phenomena, the majority of mastitis currently diagnosed are chronic granulomatous forms with a wide range of causes.
Only a small proportion is an expression of a pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoidosis or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis is a B lymphocytic mastitis with tumor-like fibrosis occurring in diabetes mellitus type I( diabetic mastopathy), endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases without features of secretory activity( lobular secretion) and when pathogen-related mastitis is suspected, bacterioscopic and microbiological examinations should always be carried out on fresh material.
Infectious colitis with the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs preferably in immunocompromised or antibiotic-treated patients.
We report on 2, 5 or 5, respectively. 14-year-old boys with Clostridium difficile-related colitis without the above-mentioned preconditions or a specific underlying condition.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the use of an appropriate protocol leads to an earlier onset of weaning and a significant reduction in mechanical ventilation time.
Both daily screening of respiratory function and attempts at spontaneous breathing are valuable aids that should be included in a weaning protocol.
Once the condition and ability to breathe spontaneously are documented, extubation of ventilated patients should be encouraged, as sufficient evidence demonstrates that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be successfully extubated after a spontaneous breathing attempt.
A gradual discontinuation of mechanical ventilation can be undertaken in patients in whom spontaneous breathing attempts have been unsuccessful.
Two randomized trials show that the strategy used to discontinue mechanical ventilation affects the speed and extent of weaning success and that SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip, jaw and palate is intended to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare baseline findings and surgical outcomes in 30 patients with unilateral LKG clefts.
Open rhinoplasty was used to correct the nasal deformity.
Soft tissue analysis of the nose was performed by measuring standardized nasal grid photographs and lateral cephalometric radiographs.
Deviations in nasal symmetry, nasal width, and nasal wing attachment line from the ideal shape were determined.
The nasal profile was assessed by measuring the nasofacial, nasolabial angle, the angle between upper lip and Frankfurt horizontal, and the angle between Columella and Frankfurt horizontal.
Anterior rhinomanometry was used to evaluate air patency.
The total flow( cm3/ s) was determined, and the flow of the cleavage and non-cleavage sides were compared.
The examinations were performed immediately before and 6 months after the surgical procedure.
In the frontal plane, a significant correction of the nasal symmetry and an adjustment of the nasal wing inclination are achieved in the frontal plane.
A significant improvement in the acute nasofacial angle and the low nasal wing was not achieved.
As a result of the intervention, the overall flow could be increased and a correction of the quotient of the flows of the gap and non-gap sides could be achieved.
The examination methods used allow the aesthetically and functionally relevant findings to be objectified and thus serve as quality control.
Studies and reports of incidents after manual therapy of the spine from 1989-1996 were examined.
There are no correctly conducted prospective or retrospective studies in the literature on complications that have occurred in connection with manipulative treatment of the spine.
Due to the excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging method of choice in the assessment of ankle diseases.
Conventional MRI can reliably image normal and acutely injured ligaments.
However, in the subacute and chronic stages of the injury, the joint fluid that is necessary for an exact delineation of the injured ligaments is often missing.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases because intra-articular KM application distends the joint space with improved differentiation of intra-articular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the stage assessment of osteochondritis dissecans, since in cases of unstable lesions, a contrast medium surrounding the dissect can be more easily visualized in cases of unstable lesions.
Finally, due to the high contrast and joint distension, MR arthrography also improves the detection of intra-articular free joint bodies, which often require surgical treatment.
MR arthrography although invasive provides essential additional information in the examination of the post-traumatic ankle joint as well as various ankle diseases.
The therapeutic goal of resuscitation after acute treatment must be the social reintegration of the person, ideally the state before the emergency occurred.
The present study investigated the long-term outcome of patients resuscitated due to out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in a rural area.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of trunk varicosis from V. -saphena magna and/or parva type.
Ascension can lead to migration of the thrombus into the deep venous system via the orifices of the trunk veins in the groin and back of the knee or via insufficient veins. perforants come, threatening the complication of pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes varicophlebitis of the truncal veins without involvement of the orifices of V. saphenous magna and/or parva and the deep venous system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfascially via insufficient Vv. perforantes into the deep veins.
In these cases, varicosis is surgically repaired only after the acute symptoms have subsided.
The operation includes crossectomy, extirpation of the truncal vein via separate incisions, exhairesis of all varicose branches and ligation of insufficient veins. perforantes.
In type III, thrombectomy has its own via V. - Sphena magna and/or parva muzzle priority over all other measures.
Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, symptomless thickening of the lateral parts of the fingers and occurs almost exclusively in young men.
Formally pathogenetically, the disease is based on benign fibromatosis.
Based on our own observations and a review of the literature, exogenous factors in the form of obsessive-compulsive acts appear to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia( thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura= TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome= HUS) are often associated with involvement of the central nervous system.
Typical symptoms are irritability, restlessness, confusion, clouding of consciousness, seizures or focal neurological deficits.
We report on a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute brain-organic psychosyndrome with progressive disturbance of consciousness up to coma.
Initial cranial computed tomography showed discrete, general brain swelling, which resolved independently of clinical deterioration, regardless of clinical deterioration.
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was inconspicuous.
Transcranial Doppler sonography showed generalized flow velocity increases ( A) . The cerebri media, anterior and posterior on both sides as well as the A. basilaris) .
The causal relationship between increases in flow velocity and disturbances of consciousness is made probable by the observation that the clinical improvement took place analogously to the regression of the increases in flow velocity.
Pathophysiologically, impaired prostacyclin metabolism, an increase in serotonin and platelet factor IV and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
The continuous follow-up of the anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted procedure.
Although replacement plastic surgery is the gold standard for the treatment of cruciate ligament injuries, autologous reinforcement reinsertion in adolescents is an excellent option.
We report the rare case of a post-traumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk.
This was preceded by a blunt chest trauma in a traffic accident.
Computed tomography( CT) did not diagnose the vascular injury.
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs after blunt thoracic trauma, angiography to rule out a life-threatening vascular injury must be requested if possible.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office( now Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) are based on existing scientific data and are categorized according to their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and sometimes differ considerably from them in some cases.
This brief presentation of the American guidelines is intended to provide the clinician with a well-founded decision-making aid for his or her own practical work with regard to many everyday, but by no means insignificant, problems.
A 57-year-old female patient with progressive systemic scleroderma underwent prolonged therapy with iloprost for 21 days.
The dosage was 2 ng/kgKGxmin over a creep-in phase of 6 days.
The therapy led to an improvement in the inflammatory parameters, the lung function, in particular the diffusion capacity and the pronounced acral circulatory disorder.
Due to its central location, the elbow joint is to be regarded as the most important joint of the upper extremity from a functional point of view.
Bony and ligamentous injuries in the area of the proximal forearm confront the treating physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions at the elbow joint, which are associated with chronic pain symptoms and restricted movement, inevitably reduce the usability of the entire arm.
Today, there is hardly any doubt that in the majority of cases a primary definitive osteosynthetic treatment with exact reconstruction of the joint surface is just as indispensable for a satisfactory result as an early start of physiotherapeutic exercise measures is for an early start of physiotherapeutic exercise measures.
With an increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical characteristics of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in therapeutic principles has taken place in recent decades, the current status of which is presented in the present work, taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrode complications can have fatal consequences.
Manipulation by the patient of subcutaneous electrode sections palpable through the skin can lead to damage to the probe.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode runs and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This drug is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was already successfully used in patients with psoriasis in the 70s.
This review presents the mechanism of action and pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil and summarizes current experience with this drug in dermatology.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology today offers the possibility of tomographically precisely analyzing structures in individual steps with tomography.
Image planes that cannot be displayed with conventional technology can be reconstructed from the electronic memory without problems.
Surface and transparency modes additionally allow a plastic representation of stored structures.
With these different imaging possibilities and the loss-free long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D sonography sets new standards in the fine diagnosis of early gravity.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of a 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 hours on the first postoperative day.
After temporary paraesthesia, as a result of the accidental infusion, burning pain occurred in the legs, combined with motor and sensory loss of innervation up to segment TH11, and this was combined with loss of motor and sensory innervation up to segment TH11, which occurred at the time of segment TH11. The clinical picture was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications such as those described are usually based on errors, the occurrence of which is not impossible, but can be made less likely by taking appropriate measures.
Such measures include color-coding pipes, filters and infusion solutions, and the use of syringe pumps with a larger drug reservoir to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
The observation of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transverse dimension has been neglected in dental implantology up to now.
With a view to a fundamental evaluation of the influence of alveolar ridge height and width, 95 edentulous bony upper jaws from collections that were sawed, measured and classified in a standardized manner were first analysed.
For 4 implant types ( 10 mm minimum length), 1076 implantations were simulated on 269 cross-sections and evaluated differentiated according to implant type, cross-sectional position and atrophy class.
A similar procedure was used in the clinical part of the study for 24 consecutive implant patients with edentulous upper jaw.
Implant placement on the cadaveric jaw was only possible in 35% of the cross-sections, but was actually to be expected in a further 4.5% if the jaw height was sufficient.
Implant length reductions were also necessary in 6% in addition.
There were dependencies v. a to the atrophy class.
Anterior cross-sections offered much more favorable conditions than posterior cross-sections.
In contrast, implantability was not given in any of the 24 patients.
Primary insufficient height was present in 22 cases, 2 times a transversally too narrow alveolar crest turned out to be only during the operation if the height was sufficient.
The results allow quantification of the importance of vertical and transverse dimensions of the maxillary alveolar ridge to be done.
Bone height is of primary importance, although reductions in implant length are often necessary even with sufficient height.
However, alveolar ridge profiles remain both on the cadaver jaw ( 12% of the incisions with expected implantability) and on the patient ( 8%), for which the sole height measurement simulates incorrect conditions and may be able to falsify incorrect conditions. an exactly planned surgical intervention must be terminated.
The complexity and price of implantological rehabilitation and the scope of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even require extended cross-sectional diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography ( PET) is a new imaging technique that can be used to study metabolic processes rather than morphological changes.
Since tumors have increased glycolysis, these can be detected using radioactively labeled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven itself in different tumor entities.
In this study, PET was investigated in lymph node staging of bladder cancer.
In 64 patients, PET of the pelvis was performed preoperatively after i. v. Fluor-deoxy-glucose ( FDG) injection was performed to compare PET findings with the histological findings of the surgical specimen after classical surgical lymph node staging.
Lymph node staging correctly identified positive lymph nodes in 14 patients;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 80% are calculated.
Thus, the PET results are encouraging and appear to be better than the classic staging methods such as CT and MRI.
In 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis, serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were determined to detect immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had subnormal total immunoglobulin levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It influences the decision as to whether antibiotic therapy and/or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
If chronic infections of the paranasal sinuses persist despite conservative therapy, mucosal-protective paranasal surgery is indicated, but this alone cannot bring the desired success in this clinical picture.
An immune subclass deficiency is an indicator of a disturbed immune system to be assessed as an indicator of a disturbed immune system.
Transitions into severe immune deficiency with development of malignancies are observed.
We report on a 64-year-old female patient who had extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the trunk as well as on the right leg along the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histological picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
Treatment with acitretin resulted in a marked decrease in lesions.
Lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses-especially "adult blaschkitis, " first described in 1990- are discussed.
Preservation of potency and urinary incontinence after rectal resection has increased after nerve-sparing dissection and complete excision of the mesorectum have become common.
Nevertheless, postoperative rates of potency disorders and urinary incontinence between 25 and 67% can be found in the literature.
Material and methods:
The autonomic nerve fibers of the pelvis were visualized on 10 cadavers and 2 formalin-fixed, isolated pelvic specimens.
Their positional relationship and possible sites of damage were visualized and photodocumented during surgical mobilization of the rectum and photodocumented.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically well-defined structures with little inter-individual variability.
The P. The inferior mesenteric nerve forms a dense network of fibers around the trunk of the A. inferior mesenteric ( AMI) on a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral rectal wall and P. The pelvis is only 2-3 mm 2 - 3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by Denonvillier's fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated using the standard surgical approach.
1 The nomenclature of the fascia and the course of the autonomic nerves in the lesser pelvis have not been clearly clarified in the literature.
2 A high discontinuation of the AMI inevitably leads to damage to sympathetic nerve fibers.
3 The close positional relationship between the rectum and autonomic nerve fibers makes sharp dissection under direct vision inevitable.
4 isn’ t that amazing! Fascia and nerves can be used as guide structures in the preparation.
5 The selective protection of parasympathetic roots in the lesser pelvis is not feasible via the standard surgical approach via the standard surgical approach.
Early detection of secondary carcinomas in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is important for the prognosis and groundbreaking for therapy planning.
In a prospective study from 1993 to 1998, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, the oropharynx and the lip underwent panendoscopy as part of the staging in order to check whether this method can be used for the early diagnosis of simultaneous second carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.
Panendoscopy was initiated with rigid tracheobronchoscopy, followed by rigid esophagoscopy followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
This was followed by endoscopic examination of the naso-, oropharynx and hypopharynx.
This was followed by microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological swabs were taken from suspicious areas.
The proportion of simultaneous second carcinomas was 8.4%, including 8.4% of simultaneous second carcinomas.
Precancerous lesions could also be diagnosed with the help of panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies ( 1988-1994) from the Clinic and Polyclinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Regensburg Tumor Center ( 1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of secondary carcinomas in a primarius in the "head and neck area" .
Due to the good experience so far and the uncomplicated course, this examination obviously does not pose any additional risk to the patients, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for staging tumors in the head and neck area without restriction.
The diagnosis of Huntington’ s disease can cause considerable problems due to the high variability of the clinical picture, especially at the beginning of the disease, due to the high variability of the clinical picture.
We present a 21-year-old patient with confirmed Huntington's disease, in which psychopathological changes were the main symptoms for over 7 years and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
The very early onset of the disease and the significant advance of the onset of the disease compared to other affected family members were unusual and thus largely responsible for the misdiagnosis.
However, the phenomenon of early onset of the disease is well documented in the literature in the case of transmission of the mutant gene from the father.
Differential diagnosis was groundbreaking in the attention to the initially subtle abnormalities of the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed survey of the family history again.
Dermatological inpatient rehabilitation can take place with different emphasis:
as climatic therapy, as( balneo-) phototherapy or in a psychosomatic setting.
Since certain patient groups benefit differently from this, indications for psychosomatic treatment are worked out:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological disease and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such therapy is indicated for dermatoses of psychological genesis or with psychological involvement, if depression, functional complaints, previous emotional stress or psychotherapy motivation are present.
If there are problems in coping with the disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant neoplasms of the skin, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
In the following, the importance of orthopedic aids such as bandages and orthoses for functional disorders in the area of the lateral ligament apparatus of the ankle joint will be presented.
Subsequently, the mechanisms of action of orthoses described in the literature with regard to joint stabilization, injury prevention and the influence on athletic performance as well as proprioceptive abilities are explained.
The present work deals with long-term changes in cemented polyethylene cups of the Müller type.
Cold flow and abrasion lead to changes in the shape of the polyethylene to varying degrees.
The amount of abrasion can be detected by the displacement of the femoral head in the socket.
Within the first years postoperatively, there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
After about 5 years, it levels off at around 0.1 mm( ceramic head) and 0.2 mm( metal head) .
Values for head displacement exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavorable with regard to loosening of the prosthesis, which is unfavorable with regard to loosening of the prosthesis.
In this study, in a total of 369 hip prostheses, the center of the femoral head was determined in relation to the marking wire of the socket and the head displacement was calculated.
After an average running time of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads( n= 109) had an abrasion rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
For the metal heads used ( Protasul-2 and Protasul-10), this value was achieved only in 71% ( n=260) ( running time 61.5 months) .
The polyethylene-ceramic sliding pairing reduces abrasion by half compared to the polyethylene-metal pairing.
In younger patients, the use of a ceramic head should be preferred.
If there is an indication to carry out electroconvulsive therapy( ECT) in patients who are incapable of giving consent, the approval of the caregiver to carry out the treatment is required.
With reference to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, the Hamburg Regional Court assumed that there was a justified risk of long-term damage to health and affirmed the requirement for approval.
However, electroconvulsive therapy, subject to the observance of contraindications, is a safe and effective therapeutic measure for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychosis.
The use of unilateral short-pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive side effects.
In particular, retrograde amnesia occurs only very rarely and to a degree that is negligible in view of the dangers posed by the underlying disease.
In the opinion of the authors, there is no need for approval by the guardianship court within the framework of the Care Act.
Malignant hyperthermia ( MH) occurs in genetically predisposed individuals with autosomal dominant inheritance u. a triggered by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine.
Due to its high sensitivity( 97-99%) and specificity( 93.6%) as well as the genetic variability of the disease, the in vitro contracture test( IVKT) according to the protocol of the European MH group represents the" gold standard" of phenotypic diagnostics for MH predisposition.
On the other hand, there is a high coupling between mutations in the ryanodine receptor gene ( RYR1) and the MH disposition.
After the C1840T mutation ( Arg614Cys) on the RYR1 gene could be detected in one individual of an extended family, the presence of this mutation in the other family members and the correspondence with the IVKT was of interest.
Ultrasound diagnosis of malignant lymphomas in childhood is described.
Lymphatic system diseases of the child are relatively uniform sonographically:
initially, lymph node and organ enlargements are found, as well as disturbance of the normal echotexture, usually in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
On the parenchymal organs, essentially 4 infiltration patterns are observed sonographically:
diffuse, small nodular, large nodular and the "bulcky type"
Successful in ultrasound is due to normalization of lymph node and organ size, return of normal organ echogenicity and regression of tumor or tumor, or regression. Inflammation-related complications are recognizable.
Differential diagnostic clues result from the topographic distribution pattern and the sonographic appearance of the lesions, as well as, with some reservation, from the echogenicity and the blood flow conditions that can be analyzed by Doppler sonography.
The primary diagnosis must always be confirmed histologically.
Background and questions.
In the case of the transient acantholytic dermatosis described for the first time by Grover in 1970, clinically mostly itchy, odematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papulovesicles are found predominantly on the trunk, which heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
Histologically typical is acantholysis.
With an etiology that is still unclear today, light, sweating and heat are discussed as provocation factors.
