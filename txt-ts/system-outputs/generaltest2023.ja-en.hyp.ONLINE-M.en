Located in the mountainous area, Park Tong farm in Kuchung-gun, Kuchung-gun, Kuchung-gun, is mostly steep and has poor soil.
Farms like this had an unusually high harvest last year.
Kiyotsu Central Zoo Feed Safety and Fisheries Business Unit has achieved great success.
The plant was established in 2011 with the mission of sending fish products for animal feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
While exceeding the catch plan, in recent years it has supported farms in Kiyotsu City such as the procurement of farm produce.
However, this time the office supported the farm not in Kiyotsu City, but in Keijo County, adjacent to the city.
In addition, we decided to help the "division" of Park Chung Farm, which is considered to be the most severe conditions in the county.

FUJI to Prevent Abandoned Accidents: System Development Experiments with Own Vehicles _ Chubu Keisei Shimbun Economic Information of Aichi, Gifu, Mie, and Shizuoka
Fuji (headquartered in Chitachi City), which manufactures and sells electronic component assembly robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent "leaving children" in cars, such as being left behind.
A human sensory sensor is installed in the car, and when it detects the movement of a person, it sends a notification to the phone or chat.
Currently, they are conducting demonstration experiments with their own transportation vehicles.
Protect the safety of children during painful accidents caused by abandonment.
Currently, we are conducting demonstration experiments with two pick-up vehicles of the English conversation after-school “teracoya THANK” for children run by our company in Chitachi City.
Sensory sensors that detect people’s movement from the temperature difference between people and their surroundings are installed on three ceilings in the car.
When the engine of the vehicle is turned off and the door is closed, it detects the movement of a person after a certain period of time, and automatically sends a warning notification.
By linking the status of the engine and the door with information, it prevents false detection as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling a pre-registered number, displaying it in the chat on your PC or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, so that mistakes such as misses do not occur.
Demonstration experiments will continue until the end of February.
Ichiko Kamiya, Head of Division 2 of the Innovation Promotion Division, pointed out that “during the experiment, peripheral issues other than the system have also been seen.”
For example, he was able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"If you want to expand the solution"
The development of the anti-abandonment system was triggered by the accident of a shuttle bus across the country.
Employees with young children suggested that something could be done to protect the children's safety.
We decided to use the know-how developed through FA (Factory Automation) related business, such as IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors.
FUJI’s anti-leaving system is easy to sell.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily attached to the transport vehicle, we aim to lower the hurdle of introduction and promote it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization while also looking at cooperation with nurseries and kindergartens.
[Original] The start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shinkansen, which was initially planned for fiscal 2023, has begun to affect urban development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture.
In Kobama City, where the new station is to be installed, the detailed location of the station is still not indicated, and urban planning including the development of the surrounding area is under way.
Formulating a plan is considered to take a long time and requires an early announcement.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station planned for Kobama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 19 the Railway Construction and Transport Facility Maintenance Support Organization indicated that the approximate location of the station was a radius of about 2–5 kilometers centred around JR Higashi-Kohama Station.
The exact location of the station and the route was planned for the winter of 22.
In Kobama City, the Shinkansen-related business was completed in FY21 with the opening of Tsuruga and the subsequent opening of Kobama.
In the initial budget of FY22, the number of projects was further increased, and the location of the new station was announced.
However, the exact location of the new station is still unknown.
The city is considering land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station, and formulating a basic plan with 3 million yen in its budget this year, but it is expected that it will not be implemented.
The urban plan centered on the new station "takes time to form a consensus among citizens" (city officials).
There are examples of new suburban stations in the prefecture that are not attached to existing JR stations in Echizen, but it may take considerable time to put together the overall concept.
It is feared that the slower the announcement, the shorter the preparation period for opening will be, and the impact on surrounding maintenance will be felt.
In front of the new station, there is a sense of opacity in the extension west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, citizens’ organizations in Kyoto submitted their signatures to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport requesting the withdrawal of the blank paper of the extension plan.
In the Ishikawa Prefecture political community, the call for a rethink of the Yonewara route has been raised, and there has been a succession of moves to return the route that has been settled to the remittance, so that the neighboring prefectures are never in a situation that can be described as a single rock.
The attitude of Kobama citizens to the start of construction is relatively calm, but the location of the new station is unknown, and the opening time remains unclear, there are concerns that it will affect future opportunities.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki’s policy is to continue to urge the country to open the entire line early, but the voice of the region along the line will be essential to start construction as soon as possible.
The indifference of "Someday the Shinkansen will pass (to the west of Tsuruga)" does not allow the country and neighboring prefectures to move.
I want you to keep raising your voice.

Cat-type feeding robot introduced at "Issalt Aged Genghis Cannonta Fukui Ekimae Store".
Lovely expression is popular with family customers=Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which suffers from a shortage of manpower, there is a widespread movement to introduce serving robots that carry food to the seats.
In addition to saving manpower in store operation and helping "non-contact" customers to prevent new coronavirus infection, the adorable expression of the robot is popular with family customers.
According to restaurant managers and stakeholders, "It is difficult for local restaurants to secure employees and part-time jobs, and food service robots will become more popular."
"Gin, gin, gingiscan ♪".
While playing light music, a robot displaying a cat’s face on the screen runs smoothly through the store.
When you arrive at the table of the guest seat, you can tell the customer, "I have brought the dish you ordered."
Fukui Station Mae Store, a major 2-chome in Fukui City, introduced a cat-type feeding robot in August 2022.
When the robot is waiting near the kitchen, press the table number on the screen and drive autonomously to the table and deliver it.
AI (Artificial Intelligence) voice function is built in, and it reacts when customers touch it, and the expression of the cat's face reflected on the screen is rich.
The "Bonta Group", which manages the store, has introduced a serving robot in two stores, including the store.
President Toshiyuki Saito said the reason for the introduction was "the biggest shortage of manpower", emphasizing that it is part of the increase in productivity through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The proportion of labor costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but it can be reduced to 21-22% with the introduction.
Robots also have the role of collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, leading to efficiency of post-cleaning, adding that "family members and children are happy and have a promotional effect".
The "Rukuma Hoshishama Fukui Store" of grilled meat and hormone pot in Araki Shinbo-cho, Fukui City, also introduced a serving robot in August 22.
Nagafu Hoshishama, the president of Sonsun Shoten, said: “I don’t want to recruit employees or part-time jobs. I thought it was absolutely necessary to eliminate the shortage of personnel.”
The Fukui store operates by separating the zone where employees serve meals and the robot delivery range.
The cost of renting a robot is equivalent to the salary of a part-time worker.
In order to save manpower, the store has adopted an ordering system by tablet terminals in addition to robots, and self-freedom is also being considered.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the effective hiring multiplier by job category in December 22 was 6.94 times "customer service" such as restaurants, which is a job with a high staff shortage.
A representative of Net System (Takagi-chuo 2-chome, Fukui-shi), which is responsible for distributing food robots, says, "The shortage of personnel in restaurants in the prefecture has become serious due to the impact of the corona disaster, and there are many inquiries about the introduction of robots."
President Hishuyama said, "It will become even more difficult to secure employees in the future in the suburbs, and I think that serving robots will become more popular."
[Original]Echizen Town makes an ending note and distributes it to the townspeople who want it.
When the "Okuyami Handbook" was published last year, covering the necessary procedures and writing the list of inheritance and family tree charts, etc. when he died, it is said that many people came to receive it for their own use.
In various parts of the prefecture, courses on how to write ending notes and how to organize life have been held many times, and it seems that "end of life" is firmly established by prefectural residents.
Ending note of Echizen Town is 35 pages.
Chapter 5 begins with a review of your own history, describing your current state of health and assets, future care, hopes for end-of-life medical care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section on what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message to your loved ones.
It's hard to write 35 pages, but you don't have to fill all the pages.
What do you most want to leave behind for the people around you and your family?
The main thing is to make the purpose clear.
In bookstores, a variety of notebooks are marketed according to the purpose, and you can start writing freely from where you can write.
It is said that the word "end of life" was born in 2009.
Eleven years later, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
The reality of "death comes suddenly" has come to many people, and more people are said to be preparing for their own end or end.
More than 10 years since then.
The new corona disaster that struck the world has not yet taken place.
Prices have risen as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and electricity prices have skyrocketed this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match current prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, funeral expenses, nursing care expenses, grave management, etc., which could be shared by the parents and relatives, but now it is not uncommon to have a single child.
In addition, life expectancy is much longer than before, but the risk of dementia and nursing care increases as we get older.
I would like to keep in mind that there is also an increase in social anxiety in the background where the end of life is settled without ending transiently.
In any case, everyone wants to avoid overburdening their partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword for ending notes, but it should not be too lonely.
I don’t want to write my hopes and requests secretly, but I want to consult with my family once and calmly prepare for that time.

At graduation ceremony, students and teachers showed the idea that wearing masks is not necessary in principle = February 10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture
At a graduation ceremony on February 10, the Ministry of Education and Science confirmed the policy that masks should not be worn by children.
The principal of a large-scale junior high school says, “It’s actually difficult to take a wide distance between students, and I’m worried about how to respond. Some students feel uneasy about taking off their masks.”
According to reports about wearing masks at graduation ceremonies, this topic is also raised among teachers.
On the other hand, one primary school principal said, "If the country decides, it will be a form that will not be worn. Is it realistic to cope with it except for the choir?"
At this graduation ceremony, there are also movements to recognize the participation of students who had self-deprecated, to resume the alumni choir, and to seek relaxation of countermeasures in some schools in the prefecture.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high is scheduled to be held in early March, and the public junior high school is scheduled to be held in the middle of the same month.
Prefectural school committees and municipal school committees will wait for official notification from the Ministry of Arts and Sciences and decide whether to respond.
There were also cautious voices about the fact that the Ministry of Arts and Humanities has tightened the policy of not requiring the wearing of masks in all school education activities since the new semester this spring.
The principal of the elementary school said, “Suddenly, from one day onwards, the response to the lack of masks will confuse children. After deciding to wear them freely, it is a natural trend that more and more children will be taken off without a mask.”
× × ×
The Ministry of Education and Science decided on 10 February that masks would not be required in school education activities from April onwards, following new government guidelines for wearing masks.
In principle, no mask is required for choir, physical education classes, and group activities.
During fiscal year 2022, we will call for infection control measures in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and we will communicate any precautions after April to the education committee and school site in the future.
Graduation ceremonies such as junior high schools and universities are carried out throughout the 22nd fiscal year, and measures such as ventilation are implemented. Graduates, faculty, and participating students are basically not to wear masks.
Yasuka Nagata cutting students (left) with scissors that asked for pass = Hair atelier Lim Lim in Tsukuma-cho, Echizen-shi, Fukui Prefecture
At the beauty salon hair atelier rim in Tsukuma-cho, Fukui Prefecture, we cut the students using scissors that we prayed for passing the exam every year.
It was well received by the students as "confident" and "calm down and took the exam".
Yasuka Nagata, the representative director of the salon, has been watching students open textbooks while waiting for a cut or reveal their anxiety about taking exams during a cut.
So, in 2014, "If you can help me a little," I started the pass prayer cut.
⇒Last day of national public applications
In the same salon, every year, on the day of the beginning of the work, she receives a prayer for passing scissors and comb at the same city Wakakake Town.
Approximately 80 people are cut each year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are various job tests, driver's license exams, etc.
I present a pencil that I prayed for passing.
⇒Mama Oki "To you who challenge high school entrance exams"
In 21 years, a man who received a cut and passed the active role at the University of Tokyo, 19 said, "I was glad to hear the feeling of support. I used the golden pencil I received to take the exam, and I was excited."
The book "Dear Prime Minister" from Higashiyukobo" published by the NPO Corporation "Heart-Resounding Literature and Editorial Bureau" at its own expense.
“Dear Prime Minister, “The Wall of Life” From Higashi-jo-bo” I published the 10th book with this title.
It has been picked up by various newspapers all over the country, and many readers have been sending comments.
The purpose of this book is to share with you the "social and structural" environmental issues about the causes of suicide in Japan and the "social and structural" environmental issues that we have heard directly from suicide planners, and to create a "comfortable society".
For 18 years and 10 months, we have been patrolling the rocky area of Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a suicidal hotspot, to prevent suicide, and continue our support activities until the suicide attempt is found and protected and set off again.
This book summarizes the issues we have heard from 784 people (currently 2/6) who have been protected to date, and addresses the following seven points to the Prime Minister regarding the state measures needed to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life saving" activities.
(2) "Human Rights Violations" are accumulating behind the suicide.
(3) Suicide is a victim of social and structural organized crime.
(4) The administrative body treats nationals living outside its jurisdiction as "insiders" and coldly treats them.
(5) Medication of mentally handicapped persons such as depression, and suicide is treated as "accident".
(6) The "duty of safety considerations" in high-risk areas of suicide has been forgotten and driven to commercialism.
(7) The part that cannot be scientifically proven in the doctrines of emerging religious groups is deception, and the act of threatening one's opponent and offering money is extortion.
Religious organizations that commit this crime of "fraud and extortion" should be made public and excluded.
Therefore, the impressions sent by subscribers of this book, such as "I was impressed by the strong mentality of those who are working on this activity", "This ex-police officer's figure is one of the police officers", "He is a living bodhisattu who supports himself in the same way as others", etc. Here are some impressions sent to us.
I looked at the photo in the newspaper article and said, "What do you think..."
Now, I hear that suicides are on the increase in people caught up in the Corona disaster.
It's really sad.
Everyone is like him.
I want it to be a society where you can live your life happily.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude to all of the staff who are devoted to those who are so bitter that they want to die.
I think this activity is an activity that abuses both mind and body, but please continue to plead with me in the future.
Thank you.
Kashiko
I hope that all of you who are readers will become the gatekeepers of life in the region.

Kenji Shimada who shoots capybara every week and posts photos on SNS = February 1st, indoor facility "Hapijan" in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, Fukui Prefecture
There are men in the city who take pictures every week of Kapibala in the amusement park of Takayama Park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, and send them on Instagram.
The post contains a variety of thumbnail images, such as the moment of grinding teeth from the big mouth, and the appearance of lying down and babbling.
He has more than 10,000 followers both domestically and internationally, helping to make the charms of Happijan and Capibara known to many.
⇒Shizuka Kudo posts traditional vegetables of Fukui Prefecture on Instagram
The male is Kenji Shimada, a company employee who lives in the city.
It began broadcasting on social networking sites (SNS) in March 2021.
Capibara is one of the world's largest rats, and is good at swimming and watering between his fingers.
Since the 18th year of its opening, Hapijang has kept a total of three animals, one male and two female, for close observation and feeding.
Mr. Shimada first met Kapibara five or six years ago.
I was shocked when I saw a video of relaxing in a hot spring and said, "What is this animal?"
It was as if he were drawn to the affectionate expression of a human being.
He later heard that he was being bred in the Hapijan and looked forward to seeing him nearby.
I started taking pictures in earnest about three years ago when I bought a SLR camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of capybara, and it shakes the body with bubbles and cuts the water like a drill does not miss the shutter chance.
The number of posts on Instagram has risen to about 830 and it’s enough to look back and say, “I’ve taken that much.”
Did you remember Mr. Shimada while you were walking, Yamama and you came close and shouted "Cucumber".
"Cute, happy," Shimada's capybara love is deepening.
Through SNS, I enjoy sharing with Capibara fans nationwide every month, such as showing each other the best shots.
Mr. Shimada, who goes to the zoo in the nearby prefecture to see capybara, smiled and said, "I would like to take pictures and transmit them mainly on my home Mt. Footabana in the future."

The fact that residents of Wakayama Prefecture and Kushimoto Town helped the crew and cared for them is presented in films and novels. About 100 years after the accident, Turkish aircraft were sent to rescue the hostages by Iraq on the eve of the Gulf War.
Those who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.

Introduction to the ancestors of plant research The collection of materials from Mt. Saikefeng is also organized by the City General Cultural Property Center [Hanamaki]|Iwanichi Online
The exhibition "People Who Introduced the Flowers of Saikefeng - A Small History of Saikefeng Plant Research", which takes up the ancestors who laid the foundation of the plant research of Saikefeng, known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, is open at the Municipal Cultural Property Center in Daikimachi, Hanamaki City until the 12th.
It collects 124 documents, including valuable specimens collected by ancestors, and introduces the footprints of ancestors involved in the plant research of Mt. Saikefeng.
The plant research of Mt. Saikefeng began with the Russian botanist Karl Johan Maximovich (1827-91) who came to Japan at the end of the year, and Naganosuke Sukawa (1842-1925) who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovich.
Unable to walk freely in the country because of foreigners, Maximovich asked Sukawa to collect them and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sukawa supported Maximovich's research even after his return to Japan, leading to the presentation of "Himekozakura", "Nambutuuchisou" and "Miyamayabukishouma" unique to Mt. Saikefeng.
Later, the modern plant taxonomist Tomaro Makino (1862-1957) published "Nambutranoo", "Kobanotsumeksa" and "Nambuinunazuna" in 1903 (Meiji 36), based on the collection of local researchers, and "Katou Hakobe", which he himself climbed Mount Saikefine and discovered and named "Katou Hakobe" in 2005.
The exhibits show that valuable alpine plants have been revealed by many researchers.
In addition, Matsuyosuke Sugimura (1874-1948) was the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School who accompanied the investigation into the preservation of natural monuments in the year 27 (Showa 2), and Shiro Tamagawa (1914-88) was the academic curator of the Oki-cho Tate Mountain Museum.
“The background of the name of each of the plants of Mt. Saikefeng is the accumulation of many studies and the connection between people. We can trace the connections between researchers spread from the region to the country.”
The exhibition consists of four chapters, one chapter focusing on the faith and history of Saikefeng, and the other chapter highlighting the features of Saikefeng, based on research by Heinrich Edmund Nauman (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundations of Japanese geology.

All members attended, including online.
We exchanged views on setting targets for decarbonization and introducing renewable energy with solar power as the main focus.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set an overall goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at each airport by more than 46% by 30 years (compared to fiscal year 13) to achieve “carbon neutrality” by 2050.
As a result, the council held its first meeting in November last year to plan ahead for six other remote airports in the prefecture.
The second meeting will be closed except for the beginning.
According to President Ando, who responded to the interview after the end, the meeting confirmed the greenhouse gas emissions of the airport.
In order to set targets and introduce renewable energy, discussions were held in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
According to the distribution materials, the CO2 emissions of the airport facilities and vehicles in the 13th fiscal year, which is the benchmark, were 1,476 tons (excluding aircraft).
Of these, 7 facilities, including the airport terminal buildings, accounted for approximately 90% of emissions such as lighting and air conditioning, followed by 84 tons of aviation lights and 71 tons of airport vehicles.
The council will discuss how to reduce emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Chairman Ando said, "Now is the point of passage. The direction of the members is in agreement, and first of all, I would like to thoroughly summarize the draft interim report."

Calling people to the island "Sakama Real Estate" Okinawa branch office opened. People who want to rent a house are recruited|Social and Economic|Nankai Nikhi Shimbun
Opening event to deepen the understanding of "Sakama Real Estate" through talk sessions = 8 days, Shima Town
(Okina Nagarabu General Bureau)Okina Nagarabu branch opening event of the real estate web service "Sakama Real Estate" that seeks lenders visualize the thoughts of people who want to challenge themselves by renting vacant houses and vacant shops, etc., was "entaku", a well-known community space of well-known town.
The operating company explains an overview of the service through a talk session.
The representative director of Tsuginova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), who is in charge of the branch office, said, "If we could do this initiative on Okinawa Ryabu Island, we could create a movement and flow that attracts people throughout the island."
In contrast to normal real estate procedures, Sakasama Real Estate is a mechanism that discloses the information of the person who wants to borrow, contacts the lender, and contracts on their own if an agreement is reached.
As a demonstration experiment to explore potential vacant houses and build relationships through vacant houses, On-Co Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture) started its service in June 2020.
The opening of the branch was the seventh and the first in Kyushu.
For the first time on a remote island in the country.
The event was attended by about 20 people from On-Co and Tsuginova, Wada, officials from well-known towns, and local residents.
Representative Director Ohkubo explained the background of the branch opening, "While the movement to attract people from outside the island is becoming more active, I thought that if I could take advantage of vacant houses and vacant shops, I thought that the town and the island would be more lively from there."
"We want to connect with people who own property on the island and people who want to do something, and we want to help them move forward with that initiative as many as possible," he said.
On-Co's representative of Mt. Mitsubishi pointed out that "it is necessary to take care of each vacant house and discuss what locals want to do in this area, who they want to have come to, and what to choose as a standard."
"The deeper the people-to-people connection, the deeper the information will be gathered," he urged the islanders to participate in the discussion and cooperate in providing information.

I didn’t want to give out much skin on the upper body, but I went around looking for something different from fitness swimsuit.
On the top, the figure behind the knitting and the one-point mark on the hem is fashionable.
I'm happy to wear a bikini or shorts from the bottom or two ways to choose (^.
^) It has just arrived, and it is not in the water just after trying it on, I do not know the durability or what it feels like when it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is solid, and I thought that the price here was affordable.
There was no wire in the bust part, but when I touch it, there seems to be a hard core at the bottom of the pad.
However, even if you wear it, it does not hurt, and I think it looks good even when I moved because it properly follows the bust.
Did you change the model without a pad?
(^.
^)From now on, I was looking forward to getting into the water! Thank you so much!
A little bigger in size 45kg156cmM.
Raincoat is a thick fabric, so it feels steamy and hot, but I think it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is solid.
Two rain protection visors were attached, which prevented my face from getting wet.
The strength was no problem, and I could use it safely even on a bicycle in a storm.
It has never broken after use.
I put it in a compressed bag and put it in a compact condition and carry it.
Really, it was a product more than expected at this price.
I was able to install it safely.
The CLA 180 Shooting Brake was fitted to the 2016 model.
The installation method is also possible for amateurs if you read the YOU tube and instructions.
Note that if the torque screw is loosened too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I fell one and went missing.
After that, when the gray connector is inserted into the brown and red-green wiring, if the tip is done with the pre-cut type, such as radio pliers, does not enter evenly the force, the plastic will be cracked like in the photo and can not be installed.
When you call support, it is a company that is very supportive and sends me a new cable the next day.
When I re-challenged, it worked well when I applied force with wide pliers like in the photo of the manual.
When I put the last main unit back in the car, it was a bit stuck in the storage of the wiring, but somehow I was able to install it.
After installation, DVD, TV, navigation can also be seen while driving without problems.
I think it is a very cost-effective product because it costs more than 80,000 yen if you ask at a dealer, and it costs more than 40,000 yen even in specialty stores.
Price below
Honestly, I don't know why it's so highly rated. First of all, the cotton pad in the middle is polished, but there's a fluffy part in the cushion that's cut off and there's a fluffy part and there's a squishy part in the cushion, which seems to have been used, so I tried to try it out, but if you don't try it out, it might fit or not. I thought the pillow and the pillow separately wouldn't fail. I bought it for 00 yen but I want to return it. First of all, the 5 stars reviews should be more cautious.
It's impossible, it's impossible.
Arrival of goods.
I had it used immediately.
You can milk without problems with the feeling of use.
However, if you feel that the sound is a little annoying, there are times when the reaction of the power button is bad.
I do not care because I can use without problems, but people who care may care.
It is not super quiet 😅If you use it at night, you may use it a little bit.
In addition, I was worried about whether the part connecting the included tube and the machine will enter the tube, but I entered it in the form of pushing 😂 I think it is easy to carry because it is light weight!
You need a trick to foam...
It is not certain whether my hair quality and compatibility is the worst, or whether it is a problem of the performance of this shampoo, but it does not foam at all in normal use.
(The shampoo I have used so far was foaming without problems even if I used it normally) So, here is the solution I found ↓ 1 First, take less shampoo in your hand than usual and let it get used to the whole hair.
(At this point, none of the bubbles will bubble at a level where none of the bubbles will appear) 2 rinse the hair once, then take a moderate amount of shampoo and let it get used to the hair.
(This finally foams normally) Well, in short, it is washed twice lol. Since the capacity of the shampoo itself is quite small, the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo the first time as little as possible... I am satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
It is clear that I bought the best shampoo so far, but obviously there was a feeling that the touch of my hair became better.
However, it is an honest impression that I could not be satisfied with the overall review.
It is a pity that Kuato Robotico series is only taken care of by the face wash goods...
The badness of cospa, which is forced to wash twice despite the small capacity.
In addition, considering the fragrance that seems to be gentle, I will make it two stars here somewhat strictly.
Evaluation is difficult
There are negatives and evaluation is difficult.
The front side of the blade is cleaned with the blade cleaner.
I think it is good to match the razor with good accuracy of the original blade.
Posing: You can remove stains on the blade, such as sebum, soap, etc. as you aim.
(Only the front side) It will last a long time if the cut taste becomes bad with that dirt.
Negative: Extremely shorten the life of the smoother.
Titanium coatings, ceramic coatings, etc. are coated on the tip of the blade, the coating will be easier to peel off.
(If you use shaving two or three times, the coating will almost peel off, so I think it is better to use this cleaner afterwards.
It is important to note that razors written that do not wipe the tip of the blade.
) Because it can be replaced with fall-proof rubber (vibration-proof rubber) that is placed under furniture used as preparation for earthquakes, it feels like how does it cost performance.
※It is up the life of the razor I use 20 ～30% up.
It is difficult to judge when the razor blade is discarded, but I think it is when the blade is damaged by shaving and the blade tip becomes scratchy.
In that sense, I think it is a good product because it can prevent sharp taste down by dirt.
(There is no effect of sharpening with the cleaner. There are times when it feels like it is being sharpened, but it seems to feel like it is taken away by a small rust.)
For TV commercials...
I just painted it once in a TV commercial and saw that the face of a rather elderly woman pulls up, so I bought it.
When I actually tried to use it, the texture is a little harder than normal gel, and I wipe it off with a pre-lotion and then use it.
At first, it feels uncomfortable, but if you apply it while massaging, it will enter your skin unexpectedly.
After entering, there was hardly any sticking, and my skin felt sucked into my hands.
The lift-up was still not like the TV.
I felt the feeling of harry at once.
Since it is ultra-dry skin, this one is still not enough, and I have used a certain Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It feels exactly moist.
I expected that the sagging of the pores would also be covered, but it is not covered.
I think that using one bottle is effective, if there is a lipid.
The work of putting together was hard, but...
It is a labor that summarizes the statements made by politicians in the past few years.
As I read, I am convinced that the statement at that time was "Ah" after all.
However, when considering the value of reading, it is a delicate matter to say whether only “fact check” as the authors call it is necessary.
To be honest, it's not interesting to read.
I tried to think about it, but I felt that the big drawback of this book lies in the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "facts" is ever true or not.
The fragility of "fact check" (even if the possibility of refutation is clouded), I felt that it was rather suspicious from the writing that the people were aware of.
When it comes to this level of awareness of the "facts" of current Japanese journalists, it becomes a bit darker.
It seems that many people are recommended, but it may be suitable for those who want some knowledge about the contents of this book.
If, like the critics, readers are interested in the "fact check" performed by the current Japanese media, I think this book is not suitable.
For those who do not increase the score in the sample test.
In my school, political economy was printed, and I didn’t really get stuck in the class format that I felt like I was studying while I was being taught, so I hated political economy anyway.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
Center this year at the current high 3.
I purchased it in March and chose this as my partner for a one-hour round-trip study.
First impressions are simple words.
You have reached the realm of God.
When I finished one lap and asked about the past, I was an average of 40 at the time, and I was 70.
I was surprised by the flowing stone.
It stretches as long as you eat strange things.
I could see from my skin that not only the knowledge and information about political economy, but also the improvement of my own strength and motivation for studying.
Thank you for really letting me tour.
Crime Prevention
Eight years ago, we tried to pick the door twice, and we took crime prevention measures.
This time it is a replacement from the camera I bought 8 years ago.
Previously, we used infrared irradiation 30m type (other company).
This product was written by someone else, but the distance you can recognize the face at night is about 5m.
I agree too.
It has not been set up as soon as I arrived, but it is the stage where I compared the camera's reflection condition and checked for defects.
The image quality is much higher than the camera of 8 years ago (of course).
It was displayed in four parts on a 32-inch monitor, but if you maximize the shooting size, it is a problem.
At present, the product is also defective.
For those who are considering the level of facial recognition other than crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied especially with night shooting, but if it is at this price, it is the highest level!
I am for crime prevention, but I do not require facial recognition.
Because I don't understand if I'm wearing a cover or mask (especially at night).
Professional vacant nest (thief) has knowledge of security cameras.
It seems to distinguish between high-performance cameras and recording even in small size.
On the contrary, it will be difficult not to be a professional.
However, since the recent vacant nest is bold and clever, we recommend using it with various crime prevention goods instead of just relying on cameras.
For example, it is a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained at home center for about 1,500 yen (the latest is very bright and equipped with 6 units).
Since it is solar, there is no electricity charge, but since it does not turn on until the morning in winter, there are also three 100V human-sensitive LED sensor lights.
With this combination, the distance to recognize the human shadow was 30m.
In addition, if you think that the threat effect will be weakened because the camera is small in daytime crime prevention, I think you need a cover with ingenuity.
I have a sticker that says "24-hour security camera in operation".
It is the original product of the security camera manufacturer I used before.
More than sticking what is sold in the home center, there is an effect on the manufacturer's products.
The place to paste is the intrusion path of thieves that cannot be covered by camera photography.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
At the same time, it was a negative because it is difficult to understand the concept of net settings.
If there are deficiencies after establishment and setting, we will update.
The harder it gets to read and empathize
If she had been born in Japan in 82, she may have had a slightly better social situation than she had, but the situation is still far from equality because of the implementation of the Employment Equality Act.
As I read on, the painful memories of surviving discrimination as a social person came back to me, and I became breathless.
Not only in Korea and Japan, but also in a feudal society, it depicts the suffering of all women who try to live as human beings rather than as women.
Is it time for women alone to stop emotional conflict and stand shoulder to shoulder to face this society?
"Man is the worst" drama I think
The story of the protagonist who was sexually abused by his real father as a child.
Of course, even when they become adults, they still carry on with them.
All the men who come out are the lowest.
The husband of the protagonist who seems warm and family-like, is also the least in a sense.
There are ↓ The protagonist's sister even know that her husband has received DV ignored, the step-sister-in-law finally took the courage to sue her husband to the police, the police officer who is the protagonist's husband will go through, such as the deployment of men can be frustrated.
The mother of the masked protagonist knows the fact that her husband (her real father) was killed by her daughter, but she does not know it (publicly, her real father's death is a drug overdose).
In short, after the death of the rap man, it seems that my daughter did not receive counseling, and it is natural that the main character will go wrong.
If the protagonist's daughter does, would you want to hear about her dead grandfather?
Do you care about Ozi, who died so much at this young age?
In the drama?Too many.
A few years ago, in the summer of the heatwave hit France, many elderly people died, hospitals and facilities, many French people said, "I can not take it because I am on vacation" even if they contact their daughter and son, and it was reported that the Paris morgue was full.
These people are "dry."
I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, and I felt that it was "dry".
The French is completely different from the United States and so on, there are many things that give a good aftermath, but this is the scene that it is better to cut, relatively many I watched while sending quickly.
Professional Boundaries
If meticulous calculations and unintelligible unexpected incidents were involved in someone's life, they would have realized that even if they were calculating to some extent from the beginning, they were worth betting on themselves.
The script that embodies such a subtle, shaky drama, which embodies the drama that she does not show in public, and how far she deceives others to pass her own beliefs, was wonderful.
On top of that... Jessica's acting is really great.
No matter what you see, there is no danger.
It's a professional job.
The feeling of use and then it malfunctioned.
I've used three units so far, but this product broke in no time either in a good or a bad sense.
The reason for choosing this product was to use the first 2200 mA built-in vepolizer, but the battery ran out after 200 degrees 5 minutes 3 sessions.
The second USB terminal is defective.
Unable to charge.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but when I reset the battery about 15 times (I used the battery with the charger so that the USB terminal did not break) the contact became bad or the power supply became difficult to turn on.
When you press the lid, the power comes on.
I think there are some who have experience if you are an Icos user.
That's the symptom.
However, the battery does not use batteries other than the attached ones.
Nails and catch parts seem to be cut out, so there seems to be no bending.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought the Sterly logo at the same time as the return, but here is the comparison.
Appearance size, same.
The chamber and the draw are the same.
Liquid crystal This one is more beautiful.
Maybe newer than without logo.
Vibe, this is restraint.
Like a smartphone vibe.
Without the logo, the vibrations of the vibrations or the sounds are different.
Cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese...
Attachments are slightly different.
This is a liquid case.
Without logo, mass like steel wool.
That's how it feels.
I think it was better to Starry, but soon broke, credibility will be lost.
I wanted to exchange, but I could only choose a return product, so it was troublesome, but I proceeded with the procedure.
Ear rubber, but ear rubber
This flat rubber really does not hurt.
It is the best in the mask of the same family used so far in terms of good hearing.
Even flat rubber, if it is twisted, the part of the twisted helix rubs against the root of the ear, it may be more painful than round rubber, but I think that this product is not only soft to the touch, but also the length is just difficult to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good. Not only does it fit, but there is a reasonable space between the nose wire and the bottom of the hook = in front of the mouth, it is difficult to feel shortness of breath.
It may be because it fits the size of your face.
I do not know if it will fit everyone the same, but if you think it is a small size, it is good to try it once.
When you open the outer box, it is in the vinyl of the central slit like box tissue, but when you take out the first one, the ear rubber on both sides gets caught and it is difficult to take out, so it is reduced by one star only.
The response of the trader is star 1
The price and taste are not regrettable, but despite the date specified, I had a distrust in the response of the supplier who disregarded and sent.
I bought drinks in addition to this product.
Because I always buy on amazon, I also know the delivery staff face to face.
In order to carry especially heavy things up to the top, I took care to fix the arrival date as much as possible, but it is a mess.
It is difficult for the shipping company because of amazon, but I think that if there is one thing that we can cooperate on the user side.
I am disappointed with the response of arrogant businessmen.
But the price is cheap.
If you are considering purchasing, including the cost of disposal
I think it can not be used for a long time because there are many dissatisfaction.
I think it is better to consider including the cost of disposal.
As a reference, it seems that there are municipalities with centers that accept large garbage for free or inexpensive if you bring in.
[Sitting comfort] Because the seat is tilted slightly to the left and it glows even more, I feel very tired sitting.
If you move even a little, there will be a squeak and a loud noise.
It is noisy at night and cannot be used.
This point is the biggest problem, and I feel that I can not continue to use this.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions are only a rough description.
There is a lack of information needed for assembly, and there are many misprints.
・There is no explanation for the orientation of the seat and the support base. Some people have written that it is leaning forward in the review, but it is possible that the orientation when installing the seat and the support base is opposite.
When installed correctly, the height adjustment lever is on the right hand side and the dial for adjusting the direction of the spring on the back is in front.
However, because the height adjustment lever is more natural, many people will install it by mistake.
There are no such basic precautions in the manual, and you have to assemble it while looking at the mixed picture while doing trial and error.
There is an error in the description of the contents. The list of contents at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
It seems that many buyers will look for 8x20mm screws that come with 12 pieces without finding them.
8x20mm screws are already inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to look for waste.
The machining accuracy is low, and there seems to be a combination that can be inserted with the same screw hole and screw and a combination that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, it is very difficult to simply insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with the screw inserted in this way.
No spare screws were found in the manual.
[Other] The black part of the surface of vinyl leather is discolored, and it turns white in some places, so it is better not to expect beautiful things like product photos.
A description of the defects in the instructions and additional explanation of the above installation method, etc., was received by the email address registered with amazon on 2-3 days from the arrival of the product.
Originally, such items should be released immediately after shipment of the goods.
Since many buyers have completed the assembly in 2-3 days from the arrival of the product, it is completely meaningless act.
Uh, uh,
I am a big fan of Thermos and have been using Thermos straw type for more than 15 years, but this model is definitely the most difficult to use.。
1The drinking part of the straw has become harder material than ever, and the groove has become as if it is hammered into the main body, and the drinking part of the straw can no longer be removed from the main body!
! Trying to take it or break your nails.。
Only the tip of the straw's mouth is thinner than ever, and the straw brush is no longer in it.
3The mysterious part of the valve attached to the end of the straw is thicker than the straw brush and dramatically difficult to wash.
Since I have used straw type so far and I have not one complaint, it is a bit of a shock.
It’s really stressful that you can’t take your mouth out of the body.
The good thing is the outstanding cooling power that remains unchanged.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and wash it the next day, about 50% of the ice that was put in the previous day is still left.
Since I do not drink hot, I will continue to be a straw type.
Thank you for improving the next model.
First Review (with additional photos)
I will review it for the first time.
(I bought a doll for the first time and wear a doll eye for the first time is an impression below amateurs who have little knowledge of wearing a doll eye) The product as pictured arrived.
I am very satisfied with the place where I installed the Obits Doll, it is very cute and light.
However, when installing (opening) it can not be installed if the force is applied a little hard and pressed.
I think the way to do it is different, but I put tweezers into the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About Shipment Since it was the first time I had shipped from abroad, I had estimated that it would take three weeks, but it arrived 8 days earlier than I thought (Narita Airport is close).
However, I was worried because the sending email was not sent once.
When you see the description of Amazon shipping earlier, it is still marked as shipping.
There was no damage and no air in the eyes, and there was a small sealed bag with a lot of tiny bits on the back of the envelope, so I think it is safe.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is it okay to have personal information if it is an e-mail from abroad?
Because I felt doubt, I will make it negative 1.
I think that the product is very affordable at that price without any problem.
Reminder Doll Eye 8mm Model iPhonese
A little small (the working area is narrow), very static
I ordered the size notation after seeing it, but it felt about twice smaller than I had imagined.
It is larger than A4 size, but because the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, the range that can be used in work is narrower than A4.
I was going to use it when repairing electronic devices and creating gunplugs, but it is easy to use if there is no B4 size.
It can be used only for soldering work, and other tasks such as assembly and disassembly, if you use a different tray and use a mat, it may be something.
Within the magazine size area, it is impossible to place the tools, place the parts, and do further work...
I also thought about ordering another one of the same things and making it double the area, but the static is too severe during the work, and all the parts that have been cut will be sucked up, so I think it is tough to continue using it for a while.
Fatal Defective Items
Although the lid of the battery box was not opened and the lid was finally opened using a rubber non-slip sheet, it will not close if you try to load and close the battery.
Out at this point.
Highly rated!
Does the cover of the battery box close?？？？
If added, instead of the protective seal of the product, a small saran wrap was affixed.
This may be used.？？？
Speaking of explanations, only English text written surprisingly on a small piece of paper.
Without explanations of the diagrams, I do not understand the operation method.
Maybe it could be another finger...
I found a good product!
I thought I bought it immediately.
Because I used it for pinkie rings, it would not be perfect if I didn't use a lot of them, and it would be a little bit tricky.
But I think it's good to use it on other fingers.
But I think he's a good idea merchant.
At the price
After all, you should not ask for quality in your products.
One flower mark was crushed.
The feeling I tried to attach is also exactly the size.
People with thick eardrums may be severe.
It might have been better if I had bought it without a pattern.
Yabana
The design is good, but it's big if you put it on your feet.
In the harsh winter season of the road east...
As there are other reviews, the electric heat wire is only 110×80, and the arrangement is vertical and not horizontal.
I sincerely wanted to warm the whole futon and purchased that it is expensive than the laying type but it has never exceeded it, but I can not check it in the store like a famous manufacturer.
You can only use it in combination with hot water and 〇tri N-worm.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
I can do it well.
Small and air volume is sufficient.
Batteries can also be replaced with spare ones.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it is good if you like the picture.
If it is on the table of Tsurutsu, it will blow off with its own wind turbine, but if you put on a handkerchief, no problem.
The sound is not noticeable even "in" if you use it outside / familyless, but it is not loud even "small" if you use it in an office.
It is necessary to give a break when going out to the end.
In addition, even if the office user is small, the air volume is too much and too cold.
It is perfect for the scene where you sweat a lot and run away to the family without "big" and cool down at once.
The only thing is, when you put it in a bag, you rarely get stuck while you don't know when the power button is pressed.
I hope there is an ingenuity such as letting the button retract slightly (make it sink) or pressing the weak eye for a long time.
It is an essential item in a time of severe heat that is life-threatening, so it helps us to make better things.
Multifunction Light Speaker
It is the weakest color of the warmest color system, put it in the bedroom and use it.
Better than I thought!
It was good to buy.
As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color by touch.
The white color suits any room, and the color light changes with gradation, so it is beautiful.
In addition, one touch at the place of your favorite color will stop with your favorite color, so you can light up according to your mood!
Because it is LED type, long life can be expected.
In terms of sound quality, I think it is too satisfactory for my ear as an amateur.
In addition, the great thing about this light is that it is multifunctional anyway.
・The upper part is equipped with a large speaker.
Bluetooth pairing with mobile phones, etc., so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
・If paired with a mobile phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
・Because it also supports MicroSD, it can also work with a PC and play music as an mp3 player.
Punching and Piano Practice
At the age of 66, he started to challenge DTM to prevent blur.
Purchase the audio interface and the main unit.
At first, I was punching, but I became obsessed with playing the piano, and I practice every day at dawn.
I downloaded the original sound source, but the protection did not work, I downloaded ASIO at first, but the free piano sound source sounds good, so I use it for piano practice.
I think it was good to buy.
I seem to have been deceived.
Is it a product that has a misalignment?
It becomes a long sentence.
Since the synthetic leather of the office chair (bouncing armrest) made by Dusisha that was used for 4-5 years has deteriorated and become crumbled, we are considering purchasing a chair with a bouncing armrest made of non-synthetic leather.
I searched for a home center and a furniture store, but there was no suitable one.
I have concerns about not being able to check the real thing, but I compromise on the look and price of the design and buy this product on Amazon.
The box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screws.
(Attention)Supplied hexagon wrench and screws are betet with oil.
At first, the hexagon wrench was not aware of the adhesion of oil because the main body was white, so when oil was applied, it was scorched.
Assembled in 40 minutes.
Completed and product confirmation.
The bounce-up armrest is different from left to right, the hardness of raising and lowering is different, the left is heavy, the right is light, and the armrest is not easy to use (no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weakly fixed and quickly drooping along with the "punch" and sound.
The seat is non-regenerative high-density urethane foam feels stiff, and it is not comfortable to sit (weak elasticity?
The backrest mesh is stiff compared to other mesh chairs, and the back hurts when worn thinly.
The height from the seat to the ground was 530 instead of 550 (height of the seat is important for tall height). And the legs supporting the caster are not made of steel, so durability remains in doubt.
Laying a cushion purchased separately, the part of the mesh fabric is likely to deteriorate (scratch) quickly, so we use it with a towel.
186cm80kg I only felt that the fit of my back was good, but otherwise I think the product is less satisfied, I also feel that it is a product that has a certain deviation.
After all, it may be better to look at the actual office chair and buy it.
Since there was an Amazon email from the manufacturer with a purchase greeting, should I inquire about armrest and headrest?
Under consideration.
Well, is it like this?
I bought a Pixel 4K tuner, which was cheap without much expectation, because apparently right-turned BS4K environment is likely to be seen.
As an experiment, NHK BS4K and other right turn free broadcasts are also seen, and at the same time purchased Panasonic's 4K TV can be viewed beautifully.
(Sometimes the images are shaky) An update came immediately after purchase, and since it became compatible with recording, I am watching some pre-recorded recordings, but does the external 2.5 inch HDD also affect, it is a situation where only the images stop playing, or frame skipping occurs.
The user interface has never been praised, but it is said that "4K broadcasts can be seen".
By the way, during the reservation recording, it is said that you can only play back the recording program, and it is accepted as a plus feature that you can record this area in 4K on HDD.
You may be disappointed to buy with various expectations, so excessive expectations are prohibited.
Expect to be improved with the update.
Warmth function is OK
I only use the heat preservation function yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in it, it warmed up in about 2 hours and became hot in 2 and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but I care about the fan sound when I stop idling, but I do not feel it at all while driving.
I was still worried about the smell of chemicals being emitted by the fans, so I had to open the windows regularly and ventilate them.
As another person wrote in the review, the burr of the part that goes through the shoulder strap is bad, so you need to fold the burr with a minus driver, etc.
Really fragile
Today, I suddenly broke in two months after I started using it.
I liked the key feeling and size, but it makes no sense to break it.
I use a PC all day to process video, but the volume is 100%.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
The earbuds are painful and cannot be used, and it is a volume that attracts attention even when using a PC at night.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds, and the volume display appears or disappears repeatedly on the computer screen.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, so you can not use the mouse freely if you do not turn off the keyboard first.
Enter keys and backspace keys have become unresponsive.
I do not recommend it at all, but you can try it if it costs 1,000 yen.
If you are lucky, you will be able to use the half-year term.
Compared to other companies, it has a one-year or three-year warranty even in the same price range, this is 6 months warranty.
The short warranty period tells the story of fragility.
The goods are the best, the packaging is the worst
The product is a favorite because of the color difference.
If you are looking for a food stoker, I would definitely recommend it!！
However, there was a gap in the large corrugated cardboard to roll and roll, and the packing was the worst without the delivery note.
The lid was also removed when I opened the box.
We recommend the product, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about intensity, but not for now.
I bought it where I replaced the lid, because the support was lost.
It plays a role in the sense of the stability of the lid, but because it is a luxurious plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make a nasty sound like "Makimaki, (will break)
You have to choose something that fits the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when buying.
Meatball is cute back
While I was looking for a bag to go out with a dog, I was attracted to a stylish bag of gray color and bought this one.
It was assembled, and it was surprisingly light when I tried to bring it, so I felt that it was not so heavy even if I had it.
The zipper also moves smoothly and there is no such thing as a snag.
It seems comfortable even for a long time traveling.
It is very compact and easy to fold.
Even when folded, you can see the design of the meatball, and it is cute even if you put it.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, take a look at the look and the cheapness of the price!Purchased.
TSA lock has been a favorite here for several years and there are several others, but it is convenient.
And number lock is recommended for celebrities who have forgotten keys or lost keys.
However, to be honest, I put the most important point on lightness is good because it is good. If you want sturdiness and security, the zipper is rough and a week, because it is cloth, pee with a knife!If it is cut, it will break in an instant.
In addition, because the zipper is sweet, I want the ingenuity to overlap.
If you are overseas, it is recommended to bring onboard.
First of all, I used it on a Shinkansen trip, but it was comfortable.
Difficult to choose size...
It is difficult to buy shoes because of the wide range.
Converse and bangs wear 24cm.
MRL996 is also 24cm.
Kitty at first?I thought it would be okay to get used to it.
This time, the ML574 was really cool if my sister said it was 24.5cm thick and had me wear it.
I felt my little finger hit me.
So I bought 25cm.
When you get it and open it, it's big...
When you try wearing socks, it is a little loose.
I was worried about whether to return the product, but it is troublesome if it becomes to 24.5, so I think I will put it inside at 25 and wear it.
I purchased Team Red, but it is very good with a vivid red!
There are many black and white monotone clothing, so it becomes brighter when you wear this!
165cm, 40s male
I ordered the appropriate size L, but if you are similar to the following specifications, we recommend the size M.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Perimeter: 100 cm Typical metabo belly.
<Disposal> In the water, the lush guard will turn up because of the loosening of the waist.
I'm swimming while repairing the twisted part.
Especially when oiling in the jacuzzi, the metabolic abdomen looks round.
In addition, if you walk while vigorously moving up and down, it will still turn up from below.
<Product Making> Because the fabric is sturdy and not too thin, there is no worry about the nipples being transparent.
At this price, I can be satisfied with this production, but I think that the person who bought the small size will fit better.
Gas leaked after all, but...
Silver Colt 25 still had a gas leak, there was a problem that part of the tank was missing when I replaced the valve, but when I closed the tank and repair grease up with [Bass Bond Q], I started to beat in a good mood. If you want to buy this Colt 25, ask someone who can disassemble or can, or if you are not sure to disassemble while taking a digital camera photo, I can not recommend it very much, if you think it can break it may be fun. I bought another black colt25, the trick to disassemble is to remove the left side while pressing the trigger with the thumb of the left hand, somehow the parts did not fly, I could disassemble myself, when assembling I coated the springs and fine parts with silicone grease and fixed with grease, when disassembling, first remove the grip remove the safety screw remove the safety screw remove the two screws on the left side of the body do not hurt the tip of the barrel You can get through the front site and the inner barrel with pliers, then you can slowly remove the left side of the Monaca structure tile, just don't blame people even if you fail on your own responsibility.
188 yen, I thought what quality it was.
It can be used when fast rotation and torque are required.
It is light and small, and the simplicity without fancy is good.
There are no scratches when installing the bit, and I thought it would be an amazing cospa if it was 188 yen.
What's more, durability?
It may not be used often, but I think it is good to put it in the toolbox.
Purchased with "1/4 Inch Hexagon Shank Magnetic Quick Release Driver Rollet Bit Holder 60/100/150 mm" from a familiar seller.
It was quite good for the price without any problem.
The controller stops moving.
It can no longer operate on its own.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes the machine will move in a different direction and become unable to operate.
It is better not to buy this product.
I'm going to warn everyone.
It's a terrible product.
Wired, but we recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It is highly reliable and has been used for a long time and is still not broken.
It can also be used for PC games.
・・・・・ Remarks Since the Amazon gift voucher was refunded as defective goods within one month, I think it was good.
Does this increase your computing power?
I think it is for children who understand calculations.
Isn't it impossible if you're not a child who understands math to some extent?
Problems are hard to solve.
In addition, where I give tools to parents, I let them slide things on the screen with my finger, but I tried to do it myself, but it does not go smoothly even if I do it many times.
The bottom line is that it may be easy for people who are used to DS to make it slide.？
I don't really like cartoon characters illustrations, or DS, etc., I think you can enter from the interestingness of the screen... For some reason I don't have familiarity.
The way to calculate is also a way to race time, for example, how many questions to answer in how many minutes.
I know what it feels like to make you rush with exams, but... don't you feel anxious and calculate?
I don't like the sound of the gong when it's over.
I'm working hard, but can't I make it sound more comfortable?
With this 6,200 yen, I feel like I lost some money.
I can see if the price of this half.
I'm sorry, that's why I got 2 ☆.
I like Persona's song after all!
Persona 3 reaches ED.
5 played until midway.
Persona 4 is already controlled in Vita.
What you can do is not different from Persona 4 in the previous film.
There is no story, I feel shorter than the previous one.
The song is cool after all!
Just listening makes me feel better!
The characters of Persona 3 were HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Somehow Junhei looked like a twink (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the original, so there is no freshness... If you think so, it feels better to be 3.
As a sound game, it felt easier to play 3 than 5.
Persona 3 is the main color, but it was difficult to see when the background was dark.
5. Bright colors such as red and yellow are the main color, so it is easy to see even when dressed with the background.
Since there are many assist functions, I think that even those who are not good at sound games can play.
Sound game experts can turn on the challenge feature and become a game with teeth.
The triple pack contains Santora, but it is a solid set of 4 pieces, so if you like the songs of Persona, I recommend this.
Something a pity
I liked the color of the dial in the photo and bought it, but the real thing is blue, but it is close to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but for now, it's cheap, so why don't you give up?
After the review was posted, I received an e-mail from the seller apologizing and exchanging for a new product.
The subsequent processing was also quick.
I think the response was very good despite the cheap product.
Corresponding to 4 stars and then purchase gold.
I think the color is very beautiful almost as pictured.
But after all, the buckle is not a double lock, the difference from the description photo is obvious.
It's just a pity.
The evening becomes very heavy.
I used it on the SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setting, I didn’t know how to do it after I arrived in Korea and pointed to the SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (Settings > Mobile Communication > Communication Options to turn data roaming ON), and it worked well.
It seems that the statement that was attached to the product did not matter much...?
However, the condition of radio waves around Gimpo Airport was bad, so I was grasping 3G all the time.
When I left the city, it became 4G.
In the evening and at night, sometimes the communication became very heavy, but if you think about it now, it may have reached the maximum limit of several hundred MB per day.
Better than I thought
I used SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, made sim free and used with Ymobile, Z4 got in bad condition and I was looking to buy used Xperia as well, so I found and bought this phone that can use Ossifu mobile phone with a new product.
Since I was using mobile Suica, I was worried whether I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver so I can see the iPhone 6?It's the impression.
Game does not change the processing speed of Z4, so it is an impression that it is a little faster. In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition is slow, but it takes a little time to recognize the impression that it is faster because face recognition is faster, so I use it here.
I thought it was amazing like an iPhone. I also made Android Ver9, and I was able to shop satisfactorily.
What I was concerned about. It can be a little smaller. No strap hole. ※It is compatible with cases with strap hole. I have not tested water resistance. It is a little heavy. I have only used a little, but I am satisfied. I recommend it.
