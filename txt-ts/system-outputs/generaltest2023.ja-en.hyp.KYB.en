Korean Peninsula
Park Chung Farm in Kagami-gun, North Hamgyong Province, is located in the mountainous area, and most of the fields are steep, and the soil is poor.
Such a farm got a high harvest last year, more than ever.
The fish farm at Kiyotsu Central Zoo is highly regarded for its contribution.
The plant was established in 2011 with the mission of sending marine products for feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
In recent years, the company has been supporting farms in Kiyotsu City, including the procurement of farm supplies, while exceeding its catch plan.
However, this time, the plant supported not only the city of Kiyotsu, but also the farm in Kagamijo County adjacent to the city.
Furthermore, he decided to help out with the division of Park Chung Farm, which is said to be the most difficult condition in the county.

FUJI To Prevent Accidents ⁇ Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic Information of Aichi, Gifu, Mie, and Shizuoka
FUJI, which manufactures and sells electronic parts-mounted robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of systems to prevent children from being left behind, such as being left behind in cars.
When a human sensitivity sensor is installed in the car and a person's movement is detected, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment on a transfer vehicle at our own facility.
Protect the safety of children in the midst of painful accidents caused by leaving them behind.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with two transfer vehicles of the English conversation after school teracoya THANK for children operated in-house in Chiryu City.
A human-feeling sensor that detects human movement from the temperature difference between people and the surrounding area is installed in three ceilings in the car.
When the engine of the vehicle is turned off and the door is closed, and the movement of a person is detected after a certain period of time, a warning notification is sent automatically.
By linking information with the engine and door state, you can prevent false positives as much as possible.
Warning notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling the number you registered in advance, it will be displayed on the chat on your PC or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, so that errors such as misses do not occur.
Demonstration experiments will continue until the end of February.
During the experiment, we were able to see other peripheral issues other than systems, said Kazumitsu Kamiya, head of the Innovation Promotion Division.
For example, he was able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
If we want to expand our solutions, we will do our best.
The reason for the development of an anti-replacement system was the accident in which a series of shuttle buses were left behind, one after another throughout the country.
Employees with young children suggested what they could do to protect their children's safety.
The company decided to develop it by utilizing its know-how in IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor-based information management, which it has cultivated through FA (factory automation) related businesses.
FUJI's system to prevent leaving is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Because it can be easily retrofitted to the transfer vehicle, it aims to reduce the hurdles of introduction and spread it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization with the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens.
[Discussion] Construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga-Shin-Osaka Shinkansen, which was scheduled to start in FY2023, was postponed, and the impact on the town development in Fukui Prefecture west of Tsuruga has begun.
In the city of Obama, where the new station is located, there is no detailed location of the station, and urban planning including the development of the surrounding area is still underway.
It is expected that the formulation of the plan will take a long time, and it will be necessary to publish it as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station, which is scheduled to be located in Obama City, will be the only new station to be built west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction and Transportation Facility Development Support Organization (JR) indicated that the station was roughly located within a radius of about 2.5 km, mainly at JR Higashi-Ohama Station.
The detailed location of the station and the determination of the route were aimed at the winter of 2010.
In the city of Obama, Tsuruga opened, and the business related to Shinkansen in anticipation of the opening of Obama in the future became full-scale in fiscal 2009.
Under the initial budget for fiscal 2010, the number of projects is expected to increase further, and the city plans to promote urban development in anticipation of publicizing the location of new stations.
However, the detailed location of the new station has not been shown even now.
The city plans to consider land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station, and plans to formulate a basic plan for the project. The city will have a budget of 3 million yen this year, but it is expected to be unenforceable.
The city plan, centered on the new station, takes time to form consensus among citizens (the person in charge of the city).
There is an example of Echizen City at a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to the existing JR station, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to compile the overall plan.
The slower the announcement, the shorter the preparation period until the opening will be, and there is concern that it will have an impact on the development of the surrounding area.
Before the location of the new station, there is a sense of uncertainty about the extension of the west of Tsuruga.
In October last year, a citizen's organization in Kyoto City, which is located on the extension route, submitted a signature to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism asking for the removal of blank paper on the extension plan.
In the political world of Ishikawa Prefecture, a series of moves have been made, such as receiving a start-up call and asking for a reconsideration of the Yonehara route, to return to the finalized route setting, and neighboring prefectures are never said to be monolithic.
However, the location of the new station is unknown, and there are concerns that if the opening time remains uncertain, the momentum will be affected in the future.
The mayor, Koji Matsuzaki, will continue to make requests to the government for the early opening of the entire line, but it is essential that the voices of the areas along the line call for the start of construction as soon as possible.
If you are indifferent to the fact that the Shinkansen will pass someday (on the west side of Tsuruga), you will not be able to move the national government and neighboring prefectures.
I want to continue to raise my voice.
A chocolate shop for Valentine's Day, which was revived for the first time in three years, will open on February 9 at Seibu Fukui Store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture.
Prior to Valentine's Day on February 14th, chocolate prices rose due to the soaring prices of raw materials and packaging materials.
Retail stores and confectionery shops in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that focus on local colors, luxury, and ingredients.
Seibu Fukui Store (Fukui City) opened a special store on January 25 at the 6th floor of the event hall.
Until the 14th, it sells 450 kinds of products from about 40 brands, including 10 confectionery shops in the prefecture.
Sand products made from local Fukui sake, such as chocolate and cookies, sandwiched between raw chocolate, etc. are said to be popular.
According to the store manager, the over-the-counter price of products has increased by about 10% year-on-year.
For this year's trend, there are many products that are characterized by sticking to ingredients and creating a sense of luxury in the package.Consumers tend to purchase products for themselves and their families and enjoy eating and comparing.
Despite the headwinds of price increases, sales in the high price range were strong.
An average increase of 25 yen per grain due to the effects of the price increase
We are trying to create a sales area where you can enjoy the event itself called Valentine's Day.
Since January 26, the shop has been selling recommended sweets on a daily basis, and it has resumed tasting for the first time in three years.
At the end of last year, Western Confectionery Club (headquartered in Maruoka-cho, Sakai-shi, Ippon Tanaka), which manufactures and sells Western confectioneries, launched a series of original chocolates, KISEKI, which was jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate manufacturer, for the first time in the Valentine's season.
It is characterized by a fruity taste that is particular about cocoa beans and reduces bitterness, and it is sold at 1,000 yen for 3 pieces and 3,000 yen for 9 pieces.
Ryuma Takakura, the company's director and purchasing manager, said, While the culture of chocolate in Giri is gradually fading, there is a demand for a little bit of fun on Valentine's Day, and we will increase the added value of our products and differentiate ourselves.

A 20-year-old employee (Fukui City) who visited Seibu Fukui store on the 9th said, I love chocolate, so I got a job and got money, so I wanted to buy it as a reward for myself.
It's painful to raise the price to chocolate, but once a year I want to give it to my family and to those who usually take care of me, she said.

The ruins of Ushigahara Castle, which is said to have been built in preparation for the battle with Hiraizumi-ji Temple, = Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
The Inuikawa district of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, was once home to a large-scale Ushigahara manor.
Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built on the hillside of Nabetokoyama in the district to prepare for the battle against Hiraizumi-ji Temple, which was in opposition to manors during the Kamakura period.
It appears in the military record Taiheiki.
Although there are no documents related to Ushigahara Castle, the following contents are written in the Echizen Ushigahara Jito Jito Jito Jito in the 11th volume of Taiheiki.
Awakawa Ukyo Ryo Tokiharu, who was an official of the Kamakura Shogunate, was sent to Ono as the head of the scene.
In 1333, the search for the Rokuhara set up in Kyoto to monitor the Imperial Court and control the West was overthrown by the Ashikaga clan, and the Kamakura Shogunate was destroyed by Yoshisada Nitta.
When they heard the news that the search for the Rokuhara had been destroyed, the family members immediately fled, and only about 20 remained.
In the meantime, the monks of Hiraizumi-ji Temple attacked the temple.
Tokiharu, when his wife and two children were brought into the river, was self-harmed.
Ieyasu, Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Nobunaga joined forces to make the castle an impenetrable castle.
In 2014, the dry-side association, which is made by local residents, issued a dry-side history story.
In order to make it easier for elementary school students to understand the pessimistic story of Tokiharu, we introduce it in manga.
Mr. Masao Kitagawa, 75, who was involved in the publication, said, I hope that people in the area will learn about the history that is familiar to them, and that they will pass it on to future generations.
You can learn about the castles in Fukui Prefecture, and enjoy the Fukui Castle Tour

You can go to the ruins of the castle on a mountain trail that has been maintained by a group of people who make good use of the dry side.
About 200 meters from the trailhead.
The road leading to the trail entrance is winter, and the car may not be able to pass due to snow.
A group to make the dry side better
A total of 220 units were joined in the Ono-shi Inui area, which is located in the center of the city.
In the past, we have published Tricetsu on the dry side, which introduces the burial mounds, historical sites and highlights in the district.
Rennyo no Sato Awara, a roadside station under construction in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture, will open on April 22.
In anticipation of the opening of Ashihara Onsen Station on the Hokuriku Shinkansen in the spring of 2024, it is expected to become a new regional development and tourist base in the northern part of the city, with approximately 360,000 users per year.

There is also a rest area and a tourist information center in the facility.
Electric bicycles can be rented, and there is a shower room.
The two parking spaces will accommodate a total of 66 small and large cars, including three for the disabled.
It was revealed at a regular meeting held on February 8, by Mayor Morinotsugu of the city.

We are working on developing a menu that uses a lot of local products, such as egg-kake rice made from Fukuchi chicken and autumn-winter-only dishes made from eel from Kitagata.
Currently, about 60 companies are members of the Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Ship-Shi

In the souvenir corner, works by artists living in the Mori Art Museum created by Kanatsu will be exhibited and sold, as well as sweets, sake, and traditional crafts.
In the Kinki area, Southern Echizensan Kairi ranked first.
The designated manager who manages and operates the station is Masashi Miyatani, the president of the Tsuki Usagi no Sato theme park in Kaga City, Ishikawa Prefecture (Yoshizaki 2-chome, Awara City).

A cat-shaped arrangement robot introduced at Iwashio Genghis Khanata Fukui Ekimae Store.
A lovely expression is well received by family customers = Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from labor shortages, there is a growing movement to introduce a food robot that carries food to the audience.
In addition to saving labor in store operations and providing contactless customer service to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the adorable expression of the robot is said to be well received by family customers.
Restaurants and related parties have said that it is difficult for local restaurants to secure employees and part-time jobs, and the number of robots that serve food will increase.
Jin, Jin, Genghis Khan!
While playing light music, a robot that displays a cat's face on the screen puts on a dish and runs smoothly in the store.
When we arrive at the table, we talk to the customers about the dishes we ordered.
In August 2022, a cat-shaped arrangement robot was introduced at the Iwashio Genghis Khanata Fukui Station Store in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City.
When you press the table number on the screen, the robot will autonomously run to the table and deliver it to you.
AI (artificial intelligence) voice functions are built in, and when customers touch it, it reacts, and the facial expressions of the cat appear on the screen are rich.
The Bonta Group, which operates the same store, has introduced a set-up robot in two stores, including the same store.
President Toshiyuki Saito stressed the reason for the introduction of the system, saying that the labor shortage is the biggest, and that it is part of the improvement of productivity through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but the introduction has reduced to 21 to 22%.
The robot also plays a role in collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, which leads to greater efficiency in cleaning up after meals, as well as the joy of families and children, and the promotion effect.
The Rokuma Hoshiyama Fukui store in Araki Shimpo-cho, Fukui City, also introduced a set-up robot in August 2010.
Mr. Eifuku Hoshiyama, president of Sonsan Shoten, who runs the business, says, I don't think it will be possible to recruit employees or part-time employees, and I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage.
At Fukui store, the robot delivery range is separated from the zone that employees are assigned to.
The lease fee for the robot is about the same as the wage for one part-time worker.
In order to save labor, the store is also considering self-checkout, incorporating a tablet-based ordering system in addition to robots.
According to the Fukui Bureau of Labor, the number of customer service services, such as restaurants, was 6.94 times higher than the ratio of effective job openings by job type in December 2010, and there was a high sense of labor shortage.
The person in charge of the online system (Takagi Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which is responsible for the distribution of the robot, said, The labor shortage of restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and there are many inquiries about the introduction of robots.
President Hoshiyama analyzed that it would be even more difficult to secure employees at suburban stores in rural areas, and I think that the number of robots that serve food will spread.
[Discussion] Echizen Town has made an ending note and distributed it to the townspeople who wish to.
When I published the Okuyami Handbook last year, which covers the procedures necessary for the death of my family, the list of written heritages, and family genealogy, many people came to pick it up for themselves.
In various parts of the prefecture, lectures on how to write end-notes and organize them before their birth are often held, and end-of-life seems to be firmly established in the people of the prefecture.
The ending note of Echizen town is 35 pages.
Starting with a review of your history in chapter 5, you will write about your current state of health, asset status, future nursing care, hope for end-of-life medical care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section where you can follow what you want to do in the rest of your life and messages to your loved ones.
If you have 35 pages, it may be hard to write, but you don't have to fill all the pages.
What do you want to write the most to your family, and to the people around you?
What is important is to clarify the purpose.
In bookstores, various notebooks are available for sale according to the purpose, and it is a good idea to start writing easily from where you can write.
It is said that the term “lifetime” was born in 2009 in a similar way to job hunting.
Two years later, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred in 2011.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that death comes suddenly, and more and more people have prepared for their own end and end of life.
It has been more than 10 years since then.
The COVID-19 pandemic that struck the world has not yet subsided.
Prices rose due to the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, and electricity prices jumped to unexpected prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to meet the current price rises, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, funeral fees, nursing care fees, and the management of graves that were shared by relatives and relatives, but now it is not uncommon for a single child.
In addition, the life expectancy has increased significantly compared to the previous years, but the older the age, the greater the risk of dementia and nursing care.
It should be borne in mind that the reason for the end-of-life period, which has not ended, is that there is also such an increase in social anxiety.
Anyway, everyone is hoping that they don't want to put too much burden on their partners and children.
It seems that the end of the period is my own, but I should not be too alone.
Rather than secretly writing wishes and requests, I would like to consult with my family at least once and be prepared for them in a calm manner.

At the graduation ceremony, students and faculty members expressed their belief that wearing masks is not necessary in principle, according to Toda City, Saitama Prefecture, on February 10.
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) announced that students should not wear masks at the graduation ceremony.
It's actually difficult to keep the distance between students wide, and some of them are worried about how to deal with it, he says.
In response to reports of wearing masks at graduation ceremonies, this topic has also been raised among faculty members.
On the other hand, a primary school principal said, If the government decides to wear it, it will not wear it, and if it excludes choirs, it will be realistic to respond.
At the graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking ways to ease their measures, such as allowing students who were self-restraints to participate and resuming the chorus of graduates.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high school is scheduled to be held in early March, and the public elementary and junior high schools are scheduled to hold a ceremony in mid-March.
The Prefectural Board of Education and the Municipal Board of Education will wait for the official notice from the Ministry of Education to determine the response.
In addition, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has decided not to wear masks in general since the spring semester.
From one day onward, children will be puzzled by the fact that there is no mask, and after deciding that you can wear it freely, the natural flow is that the number of children who take it off will increase.
× × ×
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided not to ask schools to wear masks in accordance with the government's new guidelines for wearing masks.
In principle, there is no mask in chorus, physical education classes, and club activities.
In FY2022, infection control measures will be required according to the current hygiene management manual, and precautions for April and beyond will be disseminated to the educational committee and school sites in the future.
The graduation ceremony for elementary, junior high, and senior high schools and universities is based on measures such as ventilation, and graduates, faculty, staff, and students participating in the ceremony cannot wear masks.

The hair atelier rim of the beauty salon in Echizen-shi, Fukui Prefecture is used to cut the test students using scissors, etc. that they wished to pass the exam every year.
It is said that the students who took the exam said that they had gained confidence, and that they had calmed down and took the exam.
Mr. Yasushi Nagata, CEO of the beauty salon, has seen and listened to students open a textbook while waiting for the cut and exhale their anxiety about taking the exam during the cut.
In 2014, he started to make a prayer cut for passing the exam, saying, I want to use it as much as possible.
The final day of the National Public University Application
Every year, on the first day of work, the beauty salon at Kamiso Shrine in Wakatake-cho, the city, asks scissors and combs to pray for their pass.
Around 80 people receive cuts every year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are also job hunting exams, driver's license exams, and so on.
She presents a pencil that prays for her passing.

In 2009, a man (19) who successfully passed the cut and passed the University of Tokyo's active role, said, I was happy to convey my feelings of support.I used the golden pencil that I received on the exam, and I was excited.
Dear Prime Minister from Tojinbo, The Breakwater of Life
Dear Prime Minister, From Tojinbo, the breakwater of life I have published my 10th book with this title at my own expense.
Each newspaper in Japan has been featured, and many readers have received comments.
The purpose of this book is to share with you the contents of the social and structural environmental problems related to the causes of suicide in Japan directly from the suicide attempter, and to create a life-friendly society.
For 18 years and 10 months, we patrol the waterfront of Tojinbo in Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a famous place for suicide, to prevent suicide, and we continue to support people until they discover, protect, and re-start suicide attempts.
This book summarizes the problems heard from 784 people (as of February 6) who have been protected so far, and appeals to the Prime Minister about the measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are life-saving activities.
(2) There are many human rights violations behind suicide.
(3) Suicides are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat people living outside of their jurisdiction as “others” and treat them as “others.”
(5) Even if people with mental disabilities, such as depression, are drugged and committed suicide, they are treated as accidents.
(6) A safety consideration obligation in a high-risk area of suicide is forgotten, and it is running on commercialism.
(7) The part that cannot be scientifically proven in the doctrine of emerging religious organizations is deceived, and the act of telling the future to threaten the other party and make the offering of money is extortion.
Religious organizations that conduct criminal acts of fraud and extortion should be made public and excluded.
Therefore, we received comments from those who subscribed to this book, such as I was impressed by the strong mentality of those who are engaged in this activity, The figure of the former police officer is the case in the police officer, and It is a living bodhisattva who supports me like my own body even though I am a person who is there.
When I saw a picture of a newspaper article, I cried, What do you think...
Now, I hear that the suicide of those who were cornered by the coronavirus pandemic is increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone is like that person.
I want them to be a society where they can live happily with their own lives.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude to all the staff who have devoted their hearts to those who have suffered so much that they want to die.
I think this activity is an activity that works hard both physically and mentally, but I ask for your continued support.
Thank you very much.

Mr. Kenji Shimada (38), a company employee living in the city, is a male.
In March 2021, the company began sending messages on social media.
Capybara is one of the largest rats in the world.
Since its opening in 2018, Hapijan has been raising a total of three males and two females, allowing them to observe and feed up close.
Shimada-san learned Capybara five or six years ago.
When I watched the video, I was shocked to see what this animal was like.
He was drawn by the charming expression and gestures like a human being.
After that, I heard that they were raised in Hapijan, and I was looking forward to seeing them nearby.
I started taking photographs in earnest about three years ago, when I bought a SLR camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of capybara, and you should not miss the chance of shuttering such as shaking your body and cutting water like a drill.
The number of Instagram posts has risen to about 830, and I think it's a good idea to take this picture.
I wonder if I remembered Shimada while I was going through it, and the male Yamato-kun comes up and shouts Kyurukyuru.
It's cute, and I'm happy, Shimada's love for capybara deepens.
Through social media, they enjoy interacting with capybara fans all over the country, showing their best shots every month.
Shimada said, I would like to continue shooting and transmitting images of Mt.Ashiba at home.

Introduction of Plant Research Pioneers Hayaike Mineyama Collection Materials Special Exhibition [Hanamaki] ⁇ Iwanichi Online Iwate Nisshinsha
The exhibition The People Who Introduced the Flowers of Hayaike Mine: The History of Hayaike Mine Plant Research, which features the predecessors who laid the foundation for plant research in Hayaike Mine, known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, is held until the 12th at the City Cultural Properties Center in Osako-cho, Hanamaki City.
The museum collects 124 valuable specimens collected by its predecessors, and introduces the footprints of his predecessors involved in plant research at Mt. Hayaike Mine.
Plant research on Mt. Hayaike began with Russian plant researcher Karl Johan Maximovich (1827-1991), who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Sugawa Naganosuke (1842-1925), a native of Shiwa Town, who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovich.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to walk freely in Japan because he was a foreigner, asked Sukawa to collect it and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
After returning to Japan, Sukawa supported his research and led to the presentation of the Himekozakura Nambuto Uchiso Miyamabukishoma unique to Hayaike Mineyama.
Later, modern phytocologist Tomitaro Makino (1862-1957) published Nambu Tonoo Nambu Tono Tsumekusa Nambu Tono Tsumekusa based on the collection of local researchers in 1903, and Katou Hakobe which he climbed and discovered in Hayaike Mineyama in 2005 (38 of the same year).
From the exhibition materials, it can be seen that many researchers have revealed valuable alpine plants.
In addition, Mr. Matsunosuke Sugimura (1874-1948), the head of Hanamaki Elementary School, who accompanied the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in 1927, and Mr. Shichiro Tamagawa (1914-1988), who also worked as a curator at the Osako Town Mountain Museum and was involved in the publication of Plants of Hayaike Mine.
Mr. Sohei Yoshida, a curator of the Center, said, The background of each plant's name is that there is a lot of research, and there is a connection between people, and it is possible to trace the connection between researchers from all over the country from the local area.
The exhibition consists of four chapters: Chapter 1 focuses on the faith and history of Hayaike Mine, and Chapter 2 focuses on the features of Hayaike Mine based on research by Heinrich Edmund Nowman (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundation of Japanese geology.

Opening event to deepen the understanding of Sakasama Real Estate at talk sessions, etc. = 8th, Chinamachi
[Okinaga Ryobu General Office] On the 8th, the Okinaga Ryobu branch office of the real estate web service Sakama Real Estate was opened at the community space entak of Chinamachi Tomona.
Through the talk session, the management company explained the outline of the service.
Mr. Masahiro Okubo, Representative Director of Tsuginoba (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), who is responsible for the operation of the branch office, said, By doing this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, I hope to attract people to the whole island and create a flow.
Contrary to the usual real estate procedures, real estate is a system in which the information of the person you want to borrow is disclosed, the lender contacts you, and if you reach an agreement, you contract it yourself.
Operated by On-Co Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture), the service began in June 2020 as a demonstration experiment for discovering potential vacant houses and building relationships through vacant houses.
This is the seventh branch in Kyushu.
This is the first time in Japan on remote islands.
Approximately 20 people participated in the event, including staff from On-Co and Tsuginoba, staff from the Japanese government offices and local residents in both towns.
Mr. Okubo explained the background of the opening of the branch office, saying, As the movement to attract people outside the island is becoming more active, I thought that if we could use vacant houses and empty stores, the town would be more energized from there.
He said that we want to connect people who have properties on the island and people who want to do something, and we want to help as many people as possible move forward with this initiative as possible.
Mr. Takefumi Mizutani, the representative of On-Co, pointed out that it is necessary to take care of each vacant house and discuss what local people want to do in the region, who they want to come to, and what criteria to choose.
The deeper the connection between people, the more information gathers, he called on the islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

I didn't know if I would wear it on the day of my age.
I want you to learn about your favorite soba and udon noodles.
Soba is a soba noodles, isn't it?
I also like buckwheat noodles.
Udon is tempura udon.
Because of the poor, shrimp tempura udon is a great treat.
Too nagging
From around 1:30 p.m., it's been a long time.

I heard that there was no effect of ear plugs at all
There is a terrible hell that cannot sleep.
How long will it last??????
Isn't it what is said to be spring lightning and snow down?
It ends right away
I have been to several different dentists, but when I sit on the chair for the treatment, there are teachers and dental hygienists who talk from behind somewhat diagonally.
I don't know if it's better to look back, but I think it's rude to look back all the time.
Do you know?
What are you doing?
Not only dentists, but also barbers and permists will talk to you face-to-face.
Which material is cool for polyester 100 and dry rayon?
Dry rayon is excellent and cool.
Please let me know.

Prepaid cards are not available.
The day is too long, but do you think it's okay?
It is vegetable juice.
It also depends on how you save it.
If you put it in the refrigerator, you can drink it even after a couple of days, but if you leave it outside or leave it at room temperature, I think it is better to dispose of it.
Later, if you have something different in your body, it will be difficult.

Can you enjoy the movie promise, Neverland, even if you don't know before and after the content?
You can enjoy it.
Because it is a simple story.
Is it okay to write, it is a story that escapes from monsters that feed humans.
When I go to work, I think the nurse is in private clothes, but is it okay to wear sandals and barefoot?
Well, it's okay to change all clothes, and if it's not a change that's easy to commute, isn't it?
I am envious of a house where people do not come at all, do you have anything to do with this kind of house?

About Instagram.
I have about 10,000 followers now, but if you see people who don't know this, do you think it's amazing?
Or do you think anything else?
What does it look like?
I think it's amazing.
It is a miracle for ordinary people.
I think I was doing something special.
Problems and setbacks
I didn't have much time to exercise, so I tried to rely on the popular pressurized innerwear.
The body shape is H175m W80kg.
At first, I have a hard time wearing it, but I think it's okay if I get used to it.
I used it for a few days, but now I use other pressurized inners because of the problem.
The problem is, if the arm is not quite slender, the tightening of the sleeves (just two arms) will be too tight and a little bloody, it is itchy.
2, the lower abdomen is loose The use of the lower abdomen has been stopped due to two problems.
When it comes to comfort, it is quite tight, but it is okay to sleep while wearing it.
Discounts for those who match
S was fine even with 158 cm and 50 kg.
However, the skeleton was large, and it didn't fit me.
Since it is not a three-dimensional construction such as the buttocks, it is easy to create a strange gap or fall, and it does not fit.
I felt like I had to pull it up all the time.
I think it would be good if you were a person with a body like a stick.
In terms of thickness, it may be said that it is a thinness that is secure.
It was not like a henna henna or a break, but it was possible to boot in even a tight knee-high boots and it was able to make it refreshing.
It's nice
I didn't want to get too much skin on my upper body, but I was looking for something different from my fitness swimsuit.
At the top, the back of the knitting and the one-point mark on the hem are fashionable.
I'm happy to wear shorts from the bottom, either bikini or from the top, or you can choose it in two ways (^.
I don't know how durable it is and what it looks like if it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is solid, and I thought that it was a good price.
There was no wire in the bust part, but when you touch it, it seems that there is a solid core at the bottom of the putt.
But even if you wear it, it will not hurt, and it will follow the bust properly, so I think it will look good when you move.
Did you change the model from without a putt?
(^.
Thank you very much.
It is a little larger in size of 45 kg 156 cmM.
Since the raincoat is a thick dough, it feels hot and humid, but because the manufacturing method is solid, I think it can be used for a long time.
Two rain-repellent visors were attached to it to prevent the face from getting wet.
There was no problem with strength, and I was able to use it with confidence even on bicycles in the windstorm.
It did not break after use.
I put it in a compressed bag and carry it in a compact state.
Indeed, it was more than expected at this price.
I was able to wear it safely.
CLA 180 It is attached to the shooting break in 2016.
If you read the instruction manual, you can wear it as an amateur.
Note that if you loosen the torque screw too much, the screw will fall inside the car.
I dropped one and went missing.
Also, when you insert the gray connector into the brown and red-green wiring, if the tip is a thin type such as a radio plier, it does not force evenly, and the plastic will crack like in the photo, and you will not be able to wear it.
When I call support, I send a new cable the next day, and it is a company that is very supportive.
At the time of the re-challenge, I was able to put a lot of effort into the wide pliers as shown in the photo in the instruction manual, and it worked well.
When the last main unit was returned to the car, it was a bit difficult to store the wiring, but I managed to put it on.
After installation, you can watch DVD, TV, and navigation while driving without any problems.
If you ask for it at Daller, it will cost you over 80,000 yen, and even at specialized stores, it will cost you over 40,000 yen, so I think it is a product with a very high cost performance.
Less than or equal to
Honestly, I don't know why it's so highly rated First, the inside was poly, but there are fluffy and squashy parts that are cut in the cushion It seems that it has already been used up Or rather than being used up overall, I thought that it was used for trial, but I think that if you don't try to use the product with the head and the hug pillow, it may not fit I think that separate pillows and hug pillows will not fail This time I bought it for 3600 yen in time sale, but I want to return It is because I regret that five reviews of the stars should be more vigilant in the first place
It is impossible or impossible
Arrival of goods.
I was able to use it immediately.
It can be milked properly without any problems with the feeling of use.
However, there are times when the sound feels a little annoying and the reaction of the power button is bad.
I don't care because I can use it without any problems, but those who care may be concerned.
It's not super silent, but if you use it all night, you may be a little worried.
Also, I was worried about whether the part connecting the tube to the machine will enter the tube, but I entered it in the form of a push 😉 I think it is easy to carry because it is lightweight!
I have to do a lot of work.
It is not clear whether it is the worst match with my hair, or whether it is a problem with the performance of this shampoo, but it does not foam at all in normal use.
(The shampoo I've been using until now has been foaming without problems even if it's used normally) And here's the solution I found. ↓ 1 First, I take the shampoo in my hands less than usual, and let it get used to the whole hair.
(At this point, one of the bubbles does not appear at the level of foam.) 2 Rinse the hair once, then take the shampoo to the right hand and blend into the hair.
Well, in short, it's washed twice. The shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo for the first time as much as possible ...
It is clear that I bought such a high-quality shampoo, but I clearly felt that my hair felt better.
However, when I made a general comment, I was not satisfied with it.
It is regrettable that the Quattro Botanico series was taken care of by facial cleansing goods, so ...
Even though the capacity is small, the poorness of the cospa, which is forced to wash twice.
Furthermore, taking into account the smell that looks like a million bruises, I would like to say that this place is a little stricter than two stars.
It is difficult to evaluate
There is a negative, and evaluation is difficult.
The surface of the blade will be cleaned only by the cleaner of the blade.
I think that matching with a razor with a good accuracy of the original blade is good.
Pozi: As you aim, you can remove dirt on the blade such as sebum, soap cast, etc.
(Although it is only on the front side) If it is dirty and the sharpness is bad, it will last for a long time.
Negative: The life of the smoother is extremely reduced.
If you have a titanium coat, ceramic coat, etc. coated on the cutting edge, the coating will be easier to peel off.
(If you use the shave 2-3 times, the coating will almost be peeled off, so I think it is better to use this cleaner after that.)
Please be careful not to wipe the edge of the blade.
It can be replaced with anti-vibration rubber, which is used as a preparation for earthquakes, so I feel that it is cost-effective.
I use it to increase the life of 20-30% razors.
It is difficult to determine when the blade of the razor is thrown away, but I think it is when the blade is damaged by shaving, and the cutting edge is rattled.
In that sense, I think it is a good product because it can prevent cutting down by dirt.
(There is no effect of sharpening with a cleaner.Sometimes it feels like it is sharpened, but it seems that it gets a little rust and it feels like that.)
I've been on TV commercials...
Once I painted it in TV commercials, I saw that the face of an elderly woman was raised quite a bit, and I bought it.
In fact, when I tried to use it, the texture was a little harder than an ordinary gel, and I used it after wiping it with a pre-lotion.
At first, I feel like I'm tired of it, but when I apply it while trying to massage it, it will get into the skin unexpectedly.
After entering, there was almost no stickiness, and it felt like your skin was sucking in your hands.
The lift-up didn't work like a TV.
I felt a sense of tension at once.
Because it is super dry skin, it is not enough for this one, and I used a Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It feels just like it moisturizes.
I was hoping that the relaxation of the pores would also be covered, but it will not be covered.
I think that if you use a bottle, it will be effective, and if it is there, there will be lipi.
It was hard to put it together, but ...
It is a labor work that summarizes the statements of politicians over the past few years.
As I read it, I was somehow convinced that the statement at that time was in the end.
However, if you think about the value of reading, it is subtle whether it is enough to say that it is just a fact check that the authors call it.
To be honest, I have no interest in reading.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the big drawback of this book is in the Method.
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call fact is a fact forever or not.
I felt that it was quite doubtful to write about the fragility of fact checking (which could be called disproveability) whether the original person is aware of it.
If the current perception of the fact of Japanese journalists is at this level, it will be a bit gloomy.
It seems that many people recommend it, but it may be suitable for those who want to know a little about the contents of this book.
If you have a reader who is interested in fact checking by the current Japanese media, like a critic, I think this book will not fit.
To those who do not increase the number of points in the trial.
In my school, the political economy was printed, and I didn't really get caught up in the class style that I was studying while I was doing it, and I hated the political economy.
To be honest, I was saved by this reference book.
Currently, the center this year at 3 high.
After I bought it in March, I chose it as a one-hour study partner on my way home from school.
First impressions are easy to understand, but they are just a few words.
You have reached the realm of God.
After one lap, I asked the past questions. At that time, I was the average of 40.
I was surprised by the drift stone.
It will grow to the extent that you have eaten something strange.
In addition to the knowledge and information related to politics and economics, I was able to feel that what I gained from this reference book is synergizing not only the knowledge and information related to politics and economics, but also the increased motivation for my own strength and study.
Thank you very much for making me meet.
Anti-crime
Eight years ago, I experienced an attempt to pick up the entrance twice, and I have been implementing crime prevention measures.
This time it is a replacement from the camera that I bought 8 years ago.
Previously, 30m type infrared irradiation (other companies) was used.
This product was written by others, but the distance that can be recognized at night is about 5 meters.
I also agree.
I have just arrived and I have not set it up, but it is the stage where I compare and check the brightness of the camera.
The image quality is much higher than the camera eight years ago (of course).
I used a 32-inch monitor to display a 4-part display, but if you maximize the shooting size, it won't be a problem.
For now, there are no problems with the product.
If you are considering the level of face recognition other than crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied with nighttime shooting, but if it is the price, it is the highest!
I am for crime prevention, but I do not require facial recognition.
Because if you have a cover or mask, you will not be able to solve it (especially at night).
Professional free nests (thieves) have knowledge of crime prevention cameras.
Even though it is small, it is said that the high-performance camera and the recording are distinguished.
On the other hand, it is difficult to be a professional.
However, since the recent vacant nests are bold and skillful, we recommend that you use them with various security products instead of relying solely on the camera.
For example, it is a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained for about 1,500 yen at the home center (the latest is very bright and has 6 units).
Since it is a solar power source, it does not require electricity, but it does not light up until the morning in winter, so there are three 100V LED sensor lights attached.
With this combination, we were able to maintain a distance of 30 meters that allowed us to recognize the human figure.
In addition, if you think that the threat effect will be diminished because the camera is small due to the crime prevention during the day, I think that you need a cover with ingenuity.
I have a sticker on the 24-hour security camera working.
It is an original product of a security camera manufacturer that I used before.
Rather than sticking what is sold in the home center, it has an effect on the manufacturer's products.
The place to stick is the path of the thieves that will not be covered by the camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted stickers this time.
At the same time, it was negative because it was difficult to understand the introduction of the net setting.
If there are any flaws after setting up or setting up, we will add them.
The more difficult it is to read, the more empathetic it is.
If you were born in 1982 in Japan, the social situation may be somewhat better than her, but the situation is still far from equal because of the enforcement of the Equal Employment Law for Women.
As I read it, I felt that it was true, and that the painful memories that I had lived through as an adult in discrimination were revived, and I felt distressed.
Not only in Korea and Japan, but also in a feudal society, she portrays the sufferings of all women who try to live as human beings rather than as women.
At the very least, it is time for women alone to stop emotional confrontation and stand on their shoulders to confront this society.
Man is the worst
The story of the main character who was sexually abused by his father when he was a child.
Of course, even if you become an adult, you will continue to drag the wound.
Everyone who comes out is the lowest.
The main character's husband, who is warm and looks like a family member, is, in a sense, the lowest.
It's a story that makes men irritating, such as the fact that the main character's sister-in-law finally comes to the police to sue her husband with courage, but the main character's husband, who is a police officer, slew.
The old mother of the main character, pretending to be bokeh, knows the fact that her husband (the real father of the main character) was killed by her daughter, but her daughter does not know that (publicly, her father's death is an overdose of drugs).
In short, it seems that after the death of the raped yaji, the daughter did not receive counseling, and it is natural that the main character becomes funny.
Do you want to hear about your grandfather who died when the main character's daughter did it?
Do you care about this young man who died so much?
In the drama, there are too many?
A few years ago, a lot of old people died in the summer when the heat wave hit France, and many French people said that even if hospitals and facilities contacted their daughter's son, they could not be pulled out because they were in vacation, and it was reported that the corpse detention center in Paris was full.
These people are dry.
Looking at my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that it was dry after all.
French things are completely different from those in the United States, and there are many things that give a good aftertaste, but I saw relatively many scenes where it would be better to cut them.
Professional Borders
If detailed calculations and unexpected incidents that could not be read were related to someone's life, they would have been prepared to bet on themselves, even if they were calculated to some extent from the beginning.
The script, which embodies such a fine-grained drama, was wonderful to see how much she fights her own conflicts that she cannot show in public, and deceives others to pass through her beliefs.
I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to do it.
No matter what you look at, there is no gap.
It is a professional job.
Feeling of use Then failed.
I've used three of them so far, but this product has broken quickly, both in good and bad terms.
The reason why I chose this product was that I used the built-in Vepolarizer, which was 2200 milliampers, but it was out of battery in three sessions of 200 degrees and 5 minutes.
The second USB terminal is bad.
Charging is not possible.
This time, this product was used to solve the problem so far, but when I re-entered the battery about 15 times (I used the battery with a charger so that the USB terminal did not break), it became difficult to turn on the power supply.
Press the lid to turn on.
If you are an Icos user, you may have experience.
It is a symptom.
Although it is mentioned in the note, the battery does not use a battery other than the attached one.
The part of the nails and catch is like scraping out, so there seems to be no bending.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought no Starry logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the contents compared to this.
Looks the same in size.
The chamber and draw are the same.
LCD This is more beautiful.
It may be newer than without a logo.
Vibrator This is a short notice.
It looks like a vibrator on a smartphone.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibrator or the sound is loud.
It is a cheap Chinese phone.
This product is also Chinese ...
Attached items are a little different.
This is with a liquid case.
Without a logo, it is like steel wool.
It's like that.
I think Starry was better, but if it breaks quickly, it loses credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose a return, so it was troublesome, but I went through the procedure.
When it comes to ear rubber, there is ear rubber.
This flat rubber really does not hurt.
It is the best mask of the same type that I have used so far.
Even with flat rubber, it can be twisted in some cases, and the part of the helix of the twist is rubbed into the base of the ear, and it can hurt more than the round rubber, but I think that this product is not only soft in feel, but also the length is hard to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, and not only does it fit, but it also makes it difficult to feel the difficulty of breathing because there is a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower side of the ago.
That's because you fit the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it's the same for everyone, but if you're thinking that all of them are small, I think it's a good idea to try them once.
When I open the outer box, it is in the vinyl of the central slit like a box tissue, but when I take out the first one, the ear rubber on both sides is stuck and it is difficult to take it out, so I reduced the star one by one.
Service Provider's Response to Star 1
The price and taste are good, but despite the fact that it was designated by the day, I felt distrust in the response of the service provider who ignored it.
In addition to this product, I bought a drink together.
I always buy it on amazon, so I know the delivery staff face to face.
I tried to make sure that the arrival date was as good as possible, especially since heavy items are carried up.
Because of amazon, the shipping company is very difficult, but I think that there is one thing that the user can cooperate with.
I am disappointed with the response of arrogant brokers.
But the price is cheap.
If you are considering purchasing, include disposal costs
There are a lot of complaints and I think that it cannot be used for a long time.
I think it is better to consider it with the cost of disposal.
For your information, some local governments have centers that accept large-scale waste for free or at low cost if you bring it in.
[Situation comfort] The seat surface is slightly tilted to the left, so it is very tired when sitting.
If you move it a little, you will get a big noise.
It's noisy at night and can't be used.
This is my biggest concern, and I feel that I can't continue to use it.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions are only described in a rough picture.
There is a shortage of information necessary for assembly, and there are many typographical errors.
There is no explanation about the direction of mounting the seat and the support column. Some people say that the review is pre-directed, but there is a possibility that the direction of mounting the seat and the support column may be the opposite.
When mounted correctly, the lever for height adjustment is backwards on the right side and the dial for adjusting the spring on the back is forward.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural in the forward direction, many people will accidentally install it.
There are no such basic precautions in the instruction manual, and the assembly is done while trying and error while looking at the miscellaneous picture.
The list of contents at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that there are many buyers who do not find a 8x20mm screw attached to 12.
Since 8x20mm screws have already been inserted into the chair side, it is necessary to be careful not to look for them in vain.
It seems that there is a combination that can be inserted with the same screw hole and screw, and the combination that cannot be inserted.
In a combination, it is very difficult to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that it is shipped with screws in this way.
Also, we did not find any spare screws in the instructions.
[Other] The black part of the surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring, and in some cases it is white, so it is better not to expect beautiful things like product photos.
I received an e-mail from the e-mail address registered in amazon on 2-3 days after the arrival of the product, including an explanation that there is a deficiency in the instruction manual and a supplementary explanation of the above installation method.
Originally, these items should be released immediately after shipment of the product.
In two or three days after the arrival of the product, many buyers have completed the assembly, so it is a completely meaningless act.

I'm a big fan of thermos and have been using the straw type of thermos for more than 15 years, but this model is the most difficult to use.
1 The straw's drinking mouth part has become a harder material than ever before, and the grooves have become addictive to the body, and the straw's drinking mouth part can no longer be taken from the body!
I tried to take it desperately and cracked my nails.
2 Only the tip of the mouth part of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush is no longer included.
3 The mysterious part of the valve attached to the end of the straw is thicker than the straw brush, and it is dramatically less difficult to wash.
Until now, I have never been dissatisfied with the straw type, so it's a bit of a shock.
It is really stressful that you can't get a drink from the body.
The good thing is that the outstanding cooling power is still excellent.
When I forget to leave the bag and wash the next day, about 50% of the ice I put in the previous day still remains.
I can't drink hot, so I'm still a straw type student.
Thank you for your support in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
I will review it for the first time.
(This is the impression that amateurs who buy dolls from scratch for the first time and do not know how to wear doll eyes for the first time) I received the product as shown in the photo.
I was very happy with the light, which was very cute when I put it on the obits doll.
However, it cannot be worn unless the entrance is a little hard and the force is applied and not pressed.
I think the method is different, but I put a tweezers in the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping It was the first time to ship from overseas, so I was about three weeks, but it arrived in 8 days (Narita Airport is near) earlier than I thought.
However, I was worried that I could not send a shipping email at least once.
If you look at the description of Amazon shipping earlier, it is said that it is still shipping.
There was no air in my eyes and broken eyes, and there were a lot of petits on the back of the envelope and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it was safe for me.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information okay even if it is an e-mail flight from overseas?
I was wondering, so I will be minus 1.
There is no problem with the product, I think it is very good to buy this amount at that price.
Addition Doll Eye 8mm Model iPhonese
A little small (the working area is small), and the charge is severe
I ordered the size notation after looking at it, but it felt about two times smaller than I imagined.
Although it is larger than A4 size, the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I wanted to use it when repairing electronic devices and creating gunpowders, but it would be difficult to use if there were no B4 sizes.
It can be used only for soldering iron work, and other tasks such as assembly and disassembly can be done if you use another tray or mat.
Within the area of the magazine size, it is impossible to put a tool, put parts, and do further work ...
I thought that I would order the same item and make it double the area, but during the work, the charge is too severe, and all the pieces of dust and cut parts will be sucked up, so I think it is difficult to keep using it for a while.
Fatal Defects
The lid of the battery box was not opened, and after a long struggle, the lid was finally opened using a rubber non-slip sheet, but if you try to load the battery and close it, it will not close.
At this point it is out.
High evaluation!
Is the lid of the battery box closed?
If you add it, there was a small salan wrap on the fly instead of the protective seal of the product.
This is a second-hand product?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
The only explanation is a small piece of paper written in English.
There is no explanation of the diagram solution, and no one knows how to operate it.
I'm not sure if it's the same, but I'm not sure if it's the same.
I found a good product!
I bought it as soon as I thought.
I used it for pin key rings, so if you don't use it a lot, it won't be perfect.
But I think it's a good idea to use it for other fingers.
But I think it's a good idea merchant.
Pricing
After all, you should not ask for quality for this kind of product.
One flower mark was crushed.
The size is just right.
People with thick earlobes may be tough.
It might have been a good idea to buy a pattern.
Yabana
The design is good, but it's big when you get it I wonder if the effect won't fade even if you put it on your feet?
In the winter season, it is the eastern part of Hokkaido.
As you can see in other reviews, there are only 110 x 80 electric wires, and the layout is not vertical, but horizontal.
I bought it because I wanted to warm the entire futon, but it was more expensive than the laying type, but it was not too big, but I can't help it because I can't check it in the store like a famous manufacturer.
It can only be used in combination with the N-Warm of Yutanpo and Tori.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
It can be done well.
Small and windy.
Batteries can also be replaced with spare.
If you put it on your desk and adjust the angle, you can do it as shown in the picture.
If you are on the desk of a crane, you can blow up with your own wind, but if you put a handkerchief on it, there is no problem.
The sound is not noticeable even in the medium if it is used for the outside/families, but in the office it is not loud even in the small.
It is only necessary to divide the offering when you go out.
In addition, even if it is small in office use, the amount of wind is too much and it is too cold.
It is ideal for situations where you sweat a lot at the destination, run away to the family, and cool at once with big.
Just one thing, when you release it into the bag, the power button is pressed on rare occasions and it may turn around while you do not know.
It would be nice to have some ingenuity, such as slightly pulling the button in (recovering) or pushing the weak point of the first press for a long time.
In an era of extreme heat, which is dangerous to life, it is an essential item, so it will be helpful if you make better things.
Multifunctional Light Speakers
It is used in the bedroom, making it the weakest warm color.
Better than I thought!
I was glad to buy it.
As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color with a touch type.
The white color goes well with any room, and the color light changes with gradation, so it is beautiful.
Also, if you touch one in your favorite color, it will stop in your favorite color, so you can shine according to your mood!
Because it is LED type, it can be expected to have a long life.
When it comes to sound quality, I think that the level of satisfaction is too much for my amateur ears.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it is multifunctional anyway.
At the top, there is a large speaker.
You can pair Bluetooth with your mobile phone, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
If you pair it with a mobile phone, you can also make hands-free calls.
Furthermore, since it supports MicroSD, it can be connected to a PC and play music as an mp3 player.
Squeeze and practice piano
At the age of 66, he started challenging DTM to prevent bokeh.
Buy the audio interface and this unit.
At first, I was doing a lot of work, but I ended up playing the piano, and I spent my time practicing every day.
I downloaded the sound source for the request, but the protection was not good, and at first I downloaded the ASIO, but the free piano sound source is good sound, so I use it for piano practice.
I'm glad I bought it.
There is a feeling of being deceived by the appearance.
Is there a difference between products?
It will be a long sentence.
Since the synthetic leather of the Doussier office chair (bouncing armrest) used for 4 to 5 years deteriorated, it became boring, so it was considered to be purchased at the chair of the bouncing armrest with non-synthetic leather.
I have a home center and a furniture store, but there is no suitable thing.
I am worried that I will not be able to confirm the actual product, but I compromised on the appearance and price of the design and bought this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
Screws have one spare.
[Note] The included hex wrench and screws are made of oil.
At first, I didn't know the oil adhered to the hexagon wrench and the body was white, so I was impatient when the oil was attached.
Completed in 40 minutes.
Complete and confirm the product.
The bouncing armrests are different in hardness, the left is heavy, the right is light, and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak and the fixed force is weak, and it drips down immediately with the sound.
The seat feels hard with a non-renewable high-density polyurethane foam, and it is not comfortable to sit (weak elasticity?
The backrest part of the competitive mesh is harder than other mesh chairs, and if you wear thin clothes, your back hurts.
It is fine, but the height from the seat to the ground was not 550, but 530 (the height of the seat is important for high height) And the foot supporting the caster is not made of steel, so the durability remains a question.
A separate cushion is laid, and the part of the mesh fabric is used by laying a towelket because the deterioration (harm) seems to come quickly.
I felt that only the fit of the back was good for me, but I think that other products are less satisfied, and I feel that there is a mismatch.
After all, it may be better to sit down and buy an office chair looking at the actual thing.
Do you have any questions about Armrest and Headrest?
It is under consideration.
Well, what is this?
I bought Pixera's 4K tuner, which was cheap, without much expectation, because the environment of my house, apparently, seems to be seen on the right side.
As an experiment, you can see free broadcasting of the right-wing, including NHK BS4K, and you can watch it beautifully on Panasonic's 4K TV purchased at the same time.
(Sometimes the image is crunchy) As soon as I bought it, the update came, and it became compatible with recording, so I made a few reservation recordings, but is it possible that the external 2.5-inch HDD is also affected, only the image is stopped due to playback, and the frame skip occurs.
The user interface has never been praised, and it is divided into 4K broadcasting can be seen.
By the way, during the reservation recording, it seems that you can only follow the recording program and play it, and I accept it as a positive function that it can be recorded on HDD with 4K.
You may be disappointed if you buy it with various expectations, so excessive expectations are prohibited.
We expect it to be improved in the update.
The heat retention function is OK
The heat retention function is not used yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in, it warmed up in about 2 hours, and it felt hot in 2 and a half hours.
Although it was installed at the passenger foot of a compact car, I am worried when the fan sound stops idling, but I do not feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the smell of chemicals that were still emitted from the fan, and I needed to ventilate the window regularly.
As another person writes in the review The burrs on the part passing through the shoulder straps are terrible, so it is necessary to fold the burrs with a negative screwdriver.
Really fragile.
Today, it suddenly broke in two months after starting to use.
I liked the key feeling and the size, but it doesn't make sense if it breaks.
I use a PC all day for the work of processing the video, but the volume will be 100% on my own.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in a blink of an eye.
The earphones are sore that they can't be used, and it's easy to notice that you use a PC at night.
It seems that the signal is sent every few seconds, and the volume display appears and disappears on the computer screen.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, so if you do not turn off the keyboard, you can not use the mouse freely.
Enter and backspace keys no longer respond.
I don't recommend it at all, but if you're in Chien-Yen, you may want to try it.
If you are lucky, you will be able to use it for half a year.
This is a six-month warranty, compared to the one- to three-year warranty made by other companies in the same price range.
The shortness of the warranty period tells us that it is fragile.
The goods are the best, the packaging is the worst
I love the products because they are different colors.
If you are looking for a food stocker , I would definitely recommend it!
However, there was a gap between the large cardboard and the roll, and the packing was the worst because there was no delivery certificate.
When I opened the box, the lid was out.
The product is recommended, but it may be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but for the time being, I'm worried about it.
When I bought the lid, I was not able to support it, so I bought it.
It plays a role in the sense of stability of the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you do not care when opening and closing the lid, it will make a disgusting sound.
You have to choose the one that suits the thickness of the lid, so be careful when buying it.
The Meatballs Are Cute Back
When I was looking for a back to go out with a dog, I was attracted by a gray fashionable back and I was able to buy it here.
It was a built-in style, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so even if I held it, it was not so heavy.
The fasteners move smoothly, and there is no such thing as scratching.
It seems that it is easy to move for a long time.
It is also very compact and easy to fold.
You can see the design of the meat ball, even if it is folded, and it is cute even if it is placed.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, I immediately bought it at a glance due to the appearance and the low price.
TSA Rock is my favorite for several years now, and there are several other things, but it is convenient.
And for those who forget or lose keys, we recommend using the number lock.
However, to be honest, I have the most important point in lightness, but if you ask for durability and security, the fastener is a week, because it is a cloth, so it will break in a blink of an eye if you cut it.
Also, since the combination of fasteners is sweet, I want to create a way to overlap.
If you are overseas, it is recommended to bring it on board.
For the time being, I used it on a Shinkansen trip, but it was comfortable.
It is difficult to choose a size.
Because it is wide, it is difficult to buy shoes.
Converse and buns wear 24 cm.
MRL996 is also 24 cm.
At first, I thought it was pretty, but when I got used to it, it was calm.
If my sister told me that 24.5cm was pretty, it was really tough.
I felt like I was hitting my little finger.
So I bought 25 cm.
When I arrived and opened it, it was big...
When you wear it, you can relax a little even if you wear socks.
I was worried about whether to return it, but if it becomes tight at 24.5, it will be troublesome, so I will try to put it in the middle at 25 as it is.
I bought Team Red, but it is very good in bright red!
There are a lot of black and white monotone clothes, so if you wear this, it will be bright!
165 cm, men in their 40s
I ordered the L size appropriately, but if you are similar to the following specifications, we recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel around: 100 cm Typical Metabo belly.
In the water, the lower part of the waist may be loose, so the rush guard will turn up.
I'm swimming while fixing the part that I got up.
Especially when I am a Jacuzzi, I can see the belly of the metabolite.
Also, if you walk vigorously while exercising up and down, you will still turn up from below.
The fabric is not too durable and thin, so you don't have to worry about the nipple being transparent.
At this price, you can be satisfied if you make it, but I think that if you buy a small one, it will fit.
After all, gas leaked, but ...
Silver Cort 25 was still leaking gas, there was a problem that part of the tank was missing if I changed the valve, but I started to use [Busbond Q] to seal the tank and make repair grissup, and I was able to break it smoothly.If you want to buy this cort 25, you can ask someone who can disassemble or assemble, or you can not disassemble while taking a digital camera photo, so it may be not recommended that people who are not confident, but those who think it can be broken may be fun.I bought another black cort 25, the trick to disassemble was to remove the trigger by pressing the left thumb, and I was able to break it down somehow without skipping the parts, when assembling, I assembled it while applying silicone grease to spring or fine parts, and when disassemble it, first remove the grip, remove the screws of the safety, and remove the two screws of the left body
I thought, what kind of quality is 188 yen?
It can be used separately when the speed and torque are required.
It is light and small, and more importantly, it is simple without any fancy decoration.
There is no waste when attaching a bit, and I thought that it would be amazing if it was 188 yen.
After that, what about durability?
It may not be used very often, but I think it is a good idea to put it in a toolbox.
Purchased in conjunction with the popular 1/4 hexagonal shank magnetic quick release driver Roulette bit holder 60/100/150 mm.
There was no problem with this, but it was quite good instead of the price.
The controller stops working
Self-operating machines will not be able to operate.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the machine will move in an unexpected direction and become a symptom that it cannot be operated.
It is better not to buy this product.
I will warn you once.
It is a terrible product.
Although it is wired, we recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It is reliable and has not been broken yet even if you use it for a long time.
It can also be used for PC games.
Addition I was able to refund Amazon Gift Certificates with a return as a defective item within a month, so I think that was good.
Does this increase the computational power?
I think it is suitable for children who understand the calculation.
Isn't it possible if you are a child who understands calculations to a certain extent?
It is difficult to solve the problem.
Also, if you give your parents a tool, you can slide the screen up with your fingers, but I tried it myself, but it doesn't work smoothly no matter how many times you do it.
In short, it may be easy for people who are used to DS to slide?
I don't really like the illustrations of manga characters, but I think DS etc. may be included from the fun of the screen ... for some reason I'm not familiar with them.
The calculation method is also a way to compete for time, for example, how many questions and answers are correct in a few minutes.
I know that it feels like I'm in a hurry with exams, but don't you think I'm in a hurry to calculate it?
I don't like the gong when it's over.
I'm not sure if I can make a more pleasant sound, even though I'm doing my best.
With this, 6,200 yen seems to have lost some money.
You can see if this is half the price.
I'm sorry, this is how it turned out to be ☆2.
After all, I like the song of the persona!
Persona 3 reaches ED.
5 played until the middle.
Persona 4 has been retro-controlled in vita.
What I can do is not change from the persona 4 in the previous work, but it is not.
Without a story, it feels shorter than the previous one.
After all, the song is cool!
Just listening to it makes you feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Sunpei seemed to be good at it (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the original, so there is no freshness ...
As a sound game, I felt that it was easier to play than 3 to 5.
The persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was hard to see if the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if it is worn with a background.
Because of the abundant assist function, I think that even those who are not good at sound games can play.
If you are skilled in sound games, you may turn on the challenge function and turn it on to become a tough game.
The triple pack has a santra, but it is a solid four-piece set rather than just an omake, so if you like the songs of the persona, we recommend here.
I'm sorry.
I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual thing is blue, but it is close to black or charcoal gray.
And not a double buckle.
So, I was thinking about buying gold, but now I'm on hold, so I'm going to give up because the price is cheap?
Addendum We received an e-mail from the seller stating that they will apologize and exchange it for a new product after posting the review.
After that, the process was quick.
Despite the cheap products, I think the response was very good.
4 stars in response Addition After that, I bought gold as well.
I think the color is very beautiful as shown in the photo.
But after all, the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the picture is clear.
That's the only pity.
The evening will be very heavy.
I used it for the SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setting, I didn't know how to do it after I arrived in Korea and pointed to the SIM, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (set up < Mobile Communications > Turn on data roaming from the communication option).
I'm not sure if it's a good idea, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea.
However, the area around Gimpo Airport has been in a bad state of radio waves for a long time.
When I got out of the city, it became 4G.
Sometimes communication becomes very heavy in the evening or at night, but if you think about it now, you may have reached a maximum of hundreds of MB per day.
Better than I thought.
I've been using SoftBank Z4 for two years, making it sim-free and using it on Ymobile, and Z4 has become bad, so when I was looking for a second-hand Xperia phone, I found and bought this phone that can be used with a new one.
I was using a mobile Suica, so I was worried about whether it could be used properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so I think it's an iPhone 6?
Since I do not do GAME, the processing speed is not the same as Z4, and I think it is a little faster. In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition was slow, but the impression that it takes a little more time to recognize Since facial recognition is faster, I use it here.
I thought it was great like an iPhone I made Android Ver9, and I was able to shop with satisfaction.
It's a little bit smaller than I thought I'd like There's no strap hole *The case with the strap hole Water resistance has not been tested A little heavy I'm still using a little, but I'm satisfied Recommended
