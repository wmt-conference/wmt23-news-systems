In the shadow of extinction: Three cheetah cubs were born in Iran.
The fastest animal in the world falls victim to cruel hunting, droughts, and deadly road accidents across the Islamic Republic.
As a result, their number dropped to less than 20 radars.
Three Asian cheetah cubs were recently born in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
This is a rare birth, which only slightly improves the tragic situation of the animal that is in danger of extinction in the country due to droughts, hunters, and deadly road accidents.
This is the first birth of a cheetah in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in the wild.
The Iranian news agency "IRNA" reported that the veterinary team, in charge of the Turan National Park in the northern Semnan province, decided on a cesarean birth for a captive animal.
It was also noted that recently less than 20 burglaries were recorded in seven different districts in the country.
Following the threat of their extinction, the UN implemented a protection plan for them back in 2001.
Now, in Iran, they hope that the new cubs will be able to contribute to the growth of the cheetah population in the future.
Last January, Iran's Deputy Minister for Environmental Affairs, Hassan Akbari, said that the country's cheetah population has dramatically decreased from 100 cheetahs in 2010 to just 12 cheetahs.
"Their situation is extremely severe," said the expert, noting that the turtles have fallen victim to drought in their habitats, hunting, and even road accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world, capable of reaching speeds of approximately 100 km/h.
The Bardales can be found in various places around the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: We tested the Car Thing.
Quietly, Spotify has also started to try its luck in the hardware world.
After years of development - Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small pilot in the USA.
We got our hands on the first device in Israel.
The vision: To turn your old cars into smart ones.
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product, and it was specifically designed to provide a solution for people with older cars.
A few weeks ago, I got the first opportunity to try the new product, which is currently only available to a few testers in the US, here in Israel.
For me, the timing of the delivery was exceptional, as our family car broke down and we had to drive for a few days with a replacement car with an old system.
After two weeks of playing around, I understood how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's system.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty about the global launch, I believe many would prefer to use other solutions.
From concept to reality.
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users started receiving an interesting offer in their email inbox - the opportunity to purchase a new device with voice control and 4G connectivity, which would turn any old car system into a smart one.
The rumors gradually died down until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company plans to soon introduce a new car product that simulates a smart radio with Bluetooth connectivity.
A few months later, these rumors returned to the headlines after the music service updated with a car mode - the same one we know today from the app - activated when the smartphone detects a connection to the car system.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify revealed its smart car system, "Car Thing", last April.
Spotify chose to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays regarding deliveries.
So of course, immediately after the press conference she held, I went to the website and registered.
Two months later, the long-awaited message arrived.
Reconnecting to the site gave me the opportunity to purchase the device with a small surprise - it won't cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with the Spotify logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, I was very impressed by the build quality of Spotify's device.
It's slightly smaller than my iPhone 11 and features a large, bright, and sharp touch screen on the front.
Also, next to the screen, you can find a round button and a dial that you can rotate to navigate through the interface screens.
Despite the huge dial, which you can see in the pictures, the Car Thing manages to maintain a relatively slim profile and not protrude too much from the dashboard.
Personally, I would prefer if the company allowed to change the dial function so I could control the smartphone's volume, as I can also navigate using the touch screen.
Maybe it will be possible in a future version update.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes among other things a USB Type C cable and various adapters for its installation.
Many of you probably remember how in the past we used to disconnect the radio devices and hide them in the drawer after leaving the car.
The Car Thing definitely brings back that feeling with its construction.
All the adapters were connected to the device body using a very strong magnet, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
In addition, along its top part, you can find small buttons, which can be easily set to play different playlists or podcasts.
By long pressing one of the buttons during playback, or by asking the voice assistant, I set up several playlists that I listen to frequently and the radio program that I listen to every morning on the road.
In doing so, the feature made me feel like the Car Thing is more like a car radio rather than an extension of my smartphone.
From an old vehicle to a smart car.
After a simple physical installation, I connected the Car Thing to the power.
I was pleasantly surprised by the setup process.
The instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than 5 minutes, and a few moments later I reached the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote, therefore it can copy all the information about our account.
Meaning, you will still need to connect your smartphone to the car, whether via Bluetooth or an AUX cable, in order to listen to the music.
The home screen is familiar to all app users, as like the smartphone application, it emphasizes album pictures and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like in the app, you can find music recommendations according to your taste, the search screen, and your personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touch screen or the manual dial.
Moreover, at any given moment, you can call the device's voice assistant by saying "Hey Spotify".
With it, you can play songs, playlists, albums and even search for podcasts.
From my experience, it easily recognized my voice even when music was playing in the background and the air conditioner was blowing directly on the device.
This is probably thanks to the four microphones installed in its upper part.
It's important to note that currently the voice assistant does not support Hebrew, and as of the time of publishing this article, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
So, is it worth waiting for him?
My user experience with the device was great, and it was a positive surprise for me considering it is still in its initial release stage.
Even with intensive use on long trips, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Nevertheless, occasionally there is a minor glitch in the interface, but I believe that Spotify will address such bugs with future version updates.
It's clear that the Swedish company has worked a lot on it in recent years, and among the various versions that leaked on the internet during this period, the design of the final product is probably my favorite.
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered exactly who the company was trying to target with it.
After all, his activity is summed up in controlling the application on the smartphone, and not much beyond that.
What's the difference between buying a car mount for a few shekels and connecting it so that the smartphone is closer to us while driving?
This question becomes stronger when considering that iPhone and Android devices are much more powerful than Spotify's, and most of the time they will provide the user with much more functionality.
Despite all this, the more I used the Car Thing, the more I understood how it could improve the driving experience.
The ability to see Waze on my smartphone screen and control the music on a completely different screen is something I've come to appreciate in the last two weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
So, will it also be launched here in our small country?
The Swedish company is not currently saying much.
She didn't even share how many trials for the device she is currently running worldwide, and how many she plans to add in the limited launch in the United States.
The only thing we know for sure is that the price is expected to be 79 dollars (about 255 shekels).
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides a first glimpse into the concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
From Spotify Israel it was reported that there is currently no information about a plan to launch the device in the country.

Did you recruit talent for the company?
This way you will ensure that competitors do not "snatch" it from you.
The economy is still in a labor market that is mostly controlled by the workers, and this is especially true when it comes to the most sought-after workers - the talents.
Here are some tips that will help you maintain it at the workplace.
.
Despite the increase recorded in the last month, the unemployment rate in Israel continues to be one of the lowest in the world, and in the top tenth among OECD countries, with a rate of 3.5% (150.6 thousand unemployed, according to the CBS).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is mostly controlled by the workers, and this is especially true when it comes to the most sought-after workers - the talents.
Regarding those professionals and managers who are centers of knowledge, experience, and proven ability - the trends in the job market indicate that the competition for them, the talents as they are called by employers, still exists in full force.
The implication for employers is that in the current job market, they do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even for a minute after recruiting a desired talent, as the moment he enters the company's gates - another company will already try to snatch him away.
In other words, the competition for talents is so fierce that many will continue to receive a variety of tempting job offers even after they have been hired, with 30% of employees indeed leaving just a month after accepting the job and starting work.
That's why smart employers will immediately transition from the talent recruitment stage to its retention stage, starting primarily with advanced preparation and creativity already in the onboarding process.
An efficient, thoughtful and well-structured onboarding process will make the talent excited about their new workplace from the first day and even look forward to the future.
Here are some tips on how to prepare and manage a proper onboarding process that will help retain the new talent:
It's no secret - the organization's collaboration and readiness.
Share with the stakeholders who will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is vital and important to the company and the role, and how you see his contribution.
A new employee who arrives at a place where he is expected and his value is understood, will feel wanted and will strive to meet the expectations placed on him.
Knowledge is power - coordinating expectations.
On the first day, they had an expectation coordination conversation with the talent.
Get to know his professional background and check where he sees himself in the future, so you can present him with the diverse and unique tools that you and the workplace can provide him to get there.
We are all people - Personal acquaintance |
During the onboarding days, they tried to get to know the talent beyond his professional qualities and were interested in his hobbies and areas of interest.
A new employee who is shown interest and allowed to express and realize himself beyond his role will appreciate it and want to maintain it.
Curiosity promotes |
Already at the recruitment stage, you can create attractiveness that will make the talent want to integrate quickly.
They did this not necessarily through a discourse of bonuses and benefits, but by exposing him to an exciting field or interesting technology, as such stimuli for creativity lead to curiosity and increased interest in the workplace.
Also, they encouraged the talent to voice his thoughts and opinions on the various projects in the company, making it clear that they are important to the organization.

Electricity in the pocket: The cost of not closing the coal plants in June - one billion shekels.
A report from the Knesset's Research and Information Center: The estimated cost of not closing the coal stations by the set date in June 2022 is about one billion shekels.
The Electric Company: "The policy of fuel usage is primarily dictated by the Ministry of Energy."
.
The economic cost of not closing the coal stations by the set date in June 2022 is estimated at about one billion shekels for the year 2022, as revealed by a report from the Research and Information Center of the Knesset.
According to the report, this cost is reflected in the electricity tariff for consumers, which is expected to rise in the coming months due to the increase in coal prices.
In addition, in 2023, there is expected to be an additional surplus of about 900,000 tons of coal usage, which will result in additional costs to the electricity market due to the non-closure of coal plants, assuming that the price of natural gas will remain significantly lower than the price of coal.
The report stated that a reduction of about one billion shekels in the electricity tariff in 2022 would mean a reduction of about 4% in the electricity consumption tariff for the domestic consumer.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is about a billion shekels, and the total discount that could have been for the domestic consumer is about 4%.
It should be noted that as part of the electricity market reform, among other things, it was decided to establish a subsidiary of the Electric Company, which will build units powered by natural gas, intended to replace coal units 1-4 at the Orot Rabin site.
Following this decision, a government resolution was adopted in July 2018, stating that the operation of coal production units 1-4 at the Orot Rabin power station should be ceased.
The decision set timelines, so the construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and its operation will start in June 2022, and accordingly, the coal production units 1-4 will also cease to operate at this time.
The Electric Company responded: "The policy of fuel usage is primarily dictated by the Ministry of Energy.
In accordance with the ministry's decisions, a policy of minimizing the use of coal to the lowest possible level has been implemented in Israel for several years, even when the price of coal is lower than the price of gas.
Paying the price: Everything you need to know ahead of the interest rate hike.
Continuous cuts: Next week, the interest rate on the shekel is expected to rise by half a percent.
How much will the mortgage payment increase?
And what is recommended to do? •
All the answers.
The sharp inflation in Israel, which has already reached a rate of over 4% in the last year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise the interest rate on the shekel as early as next week.
The analysts' estimates talk about an increase rate ranging between 0.25% to 0.5%.
If indeed the interest rate increases by half a percent, it will already stand at 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
This, after for years the interest rate in the economy was close to zero.
The sharp increase in the interest rate significantly raises the mortgage repayments by hundreds of shekels and drastically burdens the household economy.
With the help of Shai Tzror, a mortgage expert, we checked how much more we will pay and what is recommended to do right now.
If the interest rate increases by half a percent - how much will the monthly mortgage payment increase?
In a mortgage of 1.2 million shekels, composed of 40% prime interest rate, the monthly repayment will increase by 125 shekels.
How much has the average mortgage increased since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, there has been a significantly sharper increase.
This is because the interest rates in the other mortgage components (not just in the prime track) have also increased - in the index-linked track and in the fixed interest rate track.
If the interest rate indeed rises by half a percent, the increase will amount to about 620 shekels, according to Tzror's estimate, on a mortgage of about 1.2 million shekels.
The Prime track (40% in this track) will complete an increase of about 280 shekels, assuming there will be another 0.5% increase next month.
The variable interest rate track linked to the index (26.7% in this track) will complete an increase of about 120 shekels.
The fixed interest rate track - not linked to the index (33.3% in this track) will increase by 220 shekels.
So what is recommended to do today?
For those who have a mortgage that is mostly linked to the index, Tsror recommends considering recycling to non-linked tracks.
For those with mortgages who find their monthly repayments have significantly increased and are struggling to meet them - he recommends considering a mortgage recycling and spreading it over a longer period.
This is to reduce the payments despite the interest rate increase, as it is always better to meet the repayments and not to be in default.
Regarding new mortgage borrowers - he highly recommends getting to know the different paths and adjusting the mortgage to their economic capabilities.
In the future, when the interest rates drop, they will be able to refinance their mortgage with minimal early repayment fees.
Regarding those who purchase apartments from a contractor - Tzror recommends making payments to the contractor in advance and taking a mortgage now.
It should be taken into account that the "construction inputs index" significantly increases the property price even after the purchase contract has been signed.
The residential construction cost index has risen by 6.6% in the last year.
In light of the increase in this index, the Banking Supervision recently announced that it is considering requiring the inclusion of indexation within mortgages, however, the final decision on the matter has not yet been made.
The fuel price is rising - and Israelis will have to pay more than 8 shekels per liter in July.
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price for a liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08 shekels.
Meanwhile, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022.
Decade high: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 cents per liter - and will stand from July 1st at more than 8 shekels per liter.
The new price for a liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08, and those who want full service will have to pay an additional 21 agorot per liter.
Simultaneously, the reduction of half a shekel per liter in the diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022 - as announced by the Tax Authority.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continued rise in oil prices, against the backdrop of the war between Russia and Ukraine and the rise of the dollar.
Without the half shekel subsidy from the government since April, the fuel price would have exceeded the all-time high - 8.25 shekels per liter.
The validity of the discount ends at the end of July and the Tax Authority and the Treasury are currently promoting a public notice of the order extending the reduction in gasoline tax, which stands at half a shekel per liter, until August 9.
Also, starting from August 10th, there will be an additional reduction of half a shekel, so only from this date the price of a liter of gasoline will decrease by one shekel until November 15th, 2022.
This was announced by the Tax Authority.
"We have reached a situation where I can't remember five consecutive months of surplus in the state's revenue.
We started a few months ago with the issue of reducing the tax on diesel.
We have been working for a week on extending the tax on diesel, gasoline and blue fuel for another four months - from half a shekel to a shekel.
It's good for the industry and the citizen.
If we lower it, it will affect inflation, reduce production and ease the cost of living.
"The Finance Minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus primarily on this," said Minister Liberman at the Horowitz Conference for Economy and Society of the Israel Democracy Institute.
As of today, more than half of the fuel price is the taxes collected by the government (excise tax and VAT) - and this is a high tax rate compared to most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living in the economy - as it affects both household expenses and business expenses, public transportation and flight prices, transportation costs and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the most business-friendly city.
Petah Tikva reached second place in the business conduct rating of the Ministry of Economy.
Following them: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon LeZion.
Minister Barvivai: "The Corona emphasized the importance of local government in business development."
.
Ashdod is the most business-friendly city for small and medium-sized businesses.
This is the third consecutive year - as found by the Doing Business Index of Local Authorities by the Small and Medium Business Agency in the Ministry of Economy and Industry, which ranks the local authorities.
In second place is the city of Petah Tikva and in third place is Rehovot.
Following them in order are: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Be'er Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya, and Bnei Brak.
The agency compiles the local authorities index.
This is the fifth time and its purpose is to serve as a tool for the local authority, as it allows each authority to compare its performance with other authorities in a variety of parameters, and also to analyze its performance in the areas in which it operates.
The index is based on several parameters that are examined in each authority, which assess the "friendliness" level of the authority to the businesses operating in its area.
The index divides the authorities into three size groups according to the number of residents, as a local authority of up to 50,000 residents is not similar to a local authority of more than 150,000 residents.
This year, Tel Aviv has jumped.
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different ratings in each local authority: business satisfaction, tender accessibility, information accessibility, and property tax.
From the ranking, it appears that Ramat Gan has dropped from second to eighth place, Bat Yam has dropped from fourth to twelfth place, and Netanya has dropped from fifth to thirteenth place.
A decrease in rating does not mean that the authority's business service has deteriorated, and in many cases it is due to the fact that the service of other authorities to businesses has improved more and they have risen in the rating, while the authority that has dropped in rating has improved its services to businesses less.
Among the cities that have risen in the ranking, one can find Petah Tikva, which has moved from sixth to second place, and Rehovot, which has moved from twelfth to third place.
Tel Aviv, which dropped from fourth place to eleventh in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
"Business - The Engine of Growth"
From the ranking, it appears that the Galilee Panorama leads among local authorities that include between 50 and 150 thousand residents.
Following it are Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula, and Hod Hasharon.
Tiberias is ranked in the last and 28th place.
"The index is designed to encourage local authorities to ease the burden on small and medium businesses, from the time of opening the business and throughout its operation with the authorities," says Minister of Economy and Industry, Orna Barbivai.
"Businesses are a significant growth engine for the Israeli economy and they account for about 50% of the business output and about 60% of the employees in the economy.
The development of small businesses is a public interest for all of us, however, the local authority has a direct influence on the businesses located within it.
The Corona emphasized the importance of local government and we saw that authorities that acted and encouraged the promotion of small businesses and found creative solutions for them, became their first governmental interface.
Ran Kiviti, the director of the Small and Medium Business Agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities play a central and substantial role in the ability of businesses in their jurisdiction to thrive and prosper."
In the last two years, in which we are dealing with the Corona crisis, the authorities have a greater responsibility in helping businesses to survive in their field and to survive in general.
2021 in mail: 20 packages for each household - and a surge in their weight.
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020.
The average weight of a package stands at 435 grams - a jump of 36% compared to 2020.
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight stood at 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million mail packages arrived in Israel, almost 20 packages on average for each household - according to data from Israel Post that reached "Israel Today".
The number of packages that arrived in 2021 is similar to 2020, in which 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019 - when 61.6 million packages arrived.
However, this year there was a jump of more than 36% in the weight of packages arriving from abroad.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of products arrived in Israel from abroad, a jump of 36% compared to 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumption habits.
The average weight of a package jumped by 60% in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
The increase in package weight is mainly influenced by two central trends, both from the seller and the buyer's side: large shopping sites abroad are combining items into one shipment and no longer send each product from the "shopping basket" in separate packaging.
From the Israeli consumer's perspective, the fast delivery of orders, within a few days from the moment of purchase, supports the buying of more everyday items such as clothing and gifts, which buyers want to receive shortly after making the purchase.
Also in 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month in which the most packages from abroad arrived, both in terms of weight and number of items, was December, with 4.2 million packages weighing a total of 2,200 tons.
In December, the average weight per package was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
Black Friday effect.
More packages arrived in December than any other month, likely due to the shopping holidays in November, such as Chinese Singles Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday.
The large orders start to arrive in Israel between a week to two weeks after the purchase.
Research: Most employees in the economy are not aware that they can receive tax refunds.
Many renters receive money from the state, which can amount to tens of thousands of shekels.
Did you change your workplace?
Did you go on vacation?
Did you move from the city to the settlement?
You may be entitled to receive a substantial amount through a simple process.
All the details - inside.
Most renters are not aware of the fact that they are entitled to tax refunds, which can accumulate to high amounts.
The State Comptroller noted in a report two months ago that two million employees are entitled to tax refunds amounting to 3.6 billion shekels, which means it's worth checking if you are also entitled to a tax refund.
Many employees can receive a high amount, as four out of five employees are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, however, tens of thousands of employees submit annually.
If you think that this money has already gone down the drain, think again: renters can apply to the income tax for refunds for up to six years back.
Tax:On company conducted an in-depth research among 4,000 of its customers regarding tax returns during 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their distribution in terms of population groups, gender, age, and geography.
The data shows that during 2020, due to the outbreak of the Corona crisis and the furlough of hundreds of thousands of workers, several significant changes occurred, central among them a 15% increase in the average refund to a household, which stood at 4,300 shekels a year.
The reason is that the severance pay is lower than the salaries, therefore a gap is created between what the employee paid as tax and what he actually needs.
By the way, the highest refund received by a customer of the company in 2020 was an amount of 121,054 NIS for refunds over the last 6 years.
What can you get tax refunds for?
One of the reasons to get a tax refund is a change in the workplace.
81% of people who changed jobs during the year received a tax refund with an average amount of 2,943 shekels.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data shows that 74% of women who gave birth and took more than 16 weeks of maternity leave were eligible for an average refund of 3,538 shekels for that year.
Another reason for the refund is donations.
100% of the people who donate and pay taxes received a refund.
Another reason for the refund is the non-registration of credit points for alimony. 63%
The divorcees did not update the credit point for alimony, therefore the tax refund for each year that such a credit point was not updated is 2,616 shekels.
Due to unemployment - tax refund: 93% of those who were unemployed or on leave and earned over 12,000 shekels received a tax refund of 4,021 shekels for that year.
Other reasons for tax refunds include: refunds for life insurance payments, mortgage life insurance, settlement refund, refunds for losses in securities, non-registration of credit points for men due to birth, and distribution of tax refunds according to geographical location.
94% of people who have taken out personal life insurance or a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
In a test conducted on a million shekel mortgage for 25 years, the accumulated tax return for the period is over 20,000 shekels for the entire mortgage period.
100% of the people who moved to the eligible settlement received a tax refund for the transition year, as the residency confirmation in the eligible settlement is only given after 12 months from the day the resident becomes eligible, thus in fact, the full tax is paid in the first year.
79% of the customers holding securities were eligible for a tax refund for the said years.
However, those who hold securities should check every year as losses are not rolled over from year to year, but only through filing a report.
56% of men who have a child do not register credit points in the birth year on their pay slip.
The refund rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over 6 years.
This is a phenomenon that mainly exists in the Arab sector.
The CEO of tax:on, Tal Carmon: "The Corona crisis has made the renters' public in Israel much more active."
He is interested, checks and demands what he is entitled to in income tax returns.
It turns out that staying at home, on unpaid leave or after being fired, for many months, has led many employees to deeply examine what they are entitled to from the state.
It's important to know that today all the procedures for getting tax refunds can be done digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that deterred many in the past.
Job market: Fewer candidates for a position, higher salary.
Oljobs' 2021 summary report: At the top of the demands - jobs without experience.
The volume of jobs offered increased by 50%.
"Looking for work, but not rushing into the market"
In the past year, there was a 15% decrease in the number of resumes sent, and only an average of 23 candidates competed for each position, compared to 41 candidates in the previous year - according to a report by AllJobs website summarizing 2021, on the Corona crisis and its effects on the job market in Israel.
According to the report, job seekers were mainly interested in fields with many positions such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 resumes were sent.
However, the jobs without experience led the demand with more than 38 thousand searches - probably due to the return of young people without professional experience looking for immediate work, after the end of unemployment benefits.
The number of searches for sales and administration was 35 thousand and 32 thousand respectively, for drivers and couriers there were 11 thousand searches, and for security there were slightly less than 9,000 searches.
On the other hand, despite the Corona crisis, the salary in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average salary in Israel was 11,675 shekels gross.
The average monthly salary in the software field was 17,915 shekels, and in information systems analysis, it was 17,140 shekels.
However, there was a wage gap of more than 2,000 shekels between the center and the periphery: in the center of the country it was an average of 12,500 shekels, compared to 10,795 in the north and 10,135 shekels in the south.
From a gender perspective, the average wage gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and the number of hours, remained at 36%.
Men earned 13,295 shekels, compared to women's wages which stood at 9,740 shekels.
Trying to get back on track.
On the business side, there was almost across-the-board growth in all sectors of the economy, and businesses were desperate for workers.
Thus, the job supply increased by 50% and recorded a record of more than 40,000 jobs on AllJobs.
A survey conducted by the site among employers found that 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% of them indicated their intention to increase the total recruitments but 72% understand that they will struggle with it this year.
The largest supply was for jobs without experience - there were more than 58 thousand on the site.
Following them were customer service and administration roles with about 44,000 jobs in each field, sales and software with 41,000 jobs each, teaching and education with 24,000 available jobs, and warehouse workers are still in demand with 19,000 available jobs.
Einav Boimfeld, the research and content manager at AllJobs: "Job seekers are trying to get back on track but they are not rushing into the market, mainly due to the lack of attractive positions in their eyes.
Also, the prolonged disconnection from the work cycle makes it difficult for them to return, and some of them have found creative ways to make a living.

"Taken for granted": Subliminal sanctifies the Sabbath - and prepares for independence.
Celebrates the fact that "we can live as we please", excited to meet the audience and makes sure to spend time with the kids.
The weekend and Independence Day by Kobi Shimon, Subliminal.
What does your typical Friday look like?
"Weekends are the most important moments in my life, from my perspective."
The sanctity and tradition are a very deep root in my soul.
Fridays at my place are dedicated to my children, Or (10) and Yonatan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and supplies for the Kiddush, eat lunch and do something fun together, like playing football, horse riding or playing with remote control cars.
Sometimes we go to the sea, or even just to wash the car, but we always stop on the way to buy a gift at the neighborhood toy store - and there's always another excuse.
When we return home with all the gifts, the smells of the cooking greet us.
What does your Friday meal look like?
"I am blessed with maturity around me."
On my side, there is a Persian-Tunisian kitchen, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughter, music, singing and joy.
From my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, come the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
When we arrive at my mother-in-law's, amazing smells are already wafting up from her apartment in the building.
Usually, I do the Kiddush, along with the children, who know it by heart.
At the end of the day, my fun after eating is to collapse on the rug, and the kids jump on me as if I'm some kind of inflatable.
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"As a child, I would wake up on Saturdays to the sounds of Israeli music on Channel 3 and the skits of 'The Pale Tracker', which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we traveled a lot in Israel, usually to the north.
Every neglected corner in the country filled his heart with pride.
He passed away three months ago from a severe illness, and for him, the Sabbath and the sanctification were the holiest of holies, mainly because the whole family should be together.
Recently, I released a song in his memory called 'Shomer Alecha', which I created with Osher Cohen.
I believe he would be proud of this creation, which sanctifies the bond between father and son."
Soon we will celebrate the 74th Independence Day. As an ardent Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
"Independence Day is a sacred day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who is privileged to live with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I was already climbing trees and tying Israeli flags to the house with strings.
My Independence Days are filled with performances, and I always meet an ecstatic crowd, celebrating the fact that we can live as we please.
We need to ensure that our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren also have this opportunity, and remember that nothing here is taken for granted."
Her Friday: Esti Zakheim welcomes the Sabbath.
"My dream is to set a big table and invite all my beloved deceased": This is the Friday dinner that Esti Zakheim dreams of, and how does she cope with the fact that her husband observes Shabbath?
Tell me about your preparations for Shabbat.
.
"The preparations start already on Thursday night, when I come back from a show or workshop and cook until three in the morning everything that requires long cooking like stew, roast and sauces."
On Friday, in the first part of the day, I dedicate my time to myself, meeting friends for coffee, going to a play or a movie, or participating in rehearsals.
In the summer, the Sabbath starts late, and I have plenty of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just a good series.
During the Sabbath meal, I usually host my mother, Vered, who just turned 89, and also friends.
Can you share more about the cooking?
"I love shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry them.
On my Sabbath table, you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, baked potatoes and cauliflower.
I prepare most of the dishes, and of course, they are warmed up on the hotplate on Shabbat.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad and in winter - the "cholent".
Your husband is religious and you come from a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with someone who observes Shabbat is an endless compromise.
'Love your neighbor as yourself', a practical commandment.
He can't go on family trips, so I found myself many times packing the kids and joining my friends' family trips.
In addition, I am also the designated driver for the kids, the one who picks them up on Friday nights from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of his Sabbath, because I usually don't work on Saturdays and get a kind of 'forced vacation' - and that's a good thing.
Who would you like to host for Shabbat?
"I would set a big table and invite 'my dead ones'.
Sometimes I imagine what it would be like if my brother Daniel, may he rest in peace, was alive, or if my father, Shneor, may he rest in peace, could see my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16 and a half).
We surely argued a lot about football and politics and were amazed at each other.
Do you have a special childhood memory from the weekends?
"We were a warm and united family."
On Friday afternoon, mom would make a pile of schnitzels, bring hummus and pitas from the market, and roast eggplants for tahini salad.
Afterwards, we would travel to Aunt Hannah in Yad Eliyahu, or as she would say 'Yad Eliyake', and she would make blintzes.
Since I was the only one who didn't like raisins, she would make some without raisins for me.
She saw me, the youngest of the siblings, and took care of me.
On Saturdays, we would take a tour with my father in Jaffa port, and he would show us where he and his brother, Grisha, arrived in the country with nothing.

Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck got engaged.
Almost two decades after their love story ended in a breakup, Lopez and Affleck are back in each other's arms.
Lopez separated from baseball player Alex Rodriguez in April 2021.
.
His one: Almost two decades after their first love story ended in a breakup and a year after their highly publicized comeback, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing a romantic circle and getting engaged.
The happy news was shared by Lopez with her fans yesterday evening (Friday) on her official website onthejlo.com.
.
The news about the engagement comes after Lopez was spotted this week with a clearly visible giant diamond ring on her engagement finger.
A representative on her behalf confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
As you may recall, the last time Affleck (49) pulled out a ring and proposed to Lopez (52) to be his forever was in 2002, and then it was an eye-catching ring with a giant six-carat pink diamond, estimated to be worth about 2.5 million dollars.
Despite the grandiose gestures of love, the two separated in 2004, blaming the media for excessive obsession and constant intrusion into their lives.
Since Affleck managed to marry actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez, as is well known, has been married three times in the past, including to singer Marc Anthony, with whom they became parents to twins.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, from whom she separated in April 2021 after a four-year relationship, including two years of engagement.
The Kardashians say: "You can't make up what happens to us."
"The never-ending chaos," insists mom Kris Jenner about the new series starring the first family of reality, and gets support from her daughters and the new producer.
In an article to be published in "Shishabat" magazine, they talk about the big money, the PR grind, the brand factory and the change Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm no longer the one who spends hours thinking about which bikini selfie to post."
It may surprise many, but the most sought-after brand in Disney's content empire in 2022, which among other things includes Marvel movies and "Star Wars", is the Kardashian family.
The contract details of the first reality family and the social networks against Disney were not revealed, but estimates suggest a minimum amount of one hundred million dollars was transferred to the daughters of the family, who now also function as producers.
In a press meeting with the stars, each accompanied by a full beauty team constantly taking care of makeup touch-ups, hair and wrinkles in clothes, the girls of the family, as well as their new and sought-after producer, insisted that this time it's not about reality TV, this time what is shown on the screen is completely authentic.
"You can't make up what's happening to us," says the family's mother, Kris Jenner, "the chaos is endless."
"We show how much we've grown since that series that aired in 2007," says Khloe Kardashian.
"When we started we were overwhelmed, a lot was happening in our lives and it was impossible to simply confine everything into a narrative of beginning, middle, and end.
Many plots were rushed in editing, wrapped in a shiny colorful ribbon and then forgotten on the side.
This is not how life looks in reality.
Now we are more exposed, directly addressing the camera in a natural way, not just reality but an authentic documentary series".
When you combine this with their new involvement in the production of the series, which essentially gives them complete control over the content that appears on the screen, Khloe claims: "We are involved behind the scenes, watching clips during editing and giving feedback, but not from a controlling place, just to give our opinion on what will make the series better."
This is a reflection of our lives and I personally feel that I have undergone emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they set more boundaries.
"I grew up"
Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, continues to work hard to change her image, from cheap reality trash to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I've matured," she claims, "I'm raising four black children, meaning from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change the reality, so that my children and the children of all my friends will have a different future, in the hope that we can heal the flawed system.
"This is my motivation."
"I'm no longer the same Kim who spends hours thinking about which bikini selfie to post," she insists, "but it also hasn't completely disappeared from my life."
A person must be true to who they really are and take everything in stride.
About the reasons for the producer's dismissal revealed by Ryan Seacrest, their new and very profitable path in the industry, the significance of the transition to Disney, the family's well-oiled PR machine and its impact on the brand's profitability and more, in the full article to be published in "Shishabat" magazine.

Aviv Geffen and Sarit Hadad: Jerusalem's Hutzot Hayotzer Festival with new surprises.
The international festival in the capital, which has become a tradition and will take place at several locations, will feature musical performances by leading local artists, and will incorporate circus performances and innovative and surprising artistic displays.
.
Like every summer over the years, alongside the heat, humidity, and students' boredom, the International Arts and Crafts Festival, 'Hutzot Hayotzer' in Jerusalem also arrives, which has already become a tradition in the capital and will be held at several locations (including Mitchell Park, Sultan's Pool, opposite the Tower of David and at the foot of the walls of the Old City) - between August 15-27.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father.
The winner of "The Next Star" releases a second single and returns to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song is about how to maintain a long-distance relationship," he says.
Tamir Greenberg in his second single called "Into The Night" after winning over the audience with his first single and his participation in "The Next Star".
In recent months, Greenberg continues to perform in many venues: Tel Aviv Culture Hall, Tel Aviv Opera House, Shuni Amphitheater, Ganei Yehoshua Amphitheater, Hangar 11 and dozens of other shows.
The song "Into The Night" was produced and arranged by Greenberg together with the producer Stav Beger.
The clip, directed by Daria Geller, takes Tamir back to his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song talks about the relationship between my father and me.
"About the period when I left the country to the USA and the way to maintain the relationship from a distance," Greenberg says.
In the coming month, Greenberg will perform at the opening ceremony of the Maccabiah in Israel, and ahead of the new season of "The Next Star", the song with which he won the show, Tell Me Where The Light Goes, was chosen as the audition song for the upcoming season.
Blue and white product: Yuval Shamla is the big winner of the season and the 16th ninja in the world.
The phenomenon climbed Mount Midoriyama in 26 seconds and won the title "The first Israeli Ninja".
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but he will not hold the title of Ninja.
The
We have a winner: Yuval Shamla has conquered the Midoriyama, and he is the champion of the fourth season of "Ninja Israel". Now, he holds the title of the first Israeli Ninja and the 16th in the world.
Shamla has been participating in the program since its first season where he finished first, and in the second season he lost to Gil Marentz.
In the third season, he won again and recently returned for the fourth season, during which he announced that this would be his last season.
This evening, he climbed Mount Midoriyama for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, after overcoming competitors Yogev Malka and Yishai Kalphon.
Malcha managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds and finished in second place.
It should be noted that according to the show's rules, only one ninja can be crowned each season who has successfully climbed the Midoriyama in time.
Therefore, despite Malka's impressive achievement, since Yuval, the season's champion, climbed the Midoriyama 3 seconds faster, Malka does not win the world title of Ninja.
He will be able to compete for it again next season.
Okay, we get it, Shmuel is a superhero, Rotem Sela is perfect, and "Ninja Israel" is the most important sports event in the world.
.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sports broadcaster sat in the finale of a reality show and acted as if it was the most significant sporting achievement on the face of the earth.
.
Rotem Sela represents such a perfect feminine ideal for us, that it's distorted to present it like this on television.
She earns more from campaigns than Wonder Woman, she is too beautiful, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when necessary - also to take care of her business partner.
She is a mother and also a career woman who advertises banks and air conditioners, models and leads reality series and programs, and serves as an unattainable role model for young girls.
And perhaps it makes sense that Rotem Sela goes through a too perfect screen, because in the show she hosts, you have to be perfect, and there's no need to apologize for that.
In the world of the ninja, everyone is larger than life, and the leaders first and foremost.
Asi Azar apparently got tangled up in a scandal that was supposed to erase him from the screen for a certain period, but since he is not an ordinary person - he got out of it even before the first commercial break.
Listen to the event's soundtrack: Niv Raskin, who has broadcast live rights to European Cups and World Records in his life, but gets excited about a mega-wall as if it's the most significant sports achievement on the face of the earth.
In the final, two Olympic medalists (Jordan Jervi and Linoy Ashram) sat next to him as commentators, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the conditions for entering the superhuman world that this reality show has been presenting for four seasons.
"Israeli Ninja" went out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with the Midoriyama mountain and with Yuval Shamla who managed to climb it in 26 seconds and was finally crowned as the Ninja.
For this, he led an almost impassable path, which sequentially knocked down all the superhuman characters that the program had inflated their ego throughout the year.
Do you want to be a ninja squirrel?
Not with us.
Here, they are looking for superheroes.
The emphasis was on finding a successor to fill the role of the one called "King of Kings and one of a kind", and other titles meant to clarify how perfect and unique he is.
As a result, the level of difficulty was raised, the girls who tried to cope in the season's courses crashed, and the boys competed among themselves for who has more abs and charisma of a dictator to fill the shoes of the retiring bachelor.
They might say it's a sports program that encourages physical activity and overcoming challenges, but for the vast majority of viewers - average couch potatoes like us - "Ninja Israel" cultivates an unattainable sports-achievement model for us.
Faster, stronger, higher, more perfect.
When Gil Sassover oscillates between punches and talks about holiness.
It's strange to see the comedian, a former "Comedy Store" performer, hosting a "Friday Night Reception" program on Channel 14, where he tastes dishes and mainly gives a platform to men.
If we play an association game, we would all have similar answers to the question "What does the term 'preparation for Shabbat' remind you of?".
Say: Sponge and cleanliness, pots on the gas and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi Kakhon on TV, but the weirdest thing would be if someone suddenly says "Gil Sassover".
Because Sesober's age is in the middle of the sponge and the cooking is the least related thing that television can offer.
Indeed, "Kabbalat Shabbat", the new show he hosts on Friday afternoon on Channel 14, is disconnected in its spirit from the time it is broadcasted.
Halfway along it - a sycamore stands.
He speaks quickly, holds a microphone even when he's tasting dishes, and tries to balance the dosage between punchlines and talks about holiness.
In his defense, it should be said that the budget constraints are noticeable, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also noticeable in the debut program, which was broadcast the other day from Matan in Binyamin, was a clear gender division.
The men sing, play music, dance, discuss Torah, promote restaurants and factories - while the women were content with a small item, in which they excitedly talked about managing a sewing shop.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Celebrating Shabbat with Gil Sasover, now 14.
The Protected Housing Association against Ruthi Russo: "Saying 'it has a taste of protected housing' harms our activity."
The chairwoman, Yuli Gat, sent a letter expressing the union's complaint against an allegedly offensive remark made by a judge of "The Next Restaurant" in one of the program's trailers.
Ruthie Russo in response: "I'm glad there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population."
The Association of Nursing Homes and Sheltered Housing in Israel against "The Next Restaurant": In a letter sent by the chairwoman Yuli Gat and received by "Israel Today", it was written: "In the promo before the broadcast, which was distributed on all social networks and on television, it was described that the professional judge of the competition said 'the food tastes like sheltered housing', meaning food from a closed institution with low-quality food."
"The tone chosen by the show's judge, Ruti Russo, to express her disappointment with the food the contestant served, instantly negates our years-long efforts to fight against the ignorance in the field. This is because the protected housing facilities operate restaurants in the various homes for the benefit of the residents, with chef meals at the highest level."
It was also written: "The service teams and home managers are fighting for the image of the protected housing that offers solutions for quality housing for the elderly, including reducing loneliness, abundant leisure activities, high standard of living and more."
In recent years in Israel, more and more families and elderly people understand that loneliness is the hardest disease in old age and see community centers as a proven solution to the disease.
"Food is one of the greatest pleasures in life, and therefore we dedicate resources and efforts to serve our residents the finest food.
Most protected housing facilities use professional chefs to create a menu.
We would be happy at any time to invite the judging team to be impressed by the winning dishes served daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel, and on behalf of the chefs and restaurant teams in the protected housing, we ask for your apology and clarification.
Let's come together, the media and Israeli society, to promote community housing for the health of the elderly.
Ruthie Russo responded: "I'm glad that there are places that invest more in the culinary of this population, which definitely deserves excellent food in the advanced stage of life."
I respect the hard work of butchers, female butchers, female chefs and chefs everywhere, even in protected housing.
"Double standard: You cancel a show in Russia but not in Israel?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism.
The singer responded to criticism leveled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards.
The singer responded: "The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."
"
Earlier this week, Nick Cave cancelled a performance in Russia due to the war and announced that he "stands with Ukraine and prays that the madness will end soon."
In doing so, the esteemed Australian singer joined artists and bands like Iggy Pop, Green Day, and Franz Ferdinand, who also cancelled performances in the invading country.
But in the case of Kiev, his cancellation notice took a slightly different turn.
A Turkish fan named Ahmet accused the singer of being hypocritical, as in 2017 Kiev refused to cancel two performances that took place in Israel, despite the heavy criticism he received from pro-Palestinian organizations.
During his visit to the country, Kaye told the local media: "Ultimately, I am here for two reasons: the first reason is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second reason is that I am against anyone who tries to censor and silence musicians."
The same Achmat vividly remembered Kiev's statements in favor of music and against politicization.
The fan even published on the singer's personal and uncensored website, "The Red Hand Files", a pointed post in which he claimed that Israel is also an occupying country, therefore Palestine's situation is identical to Ukraine's.
"What bothers me about your statement on Ukraine," wrote Achmet, "is that you didn't similarly support the Palestinians, who are also suffering from a brutal regime."
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but in my opinion, Israel is primarily the party responsible for the Palestinian suffering.
"It saddens me a lot, because you represent a double standard here," concluded the Turkish fan.
But the story doesn't end here, as Kyiv chose to respond to Achmat with a long and detailed letter, emphasizing that "Russia's invasion of Ukraine is very different from the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.
The first scenario is an unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbor, in the hope of changing the entire security order of Europe.
The second situation is a complex conflict between two nations.
The conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel a lot of sympathy for all these communities - no matter where they are and who they are.
Kyiv added that although he does not want to detail his views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he certainly also supports the Palestinians, and noted that he has participated in many fundraising events for them over the past 20 years.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Achmat," clarified the singer, "It's a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, as a catastrophe is currently happening on their land."
I have great fans in Russia, and I know that many Russians strongly oppose Putin's regime actions.
"If I could play for them - I would do it."
In light of the decrease in morbidity: The Corona Projector will return to manage Ziv Hospital.
Prof. Salman Zarka was appointed to his position in July 2021 and led the policy for handling COVID-19 during the third and fourth waves.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as a projector in parallel.
Prof. Zarka: "Glad that the Omicron wave continues to decline, but we still have a duty to prepare for another wave."
.
Against the backdrop of the decline in coronavirus morbidity, the coronavirus project manager, Prof. Salman Zarka, will return to manage Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as a projector.
"I am happy for the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to decline and that we have got our normal life back," said Prof. Zarka, adding: "We still have a duty to prepare for another wave of illness as a result of the virus still being here, in Israel and around the world."
Prof. Zarka was appointed to his position in July 2021 and led the policy for handling COVID-19 during the third and fourth waves.
Starting from May 1st, Israel has returned to a "between waves" state, which includes a maximum reduction of the Corona systems, while maintaining the ability to perform continuous tests and investigations, which will be the basis for action in case a new variant is detected.
Latent disease
In the report of the National Knowledge and Information Center for the Corona System, published this morning, it was noted that "there is a decrease in the average of new confirmed cases to below two thousand per day, in the weekly average, alongside a decrease in the number of hospitalized and severely ill patients."
However, they emphasized that "there is a significant amount of hidden morbidity and in reality, the number of infected people is much higher.
The number of institutional tests conducted in the community (excluding tests for returnees from abroad, etc.) is low, standing at less than 20,000 average weekly tests only.
The low volume of tests makes it difficult to identify disease trends and understand them.
State Comptroller's report: The actual budget for most years of the Drug Basket Committee's activity - is less than the recommended budget.
According to Netanyahu Engelman's report, for over 20 years of the basket's activity - the Ministry of Health did not supervise the committee's activity.
The report also states that the meeting protocols are published significantly late, if at all.
Also, the reviewer recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activities - and updating the basket's work procedures.
Another deficiency found relates to the fact that since the committee began its work, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds to report on the extent of use and utilization of the drugs in the basket - which would have allowed to analyze and control the budget given to them.
The Drug Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and our health.
Every year, the committee decides on new medications that will be provided to the public free of charge through the health funds - but a new report by the State Comptroller published today (Tuesday) warns that it has been operating for over 20 years without any control reports on its activity and without the Ministry of Health and the Health Council supervising and examining its activity.
"Israel Today" writer, Ran Reznik, adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing exposures in "Israel Today" about the failures of the drug basket.
According to Netanyahu Engelman's report, he recommends "to make amendments and improvements in the process of expanding the health services basket, which will lead to a better utilization of the health services budget that the public is entitled to."
Throughout the existence of the drug basket addition mechanism, from 1998 to 2021, drugs worth eight billion shekels were added to the state budget - with the addition varying each year in amounts ranging from 0 to 500 million shekels.
In the years 2019, 2020 and 2021, requests were submitted to add about 800 new drugs and technologies to the health services basket, with a total annual cost of more than two billion shekels.
In practice, the budget allocated for the expansion of the basket was smaller than the volume of requests.
During most of the committee's operation years (90% of the time), the increase in the budget was less than 1.5% of the health basket, a rate recommended by various committees as the desired increase rate.
The reviewer suggests that there is a need to examine and regulate the annual increase in order to allow certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that "the transparency model in the basket's work is lacking".
For example, the work procedure of the Basket Committee stipulates that the minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, should be published within 60 days, but in practice, the minutes are published with a delay of 109-160 days, and sometimes the final meeting minutes are not published at all.
"The delay in publishing the protocols harms the transparency of the decisions; as a result, the ability of the proposal submitters - patient organizations and pharmaceutical companies - to submit repeat requests as soon as possible and relevantly may be impaired, after they have learned from the rejection of their proposals, analyzed the reasons for their failure in the previous round, improved and corrected their proposals and conducted a renewed assessment of the likelihood of their acceptance in the next round," the auditor stated in the report.
"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols according to the schedules set in the procedure."
Out of thousands of submissions - only one economic comment was submitted.
Another criticism by Engelman relates to the preliminary process of evaluating the technologies proposed for the drug basket.
The reviewer found that nearly half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the Ministry of Health does not publish the reasons for rejection.
Another deficiency relates to the subcommittee's activity on the drug basket, which is closed to the media and the public, and where the number of patients and the cost of drugs are discussed.
The reviewer recommends adding a public representative or examining the possibility of publishing the discussions to the public without private commercial details.
According to the procedure by which the Health Services Basket Committee operates, it is determined that "an economic assessment" must be submitted for a request to add a drug to the basket.
But in practice, over the years, only one economic assessment has been submitted out of thousands of submissions - and the committee makes its decisions without an economic assessment.
For example, for the 2019-2021 basket committee discussions, requests were submitted to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report revealed that economic assessments were not attached to the requests, including an estimate of the amount that could be saved by reducing damage from diseases caused by obesity or the ability to avoid gastric bypass surgeries.
It also appears that the decisions of the Drug Basket Committee do not align with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
For example, in 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparation for treating the increase in chronic diseases as goals, but in the decisions regarding the expansion of the health basket, no emphasis was placed on the need to achieve these goals.
The auditor also warns that since 2011, services that are not the responsibility of the health funds, including rehabilitation and mobility devices and various vaccines, provided by the Ministry of Health ("the third supplement"), have been included in the drug basket.
This, when the legal framework for this step is only arranged retrospectively.
In the last six years, 74 million shekels from the addition to the drug basket have been used for these services.
Engelman recommends the Ministry of Health to update the basket work procedures and also to determine whether there is a need for a separate financial supplement for these services.
A third of the new drugs added to the medicine basket are defined as "no additional cost drugs", which do not cost the health funds any additional amount because they replace an existing treatment.
The reviewer suggests examining the possibility that these drugs will be handled in a different and shorter track, so that the drug basket can be updated several times a year and not just once a year.
There is no supervision over the use of particularly expensive drugs.
The review also reveals that since the Basket Committee began its work 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked the health funds to report and has not supervised the extent of the use and utilization of the drugs in the basket, information that could have allowed the ministry to analyze and control the budget given to the funds.
Over the years, only two reports have been published that refer to the years 2006-2009, and even these were published with a noticeable delay (the last one was published this year and dealt with the budget utilization in the years 2007-2009).
"The delay in conducting tests may lead to difficulties in data collection and analysis, irrelevance of the conclusions drawn from the test after such a long period, suboptimal pricing of the subcommittee, and decisions based on preliminary findings," the report states.
Also, the office does not monitor and supervise the use of particularly expensive drugs and has not conducted a lesson learning process.
We are talking about 10 drugs that constituted 62% of the addition to the basket (1.7 billion shekels in the years 2021-2016).
Regarding this, the critic wrote: "It is recommended that the Ministry of Health conduct private inspections on these drugs and technologies and analyze the extent of their use compared to the estimates.
Audits and analysis will allow systemic conclusions to be drawn about the work process of the Basket Committee and the subcommittee, and about the method of preparing estimates when pricing drugs and technologies, and to improve them.
"Shocking and inconceivable": A heated debate in the Health Committee about the poisoning at Dafna's house.
The vital signs of the first patient who passed away were normal ten minutes before her death.
The committee chairman, MK Silman: "If people there cared that the kitchen would be like at home - it wouldn't look like this."
Ten minutes before the first victim, a 40-year-old woman from "Beit Dafna" in Holon, died from food poisoning, her medical measurements were taken and were normal, claimed the director of the institution today (Tuesday) at a health committee meeting.
"We have night caregivers who check during the night and a nurse who does rounds."
There were several reports of diarrhea and the last time the tenant had her vitals taken was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and they were normal.
She was tracking like the rest of the hikers with diarrhea.
She is under nursing care, we went to get a stretcher to assist with her transfer and then that tenant did not respond.
"We started resuscitation and called the nursing sister," described the home manager about what happened last Sunday morning at the home.
This is an event in which three residents died, six were hospitalized, and in total about a quarter of the home's residents (33 out of 131) suffered from diarrhea after eating contaminated meat.
The dormitory manager said these things against the backdrop of claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and lack of supervision by the caregivers.
Dr. Naama Nos, the epidemiologist in charge at the Tel Aviv Health Bureau, stated that "we cannot definitively determine what caused the three soldiers to pass away."
Only blood tests were taken from them.
It was also discussed that it was no longer possible to collect stool samples from the residents who were hospitalized because they did not defecate, therefore it was impossible to definitively determine the cause of death and illness.
The engineer from the Ministry of Health also noted that "The Ministry of Health checks the sanitary conditions in the kitchens of institutions once every four years at the request of the Ministry of Welfare or for the renewal of a license."
The Welfare Ministry admitted that an investigation committee has not yet been appointed for this case and for a previous case of abuse in shelters that occurred three months ago at the "Bnei Zion" institution in Sharon.
The Chair of the Health Committee, MK Idit Silman, said during the discussion: "If people cared that the kitchen would be like at home - it wouldn't look like this.
The residents in the welfare homes need more.
They are health sensitive and require extra supervision and care.
It's shocking and unbelievable what happened there.
The horrific findings were discovered only after they knew that the Ministry of Health was coming to inspect.
Where is the supervision and responsibility of the ministries?
How come the ministers and the directors of the departments are not present in such a discussion to provide an explanation about what is happening here?
Yigal Nachtomi, the CEO of Beit Eckstein who manages the home and even ran the home himself said "Hundreds and thousands of people in the entire system wake up with only one goal: to do good for people."
The people who passed away are people I personally cared for.
I put one of the tenants to sleep in my arms.
"It's a moving event for us."
Smadar Ona, a former resident of the same home at her age, burst out at him and said, "Enough with the lies and the pretty words."
"I was there."
Gali Barami, representative of the parents at Akim Israel: "We have complained about the food in the past and they did not accept the criticism."
Oren Helman, the founder of the Equal Chance initiative for integrating people with disabilities, protested that the names of the deceased victims were not published: "Their names are not known at all."
Are they worth less?
They belittle our children's lives".
Suspected negligence at Wolfson: The surgeon caused a tear in the heart - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure that Dr. Firas Abu Akar performed as the head of the chest surgery unit at the hospital.
The chairman of the doctors' committee complained that the director, Dr. Engel, was warned before his appointment.
In the hospital: "He is valued and experienced."
First published: A horrifying mistake occurred at the government hospital Wolfson in Holon, when during surgery the doctor caused a tear in the patient's heart, which led to his tragic death.
The surgery on the 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19th.
This was the first surgery performed by Dr. Firas Abu Akar at the hospital, after being appointed as the head of the chest surgery unit at Wolfson.
During the surgery, which was intended to drain the area surrounding the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a large tear in the heart, leading to severe bleeding and resulting in the patient's death.
But the exceptional complication opened a Pandora's box, raising difficult questions about the hospital's management.
The director of the Oncology Institute and the chairman of the doctors' committee, Dr. Ronen Berner, demanded an investigation into the affair in a letter he sent to the hospital director, Dr. Anat Engel.
In the letter, he raised the most serious allegations about the conduct of Dr. Engel and the appointment of Dr. Abu Akar, this after the previous unit manager, Dr. Biny Zukerman, moved to Sheba Medical Center at Tel Hashomer.
A giant hole in the heart.
According to Dr. Berner's letter, the patient was lucid, functioning and treated by him in the last four years.
Recently, his disease has progressed, and an abnormal accumulation of fluids was discovered inside the pericardium, which contains the heart muscle.
Also, the surgeon Dr. Abu Akar, was under the impression that he could perform the surgery.
According to the complaint, a serious malfunction occurred during the surgery, and Dr. Hagai Dekel, head of the heart and chest surgery department at Wolfson, who was at the same time operating on a child in the adjacent room, "was hastily called to the operating table and saw a huge hole in the heart."
According to him, the heart was emptied of blood, the blood pressure was zero, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Berner reported that Dr. Dekel approached him and said that Dr. Abu Akar is not professionally and personally suitable to manage the chest surgery unit at Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings and even though he was supposed to be the direct manager of the breast surgeon, Dr. Engel conducted a tender without involving him and appointed Dr. Abu Akar to the position.
He further noted: "It's a not complicated process that takes a few minutes," and added: "One cannot ignore the flawed process of Dr. Abu Akar's appointment to the position.
The question arises whether there is a direct responsibility of the surgeon for the failure of the surgery and the death of the patient.
Experienced surgeon.
In front of "Israel Today", information and claims from other senior doctors were raised that reinforce the questions raised by Dr. Ronen Barner in the case.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, head of Surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Berner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is "one of the most experienced surgeons in the country, but relatively young as a chest surgeon."
He added that he was chosen in a proper tender and Dr. Dekel did not participate in it, according to his statements about his desire to "disconnect" from the chest unit.
He also noted: "I was not part of the process either, and perhaps I should have been.
Dr. Shimonov wrote that Dr. Fras Abu Akar started working on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of grace, "All the hospital doctors were impressed by his professionalism and his motivation and willingness to work.
He has already performed dozens of similar procedures, and unfortunately, the current case ended in a tragic way.
From Wolfson Hospital, it was responded: "We share the family's grief."
This is a patient of the oncologist Dr. Ronen Berner.
The chest surgeon mentioned in the article is a highly regarded and experienced surgeon, who was selected through a tender to manage the chest surgery unit affiliated with the surgery department at Wolfson Hospital.
According to Dr. Hagi Dekel, his quoted words are not accurate and were taken out of context.
It should be noted that unfortunately, the patient was in a very difficult condition.
The hospital is examining the case details transparently, and the Ministry of Health is aware of the case details.

A model for healing: Three senior doctors talk about their mentors.
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Prof. Marvin Shapiro, especially during the pandemic.
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh does not forget, even from his high position, the push from the late Prof. Saul Sokenik.
And Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev acknowledges Dr. Tomy Shinfield for the lesson in identifying with the patients.
Three key figures in hospitals write about those who inspired them and encouraged them to be better, both as caregivers and as human beings.
Three senior doctors, three life and profession teachers: On the occasion of Israeli Doctor's Day, "Israel Today" invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Codish and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to recall the figures who accompanied them at the beginning of their journey - and helped them become who they are today.
Prof. Galia Rahav, head of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba.
In memory of Prof. Marvin Shapiro.
The encounter that opened my eyes - and changed my life.
If I hadn't met Prof. Marvin Shapira, who was the head of the infectious diseases unit at Hadassah Hospital, I would probably have remained a specialist in internal medicine.
He is the one who made me love the field of infectious diseases and influenced me to pursue it.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, back in the 80s of the last century.
I never thought for a moment that I would leave internal medicine, as I loved treating the patient himself; but Prof. Shapira showed me that the field of infectious diseases is also expressed in neurology, internal medicine, and essentially in every area.
I thank him for bringing me into this field.
All along the way, I loved his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor in every fiber of his being, who loved his patients and taught me not to take anything for granted from them and to thoroughly examine everything.
He was a genuine and honest person, devoid of ego, qualities that I greatly admired in him.
At first, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me and influenced me more than anyone else, I intended to choose my father, Dr. Yosef Rakover, a Holocaust survivor who served as a doctor in a partisan unit.
He was an amazing doctor, who influenced me to go into medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shpira.
Both of them, for example, coined aphorisms that doctors still use today - such as "tissue is the issue", meaning, taking a biopsy of tissue from the affected organ allows to know which drugs should be given; or "when you use it, you lose it", which is meant to explain that overuse of antibiotics leads to bacteria becoming resistant to it.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked at Hadassah and was the father of two daughters.
He passed away about a year ago, and when I visited his family during the shiva, I cried.
He was something - a sharp and smart epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his severe illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the team to treat epidemics, and he is greatly missed during this time.
If he was with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted with him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the team leaders in dealing with pandemics.

Dr. Shlomi Codish, director of Soroka Hospital.
About the late Prof. Shaul Sokenik.
A teacher and friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors.
.
I first met Prof. Saul Sockenik, of blessed memory, when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I came to do a rotation in internal medicine in the Internal Medicine D department that he managed.
Later, I returned to the department for a rotation in my sixth year, and I did my final project for medical school under his guidance, writing a computer simulation for a patient with polyarthritis (inflammation in multiple joints).
Saul has influenced every significant crossroad in my professional life over 20 years, and he was the most significant person in shaping my character as a doctor; not only professionally, but also - and mainly - personally and humanly.
During the internship, I was torn between family medicine and internal medicine, and I consulted with him about choosing the specialty.
Eventually, I chose to specialize in internal medicine at Soroka.
During my specialization, he provided me with constant guidance, in various aspects - in scientific writing (sorry Saul, I didn't persist enough), in dealing with patients, in working in a multi-professional team - an area in which the department excelled - and in fact, in every aspect related to medicine.
To this day, I identify in myself, as a doctor and a manager, characteristics that come from Saul.
When I finished my specialization and was unsure whether to go abroad for further training, Shaul pushed and guided me, and helped me with recommendation letters and advice on how to proceed.
The training period was a very important time for my professional development, and without Shaul's support and encouragement, I'm not sure it would have happened.
Upon my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital management, again Saul was the one who supported and assisted.
Later on, we went through complex periods together in the internal medicine department.
Saul knew how to wonderfully combine the roles of teacher, manager, friend, and team member, without any of his roles interfering with each other.
I aspire to succeed like him in this special combination.
He nurtured generations of students, interns, and specialists, who are now spread throughout the medical system in Israel, and their excellent work commemorates his memory and actions.
It is an honor for me to be appointed with this group.

Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev, Director of Schneider Children's Medical Center.
About Dr. Tommy Shinfield
The man who taught me medicine, and mainly listening.
Dr. Tommy Shinfield, the founder and former director of the Intensive Care Unit at Schneider Children's Medical Center, taught me to be an intensive care physician, but more than that - he taught me to think.
The inherent lesson I learned from him is to care for the most complex, the sickest children.
The children, who were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The implicit meaning is to have very difficult, perhaps the most difficult, conversations with families who never imagined they would find themselves in these complex situations in the intensive care unit with their children.
It sounds strange, but it's self-explanatory.
But I learned even more significant and profound things from him.
Looking back, as a doctor who is a manager and a manager who is a doctor, I now clearly see the connection between the two worlds; the education I received from Dr. Shinfield bridges them.
Dr. Shinfield taught me to listen attentively to many things: to listen to the children, to the monitor, to the caring nurses, to both the young and old care teams, and to the parents.
All of this needs to be done not only to communicate more correctly and successfully, but also to constantly gather a lot of information that can prevent the next deterioration.
The preventive processes in treating children exist everywhere, and of course also in intensive care.
Listening and conversation foster a deeper understanding, both from the treatment team and from the patients and their families.
My understanding today as a manager is that these insights are also correct when looking at a whole system.
The more in-depth and meticulous understanding that involves all the caregivers in the conversation, the more accurate, situation-appropriate, and primarily, the decision-making process will be timely in order to prevent future, immediate or distant damages.
That's why Dr. Tommy Weinfeld is much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He is a person who taught me a lot about medicine, but mainly taught me to think quickly and accurately, to listen - and then to implement.

Medical negligence at different stages of birth.
In order to win compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that the damage was caused by that negligence.
Birth is one of the most joyful and exciting events in a family's life.
However, unfortunately, sometimes births end in severe damages caused to the mother or the newborn as a result of the medical team's negligence.
In cases where the birth resulted in physical harm to the newborn or the mother, it is appropriate to examine the sequence of events that led to the injury and even consider seeking legal advice.
A lawyer specializing in medical negligence will examine whether there were flaws in the medical team's conduct during the various stages of birth that caused damage, and if deemed necessary, will consult with a medical expert in the relevant field.
It should be emphasized that not every mistake in treatment by the medical team amounts to negligence (in the legal sense of the term) and that various complications during childbirth do not necessarily indicate that it was negligently managed.
When is it considered negligence?
When the doctor's mistake stemmed from a lack of skill or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, and the lack of skill and deviation from the accepted level of caution caused harm to the patient that would not have occurred had the doctor not acted in such a way.
In this article, we will examine the different stages of birth, explain the complications that may occur in each stage and when they amount to medical negligence.
The stage of axes.
The labor stage lasts on average between 8 to 14 hours.
At this stage, the cervix gradually opens (to allow the passage of the fetus during birth) and at the end of the process, it should reach a diameter of about ten centimeters.
Most cases of medical negligence during labor involve failure to identify fetal distress leading up to birth, which sometimes results in brain damage to the newborn.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Brain damage may occur as a result of failure to identify or delay in identifying sub-birth asphyxia, which is manifested by a failure in oxygen supply to the fetus's brain tissue.
Generally, monitoring the condition of the mother and correctly interpreting the monitor that tracks the fetal heart activity should lead to early identification of fetal distress, allowing the medical team to act quickly and deliver the baby before irreversible damage occurs.
Cases where the medical team ignores signs that the fetus is suffering from oxygen deficiency, or the team does not correctly interpret the data in front of them, particularly the fetal monitor, or responds late to the distress shown on the monitor - may constitute negligence.
Brain damage can also be caused as a result of umbilical cord prolapse and also as a result of an undetected uterine rupture.
Even in these difficult events, it is appropriate to investigate whether the medical team acted properly.
For example, Attorney Anna Reich Ligenza, from the Kaspie Seror & Co. law firm that specializes in representing victims of medical negligence, tells that her office handled a lawsuit of a child who was injured during his birth after the midwife ruptured the amniotic sac when the baby's head was too high, causing the umbilical cord to descend (when the umbilical cord precedes the baby's head) and damage to the oxygen supply to the baby's brain (as a result of the pressure of the baby's head on the umbilical cord), resulting in him being born with severe neurological damage.
In another case, the lawyer reported that her office filed a lawsuit due to severe medical negligence by a maternity ward team in a large hospital, which during the birth did not identify in time clear signs that the birthing woman was suffering from a tear in the uterus in the area of the surgical scar from her previous pregnancy.
The fetus, which escaped through a tear in its mother's womb into the abdominal cavity, suffered from severe fetal distress until it was rescued at a late stage when it was on the verge of death.
Due to the severe distress during his birth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
We emphasize that in order to be entitled to compensation, the plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal link between the medical team's negligence that led to the failure to identify the complication and the damage caused to the newborn, meaning that the damage was caused due to the aforementioned negligence and not from any other reason or factor.
The examination of the causal link will be conducted by examining medical indices that, according to the medical literature, only when they occur there is a causal link between the asphyxiation and the brain injury.
Among other things, the fetus's blood acidity level, his Apgar scores, the presence of neurological and systemic injury, and more are examined.
The death of the fetus.
The active labor stage.
The active stage of labor begins when the cervix dilates to a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends with the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most of the medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Birth asphyxia and avoidance of performing a cesarean section.
In certain cases, a dysfunctional labor develops, meaning, a lack of progress in the active birth process.
In such cases, it is common to perform a cesarean section, in order to prevent various damages that might be caused to the fetus due to the delay in birth.
"There are cases where not performing a cesarean section on time could cause irreversible damage to the fetus," explained attorney Reif-Ligenza to us.
"For example, we handled a medical negligence lawsuit of a stillbirth caused by a significant delay in performing a cesarean section."
Contrary to all recognized medical practice, the medical team failed to identify the fetal distress and perform a cesarean section despite the particularly slow progress of the birth.
The delay in performing the surgery caused systemic damage to the mother, which eventually led to her death shortly after giving birth.
Negligence in childbirth and vacuum.
In situations where there is a significant risk to the mother or fetus that requires a particularly rapid end to the birth, a vacuum delivery (empty extractor) is sometimes performed.
In this process, a "cap" is attached to the fetus's head using a vacuum and the fetus is then pulled out with force.
Naturally, this action involves risks and may cause harm to both the passer and the birther, therefore it requires caution, precision and great skill.
In these events, medical negligence may be expressed in the doctor not adhering to mandatory guidelines and performing the procedure despite the existence of a contraindication, such as when the baby's head is too high in the pelvis, or performing it for a longer time than allowed, or when despite several failed attempts, the doctor continues and repeats the procedure more than the allowed number of attempts.
In these cases, if the negligent vacuum procedure caused damage - among other things, it could cause cranial damage and bleeding that could lead to brain damage - there is room for filing a lawsuit.
Silencing in the name of ERB.
Erb's palsy, a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (the nerve junction connecting the spine to the upper part of the shoulder), when it occurs during birth, it is appropriate to check whether the damage was caused by negligence of the delivery team.
The injury manifests as weakness in the arm muscles and can lead to complete paralysis of the entire arm.
This silence is often caused by difficulty in delivering the baby due to 'shoulder dystocia' - an obstetric emergency that occurs when the baby's shoulders get stuck in the birth canal after its head has come out.
When should you suspect that the silence was caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the fetus's weight assessment indicated that it is macrosomic, meaning it is expected to be born weighing more than 4.5 kilograms, it is preferable according to guidelines to deliver the mother by cesarean section.
When the fetus weighs more than 4 kilograms, a cesarean section should be considered due to risk factors including gestational diabetes and the prolongation of the second stage of labor.
In the case that the medical team ignores the abnormal weight assessment of the fetus or other risk factors and chooses to proceed with vaginal birth, and the risk of shoulder dystocia and ERB's palsy occurs, there is a reasonable possibility that this is medical negligence.
Indeed, in case number 2694/90, the Supreme Court ruled that "the risk of shoulder dystocia during childbirth can be predicted with some degree of accuracy, and the way to prevent shoulder dystocia, where there is a risk of its occurrence, is to perform a cesarean section".
The stage of the placenta's expulsion.
The separation of the placenta from the uterus and its expulsion occurs due to the contraction of the uterus after the birth of the baby and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process usually lasts up to half an hour from the moment the baby is born and according to many, it happens spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.
After the placenta is delivered, the medical team will check if it came out completely or if parts of it remained in the uterus.
During this stage, complications may occur that could cause serious harm to the mother.
One of the known complications resulting from the retention of placental remnants in the uterus is called "Asherman's syndrome", a scarring of the uterine wall caused by inflammation due to the retention of placental remnants in the uterus, a phenomenon that damages the uterine lining in a way that prevents pregnancy implantation.
Therefore, in cases where the medical team did not identify that placental remnants were left or did not take all measures to prevent damage to the uterine wall despite suspicion of placental remnants in the uterus, it may be a case of medical negligence and the case should be thoroughly examined by an experienced attorney in the field.
The death of the mother.
The death of a mother during childbirth is a rather rare event.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring joy and happiness to the entire family, unfortunately, turns into the most tragic event for them.
In certain cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the woman giving birth on time or responds late to such bleeding.
"For example...", Attorney Reich-Ligensa told us, "our office filed a lawsuit concerning the death of a mother during childbirth, where in that case the medical team ignored and did not respond to the alarming vital signs of the mother for many hours, and was late in diagnosing a massive and uncontrollable bleeding that occurred as a known complication of the underlying disease she suffered from."
"In another case...", attorney Reich-Ligenza reported, "our office represented the relatives of a woman who passed away after giving birth to twins due to bleeding that originated from a cesarean section incision that was not properly stitched."
In that case, the woman who gave birth complained about severe pain and weakness after the surgery, but the medical team did not properly address her complaints and her clinical condition, only responding with delay after her body systems began to collapse, which led to her death.
Loss of a uterus.
In severe cases, medical negligence during childbirth may lead to a hysterectomy, says attorney Reif Lingza: "Our office filed a lawsuit against a hospital based on a hysterectomy due to medical negligence after childbirth."
In that case, the mother, a young woman of 31, lost her uterus due to inadequate treatment of massive bleeding observed by the medical team after the birth, and yet timely actions that could have prevented the damage were not taken.
What are the compensations awarded in lawsuits for medical negligence during childbirth?
Compensation for birth injury due to medical negligence includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts given for pain and suffering, nursing and treatment costs, loss of earnings and pension for the victim and even for his parents, and additional damage components.
The compensation awarded to a minor victim for loss of earnings and pension is calculated in most cases based on the average wage in the economy.
Also, the compensation includes medical expenses, the cost of medical and rehabilitation equipment, the cost of adapting housing to the baby's needs, mobility, and more.
"The compensation amount is determined in each case individually and according to its circumstances," says attorney Reif-Ligenza, adding that "today, most medical negligence claims end in a compromise that balances the chance and risk each party has in conducting the process." However, she added and noted that "there are cases where the process only ends with a verdict, then if the claim is not dismissed, the plaintiffs will receive full compensation for all their damages. For example, in a case handled by our office, the District Court awarded a minor who suffered brain damage due to a delay in identifying a transient ischemic attack, a compensation exceeding ten million shekels."
In conclusion
Medical negligence during childbirth is undoubtedly every family's nightmare.
In these cases, a correct legal examination of the chain of events that led to the tragic outcome, by a lawyer skilled in managing medical negligence claims, can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of the eye disease Keratoconus in the south.
The research revealed that there is a connection between the development of the disease and close relatives.
The highest prevalence was found in the Bedouin sector.
Expert: "In any sector with many marriages between relatives, there may be a high prevalence of disease."
Keratoconus is a hereditary eye disease that causes several vision impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it as soon as possible, and to find the right solutions to prevent the situation from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted that help understand how the disease develops, and innovative treatments have been developed.
The new studies provide research basis for the suspicion that the eye disease Keratoconus is a genetic disease.
Recent research, which focused on the transformation of the cornea from a dome to a cone, revealed that the disease and weakness of the cornea and the distortion of its shape are related to an enzymatic imbalance, which can lead to free radicals damaging the proteins in the cornea - and its structure will change.
The lack of those enzymes is genetic, a fact that strengthens the assumption that keratoconus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariela Gordon-Shaag, head of the Optometry Department at Hadassah Academic College, "In a study published among Arab students in Haifa, a prevalence of keratoconus was found to be 3.2%."
The highest prevalence was among Bedouin students - 20% had keratoconus, but the sample size was relatively small.
The researcher added that this is not a surprising finding: "There is a high prevalence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our research, we found that close marriages are a risk factor for keratoconus disease.
Thus, in any sector with many cousin marriages, there may be a high prevalence.
In this context, it should be noted that this is an important finding given the unequivocal conclusion: in cases where there is a family history of keratoconus disease, all family members should undergo appropriate eye examination as soon as possible.
According to Erezah Fruchter, a clinical optometrist B.Sc, "There is a tenfold increase in referrals to the clinic from remote peripheral areas, mainly from the south, compared to the center."
Proctor adds that "In the last decade, I noticed that most of the patients come from the periphery, especially from the Be'er Sheva area."
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriages within the family (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies, and a lack of awareness of the proper treatment of the problem.
So how is the disease diagnosed?
Proctor explains that keratoconus usually develops during adolescence or in the late teens (ages 15-16 or 20).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, along with an increase in cylinder.
People with keratoconus report distorted and/or blurred vision of figures and objects.
These symptoms worsen with the progression of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over the years.
However, the disease can also progress rapidly and reach its peak within just a few months.
Many of the patients even report increased sensitivity to light.
Three years after the operation in Gaza - the IDF revealed the name of Sgt. M'; Bennett: "Now, the people know the face of an Israeli hero."
Mahmoud Khair al-Din from the village of Hurfeish is a deputy general who was killed in the operation in Khan Yunis.
The head of AMAN: "The publicity is deserved, for him, his family and his children".
Later on, the possibility of publishing the picture of Staff Sergeant Emanuel Moreno from the Sayeret Matkal will be examined.
Three and a half years after the operation that went wrong in Khan Yunis, the IDF today allows the publication that the one killed in the operation, Sgt. M', is Sgt. Mahmoud Khair al-Din of blessed memory from the village of Hurfeish in the north.
He was 41 at the time of his death.
Prime Minister Bennett said after the publication: "Three and a half years have passed since Brigadier General Mahmoud Hir Al-Din fell in battle during a secret operation in Khan Yunis, and only now are we allowed to reveal his name and thank him for his contribution and dedication to the security of the state."
"Mahmoud, may his memory be a blessing, was a fighter in the Paratroopers Brigade and later rose through the ranks of the army to become a Major General in the IDF's special operations division.
An Israeli hero who was posthumously awarded the Chief of Staff's citation.
He also said: "I eulogized him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, his name and the face of an Israeli hero, Major General Mahmoud Hir Al-Din, openly.
The environment turned its eyes towards him.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned the publication of his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion held by the head of the Intelligence Division, Major General Aharon Haliva, with representatives of the military censorship, and with the consent of his family, it was decided to publish his name and picture.
Mahmoud Khair Eddin, an Israeli hero, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Hurfeish in the Upper Galilee, the eldest son of his parents Ahmad and Nazira, and he has seven brothers and sisters.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nahed and a father of two sons.
He served as an officer, fighter and commander in the special operations system in the intelligence wing.
Throughout his life, Ch'ir a-Din was a social leader, and the community looked up to him.
Until ninth grade, he studied at the school in Kfar Horefish, and then moved to the military boarding school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he enlisted in the Paratroopers Brigade, and in 2000, he graduated from the Officers' School.
In 2002, he was located by the Special Operations Division in the Israeli Police and began to serve in it.
During his service, he completed a bachelor's degree in law at the College of Management and a master's degree in education and business administration at the University of Haifa.
In 2002, he met his wife, Nahed, and they got married in 2004.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year in which he and his friends established an association to promote the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined the "Acharai" association and started leading a group in Kfar Horefish, after ensuring that the association would start operating in Druze villages to encourage the youth to enlist.
In 2013, our second son was born.
The head of AMAN, Major General Aharon Haliva, explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "It's time we turn in the issue of revealing the name of Mahmoud Khair al-Din, an Israeli hero.
We finished our work and came to the conclusion that there is no security obstacle to publishing his name and picture.
"He, his family, and his children also deserve it," he noted.
"An exceptional educator and leader."
"Thanks to many operations, he is nothing less than a hero in my eyes," said General Haliwa.
"He has made a significant contribution, which shows courage and spirit, to the State of Israel."
He should receive the appropriate place for him.
And he added: "I didn't know him personally, but he was an educator, a mentor and an extraordinary leader - not only in the operational aspect, but also in values."
General Haliva stated that he will also consider whether to publish the picture of another hero, Staff Sergeant Emanuel Moreno from the Sayeret Matkal, who fell during the Second Lebanon War, and his picture was not allowed to be published.
The operation in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of long months of meticulous preparations in which the intelligence community took part.
In the command chain of the operation sat the then Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eizenkot, the then head of Military Intelligence, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heiman, and the then head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been cleared for publication, and the IDF emphasized that it was an operation conducted by the intelligence not on a whim.
But in the Arab media, communication equipment was later shown, which according to the Palestinians was left behind by the forces.
According to Hamas, the operation was intended to bury listening devices.
According to reports, on the day of the event, the force traveled in two vehicles.
The fighters were stopped at a checkpoint set up by Hamas, and something in their behavior aroused the suspicion of the Hamas activists.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The on-site investigation lasted about 45 minutes, during which it became increasingly aggressive.
When the force realized they were in a problematic situation, Sergeant H'ir a-Din managed to distract the Hamas men, and in a split second, the force commander, Sergeant A', managed to open fire.
Three Hamas members were killed in the fire, and sadly, also Sergeant Khair al-Din.
Ten months after the severe event, the Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the medal committee and award the Chief of Staff's medal to three of the fighters involved in the incident deep in the strip - including Staff Sgt. H'ir Al-Din, may his memory be a blessing.
The commander of the combat force and another fighter in the team also received a citation.
In the military announcement, it was then stated that Sgt. M received the citation for "his activity in the operation with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure and courage, to protect his comrades.
Later on, he acted out of initiative and strived for contact, took a leading role in overcoming the enemy and worked diligently to advance the takeover.
Consider transitioning from pinpoint operations to a broad operation.
Israel needs to ask itself, again, if it's not right to change its policy towards the Jenin sector.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set the West Bank on fire, but the armed men of Jenin might leave her no choice.
The stormy weekend we just had teaches us that even though Ramadan is behind us, the area is still more volatile than ever.
Many efforts and wise judgment will be required to peacefully pass the two upcoming memorial dates: Nakba Day, which is today (Sunday), and Jerusalem Day, which will be marked in two weeks.
Many factors will stand against the attempt to return to normalcy.
At the forefront, as always, are the terror groups, who are making a special effort to maintain the violent atmosphere of the recent weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the Yamam fighter, Major Noam Raz, was killed the day before yesterday.
Soldiers who participated in the battle in Jenin testified that they do not remember such a level of shooting and violence - a testimony not only to the enormous amount of weapons in the area, but also to the willingness to use them.
This requires Israel to ask itself, again, whether it is right to change its policy towards the Jenin sector, and to move from small, intelligence-based pinprick operations to a broad, mass-based operation.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set the entire West Bank and the entire arena on fire; even now, the security system prefers to act selectively, when necessary, to avoid a blaze, but the armed men of Jenin may leave it no choice.
To draw lessons for future events.
The death of Raz in combat is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims that it intentionally killed Al-Jazeera journalist, Shireen Abu Aqla.
Operational activity is a dangerous matter for those who participate in it, and for those who are present at the scene.
The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with the lives of its soldiers.
This demonstrates high morality, but it also has operational-intelligence value: a terrorist who is captured alive - as recently happened in Jenin - is an excellent source of information about weapons, attacks, and other terrorists; this is information that is usually not obtainable in any other way, and it can be used to thwart future attacks.
The IDF acted correctly when it published the interim investigation into the death of Abu Akla yesterday, and clarified that at this stage it is not possible to determine who caused his death.
Without Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful whether a definitive conclusion can be reached in the matter.
It seems that nothing will convince the convinced: the world has already rushed to condemn Israel without bothering to balance it with a word of empathy for the victims of Palestinian terror - the original cause for which the IDF is tirelessly operating in Jenin.
As always, such stories are heartbreaking.
The global public opinion is busy with its own and continues, especially when an intense war continues to rage in Ukraine.
Therefore, it's a shame that Israel insisted on giving Abu Akla's death more unnecessary moments of exposure, with the police's unsuccessful handling of her funeral.
Even if Abu-Akla's family did not meet the early agreements, one would expect a bit more restraint from the police officers who accompanied the funeral procession, and certainly to be less agitated by the Palestinian flags that were flown there.
The responsibility requires: to act to calm the situation.
The Minister of Internal Security and the Police Commissioner did well by ordering an investigation into the incident.
It seems that there was a lack of adequate preparation and clear instructions, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened to the police in a short period of time, and in two different districts.
The police also failed in managing the event, isolating the scene and handling the communication during the Dizengoff attack.
The investigation committee would do well not to limit itself to analyzing the behavior of the police during the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions that will enable more successful handling of similar events in the future.
Alongside the internal handling within the police, he is also committed to giving his opinion on the conduct of public officials who have lost their way and direction.
In the Israeli Knesset, there are currently several members who appear to be a threat to democracy.
They are found on both the left and the right, and they exploit their immunity not to challenge the state, but to harm it.
MK Ofer Cassif is the latest example of this; if no actions are taken against him - including prosecution for assaulting a police officer - the state will implicitly encourage the next public representative to further escalate his actions.
Such actions, which are a form of defensive democracy, are vital in the volatility of this era, with factors in the background seeking to exploit the situation for political purposes.
Anyone with a clear mind is expected to rise above all of this, and act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel may quickly slide into escalation against external enemies, and worse - against internal rivals.
A senior police officer: "There is a need for government policy and setting goals."
Israel Police has indeed launched an operation to mitigate the phenomenon of illegal squatters, but the road is still long.
Today in Israel, there is not a single entity that encompasses this entire issue.
"If we want to address the issue of illegal immigrants, a government policy is required, from which goals, tasks and responsibilities should be derived.
"Today in Israel, there is not a single entity that encompasses this entire issue," a senior police officer tells "Israel Today".
Until a month and a half ago, before the escalation in the security situation, the phenomenon was manifested in about 20 to 30 thousand Palestinians entering every day through breaches in the fence.
In addition, between 100 to 110 thousand Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day through 34 supervised crossings.
It should be noted that Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits in each sector is limited by a quota set by the state according to the security, economic, and political situation in Israel.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
In light of this, an illegal worker is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is forbidden due to criminal involvement or connection to attacks, but often they are Palestinians whose entry is denied because they do not meet the permitted quota.
It should be emphasized that those who carried out the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were indeed considered terrorists, but they were not under surveillance, as they had not previously committed any criminal offense that required security forces to monitor their movements.
"Therefore, their entry through the breaches in the fence is meaningless," says a senior security official, "anyone who wants to carry out an attack can enter the country through the supervised crossings, and there have been such cases in the past."
Thousands of arrests.
Following the attack in Elad and due to the increase in attack warnings, the police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal residents.
By the end of the week, about 16,000 Sabbath observers were arrested.
Out of them, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases were opened against them, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to the police prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal residents are only carried out against repeat offenders or people who repeatedly commit the same act (recidivists).
An illegal resident who is arrested for the first time is investigated, documented and returned to the territories.
Sometimes this repeats itself even for the second time, but only on the third time he is arrested, imprisoned and an indictment is filed against him for illegal stay.
According to the law, if an illegal resident is caught within a range of about 50 to 100 meters from either side of the separation fence, he is dealt with by the military prosecution.
According to data obtained by "Israel Today", it appears that in 2021, the police handled 40,010 illegal residents, infiltrators, and asylum seekers.
7,405 illegal residents were arrested and criminal cases were opened against 19,533.
The number of employers, drivers and complainants handled by the police in 2021 was 6,537.
469 were arrested, and criminal cases were opened against 5,640.
"The fundamentals of the phenomenon of 'terror attacks' do not depend on the police, not on the IDF, not on Israeli society, and not on Palestinian society.
"They are dependent on other factors," says a senior official in the law enforcement system.
"To address the issue, we need to eliminate their motivation to work in Israel, and on the Israeli side, we need to impose a cost that will deter them from crossing the fence."
Those involved in the issue argue that the failure to enforce the price is due, among other things, to a lack of detention facilities and the fact that arrests are only made when there are accompanying offenses or in the case of a recidivist.
Legal experts argue that the decision to charge a fee from the detainee only from the third arrest was made, among other things, because the courts cannot cope with the number of arrests made every day.
Whoever checks the punishment as well, will discover that it is not deterrent.
There is a great complexity.
"Shabach," says a police source, "is a complex person."
He could be a father to a family who came to the country to work, earn some money and then return.
This is the basic platform, and on it, many types of infiltrators enter the country to commit criminal offenses or attacks.
A suspect can be an adult or a minor.
In the past, the police have caught illegal residents aged 16 and even children aged 8 and 10, sent by their parents to intersections on the roads, to earn a few shekels a day from drivers.
"This also complicates the matter, because in such cases we need to bring the parents and file an indictment against them for neglect," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians employed in Israel work in manual labor jobs.
The most exceptional are electrical works or advanced construction works.
In the past, there were also local authorities that employed community service workers to remove garbage, mainly in the north.
Out of 34 crossings, there are about 18 main crossings.
There are crossings for vehicles and goods, there are crossings that only people pass through, and there are crossings that are both.
All the crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Crossings Authority.
The Sabbath observers are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as it is easy money.
"Some do it for a living and there are gangs whose main activity is transporting illegal workers," says a senior police officer, "usually most of them are Israeli Arabs, who speak the same language and communicate with them.
It can cost from 100 shekels to 300 shekels per person.
Registered companies do not engage in this, because if the company gets caught, it could be shut down.
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting a weapon can be considered a violation.
"A taxi driver who works with licenses in accordance with licensing and insurance, who picks up Palestinians at regular points and at fixed times, including a regular order, does not break the law," says a senior police officer, "whoever knows that he is driving illegal residents, usually picks them up in the dead of night at hidden points, including drop-offs at hidden points.
Most of these guys drive a beat-up car because they know their car will get scratched, so they prefer to drive an old car.
Documentation: Fields set on fire in Zippori village.
The areas suffer from many fires, with the damage amounting to tens of thousands of shekels.
At this point, the "New Guard" was established in an attempt to curb the severe phenomenon.
.
In the footage obtained by "Israel Today", one can see grazing areas in Zippori moshav on fire.
The grazing lands belong to Zilberman.
The areas suffer from many fires, with the damage amounting to tens of thousands of shekels.
It should be noted that at this point the "New Guard" was established in an attempt to curb this severe phenomenon.

Terrorists threw explosives at IDF soldiers, who returned fire and killed one of them.
Security forces arrested 13 wanted individuals across Judea and Samaria overnight.
During the operation, an IDF force fired at several suspects who threw charges at them, a hit was identified.
The hospital manager in Jenin, to whom the terrorist, Maher Mara'i, a 25-year-old from Jenin, turned, reports that he was shot by the IDF.
IDF, Shin Bet and Border Police forces arrested 13 wanted individuals across Judea and Samaria last night (Wednesday).
The forces operated in several locations across the Judea and Samaria division to arrest wanted individuals, among other places in Rashida village and in the city of Nablus.
In the military operation in the city of Jenin within the Menashe territorial brigade, two wanted suspects suspected of terrorist activity were arrested.
In addition, during the operation, an IDF force fired at several suspects who threw charges at them, gunshots were heard in the area.
A hit was identified.
The hospital director in Jenin, to whom the terrorist, Maher Mara'i, a 25-year-old from Jenin refugee camp, turned to, reports that he was shot by IDF fire, which led to his death.
During the IDF soldiers' operation in the Al-Azah refugee camp in the Etzion territorial brigade area to arrest a suspect involved in terrorist activities and seize weapons, several suspects were identified throwing stones at the force, which responded with riot dispersal means and rubber bullets.
A hit was identified.
In addition, arrests were also made in the village of Silwad, east of Ramallah, and three students from "Al-Islamiyya Al-Kutla", a list associated with Hamas at An-Najah University in Nablus, were arrested at their homes. Recently, violent clashes have been recorded there with Fatah students and security forces on campus.
"A criminal investigation should be opened against her": The Haifa city auditor makes serious accusations against Einat Kalisch Rotem.
The city auditor's report presents an apparent concern about the criminal conduct of Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality and political rivals: tracking employees and inflated payments to an accounting firm for conducting investigations.
"The harsh findings arising from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation."
The Haifa Municipality did not provide a response.
Monitoring municipal employees and political rivals and inflated payment to an accounting firm for conducting investigations, "at the expense of the public purse".
The report of Haifa's city auditor Ofer Tal, which was published yesterday (Tuesday), apparently raises concerns about criminal offenses by the city's mayor Dr. Einat Kalisch Rotem against former senior officials in the municipality, municipal employees, and political rivals.
According to the suspicion, Klisch met with the accounting firm Berlub and partners and requested to conduct an investigative audit.
The investigations were conducted under names and codes given to the former city treasurer, and a code name given to the council member Sofi Nekesh, and it was examined whether the tenders between the municipality and a company owned by Nekesh's family are completely legitimate.
The report from the auditor also reveals that there is complete disorder and lack of control over the work of the accountant with whom Klisch met.
The city treasurer is the municipal entity whose role is to coordinate and synchronize between the accountant's work and the municipality departments, and the data collected by the accountant was not transferred to him.
This has resulted in no one in the municipality being aware of all the projects carried out by the accountant, and what is the scope of work required in each of them.
Moreover, the accountant's time reports were not approved in many cases as required.
A situation was created in which the scope of issues that the auditor saw as problematic was disproportionately increasing, with a lot of interference in the routine conduct of the municipality, without any supervision or monitoring by the municipality.
In conclusion of the report, the audit recommended to stop the payments that have not yet been made to the accountant, until material specifying his work on each of the topics he examined is received.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were under codes such as "Threshold Guards", information store, fish store, investigative audit for the mayor, and an investigative audit purchase report.
A short time later, the city's legal advisor, Yamit Klein, noted that the mayor herself had signed the payment approval in her place.
"I was not summoned by any audit report and I don't know what it is about," she wrote.
It was also reported that the cost of the investigative audit is about two million shekels, of which one and a half million shekels have been paid and half a million shekels remain to be paid, from the tax money of the Haifa public.
The former city treasurer, Jackie Wakim, responded: "These disgraceful actions were done to tarnish my name and the names of public officials at the expense of the public treasury and the Haifa taxpayer, and it is a criminal offense."
Sofi Nacas, a city council member, responded: "The auditor's report and the committee's recommendations speak for themselves."
The response of attorney Sarit Golan, a member of the Haifa City Council: The testimonies and the harsh findings arising from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation against all those involved in the operation of the investigative audit consultant to conduct investigations, some of which are questionable whether they are allowed by law in the way they were conducted, especially the investigations related to the council member from the opposition to the mayor and former senior employees.
Lior Datz's response from the "Threshold Guardians" association: "It seems that all red lines have been crossed when a public authority sends private investigators to gather information against lawyers representing an association that exposes corruption, while the association is conducting public proceedings against the management of Haifa Municipality."
The Haifa Municipality did not provide a response.
The office of Yehuda Barlev, the accountant, is not interested in commenting.
Gantz revealed: "Iran and Hezbollah worked together to harm UNIFIL's activity in Lebanon."
The Defense Minister participated in the international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University and claimed that "Israel recognizes its adversaries' cyber systems and their methods of operation".
Gantz referred, among other things, to Al-Sayed's documentation of Hamas prisoners: "A video aimed at extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue".
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems."
The Defense Minister, Benny Gantz, spoke this morning (Wednesday) at the international cyber conference of the Cyber Center at Tel Aviv University and revealed a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah to harm UNIFIL forces in Lebanon, "another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon and the stability of the state," Gantz said.
Gantz referred, among other things, to the documentation of Hisham al-Sayed, who is held captive by Hamas in Gaza, which was released by the military wing of the terrorist organization: "Yesterday a video was published with the aim of extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Hamas is holding the four sons captive in violation of international law and morality.
Hamas is responsible for this and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal behavior of Hamas.
He added that "Israel is using a variety of means, and continues to leave no stone unturned in order to bring the sons home.
As we have said before - this is a humanitarian issue, that's how we see it, and on that basis we will continue to act.
Attempts at extortion and consciousness exercises will not affect our position and behavior.
Later, he revealed a joint activity of Iran and Hezbollah: "Iran is operating its branches also in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today, that recently, activities of the Iranian security forces were detected in collaboration with Hezbollah, in order to harm the activity of UNIFIL forces in Lebanon."
This was done by implementing a cyber operation aimed at stealing materials about UNIFIL's preparations in the area, and their use by Hezbollah.
This is another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the citizens of Lebanon, and on Lebanon's stability.
"Israel recognizes its adversaries' cyber systems and their methods of operation.
In recent years, we have seen a phenomenon of hacker groups on behalf of Iran, operating against Israel and other countries," Gantz continued and told.
"The 'new emissaries' are terrorists with a keyboard, their fate is like other terrorist organization fighters."
We know who they are, we are hurting them and their senders, and even today they are in our sights - not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack against Israeli citizens will be tolerated.
And the responsibility lies with the attackers and the state that sponsors and sends them.
A cyber attack can be responded to in a variety of ways in the cyber space and in additional spaces.
Gantz continued his attack on the nuclear power: "Iran leads the cyber terror - and makes moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and governments, as happened in the US presidential elections and other attempts that Israel is aware of.
Actions like those of the 'Shahid Kavah' unit, which gathered information on ships, fuel stations and industrial factories in several countries, were carried out under the direct directive of the Iranian leadership and the Revolutionary Guards as revealed in investigations.
He further added that "in recent years, we have thwarted many attempts to break into private and public companies, both domestically and abroad."
I also call on the public to demand 'cyber responsibility', and to punish companies and bodies that do not act according to the guidelines".
Gantz continued and marked the next goals of Israel against the threats: "Our supreme mission, in the army, industries and various security organizations, is to build the people, train them, and keep them.
The Chief of Staff and I have set this issue as one of the main tasks in the relevant units.
We are constantly examining the power structure - both in terms of manpower, training, and mission assignments.
In the coming years, we will also need to examine the organization, management and operation of the cyber warfare, its offensive and defensive characteristics in the IDF and the entire security system.
In conclusion, the Defense Minister called for cooperation with the world: "Our cooperation with the world against Iran is of great importance, also in the cyber dimension."
The same collaborations that we are building in the region against Iran in terms of defense against various threats - we are also expanding in the cyber dimension.
The deputy commander of Unit 8200 revealed: "We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems."
Uri, the deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in the unit's first public appearance at such conferences, revealed that Israel thwarted an attack on the water systems.
"Neutralizing cyber threats is a central part of our activity."
"Our goal is to achieve superiority over the attacker, to succeed in identifying him and act to neutralize his capabilities," said the deputy commander of 8200 and added "sometimes we also find victims outside of Israel and then we establish contact with other agencies if needed."
We do this both independently and in collaboration with the industry and other agencies, by implementing and using the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is removed.
As mentioned, a threat to Israel's water systems and attempts to poison Israeli citizens were revealed: "We thwarted an attempt to take over Israel's critical water systems and poison them a few years ago.
In another case, we also identified that a certain adversary attacked Israel and during the identification, we found that the same attacker also tried to target power stations in the US.
This was the first indication of this attack.
We managed to prevent this threat through close cooperation with our American partners."
Watch: This is how the police prepare to neutralize terrorists in a civilian population.
The Jerusalem Border Police inaugurated a new "Asaf" facility that simulates shooting in a crowded audience in response to the series of attacks that have occurred in recent months.
The Jerusalem Border Police's counter-terrorism guide: "The development provides a relevant response to attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground".
A glimpse into the "Asaf" facility.
Preparing for the next attack: A series of terror attacks carried out in the spring by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, in which 19 people were killed and about 70 civilians were injured, led the Border Guard to develop a unique technique that trains fighters to charge at terrorists within a civilian population and carry out shooting on the move.
"Israel Today" exposure: A glimpse into the "Asaf" facility.
The popular terror focuses on harming civilians and its goal is to undermine the sense of security needed for the proper conduct of civilian population's life.
The severe wave of attacks that occurred this year, with attacks in Be'er Sheva, Hadera, Bnei Brak, Ariel, Elad, and especially the one that occurred in early April on Dizengoff Street in the heart of Tel Aviv, by a terrorist embedded in the crowd, led the police to creative thinking in order to develop a tool that would enable training fighters to attack terrorists within a civilian population.
The thinking process was led by the Police Training Department and the Border Guard.
These were presented in a competition in the different police districts under the title "Commanders Leading Learning", where each district was required to develop means to improve the patrolling and combat skills of the fighters, police officers and commanders.
As part of the competition, and in response to the need for Border Police soldiers to practice shooting in motion and in such scenarios, Assaf Ben David, a counter-terrorism instructor for the Border Police in the Jerusalem envelope, developed the "Assaf Device", which consists of a dynamic target, connected to a telescopic rod on which a carrier can be attached to the instructor.
The instructor, who straps the target to his waist, can train the fighter standing in front of him by controlling and moving the target to different sides and ranges.
It should be noted that in recent years, Border Guard soldiers have dealt with many attacks in which the perpetrator is shooting and posing a threat while moving in areas crowded with innocent civilians.
"The Asaf Device", in its current version, is based on components and parts that are used in various fields.
For example, the telescopic pole that was upgraded and integrated into the device, was taken from the maintenance and cleaning field.
Using the device, it is possible to simulate shooting in motion within a civilian population towards a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object, handling traffic stops, choosing a path of progress for selective shooting, including practicing the prevention of harm to uninvolved parties.
Brigadier General Asaf Ben David, after whom the facility is named, says: "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in training and educating soldiers and police officers."
The development provides a relevant response to attribution threats and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of development versus the relatively low production cost gives us a significant advantage in competition."
The State Comptroller warns: "The Central Elections Committee is not prepared for cyber threats."
Matanyahu Englman warned at the International Cyber Week about Israel's lack of preparedness for hacker attacks.
"The third world war will be a cyber war but the world is not prepared for it."
The State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman participated today (Wednesday) in the annual Cyber Conference of Tel Aviv University and expressed concern about cyber attacks on Israel.
"We are exposed.
Our data is exposed to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
The third world war will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it."
Engelman reported that during the cyber reviews his office conducts, significant deficiencies were found: "In the past year, we have conducted penetration tests at the Traffic Management Center in Jerusalem, in hospitals and in the Tax Authority systems.
In the reviews, we found significant deficiencies, including the fact that very few penetration tests were conducted by public bodies, and some of them conducted penetration tests only during the review.
In addition, deficiencies in the Central Election Committee's preparedness for cyber threats were revealed.
"We at the State Comptroller's Office are committed to continue addressing this significant issue with utmost seriousness, for the benefit of the citizens of Israel and the entire world," he concluded.
High ambition: "I came to Hapoel Jerusalem to win titles"
Choosing the Reds: "From the first moment they showed me they wanted me, I am built to lead a big team".
Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: "I felt like I had a place, I want to be in the squad for EuroBasket".
And the period at Maccabi Tel Aviv: "I learned to focus only on what is under my control".
Oz Blayzer in an interview.
Oz Blayzer left today with the Israeli national team to Poland, where they will meet the local team in the 2023 World Cup qualifiers (Thursday, 21:30 Israel time).
Three days later, the national team will host Estonia at Shlomo Group Arena.
In parallel to the intensive training with the national team, Blazer also dealt with his future last week, until he signed a two-year contract with Hapoel Jerusalem.
"I have a peace of mind now after finding a team," he tells "Israel Today" in his first and special interview since signing.
"I'm feeling a bit stressed right now because I need to move house with my family after we settled in the central area and it's not easy, but there are no more phone calls and professionally I'm much more relaxed."
You haven't been on the team for four years, how happy are you to return, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to enjoy the national team and I come with the approach of contributing whatever I can, whether it's from my experience or on the field.
Of course, I would love to play, but when it comes to the national team, everyone needs to put their ego aside and do everything to make the team successful.
I am here for whatever they will need from me.
Now you are 14 players, and for the European championship, Deni Avdija will join, Gabi Chachashvili will return, and there might be additional changes.
Did you set a goal to be in the championship squad?
"I would be happy to be on the field and contribute."
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99m) has played for Maccabi Tel Aviv in the last two years.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue in yellow and after a few weeks he moved to Be'er Sheva, preferring Jerusalem over Hapoel Holon.
You had other offers, why did you choose Hapoel Jerusalem specifically?
"They showed a great willingness for me to be there, therefore the negotiation was relatively easy."
The moment I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I knew this was the right place for me.
Also, the situation seems good and suitable to me.
I am coming to lead and be a significant part of the team.
I spoke with the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and victories, and that's exactly what I bring.
I've always loved playing in the arena, because I get energy even when the crowd is against me, and now that they will be on my side it will be even better.
I am sure it will be a committed and fun group and I wanted to be a part of it."
Elaborate a bit on your conversation with Coach Djikic.
"Professionally, he believes in a lot of movement without the ball, he plans to bring good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energies in defense and attack and with the crowd in the arena, it can succeed".
I looked at your career and saw that you stayed at least two years in every team, if not more.
Do you feel that you could also stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
"Wherever I go, I like to connect and give my all, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone hasn't stopped ringing and beeping.
I received many messages that they are already waiting for me.
So, I believe a good period is waiting for us.
Do you think you can be a more significant player in Jerusalem than in Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How would you summarize your two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv?
"Unfortunately, there were things that were out of my control last season.
Everyone saw that I remained professional all the way, and no matter how much I received - I always gave my all.
I am proud of the way I have done in the past year, and now everyone goes their own way.
If it were up to you, would you want to stay in Maccabi?
"After the last year, it was clear to both sides that we were heading towards a separation, but that's part of the business."
Towards the end of the season, I got a bit injured and my status dropped, even though I had an excellent period in the middle of the year, but they decided to go in different directions.
After I understood the situation there, I realized it's less the place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me and that's why I chose it.
Finally, what are your goals for the upcoming season?
"They talked a lot about what happened in the semi-finals of the cup last season when I shouted at Ami Biton (the team manager at Maccabi Tel Aviv - Y.M) 'This is why I'm here', so this is why I came to Jerusalem - to win titles."
Wade Baldwin might join Maccabi Tel Aviv.
The yellows are in talks with a star from Baskonia last season (26, 1.93 m) and hope to sign him to complete the back line for the 2022/23 season.
Is Maccabi Tel Aviv on the way to a dazzling acquisition?
Guard Wade Baldwin may join the yellows and complete Oded Kattash's back line for the 2022/2023 season.
Baldwin (26, 1.93m) played last season in Baskonia and had impressive averages of 14.1 points, 4.4 assists and 3.6 rebounds per game.
Before that, he played for Bayern Munich and Olympiacos, and also had a stint in the NBA.
If he signs, Baldwin will join Alex Poitiers, Guy Penini, Darren Hilliard, Austin Hollins, and Bonzie Colson who have already signed earlier this summer.
Rafi Manko and Josh Nivo also closed and are expected to sign officially soon.
First published: Is Adam Ariel moving to Hapoel Tel Aviv?
The Reds are interested in signing the 27-year-old forward if he is released from Hapoel Jerusalem.

As mentioned, a few days ago we reported that the future of the 27-year-old forward at the Jerusalem club is uncertain and the team may exercise the option to exit his contract, with a final decision to be made in the coming days.
Now it turns out that if he indeed does not continue in the capital, Hapoel Tel Aviv will try to sign him to its ranks.
And in Jerusalem, the club's leaders decided not to exercise the option in Retin Obasohan's contract for another season and informed him of his release from the team.
In this regard, the guard Raz Adam may be loaned to Ironi Ness Ziona after he asked to leave the Reds in order to get more playing time.

All or nothing: 1:1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera.
Guy Hadida scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but managed to correct it with an equalizer after 10 minutes.
Later on, the connection was distantly dismissed in red (74) •
Hadera also remained with ten players following a red card given to Ido Levi (87).
The professional team of Hapoel Jerusalem counted the number of foreign players on the Teddy field more than once this evening (Saturday), it should be noted, and at one point they even discovered one less player (Guy Hadida was sent off).
This time, to their delight, everything went smoothly, and the 1:1 they achieved against Hapoel Hadera will not be taken away from them by the association's court.
Before he received a red card, he managed to score a goal and equalize, securing a valuable point for Ziv Arie.
Already in the 33rd minute, Guy Haddida's private show began.
Plekushchenko lifted the ball into the box, the midfielder jumped and headed it backwards and the ball ended up in his own team's net.
1:0 to Hadera who benefited from an own goal by the defender.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hapoel Hadid managed to correct and score - Levkovich caught air and this time he headed the ball into the correct and exposed net.
1:1 at Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadida also managed to get a second yellow and a red card, this time after sliding towards Marmantini.
Daniel Bar Natan decided on a questionable red card and sent the midfielder straight to an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Nathan also sent Ido Levi off with a red card, evening out the power dynamics on the field.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon.
60:85
Ariel Beit Halachmi's team secured a third consecutive victory, this time particularly impressive.
Hover and Shochman (15 points each) excelled.
The recovery journey of Hapoel Eilat continued tonight (Saturday) with an impressive 60:85 victory over Hapoel Holon, leading to a seasonal balance of 0:3 in the matches between the two.
Since falling to the last place, Ariel Beit Halachmi's team has already had three consecutive victories, and in fact, it's only a surprise for those who didn't watch the game.
We haven't seen Holon this bad in a long time.
All this before the series opener against Besiktas in the Champions League playoffs: only 60 points, a first half without a three-pointer and 11 percent for three in the entire game.
In the bottom line, it was an unimpressive evening for all the team players (except for Murphy Menko, who scored the 3 three-pointers for Holon), including the safe bet Chris Johnson.
On the other hand, Eilat is in much better shape thanks to Roi Hover and Joaquin Shuchman (15 points each).
The first one has recently come back to himself and the second one has started to bloom again and also amazed with a three-quarter court shot.
Give them a chance: The Israelis of Maccabi Tel Aviv saved Sfairopoulos.
After a loss in the derby and an eighth consecutive in Europe, a defeat in the classic against Jerusalem - it seems, would have ended the long romance between Maccabi Tel Aviv and the Greek coach.
So, who should Yanis send a bouquet of flowers to tonight?
His Israeli team was responsible for 42 critical points in the arena.
And also: Why does the yellow club need to change its 'Americanization strategy', and take a live example from Ariel Beit Halachmi's model in Eilat.
It's hard to stay cynical at the sight of the tearful eyes and the warm, strong hugs that Giannis Sfairopoulos gave his players at the end of the game tonight in the arena, and especially in front of the tight slap and the secret exchange with John Dibartolomeo, who with his hands saved the Greek coach's job, and perhaps the entire season.
Because after a home loss in the derby and eight consecutive losses in Europe, to also lose in the classic to Jerusalem and to be three victories away from it in the table?
It had already finished the Israeli-Greek novel that night.
So for now, he is with us, and he has a lot to learn from this game, especially about the Euroleague.
Firstly, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a drastic change in their attacking and ball movement habits.
The ball moves in passes, with a lot of movement and exercises, and Scotty Wilbekin, noticeably, left the concentration work to Evans, dribbled very little, and mainly went over blocks and took shots.
Despite shooting very poorly (2-9 from the field), Wilbekin contributed on defense, and most importantly, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team, and the other players scored.
However, towards the end, naturally with less oxygen in the brain, the team reverted to old habits, and the attacks went back to dribbling and shooting, and in the most critical attack, with a 2 point lead and 40 seconds to the end, Scotty himself dribbled to half corner and threw a floater on one foot that almost lost the game.
The wisdom is to continue playing exercises and passing movements especially in clutch moments, and it must become part of the nature and the team's DNA.
The important lesson will be learned by Yanis and the club regarding the use of Israelis.
Those who became water fetchers and towel wavers in games in Europe.
Tonight, they scored more than half of the team's points (42 out of 83) for the coach who stopped believing in them, and they were the ones who kept the game alive at the end.
Four out of the five leading scorers in Maccabi were her Israelis.
And don't say Israel is not Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can also help in the Euroleague.
In the first half, it was mainly OZ Blayzer, whom the section has been screaming for a month that he needs to play more.
A shooter, disciplined, a fighter under the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 meters of defensive determination and game wisdom.
Is that not enough?
In the second half, Jake Cohen shone, with excellent percentages from all ranges, coolness from the line, and covering for the injury of Zizic, and especially John Di, who at a score of 70:63 for Jerusalem, changed the momentum with 5 consecutive points.
Yanis has a complex relationship with Yiftach Ziv, and it seems that sometimes he gives him too much credit, and puts too much on him, to the point of risking a loss.
It happens in the Euroleague too, and it happened last night as well.
But the important lesson should be for the club, regarding its Americanization strategy.
Fact: Senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar went to Europe but not to Maccabi, Rafi Menco returned to Holon, and now Noam Dovrat chooses Jerusalem, or maybe he was rejected by Maccabi.
And this is happening because in Maccabi there are gradually fewer places for Israelis, due to the club's deliberate and fundamental choice to rely on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the waterline, where no Israelis will want to play for them, and then they will look for Jewish children to naturalize and pressure the management/league to increase the number of foreigners.
But it's a fatal mistake of the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that they are overdoing it with the foreigners, largely due to the tax assumption.
Certainly, it's not claimed that the Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same amount of money on one star and eight average ones, you can get five excellent ones.
For example, with the money of Williams, Nunnally, Evans, Reynolds, and Taylor, it would have been possible to bring two efficient and stable stars (a star center and forward) next to Scottie and Jizjiz.
It would be more efficient, it would be more correct, it would be more Israeli, it would be more beautiful and interesting and create identification.
It's true that there are two packed frameworks and a long season - so you have to rely on your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group, claiming to represent Israel, and even receiving tax relief from the state for supposedly representing it in Europe.
The Basketball Association/League Management can help Maccabi, and return to normality with a number of foreigners suitable for the Israeli league.
6 on the roster, 4 on the form, a maximum of three on the field at the same time.
Is the league flooded with foreigners just for Maccabi's ongoing failures (already seven years in Europe)?
And the actors' union, what about you?
Did you rest for this?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there is one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
To argue in order to get less?
The previous Russian law was good for basketball, good for the teams, and even good for Maccabi.
And if someone needed reinforcement for the above direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.
With 3 foreigners, and another 4 Israelis who were only substitutes in the youth teams (Hover, Ben Moshe, Rovina and the fighter Shuchman), she dismantled Holon (second in the table!) for the second time in the last two weeks.
It's a tradition in Eilat to play well with three forwards, as there was such a run in the days of Dan Shamir and much in the days of Sharon Drucker.
Eilat Hatzara is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and there's no one like Ariel Beit Halachmi, who started on the open courts in Givat Shmuel, to demonstrate and remind us what Israeli basketball should look like.
Everyone is at their peak fitness, everyone is playing together, and all the Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The strangers only complete.
When Ben Carter and Kasey Prather return from their knee injury, it will be an amazing team.
A song I dreamed about Eilat.
And Maccabi can learn from him about the right direction.
Yellow celebrations: "There was a feeling that the whole world was against us"
The yellows are happy after the 78:83 over Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena: "We returned to play as Maccabi Tel Aviv should play".
About Ami Biton's talk in the dressing room, the first optimistic diagnosis of Jizjic's injury, and the management's approval for the purchase.
A great sense of relief was felt this morning (Sunday) among Maccabi Tel Aviv's team after the important and prestigious 78:83 victory over Hapoel Jerusalem at the Arena yesterday.
The team players and management hugged coach Yanis Sfairopoulos who seemed very emotional at the end.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blayzer enthusiastically poured water on Derrick Williams, who excelled in the game, and the rest of the club members also smiled a big smile of happiness that showed how much pressure was released after the last losing streak.
They too feared a defeat against the bigger opponent that would further destabilize the system.
The fans also stayed for a long time to celebrate in the stands.
"There is an amazing connection between us and Yanis in the dressing room," Oz Blazer recounted.
"We know that the situation was also not easy for him, a lot of pressure was released.
We've been waiting for this a lot, even in the way we played.
We returned to play in the way that Maccabi Tel Aviv needs to play, with heart and fight, we stand behind it.
He gave us motivational talks and spoke with us.
Before the game, the team manager Ami Biton entered the dressing room and gave an emotional speech to the players.
"His words had a great influence on how we came out and how we played on the court," said players from Maccabi.
Despite the great joy, Maccabi is already gearing up for the important game against Baskonia on Thursday and wants to break the long losing streak in the Euroleague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer added.
"We lost many games at the end and this time they were leading a few minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"In the recent games we were under a lot of pressure, Yanis told us that if we are relaxed we will win these games.
I believe that this victory will take us forward.
Many eyes are on us and it felt like the whole world was against us, I am proud to go into this battle, we disconnect from everything around and only focus on ourselves."
Ante Zizic, who was injured in his right knee during the last quarter, was examined by the medical team in the dressing room and the initial diagnosis was not severe.
The doctors will examine how the knee responds today and then it will be determined how many days of rest he will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be fit for Baskonia.
Apart from the strong support given by the management to Sfropoulos and the professional team, in a meeting held on Thursday, the professional manager Nikola Vujčić was given the green light to bring one or two players to strengthen the team, and the yellows hope to add quality acquisition soon.
Anthony Bennett has been released from Hapoel Jerusalem.
The forward who was the first pick in the NBA draft failed to acclimate to the team from the capital.
At the club they said goodbye: "Anthony has entered all of our hearts, we thank him for his time at Hapoel."
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released today (Sunday) from the team's roster.
The forward (28, 2.03) who was first picked in the 2013 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, recorded 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five Champions League games, as well as 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds in eight Premier League games.
"Hapoel Jerusalem and player Anthony Bennett announce that they have reached a mutual decision to terminate the player's contract with the club," the club stated, "Anthony has touched all of our hearts and we would like to thank him for his time at Hapoel.
We wish him only the best and success.
Research states: Zoom meetings harm creativity.
About 2,100 engineers and academics around the world were asked to develop solutions to the problem - some in video meetings, some in face-to-face meetings.
The result: a virtual meeting hinders creativity and out-of-the-box thinking.
The research leader at Columbia University: "Visual focus on the screen harms the process of idea creation".
Nachama Porta: There is no harm to the work productivity or critical thinking.
A large scientific study recently published in the scientific journal Nature examined the impact of meetings via video applications on the creativity of the participants, compared to face-to-face meetings.
Unfortunately, it was found that creativity indeed suffers in virtual meetings through screens.
The research question - led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University - was whether remote meetings via computer maintain the creativity that exists in office brainstorming sessions, or if the level of creativity and free thinking decreases as a result of the distance.
The research itself began in 2016 but received a major boost during the two years of the coronavirus, during which many employees switched to working from home.
"People in a pleasant personal meeting in a room, using objects and using them for creative thinking," says Brooks.
"In a face-to-face meeting, on the other hand, the focus on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain."
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more focused on the video during interaction, which hinders the process of generating and expanding ideas.
The space is shrinking.
To examine the results of the experiment and to verify if they would repeat, they were tested twice - once at Columbia University and another time in real life - on engineers who knew each other from early acquaintance.
At the university, the researcher divided a group of 602 staff members and students into two parts - in one, the participants were asked to meet personally and develop solutions to a problem, and in the second, they were asked to do so via a computer.
Simultaneously, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East, and South Asia were asked to similarly divide and solve a problem presented to them in a new way.
In both cases, a decrease in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking was found among those who met virtually via video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral fellow at McGill University in Canada and a researcher who studies ways to measure creativity, was not involved in the study but was not surprised by the results.
In his opinion, during a thinking activity, people usually look at their surroundings to help generate ideas, whereas in a video meeting, the thinking is focused on the screen and does not expand in a way that allows creativity.
"When people are in the same room, they look around and see the space, which contains objects and situations that can evoke new associations in them.
On the other hand, the research shows that computer-mediated relationships change our attention so that we are more focused inward and on the screen, and this way reduces innovation and idea generation through looking at the environment and thinking outwardly.
There is no harm to critical thinking.
However, before rushing employees back to the office, the researchers note that "working via computer did not harm productivity itself nor people's critical thinking on innovative proposals, when they had to choose the best idea from a set of ideas."
In other words, the damage is only targeted at creativity and not at other forms of computer work.
Prof. Ellen Langer, a psychology professor at Harvard University, also supports the findings.
According to her, "there is a difference between mere creativity, like new uses for a frisbee (one of the research questions; ed) and work solutions.
It's also possible that when the employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or when they are working from home, creativity will indeed improve.
Both Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson suggested a future study in which such meetings would be interrupted for thinking states and wandering around the room to see how this activity would affect the final outcome.
Also, Dr. Olson suggested that as a result of the study, only brainstorming meetings will return to work and generally he suggested not to panic from one study but to conduct further research in the field.
"I wouldn't want employees to be forced back and not be happy, that's a bigger harm," he says.
Musk is waiting for Trump's return: "It was not right to block him."
The new buyer of Twitter said that he will reverse the decision, which led to the blocking of the former US president's account.
"I think it was a mistake," he admitted.
The owner of Tesla and SpaceX, Elon Musk, who recently purchased Twitter in a deal estimated at 44 billion dollars, said today (Tuesday) that he intends to bring Trump back to the social network, which had blocked him while he was president, following the riots by his supporters on Capitol Hill after losing the election to the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.
"I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
"I think it was a mistake," he said.
"If there are incorrect and harmful tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and suspension - temporary suspension - is appropriate, but not a permanent ban," Musk clarified.
By 2050: The world will lose 80% of the water available for agriculture.
A new global study predicts a significant decrease in the next 25 years.
The solution: Proper management of water reservoirs.
A new and disturbing study recently published in the journal Earth’s Future, predicts that by 2050 the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by about 80% if the rate of water consumption and world population growth remain at their current trends.
In the research, in which scientists from all science agencies around the world participated, they summed up the total amount of rainwater, rivers and freshwater sources in the world and compared it to the needs of humanity in agriculture.
The grim conclusions of the research show that as of now, the rate of water consumption has been doubling again and again over the last 10 years, while global warming is causing a decrease in rainfall in agricultural areas around the world.
According to the research data, 84% of the world's agricultural lands will experience a severe shortage of rainfall.
One of the main conclusions from the research calls for farmers around the world to adapt their agriculture to climate changes and seasons, and to switch to cultivation methods that allow water to penetrate the soil in order to prevent the evaporation process that leads to a widespread waste of rainwater.
Also, the researchers recommend that farmers working near salty water sources use rainwater harvesting technologies to prevent their flow into the sea.
Information about many students from Bar Ilan University has leaked online.
The hackers who attacked Bar Ilan University's database a few weeks ago threatened to publish the students' information if they do not receive a ransom.
The threat was carried out and the information was spread across the internet.
Students at Bar Ilan University are under a hacker attack as their personal information is being published across the internet by a network attacker named Darkrypt, who a few weeks ago demanded a ransom from the university officials and threatened that if an unspecified amount of money is not paid, he will publish the information under his control.
The estimates regarding the amount of money demanded by the attacker suggest that it started in the thousands of dollars and as the clock ticked, it increased and before the information was published, it had already reached several million dollars.
University student and staff Facebook groups are filled with angry messages and chaos reigns, as students are unable to access their personal information systems and cannot perform regular student tasks.
The university sent out an email blast informing about the attack that the academic institution has undergone and that they are working intensively to minimize the damage, while detailing some of the information that has leaked online.
No special instructions were given to those whose information was breached, and it was stated that the university has taken a series of actions to strengthen the security measures of the university's servers.
Good news for 40 settlements: The fiber optic cable is coming to Binyamin.
The trend of internet registration in the periphery continues rapidly and now the optical fiber reaches the Binyamin Regional Council, which includes 40 settlements.
The project, in collaboration with the council and the communication companies Teleran, X-Fiber and Rimon Internet, will start immediately after the holidays.
The Benjamin Regional Council signed a comprehensive agreement over the weekend to lay optical fibers in all council settlements.
The agreement with the 'Net-Fiber' initiative, in collaboration with 'Rimon' Internet, 'Telran' company and X-Fiber company, was signed after the completion of a large tender that the council has been working on in recent months.
The work will begin after the holidays and residents from 40 settlements of the council who are interested in connecting to the optical fiber infrastructure will enjoy high speeds of up to 1 gigabyte and advanced end equipment for the home that will allow strong WIFI reception, as required these days.
The subscribers will be able to choose between high-speed internet over optical fibers or filtered high-speed internet over optical fibers provided by Rimon Internet.
The council insisted that the market remains open to competition in any situation.
The head of the Binyamin Regional Council, Israel Gantz: "This is true Zionism."
This is great news for the residents.
The quality of life in Binyamin will improve, students will be able to study remotely if needed, it will be possible to work from home and establish advanced businesses in settlements that will have high-quality and uninterrupted internet.
I want to wish success to the dear companies in their implementation tasks in the settlements.
The residents are waiting for you."
Gantz added: "Soon we will have the conditions of fast internet among the best in Israel.
We worked for many months to bring the basis for the fiber installation and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank the Minister of Communications Yoaz Hendel who started this project with us during his previous term and now we are reaping the fruits of our labor, to the team of the Minister of Communications, the council members who were responsible for the details of the center and the CEOs of the companies that won the center for their professional quality, among the best in Israel.
The CEO of Rimon Internet, Yariv Far: "I thank the head of the council, Israel Gantz, and his team who immediately took up the challenge to bring good news to thousands of council residents who will switch to using fast internet that will upgrade the quality of life in the fields of education, economy and of course leisure."
The CEO of 'Teleran' Communication Group, Shai Aslan: "We are pleased with the decision of the Binyamin Council to connect to fast and powerful internet infrastructure, and I am confident that thanks to the extensive experience of the group, we will be able to provide residents with fast internet just like in the center of the country."
The CEO of X-Fiber, Israel Elitzur: "Establishing communication infrastructures in Binyamin is the Zionism of 2021, X-Fiber is proud to take part in the establishment of the modern infrastructure in the disputed areas of Binyamin, I have no doubt that thanks to our familiarity with the territories in general and Binyamin in particular, we will meet every engineering challenge in order to bring high-speed internet to every home across the council."
We checked: What do the side effects after the coronavirus vaccine mean?
Many people who get vaccinated feel weakness, fever, and fatigue after receiving the shot, while others do not feel anything.
Could this indicate a stronger immune system in those who do experience these symptoms, or is it a baseless rumor?
As more and more people get vaccinated, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are not true.
Is the immune system of those who developed strong side effects stronger than those whose bodies reacted less severely to the vaccine, which could perhaps prove that their system is not able to fight off a foreign body that enters the body?
"There are several levels of vaccine reactions," says Dr. David Dvir, head of primary care at Meuhedet and a member of the advisory committee for the Epidemic Management Team, and reassures: "Headaches, fatigue, pain at the site, these are the immediate reactions of the immune system.
This is how the body responds to the entry of a foreign body into the system."
Is there a connection between the levels of antibodies developed and side effects?
"There is no correlation between the symptoms and the development of antibodies against the virus.
About 50-60% experience side effects, but around 90% develop immunity against the virus.
It was not found that people who developed strong responses are more protected."
"In medical literature, there is no correlation between an immediate response and the level of vaccination.
In some of the experiments where people also received placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
This is also a psychological component - how a person perceives the vaccine, if they expect there to be side effects.
Many of the phenomena that occur could also happen normally, but since the public is biased, it attributes the reaction to the vaccine itself, and this is a distortion seen in relation to vaccines in general - attributing symptoms that occur close to the vaccination and are attributed to it.
According to Dr. Devir, the reasons for the reported widespread symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are still unknown.
Regarding myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation), opinions are divided.
"There are all sorts of theories on the subject, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One of the theories is that it's a strong response from the immune system.
Is it even possible to estimate the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the influenza virus, it was shown that those who did not sleep or were under high stress were more susceptible to infection."
Besides that, there are laboratory parameters that check the immune system or its components.
When there is a decline in the immune system, it is immediately noticeable.
People catch a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone is walking around with a weak immune system and is not aware of it.
These are people who come for investigations due to recurring events of infectious diseases, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, nutrition, sleep.
By the way, we also don't want an overly strong immune system, as it can cause autoimmune diseases."
Soon, MRNA vaccines will appear in other contexts, thanks to the vast knowledge that has been accumulated about them recently.
"There is no doubt that it will pave the way for other vaccines of this kind.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines - for treatments of oncological diseases, for example.
Their efficiency is that the substance stays in the body for a very short time - it enters, performs its action, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it received a significant boost due to the great need for rapid vaccination.
Now, for example, we know that a three-week gap between doses is too small, and some vaccination experts argue that we might not need another vaccine in the near future after the third dose, so it's unclear whether we are moving towards a situation of vaccination every six months or the third dose will provide a larger gap.
Thousands were affected: Serious privacy breach on Highway 6.
Highway 6 customers?
Your personal information, including full name, addresses, payment amounts, and full details of your trips, may have been exposed.
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Eretz company violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
After a report was submitted by Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6 in Israel, about a security incident that occurred in the company, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement process.
During the event, security weaknesses were revealed in her payment site, which allowed exposure of a lot of information from the company's customer invoices, which were exposed to everyone.
Among other things, customers' payment invoices were exposed over a long period of time and these invoices included personal information, including first and last names, payment amounts, vehicle location, travel dates and times.
Furthermore, since Derech Eretz company did not document its system access as required by law, it is impossible to accurately determine for how long unauthorized individuals could have accessed the company's systems.
In the violation letter, which was sent by the Privacy Protection Authority to the company, the Authority emphasized that most large companies and organizations are required to adopt a dynamic information security policy, and as threats and risks evolve, the organization has a duty to carefully examine the evolving risks and act accordingly to update the accepted security measures under the circumstances, according to the nature and type of the database.
As a result, companies and organizations are required to update their systems and conduct risk assessments and penetration tests, in order to examine the changing risks and prepare for them.
Also, companies and organizations are required to use an automatic documentation mechanism and to conduct employee training, in accordance with the Privacy Protection Regulations (Information Security).
According to the supervision findings, the authority determined that the company violated the privacy protection law and its regulations, and also required the company to take a number of corrective actions.
From Derech Eretz, the operator of Highway 6, it was stated: "The issue was handled in accordance with the strictest requirements."
Travel warning to Istanbul: A surprising announcement for Israelis from Turkish airlines.
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change their flight destination or date.
Good news for Israelis who booked tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: the airlines will allow to change the flight dates.
Reminder: Earlier this week, the Counter-Terrorism Bureau raised the travel warning severity to Istanbul to level four.
This is the highest level and it means "high threat level: do not travel to this country and if you are already there, leave as soon as possible."
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have announced that they will allow Israelis who booked their flight before the travel warning was issued, that is, before June 13, 2022, to change their flight destination or date.
This is done by contacting the airline company.
The Minister of Tourism, Rezbozov, said: "Israeli citizens should not have to pay an economic price because of terror threats."
I am glad that major airlines like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus responded to our request and I hope that other companies will provide a similar response to all Israeli citizens who canceled their vacation in Turkey due to the severe travel warning.

Saudi skies are getting closer: Israeli companies are preparing to increase flights to the East.
The emerging summary for extended flight freedom over Saudi Arabia: The airline is preparing to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of destinations in Europe.
The largest airline company in Israel is planning significant changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
As we reported in "Israel Today", the expectation is that Biden will announce approval for El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the United Arab Emirates.
The implication of the emerging agreement is that El Al will be able to fly shorter routes to Far East and Australia destinations.
To do this, the company will need to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, in order to free up planes for new destinations.
The destinations that flights will be cancelled to starting from the upcoming November are Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations with a significant Jewish population, but at this stage, they are less profitable for the company.
In contrast, the new destinations that El Al is considering are Tokyo in Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, and other places in the Far East.
This is how the process will be carried out: The Dreamliner planes flying to Canada will be released for long flights to the East.
The Boeing 737 planes flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be transferred for use on flights to destinations such as London and Paris, which El Al operates flights to using Dreamliner planes.
So essentially, the company could release larger planes to fly to additional destinations in the East.
Meanwhile, El Al is expecting discussions in the coming weeks regarding the possibility that Israeli airlines will be able to return to flying to Turkey, where the company can operate flights using the Boeing 737 aircraft of the airline.
Sorting out the mess: How much will you pay for a suitcase with each airline?

Exempt from quarantine for vaccinated and recovered individuals from non-red countries, foreign tourists are returning.
Those who landed in the country received messages from the Ministry of Health stating that they are exempt from the quarantine obligation upon receiving a negative result for the Corona test.
Only after that, the ministry issued an official statement stating that it only applies to passengers from orange countries, despite the fact that returnees from red countries also reported receiving the message.
In addition: Tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
At the peak of the pandemic - is this the end of quarantine for those returning from abroad?
The Ministry of Health sent messages this morning (Monday) to those returning to the country, stating that they are exempt from quarantine upon receiving a negative result for the coronavirus test they took after landing in Israel.
This also includes those returning from red countries.
Some of the messages that were sent informed the returnees that they could be released after receiving a negative response or after 24 hours at the latest, and some of them received the exemption after they received the negative response.
Only after that, an official announcement was released by the Ministry of Health stating that starting from midnight on January 4, 2022, vaccinated or recovered individuals returning from red countries will undergo a PCR test at Ben Gurion Airport and will enter isolation for 24 hours or until a negative result is received (whichever comes first).
The decision will be marked in a directive from the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be brought for approval to the Knesset's Health Committee.
The Ministry clarified that vaccinated or recovered individuals who have returned to Israel from a red country and received a negative result from the PCR test they took upon entering Israel, will end their quarantine at midnight and they are not required to take a second test.
Despite this, travelers from red countries reported that they also received the message.
Anyone who has not been vaccinated or recovered and returns from a red country, will enter home isolation for 14 days, with the possibility of shortening the isolation with a negative result of a PCR test conducted from the 7th day of landing in Israel (the day of landing is the first day).
The decision to lift most of the restrictions on flights, especially for the vaccinated, comes a day before the Supreme Court hearing filed by the Travel Agencies Association, the Open Skies Headquarters, and the Hotels Association.
In the discussion that will take place tomorrow, the petitioners are expected to demand the removal of all other red countries from the list, with Professor Itamar Grotto supporting them in his opinion.
Foreigners will also be able to enter.
The Prime Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Interior, Tourism, and Transportation have agreed that starting from Sunday, January 9, 2022, vaccinated/recovered foreigners (as defined by the Ministry of Health) from red countries will be allowed to enter, subject to filling out an online form in advance, performing a PCR or antigen test before boarding the plane, performing a PCR test upon entering Israel and then entering quarantine for 24 hours or receiving a negative test result (whichever comes first).
Non-vaccinated/non-recovered foreigners (according to the Ministry of Health's definition) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, except those whose entry has been approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The group's plan will not be renewed at this stage.
And what about red countries?
The Committee for Country Classification at the Ministry of Health recommends to the government to remove the following countries from the red list and move them to the orange list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The countries that remain at this stage on the red list are: United Arab Emirates, USA, Ethiopia, United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland, and Turkey.
Another option that the Ministry of Health is considering is to exempt vaccinated individuals returning from red countries from quarantine.
Currently, it is unclear whether there is a connection between the messages received this morning by those returning to Israel and the guidelines that may be issued by the Ministry of Health on this matter.
No response has been received from the Ministry of Health yet.
The skies are starting to open: The Ministry of Health is changing the restrictions on the country's borders.
Vaccinated individuals returning from red countries will be required to quarantine for 24 hours.
The countries USA, Turkey, Britain and the United Arab Emirates will be defined as red.
After long weeks in which it was very difficult to find a destination to fly to without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were required to quarantine, alongside the ban on tourists entering Israel - yesterday it was decided to change the procedures and significantly ease the restrictions on Ben Gurion Airport.
The Ministry of Health has decided to recommend cancelling the three-day quarantine requirement for Israelis returning from red countries.
So far, anyone who is vaccinated or recovered according to the Ministry of Health's definitions and returned from a red country - is required to be in isolation for three days, subject to two corona tests.
Now, the quarantine that vaccinated and recovered individuals returning from red countries will have to enter is for 24 hours at most, or until they receive the results of the coronavirus tests conducted after landing at Ben Gurion Airport (whichever comes first).
Anyone who is not defined as vaccinated or recovered will still be required to enter seven days of isolation subject to two corona tests, or 14 days without the second test, whether returning from an orange country or a red country.
A vaccinated or recovered person returning from a red country is also required to be in full quarantine.
The updated list of red countries recommended by the Ministry of Health, which still needs government approval, includes the USA, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, Britain, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates.
In all countries, except Turkey, the average of positives who entered the country in the last two weeks is more than 5% of all entrants, which automatically puts them on the red countries list.
The rate of increase among patients from Turkey is fast, the rate of positive returnees from it stands at just over 4%, and therefore it was decided to also include it in the list of red countries.
The prominent countries that were removed from the red list: France, Spain, Portugal, and Canada.
Starting from January 9, vaccinated tourists who meet the Ministry of Health's requirements will be able to enter Israel without the need for quarantine, similar to the conditions for Israelis returning from a red-listed country.
In this case too, the decision is subject to government approval, which will discuss the matter in the coming days.
It's important to note that there are few cases where the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this field.
The tourists are against the restrictions.
The Travel Agencies Association, the Open Skies headquarters, and the Hotels Association have filed a petition to the Supreme Court to cancel the flight restrictions.
The country lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but as mentioned, it left eight significant countries on the red list.
In the discussion that will take place this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand the state to cancel the list of red countries.
The one who will support the petitioners' position is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
The Minister of Tourism, Yoel Razvozov, who has supported easing restrictions on foreign tourists entering Israel in recent weeks, said yesterday: "Cancelling the quarantine for vaccinated returnees from abroad and resuming tourism for the vaccinated is the right and just thing to do at this time."
I am grateful to my government colleagues, who understood the crisis of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighs the benefit.
The vaccine is the best response to the pandemic, and as such - the vaccinated public should be able to maintain a feasible lifestyle alongside the coronavirus.
With an investment of 200 million shekels: The new resort that will open near Arad.
The desert blooms: Another luxury hotel is expected to open in about three years.
Chef restaurants, private pools, and 110 rooms are just a small part of what the hotel will offer.
All the details in the article.
7MINDS from the Fattal Group and the real estate company White City Buildings, jointly purchased a plot of land spanning about 20 dunams in the Judean Desert, where they will build a luxurious resort with an investment of about 200 million shekels. The hotel will be built on the same site where the Masada hotel was demolished about a year ago.
The resort will only open in about three years and will have 110 rooms, some of which will have private pools.
The hotel will also have three shared pools, a spa, chef restaurants, a recreation area, a fitness room and more.
The one who will be responsible for the culinary side of the hotel is Chef Ran Shmueli from Claro restaurant.
Chef Shmueli will be the one to create the menu, which is expected to have a unique desert concept for the resort.
The Mayor of Arad, Attorney Nisan Ben Hamo, praised the project: "The decision to build a new and luxurious hotel near Arad officially endorses the amazing progress that Arad has made in the tourism sector in recent years.
I am proud of the entrepreneurs' choice and I am convinced that it will be a joint success since Arad has a huge tourism potential."

.
The largest airline company in Israel reports an increase in demand for flights abroad since the announcement yesterday about significant easing for travelers.

As part of the new campaign, the company offers flights to Berlin, Budapest, Barcelona, Madrid, Prague, Athens, Amsterdam, Lisbon and other destinations with prices starting from about $60 for round trips.

Almost everyone nowadays has an "old" tablet or smartphone lying unused in a cupboard.
Just because a slightly newer and more sophisticated model has come out, any device can be a Spotify player with a hotspot connection.
Old devices can be used as dash cams, remote controls for home appliances, and many other uses.
We don't have to be victims of consumer culture and we don't always have to be at the forefront of technology, with yet another useless gadget.
Collecting data without analysis.
It's a shame.
It would be more interesting to hear how many people received pensions from Israel Post, how much the real estate of the branches (located in the city centers) is worth, and what the minimum wage of the employees is.
It is forbidden to harass Israel Post.
How many packages arrived and how many were distributed?
Because they have hidden so much from them.
Packages are ordered, and they disappear at the sorting center in Modi'in...
There should be a 5 shekel package tax so people won't just order nonsense for a shekel and overload the mail.
This mainly reflects the high cost of living in the country.
Thanks to the king of fakes who made it preferable to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to approach the mail, hoping that no letters will come from them and the hatred for mail has led us to give up anything related to the possibility of mail.
Have a good week.
To fire all the postal workers, and start rebuilding the post - by a private company.
Employers are arrogant and some of them are racists!
People speak differently on the phone and when they come for an interview, their true face is revealed.
No wonder they can't find workers.
They are looking for slaves.
Servant's jobs.
Everyone is invited to get to know authentic Judaism.
Well done.
Lucky you that you have merited.
Whoever withstands the trials and remains in holiness will only see light all his life.
Simply lovely.
What a mess.
No Tunisian is forced to hide his Jewish identity.
Historically, this is not correct.
A hairy and ugly monkey that was taken down from a tree. Ahhhhhhhhhhh.
Pricing waste

A few years ago, I had a dream of draping a string of pearls over Esti's red beret.
She's beautiful and talented!!

Don't worry, it's not for a long time.
Currently, it has no benefit.
How do you know it's true love...
They returned to each other after 20 years!!
And she is even older than him.
And he is a handsome, rich and famous hunk.
And in a few more months, they reported a separation of forces.
There are women who can wake up with a new husband every morning.
It's a shame he didn't participate in Eurovision.
We hope that maybe next year he will participate with his original song.
There will come the big breakthrough.
Instead, the egotist from the supermarket who brought it only made a mess.
Where is this Yemenite Greenberg from, hahaha!
Who is this?!
Why is he appearing on a news site??
Here it's not Gia Pines nor the nonsense of Moses' exit.
It smells like a greased and disguised PR, masquerading as a news article, hiding behind the newspaper's system name.
The joke is on us, the captive readers, who have escaped from the clutches of Moses Harsi and are looking for an alternative.
The song is not to my taste and the video clip is also bland.
Lovely lovely lovely.
What a talent!!!!
They want more and more from him.
Tamir Greenberg is a great singer at the level of an international star.
The State of Israel is too small for him.
He will eventually make it big abroad.
Clinical optometrist?!
Well, her "degree" is not recognized in her country of origin....
Who is the next sector in line?
Bibists?
And they did not mention the main mapping of the fund.
Elk Clinical Optometrist.
She excuses herself.
Where will the sirens be?
War is at the door, they are preparing us.
And what will the war veterans do, some cruelty.
Bennett, Lapid and Gantz in guiding Biden: Get ready friends, get ready....
Because they are the champions of champions!!
Hahaha but don't worry, even when we have messed up and stupid managers, we have abilities above and beyond what's expected!!
True, and besides, our dimensions, like most of them, are messed up.
The Home Front Command is playing "pretend" games, because in reality - who knows...
Why only in Tel Aviv?
Everything else is a right-wing clarification.
Despite the nice talks - we haven't heard about the arrest of hackers, their prosecution or any legal actions taken against them.
And in the last four elections, was the election committee prepared for an attack?
Why not specify for example...
Several attempts to infiltrate and disrupt have been made and some have succeeded in penetrating the election committee in the last 3 years.
Don't we deserve some data, facts, and proportionality?
One of the most bizarre signings of Hapoel Jerusalem.
Good luck Oz.
You will always be a part of Maccabi's legacy...
Thank you from the bottom of my heart!
All of you are pessimists, just complaints and responses, classic armchair potatoes.
Baldwin is a social bomb in the dressing room, say players who played with him both in Greece and Spain!
Holins was injured and did not play in the last games of the Red Star...
Hilliard also got injured and didn't play for the last half a year...
Heavy betting.
Maccabi is missing a star.
What is really going on with Braun?
If Maccabi doesn't sign, it could be in trouble.
What about Lorenzo Brown?
Hahaha, it fits like a glove to the hand of a loser to the team of......
Adam is a great player, the coach must give him more minutes, not give up on him. Hapoel needs a large squad, it's absolutely forbidden to give up on him.
No.
Bring Adrian Banks.
We need more strong Israelis on the team.
Those who really play.
Much more suitable than Wilbekin for the newly built Maccabi.
You can see that there are professionals in Maccabi - Blatt and Katash.
Perhaps his personal abilities are still not comparable to Scottie's, but his team player skills and especially his game intelligence are much higher.
It's so sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis are just warming the bench.
By the way, Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners, therefore they will not succeed with all the stars they have scraped from around the world.
Who cares???
If we're already watching a game where 6 American players and 3 Israelis are just for decoration, wouldn't it be better to watch a Golden State game?
The puzzle will be completed when the league ends.
Good luck.
Good column.
I loved it.
Regarding the Israelis, he is absolutely right!!
And a note about Ziv - we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the Euroleague he can't be a leader, but his decline in performance in the league also indicates that he has lost his confidence (which is not surprising after the treatment he received after 2 poor games in the Euroleague, as if Zalgiris didn't have such games) and perhaps his usage is also not correct, and it is a result of the coach's stubbornness and templates.
With all due respect, Blazer is not a scorer...
Yiftach Ziv should not be in Maccabi Tel Aviv, he is ruining it too much.
Sometimes there is not a good game but Sorkin, Blazer Dudi and also Cohen today, well done.
Ido Ashdod, a Hapoel Holon fan, was given 500 NIS so he writes nonsense.
In the picture is not Federman.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jake Cohen are much better than Colliero and Taylor who in Europe play for twenty minutes and can't score a basket, who needs foreigners at a zero level, it's much better for the Israelis to play.
It's good that there is a positive spirit for everyone, players, coach, and management throughout the momentum.
It depends on the increase of the internal reinforcement...
And a significant and necessary reinforcement of the center and guard.
And this is the management's part.
That's not correct.
The indirect human interaction is important from many aspects.
The answer to this research is that social isolation is bad both professionally and truthfully, what is surprising and disappointing here is the surprise.
So turn off the zoom on the camera and the problem is solved.
What happened, did the researchers use zoom and therefore their creativity was not enough for this solution?
How do we know what will happen in 30 years?
Someone here missed an important detail.
Scientists are not interested in global warming or rainmakers.
They are only interested in the population growth rate.
They are working on more and more vaccines and genetic methods to destroy the world's population, so they tell us fake stories about global warming and other nonsense they invent.
There is no problem in drinking water, in unlimited quantities.
They said it 50 years ago.
Meanwhile, there are more people.
The solution is limiting birth, mainly in poor places and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the rest of the leftists who are anti their countries, and in all religions that believe in violence - among the fools, the ignorant, the stupid, the blind, or in short - among the herds.
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living organisms (including mammals) consume oxygen and emit carbon dioxide.
The solution: Pessimists, go kill yourselves!
It's green.
Good for the world.
May it be better for you, and surely for the Earth and for all of us.
Who are the scientists and how did they conduct the research?
I don't believe in any research that talks about global warming because it doesn't exist.
He is inclined to control us and rob us of our freedom and liberty.
Everything is part of the new world order.
And writers like Asaf Golan are on their side, as he did during the Corona period.
I have never heard him present facts from both sides, he always brings up the side that serves the globalists.
They are bullying us.
They are just wasting money on so-called "academic" doodle "research".
As usual, another nonsense from the land of nonsense of the psychopathic narcissists.
The situation is actually improving. Human knowledge is expanding along with new technologies and improvements.
For centuries, the world's population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only improving.
The Chinese, for example, have launched a massive project to combat the Gobi desert, with amazing success.
The Saudis are doing the same thing and they are also succeeding (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
Ironically, the "climate crisis" nonsense of the alarmists (carbon dioxide emissions, which plants need) is what's making the Sahara greener, but hey, it doesn't fit the alarmist agenda, so you won't read about it in the newspapers...
The leftists are not worried.
Their urine goes straight to their head and that's how they avoid dehydration.
Does proper water management mean cutting off at least 70% of the world's population?
It's astonishing that COVID came and it's astonishing that most of the population is injected with an experimental substance, the consequences of which for a period of 5-25 years on those injected are completely unknown.
It's also amazing that Agenda 2030 is underway and now this?
The whole story is really strange!!!
Hahaha what a bullshit.
The stories of One Thousand and One Nights, all the fears and of course the nonsense of the left trying to rule the world through control of the media, five years ago they announced that there would be no more rain in Australia and this year they have enough rain for two years.
They said that even in the country it no longer rains and the drought is permanent, but now there is rain.
They also told that Rabin did not kill Jews in the Altalena and Peres did not know that the children of Yemenites were being kidnapped.
Of course, Moshe Dayan did not loot antiquities and Chaim Weizmann did not meddle with his soldiers.
It's clear that you are promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Disgusting noise.
They should also take care of reception in the axes, deal with power outages and voltage drops and we are on the wave.
"This is true Zionism" just like the opening of a Rami Levy branch in Yeruham is Zionism.
Following the rogue Bennett, the rest of the sycophantic politicians straightened their line in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I won't go near El Al, more accurately "Shoe On".
It was very nice, goodbye and not see you later.
You won't even see us in your dreams.
Another big shame, we in Israel are held hostage by El Al company, all the direct flights are in their hands, they are raising prices, it's better to just walk already, it's time for truly open skies.
Some are focusing on this matter of flights to the East.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows El Al to fly over its territory, it will not add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy, it's not such a game changer.
It's better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, acquisition of Israeli technology, transportation from the ports of Ashdod and Haifa through Jordan to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates, tourism and the opportunity for Israeli infrastructure companies to work in Saudi Arabia.
It's much more interesting than saving an hour each on 30 flights a week.
It is more important to allow the Air Force squadrons to be stationed in the Persian Gulf in order to strike Iran and to organize the Emirates in Bahrain, Oman, Egypt, and Morocco to launch a non-stop attack on Iran for a month until the complete destruction of all its military infrastructure.
And for another air force squadron to position in northern Saudi Arabia and strike the Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq from a less crowded eastern area.
After we finish with Iran, Saudi Arabia could push Oman, Kuwait, Djibouti, and the Comoros Islands to make a peace agreement with Israel and achieve a majority of the Arab League countries that have joined the peace.
After the regime change in Iran, the end of the World Cup, the stabilization of the oil and gas market, and Erdogan's replacement, it could also help Saudi Arabia to overthrow the regime in Qatar and finally eliminate this country's subversion and its support for other Muslims and Hamas.
When all these common interests end, we can talk about a few more El Al flights, if El Al survives until then.
El Al needs to be closed down.
Selling tickets for flights that do not exist.
The worst part is that there is no way to reach a representative.
"There is no customer service."
Whoever buys a ticket from El Al and wants to change or cancel it, should forget about it, it's a sure loss.
You've been warned.
Air Canada is preferred.
In any case, they prefer to fly in a swarm.
The company has turned from a mediocre company to a hellish company.
Even El Al has lowered its standards.
The best thing would be to call a taxi.
The driver will load the suitcases for free.
And you will travel by train to the field.
40 euros for a suitcase on Ryanair is much cheaper than Wizz.
You can carry a backpack weighing up to 8 kg.
Why are you lying?
Wizz Air on cargo and the return flight takes significantly longer!!!
One big mess.
Just for example, I just came back with Etihad.
The allowed weight is 30 kg.
7 kg trolley.
And every additional 1 kg is 30 dollars.
Go update yourself.
All companies are stealing the customer.
They advertise very low prices but in the end, it's about the size of a school bag.
A trolley already costs money and a suitcase is very, very expensive.
Luckily, the airlines don't ask us to come to the flight with just underwear and a tank top to avoid weight on the plane.
At El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% of the cost when ordering up to 6 hours before the flight.
The Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis have always been and remain successful schemers.
A land that devours its inhabitants and continues to devour.
To this, one must add genetic stinginess.
It's also a shame for our country that allows foreign airlines to exploit Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does as they please.
So what did you learn today that it's not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket..
They prepared a surprise for all of us..
You will pay extra for the airplane wheels, for the windows, for the luggage that doesn't arrive, for the food, for the drinks, and they will surely add for the toilets.
In short, stay at home and the prices will go down..
Or go out in boats.
The journey will take a few days.
Throw up and then you'll probably arrive.
Bennett wants to test how much he can attack and harm Israel, and still earn the endorsement and support of his new fans.
Open now?
It's not a coincidence.
Just when the chaos starts, there is an exemption, it's simply crazy what's happening here...
This is not the peak of the pandemic.
Shimon, it's not suitable for you.
The number of confirmed cases increasing does not mean that the number of sick people is increasing.
Stop getting tested for every little thing, stay home if you don't feel well.
The story is over.
A government of lunatics.
The government and Bennett are mainly a ground operation.
Loss of control.
And mainly stupidity.
And for public confusion, a score of 0.
Only more severe damage.
I suggest you open a new section: "The daily and cumulative number of deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave."
The faces and images behind the default.
Your rating will plummet.
You don't understand that the Finance Minister is trying to avoid paying compensation to tourism workers.
It brings more infection.
They are not interested in the people.
8500 have died so far.
Is anyone talking about this?
They are burying us, especially the elderly.
We have become Russia/North Korea.
If we don't talk about it - it doesn't exist!!
The main thing is that the citizens put money into the state treasury to fatten the ministers' pockets and buttocks!
It turns out that Doberman and Abbas are the Prime Minister!!
Very well, the Omicron delay was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half the population, and there is no point in trying to stop the Omicron - which is more prevalent here than in Israel.
Statistically, someone coming from a red-listed country is less dangerous than someone who is already here.
This is the first time I see logical steps taken by the Israeli government in the fight against Corona.
As if someone really sat down and crunched the numbers, unlike Bibi - who did what he thought would look better in the newspaper (and failed in all aspects).
The government decided at its best:
The Finance Minister who told driving instructors to find a new profession two weeks ago, is now opening the skies for tourists.
The Minister of Education, Yifat Shasha-Biton, is undermining the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health and setting her own policy, which is causing complete chaos in all schools!
The Foreign Minister, a joker who arrives at the government meeting sick with Corona.
And the most clownish Prime Minister we've ever had in the country, is not in control of the situation and is losing his temper like the last of the hooligans.
Simply a government without leadership, without direction, that all of Israel has lost faith in.
Go home and it's better an hour earlier!!!
In my opinion, maybe it comes not from a good place but from a place of losing control.
Now the apartment prices there will jump to 50 million per apartment.
Well, where are all the seers?
They are building a bus station and believe it will affect all the houses.
By the way, except for the sponsorship fees afterwards.
If they reduce the exorbitant property tax prices of Arad, the hotel will return to being a white elephant like its predecessor.
It looks amazing.
Lots of success.
I want it.
What about the art of posing completely naked?
Giving up on the garbage.
A serious fight for the open field.
The sword holder is wondering why benefits are not given to the girls in the Galilee occupied by the Muslim brothers of the sword holder.
Everyone to the taps.
In the current reality, is the south still ours?!
Do you need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
Surely the members of the Knesset will be there too!!
What about a folk hotel for a folk person?
Kudos to the investments in the flourishing South.
Arad is developing and thriving, and all credit goes to the mayor, since the beginning of his term there has been a positive explosion for the betterment and glory of the city of Arad.
Culture, society, education and more on the rise.
Simply an excellent mayor who improved the city!
Well done.
It's interesting how much sponsorship money the resort owner will pay to the Bedouins.
Did you raise money for sponsorship fees?
Wow, sounds good.
Those who can afford it should only fly with El Al - a company with the best service and security in the world.
Does anyone know when it was possible to fly to Dubai?
El Al is a tin company.
Neither socially nor economically.
In recent weeks, it has cancelled return flights from abroad, you understand, sent messages to Israelis telling them that the flight was cancelled, ruining the entire trip, told passengers to leave a message on WhatsApp or Messenger and they would get back, but they only responded after a day, two or even three.
The trip was ruined.
Besides, isn't it better to ground planes, instead of flying them back to the country, and also prevent economic damage?
Are there still suckers who fly El Al?
I wouldn't fly with them even for free.
Have they already returned the millions they took from the customers?
A round trip ticket from Izmir to Geneva is 70 euros.
El Al one way $560.
The deceitful religious man who rules the society along with his messed up son, I wouldn't buy even for 10 dollars, they are constant scammers...
And then the company will cancel the flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their implementation will be with an additional price change.
Whoever purchases tickets from El Al puts their money on the wing of the plane.
Metal company.
Exercises by Lovo Cost company.
Without suitcases, without seat selection, certainly without taxes and without food.
Vacation and Corona flights...
To all members of the "coalition"... charge!
Nature thins out fools!!
