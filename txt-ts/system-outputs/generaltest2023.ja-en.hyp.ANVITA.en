It is a great achievement of the feed support fishery of the Kiyotsu Central Zoo.
The plant was established in 2011 with the mission of sending fish for feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
In recent years, the company has been providing support to farms in Chongjin City, including the procurement of farming materials, while exceeding its fishing plans.

FUJI System Development to Prevent Accidents Left Behind | Chubu Keizai Shimbun Economic information of Aichi, Gifu, Mie and Shizuoka
FUJI Co., a Japanese company that manufactures and sells robots and machine tools for mounting electronic components, has begun developing a system to prevent children from being left behind in cars.
A motion sensor is installed in the car, and when it detects the movement of a person, it sends a notification to the phone or chat.
Currently, the company is conducting a demonstration experiment with a pick-up vehicle at its own facility.
In the midst of painful accidents caused by being left behind, we will protect the safety of children.
Currently, the company is conducting a demonstration experiment with two shuttle vehicles of "teracoya THANK," an English conversation after-school for children operated by the company in Chiryu City.
A motion sensor that detects the movement of people based on the temperature difference between them and the surrounding environment is installed in three places on the ceiling of the vehicle.
When the vehicle's engine is turned off and the door is closed, a warning is automatically sent when a person's movement is detected after a certain period of time has elapsed.
By linking engine and door status with information, false positives are prevented as much as possible.
Notifications of warnings are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling a pre-registered number, it is displayed in a chat on a computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, so that mistakes such as oversights do not occur.
The demonstration experiment is expected to continue until around the end of February.
"During the experiment, we were able to see issues other than the system," said Kazumitsu Kamiya, chief of Section 2 of the Innovation Promotion Department.
For example, they were able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"If we can expand our solutions," he says, "we can do it."
The impetus for the development of the system was a series of accidents that left a shuttle bus behind in Japan.
An employee with young children suggested what they could do to keep their children safe.
The company decided to develop the system to take advantage of its know-how in information management using IoT (Internet of Things) and sensors, which it had cultivated through its factory automation (FA) related business.
FUJI's system to prevent people from leaving their homes behind is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed by simply fixing it to the ceiling with a pin.
Since the system can be easily retrofitted to pick-up and drop-off vehicles, the company aims to lower the barrier to adoption and popularize the system.
With the cooperation of nursery schools and kindergartens, the company plans to commercialize the technology.
[Editorial] The start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tsuruga to Shin-Osaka, which was scheduled for the beginning of 2023, has been postponed, and the town development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture is beginning to be affected.
In Obama City, where the new station is located, the detailed location of the station is still not indicated, and urban planning, including the surrounding area, is at a standstill.
The development of the plan is expected to take a long time, and it should be announced as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station planned for Obama City is the only new station west of Tsuruga Station.
In 2019, the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency (JRTA) indicated the approximate location of the station within a radius of about 2.5 kilometers, centered on JR Higashi-Obama Station.
The detailed location and route of the station were targeted for the winter of 2022.
In Obama City, a project related to the Shinkansen will be launched in earnest in fiscal 2021, with the opening of Tsuruga and the opening of Obama.
In the initial budget for fiscal 2022, the city plans to increase the number of projects and promote community development in anticipation of the location of the new station being announced.
However, the exact location of the new station is not yet known.
The city has set aside 3 million yen (about U.S. $3,300) in its budget for this fiscal year as a project to consider land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station and formulate a basic plan, but it is expected to remain unimplemented.
City planning centered on the new station "takes time to build consensus among citizens," a city official said.
There is an example in Echizen City of a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to compile the overall concept.
There is a concern that the later the announcement is made, the shorter the preparation period for the opening of the station will be and the greater the impact on the surrounding area.
Prior to the location of the new station, there was a sense of uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga Station.
In October last year, a civic group in Kyoto City submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) calling for the government to withdraw the plan.
In response to the postponement of the start of construction in Ishikawa Prefecture's political circles, there have been a series of moves to return the already settled route to its starting point, including calls for reconsideration of the Maibara route, and it is difficult to say that neighboring prefectures are monolithic.
Although the residents of Obama City are relatively calm about the postponement of the start of construction, the location of the new station is unknown, and if the opening date remains unclear, there is concern that it will affect the momentum in the future.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue his campaign to request the national government to open the entire line as soon as possible, but the voices of the regions along the line calling for the construction to begin as soon as possible are indispensable.
The national government and neighboring prefectural and municipal governments cannot be moved if they are indifferent to the idea that the Shinkansen (bullet train) will pass (to the west of Tsuruga) someday.
I want the enthusiasm to keep raising my voice.
On February 9, the Seibu Fukui branch in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, held a chocolate tasting event for Valentine's Day.
With the price of chocolates soaring in stores ahead of Valentine's Day on February 14 due to soaring prices of raw materials and packaging materials, sales of chocolates for personal use and high-priced chocolates for family and friends are booming.
Retail stores and confectionery stores in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that emphasize local colors, luxury, and attention to ingredients.
The Seibu Fukui store (Fukui City) opened a special sales area on the 6th floor event hall on January 25.
Up to the 14th, the store has sold about 450 kinds of 40 brands, including 10 confectionery stores in the prefecture.
Chocolate made with Fukui's local sake and sandwiched between fresh chocolate and cookies are popular.
According to the store representative, store prices of many products have increased by about 10% compared to the previous year.
As for this year's trend, "Many of the products are characterized by sticking to the ingredients and adding a sense of luxury to the packaging.As a trend, consumers tend to buy for themselves and their families and enjoy eating and comparing."
Despite the headwinds of price hikes, sales in the high-price range are said to be strong.
Average price increase of 25 yen per grain due to high prices.
"We are trying to create a space where people can enjoy the Valentine's Day event itself," said the person in charge.
The store has been selling daily recommended sweets since January 26, and has resumed tasting for the first time in three years.
Western-style confectionery company Kurabu (headquartered in Ippontanaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai City) launched its original chocolate series "KISEKI" for the first time at the end of last year, which was jointly developed with a well-established French chocolate manufacturer.
They are particular about cacao beans and are characterized by a fruity taste that suppresses bitterness, and are sold for 1,000 yen for 3 pieces and 3,000 yen for 9 pieces.
Ryoma Takakura, director and general manager of the company's purchasing department, says, "While the culture of giri-choco is gradually fading, there is a demand to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine's Day, and we will try to differentiate our products by increasing the added value of our products."
How to get chocolates from women...
On the 9th, a company employee in her twenties (Fukui City) visited the Seibu Fukui store and said, "I have always loved chocolate, so I got a job and got money, so I want to buy it as a reward for myself."
A company employee in her thirties who bought a giri chocolate said, "It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolate, but since it is once a year, I want to give it to my family and people who are usually indebted to me, but the number of people who give it may be reduced."
Products using Fukui Plum Blossoms and Prefectural Midi Tomatoes (February 9, Fukui Prefectural Government)
Seven-Eleven Japan Co. announced on February 9 that it will start selling six products, including new products using ingredients from Fukui Prefecture, such as sweet shrimp, at 339 stores in the three prefectures of the Hokuriku region.

Governor Sugimoto, who tasted the soup, said, "The sweet shrimp broth is delicious."
"We would like to continue to develop products using products from Fukui Prefecture," said a company representative.
The ruins of Ushigahara Castle, which is said to have been built in preparation for the battle with Heisen-ji Temple: Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
The Inuikawa area of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, where the large-scale Ushigahara Manor once stood.
Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built in the middle of the Nabetoko mountain in the area in preparation for the battle with Heisenji Temple, which was in conflict with the manor in the Kamakura period.
He appears in the war chronicle 'Taiheiki.'
Although there are no materials concerning Ushigahara Castle, the following is written in 'Echizen Ushigahara jito suicides' in volume 11 of Taiheiki (The Record of the Great Peace).
Tokiharu, Ukyo no suke (Assistant Governor of Ukyo Province) of the Awa River, who was an official of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), was dispatched to Ono as jito (manager and lord of manor).
In 1333, the Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto), which was established in Kyoto to monitor the Imperial Court and control the western provinces, was overthrown by Takauji ASHIKAGA, and furthermore, the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was destroyed by Yoshisada NITTA.
When Tokiharu's retainers heard the news that Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto) was destroyed, they ran away immediately, and only about 20 of them remained.
Taking advantage of this situation, the armed priests of Heisen-ji Temple attacked.
When Tokiharu let his wife and two children into the river, he followed them and committed suicide.
An impregnable castle where Nobunaga, Hideyoshi and Ieyasu stood together
In 2014, the "Inui Side History Story" was published by a group of local residents called "Inui Side History Story."
The story of Tokiharu is introduced in comics so that even elementary school students can easily understand it.
Masao Kitagawa, 75, who was involved in the publication, said, "I want the local people to learn about the history that is familiar to them and pass it on to future generations."

You can go to the castle ruins by the mountain trail maintained by the association that makes the Inui side better.
It is about 200 meters from the trailhead.
The road leading to the trailhead may be impassable due to snow in winter.

There are about 220 houses in the village.
In the past, he published "Inui Side Torisetsu," which introduced the tumuli, historic sites, and highlights in the area.
Rennyo no Sato Awara, a roadside station under construction in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture, will open on April 22.
In anticipation of the opening of Awara Onsen Station on the Hokuriku Shinkansen line in the spring of 2024, the facility is expected to be used by about 360,000 people annually as a new regional promotion and tourist base in the northern area of the city.
The station's main food and beverage and merchandise sales facilities are single-story steel-framed buildings with a total floor area of 975 square meters.
The total area of the roadside station, including the parking lot and Nagisa Children's Park, is 8,137 square meters.
The facility also has a rest area and a tourist information center.
Electric bicycles are available for rent and shower rooms are also available.
The two parking lots will accommodate a total of 66 small and large vehicles (including three for the disabled).
Mayor Mori Yukitsugu of the city made it clear at a regular press conference held on February 8.
At the food and drink corner, parfaits made with fruits from the northern hills of Sakai and Tomitsu Kintoki pie are sold.
They are working on developing menus that use plenty of local products, such as tamago kake gohan using Fukuji chicken and autumn-winter limited dishes using eels from Kitagata.
Currently, about 60 businesses are members of the "Shippers' Council" of the direct sales office.
There will also be a full lineup of processed foods such as boxed lunches and side dishes, as well as agricultural and garden products such as seedlings and plants.
In the souvenir corner, works by artists residing in the Kanatsu Creative Forest Museum are exhibited and sold, as well as sweets, sake, and traditional crafts.
In the ranking of roadside stations in the Kinki region, 'Minami-Echizen-yamakairi' ranked first.
The designated manager of the station is Awa Running LLC (2-chome Yoshizaki, Awara City), which was established by Mr. Masashi Miyatani, president of Tsuki Usagi no Sato, a theme park in Kaga City, Ishikawa Prefecture, where people can interact with rabbits.
At the press conference, Mayor Mori said, "We will restore and improve the vitality and vitality of the entire Awara City, which will lead to the improvement of the lives of local residents and the revitalization of the region."
This is a cat-shaped catering robot introduced at the Fukui Station Store.
(Mainichi / Ote 2-chome, Fukui, Fukui Prefecture)
In the restaurant industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, there is a growing movement to introduce a robot that delivers food to customers.
In addition to being useful for labor-saving store operations and "contactless" customer service to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, the robot's adorable facial expression has been well received by family customers.
Restaurant owners and related parties have commented that it will be difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, and that delivery robots will become even more popular.
"Jin, Jin, Genghis Khan."
While playing light music, a robot that displays the face of a cat on the screen puts food on it and runs smoothly inside the store.
When he arrives at the table, he talks to the customer, saying, "I brought the food you ordered."
In August 2022, Fukui Station Store, located in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped delivery robot.
When the robot is waiting near the kitchen, it places the food ordered by the customer on the table, presses the table number on the screen, and autonomously runs to the table and delivers it.
It has a built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice function that responds when customers touch it, and the expression of the cat's face on the screen is rich.
The "Bonta Group," which operates the store, has introduced a food delivery robot in two stores, including the store.
President Toshiyuki Saito says that the biggest reason for introducing the system is labor shortage, and emphasizes that it is a part of productivity improvement through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of personnel expenses to store sales is usually about 30%, but the introduction has reduced it to 21 to 22%.
The robot is also responsible for collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, which leads to more efficient cleanup. "Families and children are happy, and it also has a publicity effect," he adds.
The rokken Hoshiyama Fukui branch, a yakiniku and horumon nabe restaurant in Araki Shinpo-cho, Fukui City, also introduced a delivery robot in August 2022.
Mr. Eifuku Hoshiyama, the president of Seongsan Shoten, said, "Even if we recruit employees and part-timers, they don't come easily, so I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
At the Fukui store, the robot delivery range is separated from the zone where employees serve meals.
The lease fee for the robot is said to be about the same as the salary of a part-time worker.
In order to save labor, the store is considering introducing a tablet ordering system in addition to robots and self-checkout.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, in December 2022, the ratio of job offers to job seekers was 6.94 for "customer service" in restaurants, etc., a job with a high sense of labor shortage.
A person in charge at Net System (Takagi Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which is the sales agent for the delivery robot, said, "Due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the shortage of workers at restaurants in the prefecture has become serious, and there are many inquiries about the introduction of robots."
Hoshiyama said, "It will be even more difficult for suburban stores in rural areas to secure employees, and I think that delivery robots will become more popular."
[Editorial] The town of Echizen makes an ending note and distributes it to the people who want it.
In the year before last, she published the "Okuyami Handbook," which covers the procedures required when a relative passes away, as well as the inheritance list and family tree, and many people came to receive it for themselves.
Lectures on how to write an ending note and how to organize it during life are often held in various parts of the prefecture, and it seems that "shukatsu" has become firmly established among the residents of the prefecture.
The first edition of the book has 35 pages.
Starting with a review of my history in five chapters, I will write about my current state of health and wealth, future nursing care, end-of-life care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section where you can write about what you want to do for the rest of your life and messages for your loved ones.
It's hard to write 35 pages, but you don't have to fill all the pages.
What do you most want to write down for your family and the people around you?
The important thing is to have a clear purpose.
Bookstores sell a variety of notebooks according to the purpose, and it is said that you can easily start from where you can write.
It is said that the word "shukatsu" was born in 2009, likening it to job hunting.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly," and more people are preparing for their own end and the end.
More than 10 years have passed since then.
The COVID-19 pandemic that hit the world has not yet subsided.
Prices have risen since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and electricity prices have soared to an unexpected level this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current high prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, funeral expenses, nursing care expenses, and grave management were shared by siblings and relatives, but now it is not uncommon to have only one child.
In addition, although life expectancy has increased significantly compared to a decade ago, the older we get, the greater the risk of dementia and the need for long-term care.
I would like to keep in mind that the background to the fact that the end of life was not a transient one but took root is also the rise of social unrest.
At any rate, we all want to avoid overburdening our partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end" seems to be a popular keyword of the ending note, but you should not be too self-righteous.
I don't want to write my hopes and demands in secret, but I want to consult with my family at least once and prepare for the occasion calmly.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (second from right) and Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Keiko Nagaoka (third from right) pose for a commemorative photo at the elementary school they visited.
In principle, students and teachers do not need to wear masks at the graduation ceremony held on February 10 in Toda City, Saitama Prefecture.
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) announced at its graduation ceremony that students should "basically not wear masks."
"It's actually difficult to keep students apart, and I'm not sure how to deal with it," said a junior high school principal at a large school. "Some students are worried about taking off their masks."
Advertisement - Scroll to Continue Teachers have also raised the issue in the wake of reports of masks being worn at graduation ceremonies.
On the other hand, one head of an elementary school said, "If the government decides not to wear it, it will be possible to realistically deal with it if it excludes chorus."
At the graduation ceremony this time, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to relax measures, such as allowing current students who had refrained from participating and restarting the chorus of graduates.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high is scheduled for early March, and the public elementary and junior high schools are scheduled to hold the ceremony in the middle of the same month.
The prefectural board of education and the municipal board of education will wait for an official notification from the Ministry of Education to make a decision.
Some were also cautious about the fact that the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) has decided not to require the wearing of masks in all school education activities from the new semester this spring.
The head of the elementary school said, "Children will be confused if they suddenly stop wearing masks one day, and it is natural that more and more children will gradually remove them after deciding that they are free to wear them."
× × ×
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided not to require the wearing of masks in school education activities from April in accordance with the government's new guidelines on wearing masks.
In principle, no masks are required for choirs, physical education classes, and club activities.
During the 2022 academic year, we will ask for infection control measures in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and we will inform the Board of Education and the school site of the precautions after April.
Graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high, and senior high schools, universities, and other institutions, even during the 2022 academic year, must be ventilated, and graduates, faculty and staff, and participating students must not wear masks as a basic rule.
Yasushi Nagata cuts a student (left) with scissors praying for success at Hair Atelier Lim in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture.
Every year during the exam season, students are cut using scissors to pray for success in the exam at the beauty salon Hair Atelier Lim Lim in Zuka Town, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture.
The students who took the test said, "I feel more confident," and "I was able to take the test calmly."
Yasushi Nagata, the president of the beauty salon, has seen and heard students opening textbooks while waiting for the haircut, and expressing their anxiety about taking an entrance exam during the haircut.
Therefore, in 2014, he started a cut to pray for success, saying, "I hope it will be of some use."
The last day of the national and public university applications
Every year, on the first day of work at the beauty salon, they go to Kamiso-sha in Wakatake-cho in the city to pray for success.
Around 80 people are cut every year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are also employment tests and driver's licenses.

"Dear Prime Minister," The Breakwater of Life "from Tojinbo," a book published by the NPO "Emotional Text Collection and Editorial Bureau" at their own expense
"Dear Prime Minister," The Breakwater of Life "from Tojinbo" I published the 10th book with this title at my own expense.
Newspapers all over the country have been reporting on it, and many readers have sent us their impressions.
The purpose of publishing this book is to share with you what we have heard directly from people who have attempted suicide about "social and structural" environmental problems that cause suicide in Japan, and to create a "comfortable society."
For 18 years and 10 months, we have been patrolling the waterfront of Tojinbo in Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a famous suicide spot, to prevent suicide, and we have continued to support activities until we find and protect suicide attempts and start again.
This book summarizes the problems heard from 784 people (as of 2 / 6) who have been protected so far, and appeals the following seven items to the Prime Minister regarding the national measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) There are many "human rights violations" behind the suicide.
(3) Suicides are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens who live outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) Even if a person with mental disorders such as depression is drugged and commits suicide, it is treated as an "accident."
(6) The "duty to pay attention to safety" in high-risk areas for suicide has been forgotten and has become a form of commercialism.
(7) The part of the doctrine of the new religious group that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of threatening the other party by telling him of the curse in the future is blackmail.
Religious organizations that commit this criminal act of "fraud and extortion" should be publicized and eliminated.
Therefore, we have received a lot of impressions from people who have subscribed to this book, such as "I was impressed by the strong mentality of the people who are working on this activity," "This former police officer is a model inside the police officer," and "It is a living bodhisattva who supports like his own family even though he is such a stranger."
When I saw a picture in a newspaper article, I cried, "What are you thinking?"
Now, I hear that the number of suicides of people who have been cornered by the corona disaster is increasing.
It's a very sad thing.
Everyone seems to be that person.
I want society to be a place where people can live their lives with joy.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude to the staff who gave their hearts to the people who had so much pain that they wanted to die.
I think that this activity is an overwork activity both physically and mentally, but please continue to call out to me with self-love.
Thank you very much.
Kashiko
I hope that you, our readers, will also become the gatekeepers of life in the region.

A man in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, takes weekly photos of capybaras at Hapijan, an indoor facility at Asuwayama Park amusement park, and posts them on Instagram.
The posts are lined with a variety of thumbnail images, such as the moment of yawning with a large mouth peeking out of a tooth, or the image of lying down and basking in the sun.
He has more than 10,000 followers in Japan and abroad, and is helping to spread the word about hapijang and capybaras.

The man is Kenji Shimada (38), a company employee living in the city.
In March 2021, we started posting on social networking sites (SNS).
The capybara is one of the largest mouse species in the world, and it is good at swimming with webbing between its fingers.
Since its opening in 2018, Hapijang has been raising a total of three animals, one male and two female, and you can observe and feed them up close.
Shimada first learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
Watching a video of her relaxing in a hot spring, she was struck by the question, "What is this animal?"
I was drawn to his charming, human-like facial expressions and gestures.
After that, I heard that it would be kept in Hapian, and I was looking forward to seeing it up close.
I started taking photos seriously about three years ago when I bought a single-lens reflex camera.
It is used to capture the adorable appearance of the capybara, and you will not miss the photo opportunity such as the figure of shaking your body and cutting the water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram is about 830, and I look back and say, "I took this much."
The male Yamato-kun seems to have learned Shimada-san while going to school, and he approaches and cries "Kurukyuru."
Shimada's love for capybaras is deepening, saying, "It's cute and I'm happy."
He enjoys interacting with capybara lovers from all over the country through SNS, such as showing each other his best shots every month.
Mr. Shimada, who also visits a zoo in the neighboring prefecture to see capybaras, said with a smile, "I would like to continue taking photos and transmitting them, mainly at Asuwayama on the platform."

Toba City calls for double payment of child-rearing benefits - Ise Shimbun
Toba City announced on July 10 that 11 households and 12 people received a total of 600,000 yen (about U.S. $600,000) in the fiscal 2021 Special Support for Families with Children (for other households).
The city will apologize to the victims and explain the circumstances, and will seek procedures for the return of the property.
According to the city, it was discovered on January 27, 2020, by a parent of a target child who confirmed the payment in the past.
It was found that the benefits paid on July 20, 2021 were paid twice to 12 people from 11 households.
The city will provide 50,000 yen (about U.S. $570) per child to high school students and younger from households that do not have resident tax.
The data was provided by a computer company, but the staff in charge mistakenly thought that the target children were not included in the data and added it to the data, which resulted in double payment.
A person in charge of the city's Child-Rearing Support Office said, "We will take it seriously and try to restore trust by taking all possible measures to prevent recurrence, such as re-checking the data."

It's snowing again.
It seems to be not a cold wave from the north, but the influence of a low pressure system on the south coast moving east of the Japanese archipelago.
It has been a few days since we experienced the unusual cold of 24-26 last month, and we can still be vigilant ▼ Even with the same cold, the people of the Republic of Turkey, which was hit by a major earthquake, will be able to endure it even more.
The building collapsed in an instant.
Together with neighboring Syria, more than 20,000 people have been killed, and many people are still left behind in the rubble ▼ Syria is known as a pro-Japanese country.
In 1890, the ship Ertuğrul, which was dispatched to Japan by the Ottoman Empire at the time, was wrecked.
The fact that the crew was helped and cared for by the residents of Kushimoto Town in Wakayama Prefecture, which is in the area where the accident occurred, is introduced in movies and novels. ▼ About 100 years after this accident, a Turkish aircraft was dispatched by Iraq to rescue Japanese hostages on the eve of the Gulf War.
Those who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.
Now that the situation has settled down, I would like to pay attention to reconstruction and recovery.

Accommodation support project of the prefecture and the city has been returned in full | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
The prefectural government and Ichinoseki City announced on July 10 that Bellino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yamame in Ichinoseki City) had been improperly using the hotel for about a year since October 2021.
Those who did not qualify for the discount were given a discount when they stayed at the hotel, such as by lending the name of the employee.
There were also many cases of employees using accommodations that did not meet the business purpose of "stimulating tourism demand."
By the 6th of this month, the prefecture, the city and the hotel had returned the entire amount of 7,231,000 yen, including the amount received for inappropriate use, including voluntary investigations by the hotel.
The reason for the illegal receipt of subsidies was the Iwate Travel Support Project, an accommodation discount implemented by the prefecture due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, and the Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount, an emergency measure for tourist accommodation facilities by the city.
The survey was conducted from October 18, 2021 to October 10, 2022 (September 30, 2022 for the Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount).
When the prefectural business contractor proceeded with the settlement procedure, it was confirmed that the user of the accommodation discount and the person in charge of reception on the hotel side were the same person.
A detailed investigation by the prefecture revealed inappropriate use of the system, and the city that obtained this information also confirmed the facts.
The project of the city has already ended, and the registration of the prefectural project was also deleted on December 2 last year.
In response to the interview, Michiaki Tsuchihashi, the representative director of Bellino, the hotel owner, said, "I am very sorry for the inconvenience caused to the local people, the prefecture, the city, and many people, and I am very sorry.
Takahito Chiba, the head of the prefectural tourism and promotion office, said, "We deeply regret that we will once again encourage compliance with the rules and the establishment of compliance, and call for appropriate use in line with the purpose of the project."
Mayor Yoshihito Sato said, "It is truly regrettable that there has been inappropriate use of the business at the accommodation facilities in the city."

In the course of training, several horses went out to the ground and made minor adjustments.
A white breathing horse was also seen in the cold.
A new runway lighting system will be installed at the racetrack for the 2023 season.
It will be possible to hold twilight, and will be fully operated through trial lighting.

Nishiwaga-cho Suginabata-no-michi no Eki Kinshuko (manager Sachiki Masuoka) has opened a ramen restaurant, Menya Nishiki, on Thursdays only.
Tantanmen (850 yen including tax) using local ingredients has been newly developed so that more people can enjoy the taste of the region.
Kinshuko, a restaurant serving Yuda Dam Curry (1,200 yen) and Nishiwaga Marugoto Ramen (900 yen), had been closed on Thursdays in order to secure holidays for the staff, but customers said they were disappointed.
In response to this, on the 9th, the restaurant started serving only ramen, which can be served by a small number of people.
Among the menu items of the restaurant, four items of soy sauce ramen, soy sauce fried noodles, miso ramen, miso fried noodles, and dandan noodles will be sold.
The new product, Tantan Noodles, is based on "Yukikko Miso," which is made from soybeans and sun-dried salt from Nishiwaga, and uses green onions, western bracken, ground meat, chili pepper, and other ingredients from the town.
There have been many orders since the first day, and we will consider offering it on other days in the future.
The station will be closed from May 2021 to November 2022 due to the closure of National Route 107.
During this time, he opened an alternative restaurant "Ramen and Donburi no Mise Nishiki" in Kotsunazawa, the same town, and he will make use of the know-how he has accumulated.
Manager Masuoka says, "Tantanmen is perfect for this time of the year to warm your body, and although the menu is limited, I hope that you will feel happy when you eat delicious food."

Introduction of the predecessors of plant research Hayachineyama collection materials also city general cultural property center special exhibition [Hanamaki] | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
A special exhibition titled "The People Who Introduced the Flowers of Hayachine: A Brief History of Hayachine Plant Research" is being held at the city's General Cultural Property Center in Osako Town, Hanamaki City.
It collects 124 materials, including precious specimens collected by our ancestors, and introduces the footprints of our ancestors who were involved in plant research on Mount Hayachine.
The study of plants on Mount Hayachine began at the end of the Edo period with the arrival of the Russian botanist Carl Johann Maximovich (1827-91) and Chonosuke Sugawa (1842-1925) from Shiwa-cho, who collected plants under Maximovich's guidance.
Maximović, who was not allowed to freely walk around the country because he was a foreigner, asked Sukawa to collect it, and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Even after Maximović returned to Japan, Sukawa supported his research, which led to the publication of "Himekozakura," "Nanbutouchisou," and "Miyamabukishoma," which are unique to Mt. Hayachine.
In 1903, Tomitaro Makino (1862-1957), a modern plant taxonomist, published "Nambutoranoo," "Kobanotsumekusa," and "Nambu Inunazuna," based on items collected by local researchers, and in 2005, he climbed Mt.
From the exhibition materials, it can be seen that valuable alpine plants have been revealed by many researchers.
It also introduces Matsunosuke Sugimura (1874-1948), who was the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School and studied plants, and Shichiro Tamagawa (1914-1988), who was a curator at the Osako Mountain Museum and was involved in the publication of "Plants of Hayachine."
Sohei Yoshida, a curator and researcher at the center, says, "Behind each name of the plant on Mt. Hayachine is the accumulation of a lot of research and the connection between people, which allows us to trace the connection between researchers spreading from rural areas to the whole country."
The special exhibition consists of four chapters, the first of which focuses on the faith and history of Mount Hayachine, while the second focuses on the geological features of Mount Hayachine, based on research by Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundation for Japanese geology.
JR | Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
Due to the heavy snowfall, JR lines in the prefecture were suspended one after another on the Kitakami, Hanawa, Yamada, Ofunato, Kamaishi, and Hachinohe lines on July 10.
According to the JR Morioka branch office, the Kitakami Line suspended three trains between Kitakami and Yokote, disrupting the travel of about 80 people, and the Ofunato Line suspended four trains between Ichinoseki and Kesennuma, affecting about 280 people.
The company announced plans to operate the line on March 11, citing the prospect of heavy snowfalls.
The section between Fujine and Yokote on the Kitakami Line was closed from the first train to around 9: 00 a.m., and some trains between Kitakami and Fujine were suspended.
The Ofunato Line is the inbound and outbound line between Ichinoseki and Kesennuma, and the Kamaishi Line is the outbound line between Morioka and Kamaishi.
There is also a train stop on the north side of the station.
The plan is subject to change depending on weather conditions.
Even when the ball changed, the proud fast ball flashed.
Sasaki Rōki (Ofunato Takashi) of Lotte Co., Ltd. pitched his first hit on a seat at Ishigaki Camp in Okinawa on July 9, throwing 30 balls at the World Baseball Classic (WBC), marking a 160km mark.
With two hits against six batters, he said with a sense of satisfaction, "I've gained a lot of things, and my forkball is a little better than it was in last year's strengthening game."
The 160km was measured twice, and Fujiwara was clogged and foul, while Yasuda was doughnutted.
He was also the first player to score a goal in the game, and the second player to score a goal in the game, and the third player to score a goal in the game, said, "It was a very good goal.
Yoshii said, "I think things are going well, so far," and he seemed satisfied with the steady progress he made in his fourth year as a professional.
As the next step, he will be pitching in a practice match with Yakult (Itoman, Okinawa) on the 15th and will throw around 40 pitches.
"I want to improve the accuracy of the ball and the overall cohesiveness," he says.
Idlib Governorate in northwestern Syria hit by a major earthquake. (Courtesy of local residents and joint project)
Authorities in Turkey and neighboring Syria have confirmed that more than 21,000 people have died as a result of the massive earthquake that hit the southern part of the country.
Rescuing survivors from collapsed buildings in severe cold weather has become increasingly difficult over time.
A vigorous search was carried out in the affected areas.
The UN on Wednesday brought supplies across the Turkish border to the devastated Idlib province in northwestern Syria for the first time since the earthquake struck on Monday.
Idlib Governorate was the last stronghold of the rebels against the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war, and there were concerns that international aid would not reach it.
Rescue efforts continue at disaster sites in both countries, using heavy machinery and other means, but they are facing difficulties.
The death toll is likely to rise as more people remain buried in debris.
According to the Turkish authorities, 17,674 people have been confirmed dead in Turkey.
Together with the deaths of more than 3,000 people in Syria, the disaster is greater than the 1999 earthquake that killed more than 17,000 people in northwestern Turkey.
Miyako City plans to implement its own support measures to subsidize the energy costs of utilities such as electricity, gas and gasoline, which are struggling to secure profits due to soaring fuel and prices.
As an emergency measure, we will invest our own financial resources to support the local economy, which is in a difficult environment.
The target is businesses in all industries (except for agricultural, forestry, and fishery households, and electricity and gas supply companies).
The requirement is that the profit margin for the fiscal year ended immediately before the end of the previous fiscal year be lower than that of the previous fiscal year.
The subsidy is intended to provide half of the increase in expenses compared to the same period of the previous fiscal year for the six consecutive months from April 2022 to March 2023, with a maximum of 1 million yen per business operator.
It is expected to provide benefits to about 800 people.

Second Meeting of the Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council | Society and Economy | Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
The Amami Airport Promotion Council, which discussed decarbonization of the airport, held a meeting on June 9 in Kasari-cho, Amami City.
The second meeting of the Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council (head: Takashi Ando, head of the Oshima Branch Office Construction Division, and 13 members), which consists of the prefectural government and airlines that use the airport, was held at the airport on July 9 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the airport.
All committee members attended, including online.
They exchanged opinions on setting targets for decarbonization and introducing renewable energy centered on solar power generation.
Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) has set an overall goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at airports by 46% or more by 2030 (compared to fiscal 2013 levels), with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
In response to this, the council held its first meeting in November last year and aims to formulate a plan ahead of six other remote island airports in the prefecture.
As with the first meeting, the second meeting was closed to the public except for the opening.
According to Mr. Ando, who was interviewed after the meeting, the amount of greenhouse gas emissions at the airport was confirmed at the meeting.
In order to set targets and introduce renewable energy, discussions were held in accordance with the guidelines of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.
According to the handout, 1,476 tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (excluding aircraft) were emitted from the airport's facilities and vehicles in fiscal 2013.
Lighting and air conditioning emissions from seven facilities, including the airport terminal building, accounted for about 90 percent of the total, at 1,321 tons, followed by 84 tons of aviation lights and 71 tons of airport vehicles.
The council aims to reduce the emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Ando said, "We are now at the halfway point, and the members of the committee share the same direction.
From now on, an interim report will be prepared at the third meeting, and a final report will be prepared at the fourth meeting.
"Sakasama Real Estate" opened a branch in Okinoerabu to attract people to the island People who want to rent a house are looking for a landlord | Society and Economy | Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
Opening event to deepen understanding of "upside-down real estate" through talk sessions, etc.
[OKINOERABU] Sakasama Real Estate Co., Ltd., a real estate web service, held an opening event for its OKINOERABU branch on the 8th at entaku, a well-known community space in a well-known town.
Through the talk session, the operating company explained the outline of the service.
Masahiro Okubo, the representative director of Tsuginova (Rishiri County, Hokkaido), which is responsible for the operation of the bureau, said, "I hope that by carrying out this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we can create a movement and flow that will attract people to the entire island."
Contrary to the usual real estate procedure, the landlord contacts the landlord by disclosing the information of the person who wants to rent the property, and if an agreement is reached, the landlord makes a contract.
The service was launched in June 2020 by On-Co Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Mie Prefecture) as a demonstration experiment to discover latent vacant houses and build relationships through vacant houses.
It was the first of the seven to be built in Chicago.
It is the first of its kind in the country.
The event was attended by about 20 people, including staff from On-Co and Tsuginova, town hall staff from Wadomari and well-known towns, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background of the establishment of the branch, saying, "With the movement to attract people from outside the island becoming more active, I thought that if we could make use of vacant houses and stores, the town and the island would be more exciting."
"We want to connect with people who have properties on the island or want to do something, and help them advance their efforts as much as possible," he said.

If you put it in the refrigerator, you can drink it after a few days, but if you leave it outside or leave it at room temperature, you should dispose of it.
If something goes wrong with your body later on, it will be a big deal.

About instagram.
I (ordinary people) now have about 10,000 followers. If people who don't know this see it, do you think it's amazing?
or don't you think it's nothing?
What does it look like?
I think it's a tremendous thing.
In the ordinary person is a miracle.
I think he was doing something special.
problems and setbacks.
It was hard to find time to exercise, so I bought it to rely on the popular pressurized inner.
Body type is H175m W 80kg I bought L size.
I have a hard time wearing it at first, but once I get used to it, I think it's okay.
I was using it for a few days, but now I'm using another pressurized inner due to a problem.
The problem is 1, If the arm is not quite slender, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve (just the second arm) is too tight, it becomes a little congested, itchy.
The lower abdomen is loose I stopped using it due to the above two problems.
It is quite tight in terms of comfort, but it is no problem to sleep while wearing it.
good deal for someone who fits.
158cm and 50kg were fine.
However, it did not suit me because I had a large and muscular skeleton.
Since it is not a three-dimensional structure such as a buttock, it is easy to fall and make a strange gap.
It felt like I always had to pull up.
I think it's good if you have a body type like a stick.
Is it a safe thinness in terms of thickness?
I was able to make the boots come in and feel refreshed even with a perfect knee-high boot, not a henna or a feeling that seems to break.
nice.
As for the upper body, I don't really want to put out my skin, but I was looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit.
The top is fashionable with a knitted back and a one-point mark on the hem.
I'm happy that I can choose from a bikini underneath or shorts on top of it, or two ways (^.
I don't know what it feels like if it gets wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is firm, and I thought that it was a bargain that it was this price.
There was no wire on the bust, but when I touched it, it seems that there is a hard core at the bottom of the putt.
However, it doesn't hurt even if you wear it, and it follows the bust properly, so I think it looks good when you move.
Did it change from no putt to no putt?
(^.
I'm looking forward to the water ♪ Thank you very much!
45kg 156cmM size, slightly larger.
The raincoat is a thick fabric so it feels hot and humid, but I think that it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is solid.
It has two visors to protect my face from getting wet.
The strength was not a problem, and it could be used with confidence even on a bicycle in a storm.
There was no tear after use.
I put it in a compression bag and carry it in a compact state.
Really, it was a product that exceeded expectations at this price.
I was able to attach it safely.
I attached it to the CLA 180 Shooting Brake in 2016.
The installation method is possible even for amateurs if you read the instruction manual and YOU tube.
Please note that if you loosen the torx screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
i fell one and went missing.
After that, when the gray connector is sandwiched between brown and red-green wiring, if you do it with a tapered tip type such as radio pliers, the force will not be applied evenly and the plastic will crack as shown in the photo and you will not be able to install it.
When I call support, they will mail me a new cable the next day, which is a very solid support company.
When I tried again, I put a lot of effort into it with the wide pliers as shown in the picture in the instruction manual, and it worked.
When I put the last main unit back in the car, it took a little bit of effort to store the wiring, but I managed to install it somehow.
After installation, there is no problem DVD, TV, navigation can also be seen while driving.
I think that it is a product with a very high cost performance because it costs over 80,000 yen if you order it with a dahler, and over 40,000 yen at specialized stores.
under the price.
To be honest, I don't know why it is so highly rated. First of all, the cotton inside is poly, but it is cut off in the cushion, and there are fluffy parts and squishy parts It seems that it has already been used, or rather, it seems that there are few cotton overall, and I tried using it, but I think that if the head and the hug pillow part are one, I think that it may or may not fit.
nothing good, nothing bad.
Merchandise arrives.
I used it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use and it can be milked properly.
However, there are times when the sound is a little annoying and the power button reacts poorly.
I don't care because I can use it without problems, but people who are interested may be interested.
It's not super quiet. I might be a little worried if I use it at night.
In addition, I was worried that the part connecting the attached tube and the machine would enter the tube, but I entered in the form of pushing it in ✨ I think that it is easy to carry because it is lightweight!
You need a knack to make a whisk...
I am not sure if it is the worst compatibility with my hair quality or if it is a problem with the performance of this shampoo, but it does not lather at all with normal use.
Here is the solution I found. ↓ 1 First, pick up less shampoo than usual and apply it to the entire hair.
(At this point, no bubbles will appear.) 2 Rinse your hair once, then take a suitable amount of shampoo in your hand and blend it into your hair.
The volume of the shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo as much as possible the first time...
It is obvious that I bought this expensive shampoo, but there was clearly a feeling that the texture of the hair was improved.
However, my honest impression is that I was not satisfied with the overall review.
The Quattro Botanico series is a pity because it was taken care of by the face washing goods....
Even though the capacity is small, it is bad cost performance that you have to wash twice.
In addition, considering the scent that seems to be popular among all people, I will give it two stars here.
it's hard to evaluate.
There is a negative positive, and the evaluation is difficult.
The front side of the blade is cleaned with a cleaner blade.
I think that it matches well with a razor that has good accuracy of the original blade.
Positive: As you intended, remove dirt such as sebum, soap residue, etc. on the blade.
(Only the front side) If the sharpness is bad due to the dirt, it will last longer.
Negative: Extremely reduces the life of the smoother.
Titanium coat, ceramic coat, etc., which are coated on the edge of the blade, will easily peel off the coating.
(If you use a shaver two or three times, the coating will almost come off, so I think it's better to use this cleaner after that.)
Be careful with the razor that says "Do not wipe the edge."
If you can replace it with a tip-over prevention rubber (anti-vibration rubber) that can be placed under furniture used as earthquake preparedness, I feel like it is not cost-effective.
The life of the razor is increased by 20 to 30%.
It is difficult to judge when the razor blade is thrown away, but I think that it is when the blade is damaged by shaving and the edge is rattled.
In that sense, I think it is a good product because it can prevent sharpness down by dirt.
(It is a cleaner and does not have the effect of sharpening, sometimes it feels like it has been sharpened, but it seems that it feels like a small rust has been removed.)
i was hit by a tv commercial.
I bought it when I saw the face of a pretty elderly woman come up after just applying it once in a TV commercial.
When I actually used it, the texture was a little firmer than a regular gel, so I wipe it off with a pre-lotion before using it.
At first, it feels sticky and disgusting, but if you apply it while massaging it, it will unexpectedly enter your skin.
After entering, there was almost no stickiness, and it felt like my skin was sucking on my hand.
Lifting up didn't go as well as TV.
I felt the firmness at once.
I have super dry skin, so this one is still not enough, so I used a certain moisture surge 72 before this.
It feels just right.
I thought it would cover the sagging pores, but it didn't.
I wonder if there is an effect when I use a bottle, and if there is, I think there is also a repi.
it must have been a lot of work to put it all together.
This is a compilation of what politicians have said in the past few years.
As I read it, I was somehow convinced that what I said at that time was, in the end, ah.
However, when considering the value of the book as a reading material, it is a delicate point whether "fact check" as the authors call it is necessary and sufficient.
To be honest, it is not interesting to read.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the major drawback of this book was the "method."
In the end, no one knows whether what we call "fact" will be true forever or not.
I felt that they were aware of the fragility of the "fact check" (or the possibility of disproving it), and I felt that it was quite suspicious from the writing.
If the current level of awareness of the "facts" among Japanese journalists were to reach this level, I would feel a bit gloomy.
It seems that many people are recommended, but it may be suitable for those who want to know a little about the contents of this book.
If you are a reader who is interested in the "fact check" conducted by the current Japanese media, like the reviewer, this book will not suit you.
For those who do not increase their score on the mock exam.
In my school, politics and economics are printed, and the class format is really boring as if I was studying while being forced to do it, and before I knew it, I had come to dislike politics and economics.
To be honest, I was saved by this reference book.
Currently in the high 3 center this year.
Since I purchased it in March, I have chosen this as my partner for one hour of study on the way to and from school.
First impressions are easy to understand.
we have reached the realm of god.
When I finished one lap and took the past question, I was 70, which was the average of 40 at that time.
I was surprised at myself.
it grows to the point where it feels like i've eaten something strange.
What I got from this reference book was not only knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also my ability and motivation to study.
thank you for letting me meet you.
Crime prevention
Eight years ago, I experienced two attempts at picking entrances, and I have been taking measures to prevent crime.
This time it is a replacement from a camera purchased 8 years ago.
In the past, we used the infrared irradiation 30m type (other company).
This product was written by another person, but the distance that can recognize the face at night is about 5 m.
I agree with you.
I have just arrived and have not set it up, but it is at the stage of comparing and checking the appearance of the camera.
The image quality is much better than the camera from 8 years ago (of course).
I divided the image into 4 parts on a 32 inch monitor, but there is no problem if the shooting size is maximized.
At the moment, there are no problems with the product.
If you are considering a level that can recognize faces other than crime prevention, you may be dissatisfied with nighttime shooting in particular, but this price is the best!
I use it for crime prevention, but I don't require facial recognition.
Because if you are wearing a mask or mask, you will not know (especially at night).
Professional burglars (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
Even if it is small, it seems to be able to distinguish recording from a high-performance camera.
On the other hand, if you are not a professional, you will be in trouble.
However, these days, burglaries are bold and clever, so we recommend using them with various security products instead of relying solely on cameras.
For example, there is a white solar LED garden light that you can get at a home center for about 1,500 yen (the latest one is very bright and has 6 lights).
Since it is solar, you don't need to pay for electricity, but in winter it doesn't light up until the morning, so there are also three 100V human-sensing LED sensor lights.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30 meters that can recognize people.
In addition, if you think that the intimidating effect will be weakened due to the small size of the camera during the daytime crime prevention, I think that you need to devise a cover.
I have a sticker that says, "Security cameras are on 24 hours a day."
It is an original product of a security camera manufacturer that I used before.
It is more effective for the manufacturer's product than the one sold at the home center.
The place to stick is the intrusion path of the thief who will not be able to cover by camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
At the same time, it is difficult to understand the instructions for setting up the net, so it was negative.
If there are any deficiencies after setting up and setting up, add them.
the more painful it is to read
If she had been born in Japan in 1982, her social situation might have been a little better, but even with the enactment of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law, the situation is still far from equal.
As I continued reading, the painful memories of living through discrimination as a member of society came back to me, and I felt suffocated.
Not only in Korea and Japan, but also in feudal society, it depicts the suffering of all women who try to live not as women but as human beings.
At least it's time for women to stop the emotional conflict and stand shoulder to shoulder with this society.
a drama that makes me think that men are the worst.
This is the story of the protagonist who was sexually abused by his father as a child.
Of course, he continues to drag the wound even when he becomes an adult.
All the men who come out are the worst.
The husband of the main character, who seems to be gentle and family-oriented, is also, in a sense, the worst.
There is a spoiler ↓ Even if you know that the sister of the main character is receiving DV by her husband, ignore it, the sister-in-law finally got the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, but the husband of the main character who is a police officer is thrusting, etc.
The old mother of the protagonist, who pretends to be stupid, knows that her husband (the real father of the protagonist) was killed by her daughter, but the daughter does not know that (officially, the death of the real father is a drug overdose).
In short, it seems that he did not let his daughter receive counseling after the death of the rapist, so it is natural that the main character will be crazy.
the main character's daughter wants to hear about her dead grandfather?
do you care about the old man who died so young?
In the drama? Too much.
A few years ago, a heatwave hit France and many elderly people died, and even when hospitals and institutions contacted their daughters and sons, many French people said that they could not get them because they were on vacation, and it was reported that the Paris morgue was full.
These people are "dry."
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that it was "dry."
The French ones are completely different from the American ones, and there are many that give a good aftertaste to the vague parts, but I watched relatively many scenes that I thought it would be better to cut.
Professional boundaries
If a meticulous calculation and an unexpected accident that could not be read out was related to someone's life, he would have been prepared to risk himself even if he had calculated it from the beginning to some extent.
She struggles with her own conflicts that she does not show in public, and how much she deceives the people around her in order to carry out her own beliefs.
And yet... Jessica's performance is absolutely amazing.
No matter what you look at, there is no gap.
It is a professional job.
and then it broke down.
I have used three of them so far, but this product broke quickly, both in a good way and in a bad way.
The reason why I chose this product was that I used the first 2200 mA built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out at 200 degrees 5 minutes 3 sessions.
The second USB port is defective.
It cannot be charged.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem so far, but when I put in the battery about 15 times (I used the battery with the charger so that the USB terminal does not break), the contact became bad, and it became difficult to turn on the power.
Press the lid to turn on the power.
I think there are some people who have experience with ICOS.
it's that symptom.
As stated in the instruction manual, the battery does not use any battery other than the one attached.
The nails and the catch part are like shavings, so there seems to be no bending.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought it without the Starry logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the contents compared to here.
It looks the same size.
The chamber and draw are the same.
LCD This one is more beautiful.
It may be newer than without logo.
Vibe This is modest.
Like a smartphone vibe.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibe or the sound is huge.
A cheap Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese...
The accessories are a little different.
This one comes with a liquid case.
Without the logo, it is lumpy like steel wool.
Roughly like that.
I think Starry would have been better, but it will soon break down, and you will lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose to return it, so it was troublesome, but I proceeded with the procedure.
it's just ear rubber, but ear rubber
This flat rubber is really not painful.
It is the best mask of the same type that I have used so far.
Even with flat rubber, if it twists, the helical part of the twist may rub against the base of the ear and become more painful than round rubber, but I think that this product is not only soft to the touch, but also the length is just as hard to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, not only does it fit, but there is a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower part of the jaw = in front of the mouth, so it is difficult to feel suffocating.
It may be because it matches the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it will suit everyone in the same way, but if you think that all the other small sizes are not good, I think it's a good idea to try it once.
When you open the outer box, it is in the vinyl in the center slit like a box tissue, but when you take out the first one, the ear bands on both sides are stuck and it is difficult to take out, so I reduced one star by that amount.
the contractor's response is star 1.
The price and taste are perfect, but even though I specified the date, I was distrustful of the response of the vendors who ignored me and sent me.
I bought a drink in bulk other than this product.
I always buy on amazon, so I know the delivery person.
I tried to arrange the arrival date as much as possible because it carries heavy items to the top, but it was ruined.
The shipping company is having a hard time because of amazon, but we are thinking if there is one thing that users can cooperate with.
I am disappointed with the response of the arrogant contractor.
But the price is cheap.
if you want to buy it, you have to pay for it
There are many complaints and I don't think it can be used for a long time.
I think it is better to consider the cost when disposing of it.
For reference, some local governments have centers that accept bulky garbage for free or at low cost if you bring it in.
[Sitting comfort] The seat surface is slightly inclined to the left and further rickety, so it is very tiring to sit.
If you move even a little, you will make a loud noise.
It is too noisy to use at night.
This is my biggest worry, and I feel that I can't continue to use it.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions are only explained in rough drawings.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many errors.
There is no explanation about the orientation when installing the seat surface and the post fixation platform.
When it is installed correctly, the height adjustment lever is turned backwards on the right hand side and the dial to adjust the spring on the back side is in front.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural in the forward direction, many people will install it by mistake.
There are no such basic precautions in the instruction manual, and you have to try and error while assembling while looking at the rough picture.
The list of contents at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
It seems that many buyers are looking for it without finding the 8 x 20 mm screw that comes with the 12 screws.
The 8x20mm screw is already inserted on the chair side, so be careful not to look for it in vain.
It seems that there are combinations that can be inserted with the same screw hole and screw, and combinations that cannot be inserted.
In some combinations, it is very difficult to just insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined that they are shipping with screws inserted like this.
I didn't find any spare screws in the instructions.
[Other] The black part of the surface of the vinyl leather has unevenness in coloring, and it becomes whitish in some places, and it is better not to expect a beautiful one like the product photo.
The explanation of the incompleteness of the instruction manual and the supplementary explanation of the installation method above were delivered to the email address registered on amazon two to three days after the product arrived.
Normally, these items should be served immediately after shipment.
Many buyers have completed the assembly within 2 to 3 days after the product arrives, so it is a completely meaningless act.
well, um...
I am a big fan of Thermos and have been using the Thermos straw type for more than 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use...
(1) The drinking part of the straw has become a harder material than before, and the groove is clinging to the main body, and the drinking part of the straw can no longer be removed from the main body!
i tried desperately to take it and cracked my claws.
(2) Only the tip of the mouth of the straw is thinner than before, and the straw brush can no longer be inserted.
(3) The valve at the tip of the straw is thicker than the straw brush and is dramatically harder to wash.
I've never had any complaints about using the straw type before, so I was a bit shocked.
It is really stressful that the mouth cannot be taken out from the main body.
The good thing is the outstanding cold insulation as usual.
I forgot to take it out of my bag When I wash it the next day, about 50% of the ice I put in the previous day still remains.
I don't drink Hot, so I will continue to be a straw type.
Please improve the following model.
First time review (with postscript photos)
I will review it for the first time.
(This is the impression of an amateur who purchased a doll from scratch for the first time and has little knowledge of wearing a doll eye for the first time.)
When I put it on the doll, it was very cute and I was very satisfied with the light.
However, when you put it on (at the entrance), you can't put it on unless you push it a little harder.
I put tweezers into the hole of the doll eye and pushed it in.
About shipping It was the first time to ship from overseas, so I estimated it to be 3 weeks, but it arrived 8 days earlier than I expected (near Narita Airport).
However, I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
If you look at the description of Amazon's shipping earlier, it says that it is still shipping.
There was no air in the eyes and there was a lot of petit petit on the back of the envelope, so I think it's safe for the time being.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, it is an email mail from overseas, but is personal information okay?
And I felt a doubt, so I will make it minus 1.
The product is no problem, I think it is a very good deal for this amount at that price.
Postscript Doll Eye 8mm model iPhonese
it's a little small (working area is small), the charge is terrible
I ordered the size notation after I saw it, but I felt it was about two times smaller than I had imagined.
It is larger than A4 size, but the outer circumference is a groove for parts stock, so the range that can be used for work is narrower than A4.
I wanted to use it when repairing electronic devices and making Gundam plastic models, but it was difficult to use without the B4 size.
Use only for soldering iron work, and other work such as assembly and disassembly may be managed if you use a separate tray or mat.
It is impossible to place tools, place parts, and do further work in the area of ​ ​ the size of a magazine.
I thought about ordering another one of the same one to double the area, but the electrification is so bad that all the dust and cut pieces will be absorbed during the work, so I think it will be difficult to continue using it for a while.
fatal defect.
After struggling to open the lid of the battery box, I finally opened it with a rubber non-slip sheet, but it never closed when I tried to load and close the battery.
At this point is out.
Highly Rated!
Will the lid of the battery box close???
In addition, there was a small plastic wrap instead of the product's protective seal.
Is this a secondhand item???
Speaking of the explanation, only English is written on a small piece of paper.
There is no explanation of the diagram and I do not know how to operate.
another finger might be a good idea.
I found a good product!
I bought it immediately.
I used to use it for pinky rings, so if I didn't use it a lot, it wouldn't be perfect and it would be a little rough.
But I think it's good for other fingers.
But I think it's a good idea merchant.
for the price.
After all, you should not seek quality in this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was crushed.
The size is just right.
People with thick earlobes may be tough.
Maybe I should have bought a patternless one.
Yabana
The design is good, but if you put it on your hand, will the effect not fade even if you put it on the big leg?
it's the middle of winter in eastern doto.
As there is also a review of other people, the electric heating line is only 110 × 80 net, and the arrangement is not vertical but horizontal.
I wanted to heat the entire futon evenly, so I bought it because it was more expensive than the mattress type, but it was better to have a bigger one, but I can't help it because I can't check it at the store like a famous manufacturer.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and a bird's N warm.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
well done.
It is small and has sufficient airflow.
The battery can also be replaced with a spare.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it will look good as shown in the picture.
If it is a smooth desk, it will blow away with your own wind force, but if you lay a handkerchief, there is no problem.
If you use it in an outside / family restaurant, you won't notice the sound even if it's "inside," but in the office, even if it's "small," it's too noisy.
It is necessary to separate it as an accompaniment when going out.
In addition, even if it is "small" for office use, the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It is perfect for a scene where you sweat a lot on the go, escape to a family restaurant, and cool down at once with "large."
However, when you throw it in the bag, the power button is rarely pressed and it may be left around unnoticed.
It would be nice to have ingenuity such as slightly retracting the button (making it sink) or long pressing the weak first press.
It is an essential item in a time of intense heat that is dangerous to life, so it will be helpful if you make better things.
Multifunctional light speaker
I use the weakest warm color in my bedroom.
Better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color by touch type.
The white color goes well with any room, and the color light changes with the gradation, so it's beautiful.
In addition, if you touch the color you like, it will stop with your favorite color, so you can make it shine according to your mood!
Since it is an LED type, long life can be expected.
As for the sound quality, I think it is satisfactory enough for my ears as an amateur.
Also, the amazing thing about this light is that it is multifunctional.
A large speaker is attached to the upper part.
Bluetooth pairing with mobile phones is possible, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
You can also make hands-free calls by pairing it with your mobile phone.
In addition, since it also supports MicroSD, it can be linked with a personal computer and can play music as an mp3 player.
Ukikomi and piano practice
At the age of 66, he began to challenge DTM to prevent bokeh.
I bought the audio interface and the instrument.
At first, I was practicing, but I became addicted to playing the piano, and I am practicing every day.
I downloaded the sound source that I ordered, but the protect did not work, and I downloaded ASIO at first, but I use this for piano practice because the free piano sound source sounds good.
I'm glad I bought it.
There is a sense of deception in the appearance.
what's wrong with this product?
It will be a long sentence.
The synthetic leather of the office chair (armrest) made by Doushisha used for 4 to 5 years has deteriorated and has become worn out, so I am considering purchasing a chair with an armrest made of non-synthetic leather.
I searched home centers and furniture stores, but there were no suitable ones.
I was worried that I could not check the actual product, but I compromised with the appearance and price of the design and bought this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is a reserve of one screw type.
[Caution] Attached hexagonal wrench and screws are greasy with oil.
At first, I could not see the oil on the hexagonal wrench and the main body was white, so I was impatient when the oil was attached.
Assembly completed in 40 minutes.
Complete and confirm the product.
The left arm is heavy, the right arm is light, and the armrest is not easy to use (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak in the fixing force, and it hangs down immediately with a click sound.
The seat is non-regenerated high-density urethane foam feels hard and is not comfortable to sit (Is the elasticity weak?
The mesh of the backrest part of the competition is harder than other companies' mesh chairs, and if you wear thin, your back hurts.
Although it is a detailed thing, the height from the seat to the ground was not 550, but 530 (The height of the seat height is important for tall height) And the legs supporting the casters are not made of steel, so the durability is questionable.
I put a cushion that I bought separately, and the part of the mesh fabric seems to deteriorate (damage) quickly, so I use it with a towel.
I felt that only the fit of the back was good for me of 186cm 80kg, but other than that, I think that the satisfaction level is low, I also feel that there is a gap in the product.
After all, it may be better to sit and buy an office chair by looking at the actual thing.
There was an Amazon email from the manufacturer saying hello to purchase, so would you like to inquire about the armrest and headrest?
Under consideration.
Well, I wonder if it is like this.
I bought Pixela's 4K tuner, which was cheaper than I expected, because it seemed that I could see the right turning BS4K in my home environment.
As an experiment, I was able to watch the free broadcast of the right turn including NHK BS4K, and at the same time I was able to watch it beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV I purchased.
(Sometimes the image is jittery) The update came soon after purchase, and it became compatible with recording, so I am doing some scheduled recording and watching, but there is also the influence of the external 2.5-inch HDD, it is the situation that only the image stops in playback or frame skipping occurs.
The user interface is not a compliment at all, and it is clear that you can watch 4K broadcasts.
By the way, during the scheduled recording, it feels like you can only play the chase of the recorded program, and this is also accepted as a positive function that you can record in 4K on the HDD.
You may be disappointed if you buy with various expectations, so do not expect too much.
I hope it will be improved by the update.
heat function is ok.
I have only used the heat retention function yet, but when I put two 500ml plastic bottles in it, it warmed up in about two hours and two and a half hours.
I installed it at the passenger seat of a compact car and used it, but the fan sound is anxious when idling is stopped, but I do not feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the smell like a chemical substance discharged from the fan because it was still new, so I needed to open the window regularly and ventilate it.
As another person wrote in the review, the burr of the part through the shoulder string is terrible, so it is necessary to fold the burr with a negative screwdriver.
it's really fragile.
Today, two months after I started using it, it suddenly broke.
I liked the keystroke feeling and size, but it doesn't make sense to break it.
I use a PC all day for video processing work, but the volume becomes 100% without permission.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in an instant.
I can't use earphones because my ears hurt, and I can't even use a PC at night.
It seems to send a signal every few seconds, and the volume display repeatedly appears and disappears on the computer screen.
In addition, the keyboard interferes with the mouse's instructions, so the mouse cannot be used freely unless the keyboard is turned off each time.
The Enter and Backspace keys are also no longer responsive.
I do not recommend it at all, but if you are in the 1000 yen range, you may want to try it.
If you are lucky, you will be able to use it for about half a year.
This is a 6-month warranty, compared to other companies' warranties of 1 to 3 years for the same price range.
The short warranty period is a testament to its fragility.
the product is great, the packaging is bad.
The product is my favorite because I use it in different colors.
I would like to recommend it to those who are looking for a food stocker!!
However, there was a gap that rolled around in a large cardboard box, and there was no delivery note, so the packaging was the worst.
When I opened the box, the lid was also off.
The product is recommended, but it may be better to buy elsewhere.
i'm worried about the strength, but for now
When I replaced the lid, I was worried about the support, so I bought it.
It plays a role in the stability of the lid, but since it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make a disgusting sound of "It looks like it will break."
You need to choose the one that matches the thickness of the lid, so you need to be careful when purchasing.
Buck with a Cute Pussy
When I was looking for a bag to go out with a dog, I was attracted by a fashionable bag of gray color and bought this.
It was a stand-up type, and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so even if I held it, it didn't feel that heavy.
The zipper moves smoothly and there is nothing like a hook.
It seems easy to move for a long time.
It is also very compact and easy to fold.
Even if you fold it, you can see the design of the meat ball, and it is cute even if you place it.
Light and comfortable!
the pulley is also very comfortable to use.
First of all, I fell in love at first sight with the appearance and the low price, so I bought it right away.
TSA lock has been my favorite for several years and I have several others, but it is convenient.
And as a master of forgotten or lost keys, number lock is recommended.
However, to be honest, I put the most important point on lightness, so it's okay, but if you want durability and security, the zipper part is a cloth for a week, so you can use a knife to pick it!
Also, the place where the zipper is matched is sweet, so I would like to have some ingenuity in overlapping.
If you are overseas, it is recommended to carry it on board.
For the time being, I used it on a Shinkansen trip and it was comfortable.
It is difficult to choose the size....
Because it is wide, it is difficult to buy shoes.
Converse and buns wear 24cm.
MRL 996 is also 24 cm.
At first, I thought it would be tough, but when I got used to it, I didn't mind.
This ML574 was definitely hard when my sister said that 24.5cm was tough and let me wear it.
It felt like my little finger was hitting me.
Therefore, I bought 25 cm.
When it arrived and opened, it was big....
When you wear it, it is a little loose even if you wear socks.
I was worried about returning it, but if it gets tough at 24.5, it will be troublesome, so I think I will put it inside at 25 as it is.
I bought Team Red, but it is so good with a bright red!
There are many black and white monotone clothes, so if you wear this, you will be bright!
165cm, 40s, male.
I ordered L size appropriately, but if you are similar to the following specs, I recommend M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm It is a typical metabolic belly.
In the water, the rash guard rises up because the waist part is loose.
I'm swimming while fixing the turned up part.
Especially when I was careless in the jacuzzi, I could see my meta-belly.
Also, if you walk while moving up and down intensely, it will turn up from the bottom.
The fabric is strong and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples being transparent.
At this price, you can be satisfied with this product, but I think that the smaller one will fit better.
it's a gas leak, but...
If you want to buy this Colt 25, ask a person who can disassemble or assemble it, or ask a person who can disassemble it while taking a picture of a digital camera. If you are not confident in disassembling it, I do not recommend it very much, but if you think that it is okay to break it, it may be fun.
i was wondering what kind of quality is 188 yen
It can be used for fast rotation and when torque is required.
It is light and small, and above all, the simplicity without any vanity is good.
There was no rattling when I attached the bit, and I thought that 188 yen was an amazing cost.
It's also about durability.
It may not be used very often, but I think it is a good thing to put in a tool box.
I bought it together with "1 / 4 inch Hexagon Shank Magnetic Quick Release Driver Rollet Bit Holder 60 / 100 / 150mm" from the same distributor.
There was no problem here, or rather, it was quite good for the price.
the controller won't work.
It can be operated by itself and can not be operated.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the aircraft moves in an unexpected direction and cannot be operated.
This product is better not to buy.
I would like to warn you.
It is a terrible product.
It is wired, but the controller of BEBONCOOL PS3 is recommended.
It is reliable and has not yet broken even after long use.
It can also be used for PC games.
I was able to get a refund for the Amazon gift card by returning it as a defective product within a month, so I think that was good.
is this going to increase your calculation power?
I think it is suitable for children who understand calculation.
Isn't it impossible unless the child understands the calculation to some extent?
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, when I give a tool to the master, I slide the thing on the screen up with my finger, but I tried it myself, but it doesn't go smoothly no matter how many times I do it.
In short, it may be easy to slide for people who are used to DS.?
I don't like the illustrations of manga characters, or rather, I think that DS may enter from the fun of the screen, but for some reason I don't feel familiar.
The method of calculation is also a way to compete for time, for example, how many correct questions can be answered in how many minutes.
I understand the feeling of making you hurry up with exams and so on...
For some reason, I don't like the gong that rings when it's over.
Wouldn't it be nice to make the sound more pleasant even though you are working hard?
I feel like I lost 6,200 yen in this.
I know this half price.
I'm sorry, but there are only two of them.
after all, i like the persona song!
"Persona 3 reaches ED."
5 played until the middle.
Persona 4 is already in vita.
What I can do has not changed from the previous Persona 4.
Because there is no story, it feels shorter than the previous work.
The song is still cool!
Just listening makes me feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were in HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Junpei seemed to be handsome (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the beginning, so there is no freshness...
As a music game, I felt that 5 was easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see if the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if you wear it with the background.
Since it has a lot of assist functions, I think that even those who are not good at music games can play it.
If you turn on the challenge function, the game may be crunchy.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not a bonus, it's a solid 4-disc set, so if you like Persona songs, I recommend this one.
i'm sorry.
I liked the color of the dial in the photo and bought it, but the actual thing has a blue color, but it is close to black or charcoal gray.
and it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but the pending price is low so far, so I wonder if I can give up?
Postscript After the review was posted, I received an email from the seller apologizing and exchanging it for a new product.
Subsequent processing was also quick.
I think the response was very good even though it was a cheap product.
4 stars added to the correspondence After that, gold was also purchased.
The color is almost as shown in the picture and I think it is very beautiful.
But after all, the buckle is not a double lock, and the difference from the explanation photo is obvious.
That's the only regret.
The evening becomes very heavy.
I used it for my SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setting, I didn't know how to do after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (Settings > Mobile communications > Turn on data roaming from the communication option).
The manual attached to the product seems not to have much to do with it...?
However, in the area around Gimpo Airport, the radio wave condition was bad, so I kept grasping 3G for a long time.
When I went out into the city, it became 4G.
Sometimes in the evening or at night, the communication became very heavy, but now that I think about it, I may have reached the limit of up to hundreds of MB a day.
better than i thought.
I used Softbank Z4 for 2 years, made it sim-free, used it on Ymobile, and Z4 got sick, so I was looking for a used Xperia, but I found this phone that can be used as a new phone.
Since I was using a mobile Suica, I was worried about whether I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, and silver, so it looks like an iPhone 6 at first glance.
I do not play games, so the processing speed is the same as Z4, and I have the impression that it is a little fast.
I thought it was amazing that it looked like an iPhone. I made the Android version 9, and I was able to shop satisfactorily.
Things I was interested in A little smaller No strap holes * Compatible with cases with strap holes No experimentation on water resistance A little heavy I have only used a little, but I am satisfied Recommended
