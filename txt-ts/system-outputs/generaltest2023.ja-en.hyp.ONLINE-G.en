Increase in rabies cases in northeastern Thailand
Dr. Tawichai, from the 9th Disease Prevention and Control Office, said 2.9 percent of rabies infections have increased in northeastern Thailand over the past few months, bringing the total number of people infected to 74.
In this fiscal year (last year 10 month － this year 9 month), 67 people were tested positive for rabies in Surin Province and Buriram Province in the northeast, respectively, and 7 people were a total of 74 people.
All of them have been vaccinated against rabies in the past, he said.
The doctor has called on people to be vaccinated against rabies with their pets and not touch the saliva of animals suspected of being infected.
Rabies infects people not only from dogs, but also from cats and bats.
Almost 100% of deaths occur when a person is infected and contracted, but vaccination before onset can prevent death.

FUJI System development to prevent leaving behind accidents Experiment with our own vehicle｜Chubu Keizai Shimbun Aichi, Gifu, Mie, Shizuoka Economic Information
FUJI (head office, Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent children from being left behind in the car.
A person sensor is installed in the car, and when a person's movement is detected, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
At present, the company is conducting a demonstration experiment on the transportation vehicles of its own facilities.
Protect the safety of children while painful accidents occur due to leaving them behind.
At present, we are conducting a demonstration experiment on 2 pick-up vehicles of teracoya THANK, an English conversation after school for children operated by our company in Chiryu City.
A human sensor that detects the movement of a person based on the temperature difference between the person and the surrounding environment is installed in 3 ceiling places in the car.
When the vehicle's engine is turned off and the door is closed, a warning notification is automatically sent when a person's movement is detected after a certain period of time has elapsed.
By linking information with the condition of the engine and door, false positives are prevented as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to making a call to a pre-registered number, it displays it in a chat on a computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, so that mistakes such as missed will not occur.
The demonstration experiment will continue until around the end of the 2nd month.
Kazumitsu Kamiya, Director of the Innovation Promotion Department, Division 2, pointed out that "During the experiment, peripheral issues other than the system were also visible."
For example, they were able to pick up various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
"If we can expand our solutions," he said.
The reason for the development of the system was a series of accidents involving pick-up and drop-off buses across the country.
Employees with young children suggested that there was something they could do to protect the safety of their children.
The company decided to develop the system in order to make use of its know-how in IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors, which it had cultivated through its factory automation (FA)-related business.
FUJI's easy-to-leave prevention system is sold.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since it can be easily retrofitted to a pick-up vehicle, it aims to reduce the hurdle of introduction and popularize it.
In the future, we will consider commercialization while seeking cooperation from nursery schools and kindergartens.
[Editorial] Construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Tsuruga and Shin―Osaka, scheduled for the beginning of fiscal 2023, has been postponed, and urban development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture has begun to be affected.
In Obama City, where the new station will be installed, the location of the station in detail is not indicated even now, and urban planning including peripheral maintenance is still under way.
The plan is expected to take a long time and is expected to be published as soon as possible.
The Hokuriku Shinkansen station scheduled for Obama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 19 years, the Railway Construction and Transportation Facility Improvement Support Organization indicated the range of about 2-5 km in radius around JR Higashi・Obama Station as the location of the approximate station.
Detailed station location and route determination were aimed at the winter of 22 years.
In Obama City, the business related to the Shinkansen, which is expected to open in Tsuruga and then open in Obama in the future, is in full swing in fiscal 21.
In the initial budget for FY22, the city plans to increase the number of projects further and promote town development in anticipation of the announcement of the location of the new station.
However, the detailed location of the new station is still not shown.
The city is considering land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station, and has put 300 million yen in the budget this year as a project to formulate a basic plan, but it is expected to be non-execution.
Urban planning centered on the new station "takes time to form a consensus among citizens" (a city representative).
There is a case of Echizen City in a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to the existing JR station, but it seems that it takes considerable time to summarize the overall concept.
It is feared that the later the announcement is made, the shorter the preparation period until the opening of the facility, and the impact on the surrounding development will come out.
Before the location of the new station, there is uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
Citizens' groups in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism calling for the cancellation of the extension plan in black and white on March 10 last year.
In Ishikawa Prefecture politics, there have been a series of moves to return the route setting that had been settled to the starting point, such as calls for reconsideration of the Maibara Route after the start of construction was postponed, and it is difficult to say that the neighboring prefecture is never a single rock.
Obama residents are relatively calm about seeing off construction, but the location of the new station is unknown and the timing of its opening remains uncertain, and there are concerns that future momentum will be affected.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki is planning to continue his campaign to urge the government to start the entire line as soon as possible, but the voice of the area along the line that calls for the start of construction as soon as possible is essential.
It is not possible to move the country and neighboring municipalities with indifference that "the Shinkansen will pass (west of Tsuruga) someday."
I want the enthusiasm to keep raising my voice.
Chocolate shop for Valentine's Day where tasting was revived for the first time in 3 years = 2/9, Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture

⇒ Price high impact on 1 grain average 25 yen up
"We are trying to create a sales area where people can enjoy the Valentine's Day event itself," said the person in charge.
In addition to selling daily recommended sweets from 1/26, the store resumed tasting for the first time in 3 years.
At the end of last year, Kurabu (head office: Ippon-denaka, Maruoka-cho, Sakai City), a manufacturer and exporter of western-style confectionery, launched a series of original chocolates, "KISEKI," jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate maker, for the first time in the Valentine's Day sales campaign.
It is characterized by a fruity taste that is particular about cocoa beans and suppresses bitterness, and is sold for 3 thousand yen and 9 thousand yen for 3 thousand yen.
Ryoma Takakura, director of the Purchasing Department of the company, said: "While the culture of chocolate-in-law is gradually fading, there is a demand to enjoy a little luxury on Valentine's Day.We will increase the added value of our products to differentiate them."

On the 9th, a woman in her 20s (Fukui City) who visited the Seibu Fukui store said, "I originally loved chocolate, so I got a job and got money, so I wanted to buy it as a reward for myself."
A 30-year-old office worker who bought chocolate said, "It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolate, but I want to give it to my family and people who are usually indebted to me because it is 1 time in 1 year.However, the number of people who pass may be reduced," he said.

The ruins of Ushigahara Castle, which is said to have been built in preparation for the battle against Heisen-ji Temple = Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
Inuikawa District, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, where a large-scale Ushigahara Manor used to be located.
Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built on the hillside of Nabetokoyama in the area to prepare for the battle against Heisen-ji Temple, which had been in conflict with Shoen in the Kamakura period.
He appears in "Taiheiki" (The Record of the Great Peace), a war chronicle.
There are no documents on Ushigahara-jo Castle, but the following contents are written in "Echizen Ushihara Jito Jito Jito Sujiji" in eleven volumes of Taiheiki (The Record of the Great Peace).
Tokiharu AWAGAWA Ukyo no suke, who was an official of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), was dispatched to Ono as jito.
In 1333, Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative office in Rokuhara) established in Kyoto to monitor the Imperial Court and control Saigoku (western part of Japan) was overthrown by Takauji ASHIKAGA, and the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was further destroyed by Yoshisada NITTA.
Upon hearing the news that Rokuhara Tandai had been destroyed, Tokiharu's servants quickly fled, and only about 20 people remained.
The monk soldiers of Heisen-ji Temple took advantage of that gap and attacked.
When Tokiharu let his wife and 2 children into the river, he followed them and killed himself.
⇒ An impregnable castle where Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu stood together
In 2014, the Inui-side Historical Story was published by the Association of local residents.
Tokiharu's tragic story is introduced in manga so that even elementary school students can easily understand it.
Masao Kitagawa, 75, who was involved in the publication, said, "I want people in the region to know about the history familiar to them and pass it on to future generations."

A cat-shaped serving robot introduced at "Rock salt aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store".
The adorable expression is popular with family customers = Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture Ote 2-chome
In the food and beverage industry in Fukui Prefecture, which suffers from a labor shortage, there is a growing movement to introduce a serving robot that carries dishes to the audience.
The robot is said to be popular with family customers for its adorable facial expressions, as well as being useful for "non-contact" customer service by reducing the number of people in store operations and preventing the new coronavirus infection.
Restaurant owners and related parties have said that restaurants in rural areas are difficult to secure employees and part-time workers, and serving robots will become even more popular.
"Jin, Jin, Genghis Khan♪".
While playing light music, a robot displaying a cat's face on the screen smoothly travels through the store with dishes on it.
When you arrive at the table in the audience, you talk to the customer, such as "I brought the dishes you ordered".
"Rock salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Store" in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City introduced a cat-shaped serving robot in 2022/8.
When a customer places a dish ordered by a customer on a robot waiting near the kitchen, and presses the table number on the screen, it autonomously travels to the table and delivers it.
It has a built-in AI (Artificial intelligence) voice function, which responds when a customer touches it, and the expression of the cat face reflected on the screen is rich.
The "Bonta Group", which operates the same store, has introduced a serving robot at 2 stores, including the same store.
Toshiyuki Saito, President of the company, said that "the labor shortage is the biggest" and stressed that it is part of efforts to improve productivity through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually about 30%, but the introduction has reduced it to 21-22%, he said.
The robot also has the role of collecting dishes that customers have finished eating, which leads to more efficient cleaning up, and adds, "It's a joy for families and children, and it's also a publicity effect."
"Rokkan Hoshiyama Fukui Store" of yakiniku and hormone hot pot in Araki Shinbocho, Fukui City also introduced a serving robot in 22 years 8 month.
"Even if we recruit employees and part-time workers, it's not easy to come," said Eifuku Hoshiyama, president of Songsan Shoten Co., Ltd.I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage."
The Fukui store operates by dividing the zone where employees serve food and the robot delivery range.
The lease fee for the robot is about the same as the wage for 1 part-time worker.
In order to save manpower, in addition to robots, the store has adopted an ordering system using tablet devices, and is also considering a self-cash register.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, "customer service" such as restaurants is 6.94 times the effective job offer-to-job ratio by type of job in 22 years and 12 months, and it is a job with a high sense of labor shortage.
A person in charge of the Net System (Takaki Chuo 2-chome, Fukui City), which is responsible for the sales agent of the serving robot, says, "Due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the labor shortage in restaurants in the prefecture is becoming more serious, and there are many inquiries about the introduction of robots."
President Hoshiyama said, "It will be even more difficult to secure employees at suburban stores in rural areas in the future, and I think that serving robots will spread."
[Editorial] Echizen Town makes the ending note and distributes it to the townspeople who wish.
When I published the "Okuyami Handbook" two years ago, which covers the necessary procedures when a relative dies, a written heritage list table, family tree, etc., many people came to receive it for themselves.
Lectures on how to write an ending note and how to organize it during life are often held in various parts of the prefecture, and "end-of-life" seems to be firmly established among the prefectural residents.
Echizen-cho's ending note is on page 35.
Chapter 5 begins with a look back at your own history, and describes your current health and asset status, future nursing care, hopes for end-of-life medical care, and requests for funerals and graves.
There is also a section to spell out what you want to do for the rest of your life and a message to your loved one.
It's hard to write that there are 35 pages, but you don't have to fill all the pages.
What do you want to write the most to your family and to the people around you?
The key is to clarify the purpose.
In bookstores and other places, a variety of notebooks are available on the market according to the purpose, and you can easily start writing from where you can write.
It is said that the term "end-of-life" was born in 2009, likening it to job hunting.
2 years later, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred in 11 years.
It is said that many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly," and that more people have prepared for their own end and end times.
it's been more than 10 years since then.
The new coronavirus pandemic that hit the world has not subsided even now.
Prices rose after Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other factors, and electricity prices jumped to unexpected prices this winter.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to meet the current high prices, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in the past, funeral expenses, nursing care expenses, and grave management were shared by relatives and relatives, but now it is not uncommon for only children.
In addition, life expectancy has been significantly extended compared to a decade ago, but the risk of dementia and nursing care needs increases as the elderly age.
I would like to keep in mind that the rise of social unrest is also behind the fact that the end of life has not ended in a transient and fixed period.
In any case, everyone wants not to overburden their partners and children.
"Make the end your own" seems to be a popular keyword for ending notes, but don't be too self-righteous.
I would like to consult with my family at least once, rather than secretly writing my wishes and requests, and prepare for that moment calmly.

At the graduation ceremony, students and faculty members of the mask wearing principle is not necessary and showed the idea = 2/10, Toda City, Saitama Prefecture
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided on a policy of "not wearing masks" for students at the graduation ceremony on 2/10.
The head of a large school said, "It is actually difficult to get a wide distance between students, and I am worried about how to deal with it.Some students feel uneasy about taking off their masks."
The topic has been raised among faculty members in the wake of news reports surrounding the wearing of masks at graduation ceremonies.
Meanwhile, one elementary school principal said, "If the country decides, it will be a form that will not be worn.If the chorus was excluded, it would be feasible to deal with it in a realistic manner."
At the graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are seeking to ease the measures, such as allowing current students who had been refraining from participating and resuming the chorus of graduates.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high school will be held in early May 3, and the public elementary and junior high school will be held in the middle of the same month.
The Prefectural Board of Education and the Municipal Board of Education will wait for the official notification from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology to determine the response.
It was also heard that the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology has tightened its policy not to require the wearing of masks in all school activities from the new school year this spring.
The head of the elementary school said, "From one day, the child is confused by the response that suddenly there is no mask.It is a natural flow that the number of children who wear it gradually increases after deciding that they are free to wear it."
× × ×
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology 2/10, along with the government's new policy of wearing a mask, 4 from the school education activities decided not to ask to wear a mask.
In principle, there is no mask in chorus, physical education classes, and club activities.
During fiscal 2022, we will seek infection control measures in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and we will inform the Board of Education and school sites of precautions after 4 months in the future.
Graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high and high schools, universities, and other institutions will be held in the course of 22 years, with measures such as ventilation implemented, and graduates, faculty and staff, and participating current students will not wear masks.

At the Hair Atelier Limu Limu, a beauty salon in Tsuka-cho, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, every year during the exam season, students are cut using scissors to pray for passing the exam.
It is said that the examinees were well received, saying that "I gained confidence" and "I was able to take the exam calmly."
Yasushi Nagata, CEO of the Beauty Salon, has seen and heard students opening textbooks while waiting for the cut, and expressing anxiety about the exam during the cut.
So, in 2014, he started a prayer cut for passing exams, saying, "If you can help me even a little."
⇒The last day of the national public application
Every year, on the first day of work, the beauty room receives scissors and combs to pray for passing the exam at Kazusa-sha Shrine in Wakatake-cho, the city.
Around 80 people are cut each year.
In addition to high school and university entrance exams, there are various types of exams such as employment exams and driver's license exams.

"Dear Prime Minister," "Breakwater of Life" from Tojinbo" I published my 10th book at my own expense with this title.
Newspapers all over the country have taken up these articles, and many readers have come forward to comment on them.
The purpose of this book is to create a "comfortable society" by sharing with you the contents of the "social and structural" environmental problems of the causes of suicide in Japan directly heard from suicide attempts.
For 18 years and 10 months, we have been patrolling rocky areas to prevent suicide in Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, which is known as a famous place for suicide.We continue to support activities until we find and protect those who attempt suicide and start again.
This book summarizes the problems we have heard from 784 people (2/6 as of now) who have been protected so far, and appeals the following 7 items to the Prime Minister regarding national measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "lifesaving" activities.
(2) There is a mountain of "human rights violations" behind the suicide.
(3) Suicides are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens living outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and treat them coldly.
(5) Drugging a mentally handicapped person such as depression and committing suicide is treated as an "accident."
(6) The "duty of safety consideration" in high-risk areas of suicide has been forgotten and has run into commercialism.
(7) The part that cannot be scientifically proven in the doctrine of new religious organizations is deception, and the act of threatening the other party by telling the future curse is extortion.
Religious organizations that commit this "fraud and extortion" crime should be announced and eliminated.
So, in the comments received from those who subscribed to this book, "I was moved by the strong mental of those who are working on this activity", "The figure of this former police officer is a reflection of the police", "It is a living Bodhisattva who supports like his own family even though it is others so far", etc. I would like to introduce a part of the essay here.
When I saw a photo in a newspaper article, I thought, "What are you thinking?".."I'm not going to let you down," she said.
I have heard that the number of suicides among people who have been cornered by the coronavirus pandemic is increasing now.
It's really sad.
All people are like that person.
I want a society where you can live happily with your own life that you have received.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude to all the staff who are dedicated to those who have suffered so much that they want to die.
I think that this activity is an activity that is overused both physically and mentally, but please continue to call me from now on.
Thank you.
i'm not sure if it's true.
I hope that you, as readers, will become the gatekeepers of life in your community.

A man from the city takes a weekly photo of a capybara at Hapidjan, an indoor facility at Fukui City's Asuwayama Park Amusement Park, and posts it on Instagram.

The man is Kenji Shimada, 38, an office worker living in the city.
From 2021/3, we started sending out on the exchange site (SNS).
The capybara is one of the world's largest rats, and has a webbed between his fingers and is good at swimming.
Since its opening 18 years, Hapidjan has bred 1 male and 2 female, a total of 3, so you can observe and feed them up close.
It was 5 or 6 years ago that Mr. Shimada learned about Capybara.
He said he was shocked when he saw a video of him relaxing in a hot spring, saying, "What is this animal?"
I was drawn to the charming expression and gesture like a human being.
I heard that it would be bred in Hapidjan afterwards, and I was looking forward to seeing it nearby.
I started taking photos in earnest about 3 years ago, when I bought an SLR camera.
I use it to capture the adorable figure of the capybara, and do not miss the shutter opportunity such as the figure that the body trembles and cuts the water like a drill.
The number of Instagram posts has risen to about 830, and it is enough to look back "I took this much well".
It is said that he remembered Shimada-san while he went to school, and the male Yamato-kun approaches and cries "Kyuru-kyuru".
"It's cute and happy," says Shimada-san's love of capybara.
Through SNS, he enjoys interacting with capybara lovers nationwide, showing off their best shots every month.
Mr. Shimada, who also goes to a zoo in nearby prefectures to see the capybara, said with a smile, "I would like to continue shooting and transmitting it mainly with Mt.Asuwa on the platform."

Bellino Hotel subsidy fraud recipient Prefecture and city accommodation support project already full refund｜Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
On the 10th, the prefecture and Ichinoseki City announced that Bellino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yamame City) had made inappropriate use of it for about 10 years from 2021/10/1 in each subsidy grant project to discount the accommodation price of travelers.
When a person who was not eligible for the discount was staying at the hotel, the discount was applied by the name lending by the employee.
It was also confirmed that many employees used accommodation not in line with the business purpose of "stimulating tourism demand."
The full amount of 7,231,000 yen received due to improper use, including voluntary investigations by the prefecture, city, and hotel sides, has been returned by the 6th of this month.
The recipients of the subsidies were the Iwate Travel Support Project, a prefectural accommodation discount that was implemented in response to the spread of the new coronavirus infection, and the Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount, a sightseeing accommodation emergency countermeasure project in the city.
The period is from 21 years 10 months 18 days to 22 years 10 months 10 days (Ichinoseki accommodation support discount is 22 years 9 months 30 days), as a result of the survey, inappropriate use that is not subject to discount application, such as outside the target area and unvaccinated, 95 cases, 587,000 yen, use that does not meet the purpose and purpose of the business rose to 1239 cases, 664,4,000 yen.
When a business contractor of the prefecture was proceeding with the settlement procedure, several situations were confirmed, such as the same person in charge of the reception of the hotel side and the user of the accommodation discount.
A detailed investigation of the prefecture revealed inappropriate use, and the city that obtained such information confirmed the facts.
The city's business has already ended, and the registration to the county business has also been removed last year 12-2.
In response to the interview, Michiaki Dobashi, CEO of Bellino, which runs the hotel, said, "I am sorry for the inconvenience caused to everyone in the region, the prefecture, the city, and many people.I am very remorseful.It is a hotel with everyone in the community, and I want to start again from scratch again and work on restoring trust," he said, and plans to hold a compliance (legal compliance) training session for all employees.

Introduction of Plant Research forerunners Hayaike Mineyama Collected materials also City Center Exhibition【Hanamaki】｜Iwanichi Online Iwate Nichinichi Shimbun
The special exhibition "People Who introduced Hayaikemine Flowers ― A Brief History of Hayaikemine Plant Research―" featuring the ancestors who laid the foundation for plant research at Hayaikemine Mountain, which is known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, is held until March 12 at the City Center for Cultural Affairs in Osako-cho, Hanamaki City.
The museum collects 124 valuable specimens collected by its predecessors, and introduces the footprints of its predecessors who were involved in plant research at Mt.Hayaike.
Hayaike Mineyama's plant research began with Karl Johan Maximovich (1827-91), a Russian plant researcher who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Naganosuke SUKAWA (1842-1925), a native of Shiwa Town, who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovich.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to walk freely in the country because of foreigners, asked Sukawa to collect them and continued his research for 3 years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sukawa supported his research even after returning to Maximovich, leading to the presentation of "Himekozakura", "Nambutouchisou" and "Miyamayamabukishouma" unique to Mt. Hayaike.
Later, Tomitaro MAKINO (1862-1957), a modern plant taxonomist, published "Nambutranoo", "Kobanotsumekusa" and "Nambuinunazuna" based on the collection of local researchers in 1903 (Meiji 36), and "Katohakobe", which he discovered and named by climbing Mt.Hayaike in 05 (Meiji 38).
From the exhibition materials, it can be seen that many researchers have revealed valuable alpine plants.
We also introduce Matsunosuke SUGIMURA (17-2), the head of Hanamaki Elementary School who accompanied the investigation into the preservation of natural monuments, and Matsunosuke SUGIMURA (1874-1948), who studied plants, and Shichiro Tamagawa (1914-88), who served as curator of the Osako-cho Mountain Museum and was also involved in the publication of "Hayaikemine no Flora".
"There is a lot of research and connections between people behind the name of each plant in Mt.Hayaike," said Sohei Yoshida, a researcher at the center.We can trace the connections between researchers that spread from rural areas to the whole country."
The exhibition consists of 4 chapters, Chapter 1 focuses on the faith and history of Hayaike Peak, and Chapter 2 focuses on the characteristics of Hayaike Peak from a geological point of view based on research by German geologist Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), who laid the foundation of Japanese geology.

Amami Airport 2nd Decarbonization Promotion Council / Society and Economy / Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
Promotion Council to Discuss Decarbonization of Amami Airport = 9th, Kasari-cho, Amami City
Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council (Chairman, Takashi Ando, Chief of Construction Section, Oshima Branch Office, 13 members) held the 9th meeting at Amami Airport (Kasari・cho, Amami City) to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at Amami Airport (Kasari-cho, Amami City).2
All members attended, including online.
They exchanged opinions on setting targets for decarbonization and introducing renewable energy mainly through solar power generation.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set an overall target to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, "carbon neutrality," and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at each airport by 30 years by 46% or more (compared to FY13).
In response to this, the Council held its first meeting in 11 months last year, aiming to develop a plan ahead of 6 other remote islands in the prefecture.
The 2nd meeting was closed except at the beginning, as was the first meeting.
Chairman Ando, who was interviewed after the meeting, confirmed greenhouse gas emissions from the airport.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT) said it had conducted discussions in line with the guidelines for setting targets and introducing renewable energy.
According to the handouts, in FY13, CO2 emissions from the airport facilities and vehicles were 1476 (excluding aircraft).
Of these, emissions from lighting and air conditioning at 7 facilities, including airport terminal buildings, accounted for 1321%, or about 9%, followed by 84 aviation lights and 71 airport vehicles.
The Council will proceed with discussions on reducing emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Mr. Ando said, "It's a passing point now.The members agreed on the direction, and I would like to make a firm conclusion on the draft interim report."
In the future, a promotion plan will be formulated after hearing the opinions of the interim report draft at the 3rd meeting and the final report draft at the 4th meeting.
The flow of attracting people to the island "Upside Down Real Estate" Oki-Erabu branch office opening People who want to rent a house are looking for landlords｜Society and Economy ｜Nankai Nichinichi Shimbun
Opening event to deepen understanding of "Upside-down real estate" through talk sessions = 8th, Chim-cho
[General Directorate of Oki-erabu] The Oki-Erabu branch office of the real estate web service "Sakasama Real Estate", which visualizes the thoughts of people who want to challenge by renting vacant houses and vacant stores, and solicits lenders, opened an event on the 8th at the community space "entaku" in Chim-machi.
Through a talk session, the management company explained the outline of the service.
Masahiro Okubo, representative director of Tsuginoba (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), who runs the branch office, said, "By doing this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we hope to create a movement and flow to attract people to the entire island."
Reverse real estate is a system that, contrary to normal real estate procedures, discloses the information of the person who wants to rent, contacts the lender, and contracts by themselves if an agreement is reached.
It was operated by On―Co (Head office Mie Prefecture) Co., Ltd., and started the service in 2020/6 as a demonstration experiment that is responsible for discovering potential vacant houses and building relationships through vacant houses.
It is the 7th branch office to be opened in Kyushu for the first time.
For the first time in the country on a remote island.
About 20 people attended the event, including On―Co and Tsuginova staff, Wadomari and Chimyo town office staff, and local residents.
"As the movement to attract people from outside the island became active, I thought that if we could use vacant houses and shops, the town and the island would be more lively from there," Mr. Okubo explained the background of the establishment of the branch office.
"We want to connect with people who have properties on the island and people who want to do something, and help advance that effort as many as 1 or 1 person," he said.
Takeshi Mizutani, the representative of On―Co, said, "It is necessary to take care of each vacant house and discuss what local people want to do in this area, what people want to come, and what criteria to choose."
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information is gathered," he said, calling on the islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

According to reports from companies that have reduced working hours, many employees have improved their work efficiency by reducing their time, and this has resulted in a rise in the company's performance.
As earnings increase, wages rise, holidays increase, so the amount of consumption rises, this will also be an economic effect.
Is it not related to driving on snowy roads even if automobile studless tire pressure is increased?
Will fuel economy be improved a little if the air pressure is increased
i have to make it a lot higher.
i think the rolling resistance will be better
Since studless is a low-pressure tire, there is no good thing, such as snow will not bite and it will be easy to burst when it is high pressure.

I have visited several different dentists so far, but when I sit in that chair for treatment, there are teachers and dental hygienists who talk slightly diagonally from behind.
I wonder if it is better to turn around behind this, but I think that it is rude to keep facing the front even if the posture is tough to turn around all the time.。
who knows?
what are you doing?
Not only dentists but also barbers and perm shops talk while facing the front.

It is vegetable juice.

About Instagram.
I (the general public) currently have about ten thousand followers, if people who do not know this see, do you think that it is amazing?
Or do you not think anything else?
What is it like?
I think that it is amazing.
In the general public it is a miracle.
I think he was doing something special.
there's a problem and a setback.
Since I cannot take time to exercise easily, I bought it to try to rely on the popular pressurized inner.
The body type is H175m W80kg I bought the large size.
It is quite hard to wear at first, but I think that it is okay if you get used to it.
I've been using it for a few days, but now I'm using another pressurized inner because of a problem.
The problem is 1, If the arm circumference is not quite slender, the tightening around the edge of the sleeve (just the second arm) is too tight, itchy, it becomes a little congestive front situation.
2, the lower abdomen is loose more than 2 points of the problem I stopped using.
It is quite tight with regard to comfort, but there is no problem even if I sleep with wearing it.
Great value for the person who fits
Even 158cm, 50kg was S okay.
But it didn't suit me, who was big and muscular.
As it is not a three-dimensional making such as buttocks, it is not easy to make a strange gap or fall well.
It was a feeling that I always had to pull it up.
I think that it is good if it is a person of a body type like a stick.
In terms of thickness, is it safe to say that it is thin?
It was not a feeling like henna henna or tear, I was able to make it refreshing by being able to boot in the perfect knee-high boots.
it's lovely.
The upper body, I do not want to put out much skin, but I met around looking for something different from the fitness swimsuit.
The top is fashionable with a one-point mark on the back figure and hem of the knitting.
I'm happy to choose in 2 ways, whether to wear shorts from the bikini or the top of it under (^.
I do not know what it feels like when I get wet, but the sewing is beautiful, the fabric is firm, and it was a bargain that it was this price.
There was no wire in the bust part, but when I touched it, there seems to be a properly hard core at the bottom of the putt.
However, it does not hurt even if you wear it, and I think that it looks good even when you move because it goes along the bust properly.
Did you change the model from without a putt to there?
(^.
^) From now on, I was looking forward to entering the water ♪ Thank you ♪
It is a little big at 45kg156cmM size.
Because the raincoat is a thick fabric, it feels sultry, but I think that it can be used for a long time because the manufacturing method is firm.
There were 2 rain-proof visors, which prevented my face from getting wet.
I was able to use it with peace of mind even with a bicycle in a storm without a problem in strength.
It was not torn after use.
I put it in a compression bag to make it compact and carry it around.
Really, it was more than expected at this price.
I was able to wear it safely.
I attached it to the CLA 180 shooting break in the 2016 year.
The wearing method is possible even by an amateur if you read YOU tube and the manual.
To be careful, if you loosen the torx screw too much, the screw will fall into the car.
I fell 1 book and went missing.
After that, when the gray connector is sandwiched between the brown and red-green wiring and staked, if you do it with a type with a tapered tip such as radio pliers, the plastic will crack as shown in the photo and it will not be able to mount it.
When I called support, they sent me a new cable the next day and it was a company that was very supportive.
At the time of re-challenge, it worked well when I put a force at once with a wide pliers like the picture of the manual and staked it.
When I put the last main unit back in the car, there was a little hang in the storage of the wiring, but I was able to attach it somehow.
After wearing, DVD, TV, navi can be seen even while driving without problems.
I think that it is a very high cost performance product from that it costs 8 million yen over and ask in Deler, 4 million yen over even in specialty stores.
Below price
This is the first time I've used this product, and I've used it for a long time, and I've used it for a long time, and I've used it for a long time, and I've used it for a long time, and I've used it for a long time, and I've used it for a long time, and I've used it for a long time, and I've used it for a long time, and I've used it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time, and I've tried it for a long time. I thought that there would be no failure if I didn't use it as a pillow and a hug pillow. I bought it for 3600 yen at a time sale this time, but I would like to return it. In the first place, I regretted that 5 reviews with stars should be more vigilant.
no, no, no, no.
Product arrival.
I was allowed to use it immediately.
There is no problem with the feeling of use and I can milk it properly.
However, there are times when I feel that the sound is a little troublesome, and the response of the power button is bad.
I don't care because I can use it without problems, but people who care may be worried.
It is not super quiet😅 I might be a little careful when it comes to using it in the middle of the night.
Also, I was worried about whether the part connecting the attached tube and the machine will enter the tube, but I entered it in the form of pushing😂 I think that it is easy to carry because it is lightweight!
you need a knack for whisking.…
It is not clear whether it is the worst compatibility with my hair quality or the performance problem of this shampoo, but it does not lather enough to say that it can be said at all with normal use.
(The shampoo I've used so far was bubbling without problems even if I used it normally), and the solution I found is here ↓ ① First of all, take the shampoo in your hand less than usual and let it blend in with the whole hair.
(At this point, it does not lather at a level that does not appear even one of the bubbles) ② Rinse your hair once, then take a proper amount of shampoo in your hand and let it blend in with your hair.
Well, in short, I wash it twice lol The volume of the shampoo itself is quite small, so the trick is to reduce the amount of shampoo for the 1st time as much as possible...I am satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
It is clear that I bought a higher shampoo so far, but obviously there was a feeling that the feel of the hair became better.
However, it is an honest impression that I was not satisfied with the overall evaluation.
The Quattro Botanico series is a pity because it was taken care of by the face wash goods....
Although the capacity is small, the poor cost of being forced to wash 2 times.
In addition, considering the fragrance that seems to be popular among all people, I will make it 2 stars slightly harsh here.
it's hard to evaluate.
There is a negative positive and evaluation is difficult.
The front side of the blade will be clean with the cleaner of the blade to the last.
I think that matching with a razor with good accuracy of the original blade is good.
Positive: As you aim, sebum, soap residue, etc., dirt on the blade can be removed.
(It is only on the front side) With the dirt, it will last long if the sharpness is bad.
Negative: The life of the smoother is extremely reduced.
Titanium coating, ceramic coating, etc., which is coated on the cutting edge, the coating will be easy to peel off.
(If you use the shaving 2-3 times, the coating will almost peel off, so I think that you should use this cleaner after that.)
Be careful with razors that say do not wipe the cutting edge.
Because it can be substituted with fall prevention rubber (anti-vibration rubber) to put under furniture etc. used as preparation for earthquakes, it is a feeling that I wonder about the cost performance.
※I use 20~30% of the razor life up.
It is difficult to determine when the blade of the razor is thrown away, but I think that it is when the blade is damaged by shaving and the cutting edge becomes rattled.
I think that it is a good product because I can prevent sharpness down by dirt in that sense.
(There is no sharpening effect in the cleaner to the last.There are times when I feel that it is being sharpened, but it seems that small rust is removed and it feels so.）
i got caught up in a tv commercial.・・・
I saw that the face of a pretty elderly woman pulled up just by painting it once in a TV commercial, and I bought it.
When I actually used it, the texture hardened a little more than normal gel, and I use it after wiping it off with pre-lotion.
I use this product for a long time, but it's not as good as it used to be, and it's not as good as it used to be.
After entering, there was almost no stickiness, and it was a feeling that the skin stuck to the hand.
The lift-up did not go like the TV.
I felt a sense of firmness at once.
Because it is super dry skin, this one is still not enough, and I use it after using a certain moisture surge 72 before this.
It feels just moisturized.
I was expecting that sagging pores will also be covered, but it will not be covered.
I think that there is a lipi if there is an effect by using a bottle.
i think it was hard to put it together.・・・
It is an exertion that summarizes the remarks of politicians of the past few years.
As I read it, I am convinced that that remark at that time was after all AH, somehow.
However, when considering its value as a reading material, it is delicate whether it is necessary or sufficient just by the "fact check" that the authors call.
To be honest, it's not interesting to read.
I thought about it a lot, but I felt that the big drawback of this book is in the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "facts" is forever true or not.
I felt that it was quite suspicious from the way they wrote, whether they were aware of the fragility of "fact-checking" (let's say it's also the possibility of disproven).
When it comes to the level of awareness of the "facts" of the current Japanese reporters, I feel a little gloomy.
It seems that there are many people who have been recommended, but it may suit those who want some knowledge about what this book deals with.
If there are readers like the reviewers who are interested in the "fact-checking" conducted by the current Japanese media, I think this book will not fit.
To those who do not increase the score in the mock exam.
In my school, politics and economics were printed, and it was really boring in a class format that felt like I was studying while being forced to do it, and before I knew it, I hated politics and economics.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
Center this year at the current high 3.
I bought it in 3 months and chose it as my study partner for 1 hour after school.
The first impression is easy to understand.
you have reached the realm of god.
When I finished 1 lap and asked past questions, at that time 40 was the average I was 70.
I was surprised by myself.
It will stretch as much as I ate strange things.
What I can get from this reference book is not only knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also the improvement of my own power and motivation for studying, etc. I could feel from my skin that it is going up synergistically.
I really appreciate that you let me meet you.
Crime prevention
8 years ago, I experienced an attempted entrance picking 2 times, and I have carried out security measures.
This time it is a replacement from the camera that I bought 8 years ago.
I used infrared irradiation 30m type (other company) before.
This product, other people were written, but the distance that can be facial recognition at night is about 5m.
I also agree.
It has not been up to the setting just arrived, but it is the stage that compared the reflection condition of the camera & defect check.
The image quality is much better than the camera of 8 years ago (naturally).
The 32-inch monitor showed a 4-split view, but if you maximize the shooting size, it is no problem.
So far, it is no problem with the product.
For those who are considering a level that can be facial recognition other than crime prevention, you may be particularly dissatisfied with night shooting, but if it is this price, it is the best!
I am for security measures, but I do not request facial recognition.
Because if you are wearing a mask or a mask, you will not know (especially at night).
A professional burglar (thief) has knowledge of security cameras.
Even though it is small, it seems to distinguish between high-performance camera and recording.
On the contrary, it would be troublesome if you are not a professional.
However, the recent vacant nest is bold and clever, so we recommend using it in combination with various security goods rather than relying only on a camera.
For example, it is a white solar LED garden light that can be obtained at home center for about 1,500 yen (the latest is very bright 6 units).
Because it is solar, there is no electricity bill, but it does not light up until morning in winter, so 100V human feeling LED sensor lights are also attached to 3 units.
With this combination, we were able to secure a distance of 30 meters to recognize the human figure.
In addition, I think that it is necessary to cover with ingenuity if you think that it is felt that the menacing effect will fade because the camera is small in the daytime security.
I put a sticker of "Security camera working 24 hours".
It is the original product of the security camera maker that I used before.
It is more effective for manufacturer products than sticking things sold in home improvement stores.
The place to stick is the entrance path of the thief that would not be covered by the camera shooting.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
Also, it was negative because it is difficult to understand the manual of the net setting.
If there is a defect after setting and setting, I will add it.
The more painful it is to read, the more empathetic it becomes
Although Japan's 82-year-old may have a somewhat better social situation than her, the situation is still far from equal just because the Gender Equality Act has been enforced.
As I read it, my painful memories of living through discrimination as a member of society came back and I became suffocating.
Not only in Korea and Japan, but in feudal society, it depicts the suffering of all women who try to live as human beings, not as women.
At the very least, it is time for women to stop their emotional confrontation and stand up against this society.
a drama that makes you think that men are the worst.
The story of a hero who was sexually abused by his biological father when he was a child.
Of course, he continues to drag the wound even when he becomes an adult.
All the guys that come out are the lowest.
The husband of the hero who seems to be a gentle and family-minded is also, in a sense, the lowest.
There is spoilers ↓ Even if I know that the hero's sister is receiving DV by her husband, I ignore it, and even though that sister-in-law finally got the courage and came to the police to sue her husband, the hero's husband who is a police officer is frustrated by men, such as going through.
The old mother of the main character, who pretends to be a bloke, knows that her husband (the main character's biological father) was killed by her daughter, but her daughter does not know it (publicly, her biological father's death was a drug overdose).
In short, after the death of the rape father, it seems that he did not let his daughter receive counseling, and it is natural that the hero becomes strange.
you want to hear about your grandfather, whose daughter died so badly?
do you care about the old man who died so young?
in the drama?There are too many.
A few years ago, a heat wave hit France, and many elderly people died, hospitals and facilities were flooded, and many French people contacted their daughters and sons, saying they could not take them because they were on vacation, and it was reported that the morgue in Paris was full.
These people are "dry."
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I felt that it was "dry" after all.
France is completely different from the United States, and there are many things that give a good aftertaste with vague parts, but I saw relatively many scenes that I thought it would be better to cut this while fast-forward.
Professional boundaries
If the precise calculation and the unexpected accident that could not be read were related to someone's life, he would have prepared that he deserved to bet on himself, even if he had calculated it from the beginning to some extent.
She struggles with her own conflicts that she doesn't show in public, and how far she deceives others in order to pass on her beliefs, the script that embodies such a delicate mind-shaking drama was superb.
even if you put it on it...Jessica's acting is really amazing.
No matter what you look at, there is no gap.
It's just a professional job.
It's a great app, but I can't use it anymore.
I have used 3 units so far, but this product was broken in a short time, both in a good sense and in a bad sense.
The reason I chose this product was the 1st 2200ma built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out at 200 degrees 5 minutes 3 sessions.
The 2nd USB terminal is faulty.
It becomes impossible to charge.
This time, this product was a product to solve the problem until now, but when I re-put the battery about 15 times (I used the battery with the charger so that the USB terminal does not break) The contact became bad or it became difficult to turn on the power.
When the lid is pressed, the power is turned on.
If you are a Icos user, I think that there are people who have experience.
that's the symptom.
Although there is also a note, the battery does not use a battery other than the attached battery.
The part of the nail and the catch is like shaving, so there seems to be no bending.
Therefore it became the return in about 10 days.
I bought without the Starley logo at the same time as the return, but I will describe the comparison with here.
It looks the same size.
The same goes for chambers and draws.
LCD This is more beautiful.
It may be newer than without logo.
The vibe here is modest.
Like a smartphone vibe.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibe or the sound is huge.
A cheesy Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese....
Attached items are slightly different.
This is with a liquid case.
Without the logo, the mass like steel wool.
It is roughly like that.
I think Staley was better, but if it breaks quickly, you lose trust.
I wanted to exchange it, but I could only choose to return it, so it was troublesome, but I proceeded with the procedure.
It is ear rubber, but ear rubber
This flat rubber really does not hurt.
It is the best mask of the same type that I used so far in the goodness of the ear.
Even with flat rubber, it may be twisted, and the part of the heli of the twist is rubbed into the base of the ear, and it may be more painful than round rubber, but this product is not only soft to feel, but also I think that the length is made just hard to twist.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, not only does it fit, but it also makes a moderate space between the nose wire and the lower side of the chin = in front of the mouth, so it is hard to feel breathlessness.
It is because it fits the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it fits everyone the same way, but I think that it is good to try it once if you think that it is not good at other small sizes.
When I opened the outer box, it was in the vinyl of the center slit like a box tissue, but when I took out the first one, the ear rubber on both sides caught and it was difficult to take out, so I reduced one star by that amount.
Trader's response is Star 1
The price and taste are perfect, but even though I specified the date, I was distrustful of the response of the supplier who ignored and sent it.
I bought a drink in bulk other than this product.
Because I always buy it on amazon, I am familiar with the delivery person.
The hotel is located in the heart of the city, just a short walk from the city centre and close to the city centre.
It is said that the shipping company is difficult because of amazon, but I think that there is one thing that can be cooperated by the user side.
I am disappointed with the response of the arrogant trader.
But the price is cheap.
if you're considering buying it, it's going to cost you a lot of money.
I think that I can not use it for long because there are many complaints.
I think that it is good to consider it including the cost at the time of disposal.
As a reference, there seems to be some municipalities that have centers that accept bulky garbage for free or cheap if you bring it in.
[Sitting comfort] The seat surface is slightly tilted to the left and more wobbly, so it is very tired to sit.
If you move even a little, there will be a loud noise.
It is noisy at night and can not be used.
This is the biggest problem, and I feel that I can not continue to use it with this.
[assembly] The assembly instruction manual is only a description with a rough picture.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many errors.
・ There is no explanation about the orientation when installing the bearing surface and the pillar fixing stand There are people who are written to lean forward in the review, but there is a possibility that the orientation when installing the bearing surface and the pillar fixing stand is opposite.
When installed correctly, the lever for height adjustment is facing backwards on the right hand side, and the dial for adjusting the direction of the spring on the back is in front.
However, since the height adjustment lever is more natural in the forward direction, many people will come out to install it by mistake.
Without these basic precautions in the manual, it will be assembled while trying and error while looking at the miscellaneous pictures.
・There is an error in the description of the contents and the contents list at the beginning of the instruction manual is incorrect.
There seem to be many buyers who look for 12 8x20mm screws that are included.
The 8x20mm screw has already been inserted into the chair side, so be careful not to look for it in vain.
It seems that there are combinations that can be inserted with the same screw hole and screw, and combinations that can not be inserted.
In some combinations, it is very difficult just to insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, it can be imagined whether it is shipped in a state in which the screw is inserted in this way.
Also, spare screws in the instructions were not found.
[Other] The black part of the surface of the vinyl leather has uneven coloring, it has become whitish in some places, and it is better not to expect beautiful things like product photos.
Explanation of the fact that there is a defect in the manual and supplementary explanation of the above mounting method, etc. arrived at the email address registered with amazon on 2-3 days from the arrival of the product.
This should be done immediately after the goods have been shipped.
Since many purchasers have completed the assembly in 2-3 days from the arrival of goods, it is an act of no meaning at all.
hmm.、、、
I have been a big fan of thermos for over 15 years and have been using the thermos straw type, but this model is the most difficult to use in the past.。
① The drinking mouth parts of the straw become harder material than ever, the groove has become addictive to the main body, and the drinking mouth parts of the straw can not be taken from the main body anymore!
！i tried desperately to take it and cracked my nails.。
② Only the tip of the mouthpiece of the straw has become thinner than before, and the straw brush no longer enters.
③ The mysterious part called the valve attached to the tip of the straw is thicker than the straw brush, and it is dramatically harder to wash.
It's a bit of a shock because I haven't had any complaints about using the straw type until now.
It is really stress that you can not take the mouth to drink from the body.
The good point is the outstanding cooling power as usual.
When I forgot to take it out of my bag and wash it the next day, I still have about 5 percent of the ice I put in the day before.
Since I do not drink Hot, I will continue to be a straw type faction.
Please improve it in the next model.
Review for the first time (there is a postscript photo)
I will review for the first time.
(I bought a doll from scratch for the first time, it is the impression below amateur who has poor knowledge of wearing a doll eye for the first time) I received the product as shown in the photo.
When I put it on the Obitu doll, it is very cute and light is also very satisfied.
However, when wearing (entrance) is a little hard and you can not wear it if you do not push it in.
I think the way is different, but I put tweezers into the hole of the doll eye and pushed it.
About shipping Since it was my first time shipping from abroad, I had been using three weeks as a guide, but it arrived in 8 days (near Narita Airport) earlier than I thought.
However, I was worried because the shipping mail was never sent.
If you look at the description of Amazon shipping earlier, it is written that it is still shipping.
There is no air in the damage and pupil at all, and I think that it is safe once because it was in a small sealed bag with a lot of petit petit on the back of the envelope.
However, since the phone number was printed on the envelope, is personal information okay even though it is an e-mail service from abroad?
And I felt doubt so I will make it to minus 1.
I think that the product is very bargain if it is this amount at that price without problems.

A little small (working area is narrow), charging is terrible
I ordered the size notation after seeing it, but it felt smaller than I imagined twice.
Although it is larger than the A4 size, the outer periphery is a groove for parts stock, so the range that can be used in work is narrower than the A4.
I was thinking about using it when repairing electronics and making gunpla, but it is hard to use if there is no B4 size as expected.
I use it only for soldering iron work, and other work such as assembly and disassembly may be managed if I use a different tray and mat.
Place the tools, place the parts, and perform further work within the area of the magazine size... It is impossible.
I also thought about whether to order another one of the same items and make it double the area, but the electrification is too bad during the work, and all the parts pieces that have been cut also suck on the dust, so I think that it is tough to continue using it for a bit.
Fatal defects
The lid of the battery box did not open and I finally opened the lid with a rubber anti-slip sheet, but when I tried to load the battery and close it, it did not close in any way.
At this point it is out.
High evaluation!
Will the battery box lid close?？？
If you add, instead of a protective seal on the product, there was a bumpy little saran wrap.
is this a used item?？？
The only explanation is in English, written on a small piece of paper.
No explanation of the illustration, no operation method, no eyes.
maybe you should use another finger.…
I found a good product!
I bought it as soon as I thought.
I use it for a pinky ring, so it's not perfect if you don't use it a lot, and it's a little lumpy.
But I think that it is good for the minute that I use it for other fingers.
But I think it's a good idea merchant.
the price is good.
After all, you should not ask for quality in this kind of product.
One flower mark was crushed.
The feeling that I attached is just right size, too.
Although people with thick earlobes may be tough.
It might have been better if I had bought a pattern-free one.
oh, shit.
The design is good, but I wonder if the effect does not fade even if I attach it to a large foot when I attach it to a hand?
in eastern hokkaido in the harsh winter season･･･
As there is in other reviews, the heating wire is only net 110× 80 and the arrangement is not vertical but horizontal.
I bought it because I wanted to warm the whole futon evenly and it is more expensive than the spread type but it is big, but I can't help it because I can't check it at the store like a famous manufacturer.
There is no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and N warm.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
it's good.
It is small and has enough air volume.
Batteries can also be replaced with spare.
If you put it on the desk and adjust the angle, it is good if you do it like the photo.
If it is on a slippery desk, it will blow off with its own wind power, but if you lay a handkerchief, there is no problem.
If you use it outside / in a family restaurant, you won't notice the sound even in the "middle", but if you use it in the office, you won't notice the sound even in the "small".
It is necessary to divide it as a companion at the time of going out to the last.
In addition, even if it is "small" in the office use, the air volume is too much and it is too cold.
It is ideal for scenes where you sweat heavily on the go and run into a family restaurant, and cool down at a stretch with "big".
The only thing is that when you throw it in your bag, the power button is rarely pressed and it may turn around without knowing it.
It would be nice if there was a ingenuity such as slightly retracting the button (let it collapse), or letting you long press the weak 1 push.
It is an essential item in the era of intense heat with danger to life, so it will be helpful if you make better things.
Multifunctional Light Speaker
I use it in the bedroom with the weakest warm color.
Better than I thought!
It was good to buy.
As a light, you can adjust the brightness and color by touch.
The white color fits any room, and the color light also changes with gradation, so it is beautiful.
In addition, because it stops with your favorite color when you touch it at the place of your favorite color, you can let it shine according to your mood!
As it is an LED type, a long life can be expected.
As for the sound quality, I think that it is enough to satisfy my ears as an amateur.
Also, the amazing thing about this light is that it is multifunctional anyway.
・ At the top, there is a large speaker.
Since it can be Bluetooth pairing with a mobile phone, etc., you can enjoy music wirelessly.
- Pair with your phone to make hands-free calls.
- In addition, since it supports microSD, it can be linked with a PC, and music can be played as an mp3 player.
Piano practice and hammering
At the age of 66, he started challenging DTM to prevent bokeh.
Purchase audio interface and this instrument.
At first, I was hitting, but I got addicted to playing the piano, and I am practicing every day.
I downloaded the sound source of the attached work, but the protect did not work, and at first I downloaded ASIO, but I use this for piano practice because the free piano sound source sounds good.
I think that it was good to buy.
There is a feeling of being deceived by the appearance.
Is it a product with a deviation?
It will be a long sentence.
Since the synthetic leather of the office chair (jump-up armrest) made of Doushisha used for 4-5 years deteriorated and became tattered, I considered buying it with a chair of the jump-up armrest with non-synthetic leather.
I searched a home improvement store and a furniture store, but there was no suitable thing.
There is a worry that I can not confirm the actual thing, but I compromise on the appearance and price of the design and buy this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There are 1 spare screw.
[Note] The included hex wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I was impatient when it was oiled because the body was white because I did not know the adhesion of oil to the hex wrench.
The assembly is completed in 40 minutes.
Finished product confirmation.
The bounce-up armrest is different in the hardness of the raising and lowering on the left and right, the left is heavy for raising and lowering, the right is light, the usability of the armrest is not good (there is no adjustment method).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak in fixing force and hangs down immediately with a "click" sound.
The seat is non-regenerated high-density urethane foam feels hard, and the sitting comfort is not good (elasticity is weak?
The mesh used in the backrest is stiffer than other mesh chairs, and if you wear light clothes, your back hurts.
As a detail, the height from the seat to the ground was not 550 but 530 (height of the seat height is important for height) And the leg part supporting the caster is not made of steel, so the durability remains questionable.
I spread another buy cushion, and the part of the mesh fabric is used by laying a towel kit because deterioration (damage) seems to come early.
I felt that only the fit of the back was good for me of 186cm 80kg, but other than that, I think that the satisfaction is low product, I feel that there is a deviation.
After all, it might be better to sit down and buy an office chair by looking at the actual thing.
Since there was an Amazon email from the manufacturer of the purchase greeting, do you want to inquire about the armrest and headrest?
Under consideration.
Well, I wonder if this is something like this.
The environment of the humble house, apparently the BS4K of the right turn is likely to be seen, so I bought a 4K tuner of Pixela whose price was cheap without expecting much.
As an experiment, free broadcasting of the right turn including NHK BS4K is seen, and I can watch it beautifully with Panasonic's 4K TV which I purchased at the same time.
(Sometimes the image is crunchy) Update came immediately after purchase, I have been watching some reserved recording because it became recording support, but is there also the influence of the external 2.5-inch HDD, it is a situation where only the image stops in playback or frame skipping occurs.
The user interface is also not a compliment, and I divide it as "4K broadcasting can be seen".
By the way, I feel that I can only chase playback of the recording program during the reservation recording, and I accept this side as a plus function that I can record in 4K on HDD.
This is the best app I've ever used, but it's not the best app I've ever used.
I hope it will be improved with the update.
The heat preservation function is OK
I have not used only the heat preservation function yet, but when I put 2 500ml plastic bottles, it became warm in about 2 hours and it became hot in 2 and a half hours.
I installed it at the foot of the passenger seat of the compact car and used it, but the fan sound is worrisome at the time of idling stop, but I do not feel it at all while driving.
I was worried about the smell like a chemical discharged from the fan because it was still new, and I needed to open the window regularly and ventilate.
As another person wrote in the review, the burr of the part that passes the shoulder string is terrible, so it is necessary to fold the burr with a minus screwdriver etc.
Really fragile
Today, it suddenly broke in 2 months after I started using it.
I like the feel and size of the keys, but it doesn't make sense to break them.
I use a PC all day for work to process images, but the volume becomes 100% without permission.
Even if you lower it, it will return to 100% in a moment.
The earphones can not be used because of the pain in the ear, and it is a volume that is mind-boggling to use a PC at night.
It's a great app, but it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app, it's a great app,
In addition, since the keyboard interferes with the instructions of the mouse, you can not use the mouse freely if you do not turn off the keyboard one by one.
The enter key and backspace key are also no longer responsive.
It is not recommended at all, but it may be good to buy it as a trial if it is a thousand yen price.
If you are lucky, you will be able to use half a year.
Compared to the 1 year ~3 year warranty at the same price range made by other companies, this is a 6 month warranty.
The short warranty period tells us the fragility.
The goods are the best, the packing is the worst
The product is my favorite because it is different in color.
If you are looking for a food stocker, I would like to recommend it!！
However, there was a gap so large that it rolled around on the cardboard, and the packing was the worst because there was no delivery note.
When I opened the box, the lid was also off.
The product is recommended, but it may be better to be bought elsewhere.
I'm worried about strength, but for now
I bought it because the support was gone when I replaced the lid.
It plays a role in the sense of stability of the lid, but because it is a delicate plastic product, if you do not care when opening and closing the lid, it will make a disgusting sound "Meki-meki,, (Likely to break)".
Since you have to choose a thing that matches the thickness of the lid, you need to be careful when buying.
The back where the meat ball is cute
When I was looking for a back to go out with a dog, I was attracted to the fashionable back of the gray color and bought this.
It is assembled and it is surprisingly light when I have it, so it felt not so heavy even if I have it.
The zipper also moves smoothly and there is no such thing as a scratch.
It seems easy even if it moves for a long time.
It is very compact and easy to fold.
I can see the design of the meat ball even if I fold it, and it is cute even if I put it.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley is also comfortable to use
First of all, I immediately fell in love with the appearance and the cheapness of the price!I bought it.
TSA lock is a favorite of Coco years and I have several others, but it is convenient.
And as a master of key forgetfulness and loss, number lock is recommended.
However, honestly, I put the most important point in lightness, so it is good, but if you ask for durability and security, the place of the zipper is a week, because it is a cloth, I pick it with a knife!If it is cut, it will break in a moment.
Also, since the place of matching the zipper is sweet, I want to devise overlapping.
If you are overseas, it is recommended to carry it on board.
It was a great place to stay, and it was a great place to stay.
It is difficult to choose the size ....
Because it is wide, it is hard to buy shoes.
Converse and vans wear 24cm.
MRL996 is also 24cm.
is it hard at first?I thought, but when I get used to it, I feel fine.
This time ML574 was certainly tough if my sister said that 24.5cm is tough and let me wear it.
It was a feeling that the little finger hit.
For that reason, I bought 25cm.
When I arrived and opened it, it was big ....
Even if I wear socks when I wear it, I loosen it a little.
I was worried about whether to return it, but I think that I will put it in as it is 24.5 as it is troublesome when it becomes tough, so I put it in 25 as it is.
I bought Team Red, but it is very good with bright red!
Because there are many black and white monotone clothes, it will be bright when you wear this!
165cm, 40s male
I ordered the L size appropriately, but those who are similar to the following specifications, I recommend the M size.
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel Circumference: 100 cm Typical metabolic belly.
<Usage gochi> In the water, the rash guard will turn up, perhaps because the waist part is loose.
I am swimming while fixing the part that turned up.
Especially when you are careless in the jacuzzi, the metabolic belly is in full view.
Also, if you walk while exercising vigorously up and down, you will still turn up from the bottom.
<Making of the product> As the fabric is strong and not too thin, there is no worry that the nipple is transparent.
I think that it fits better if you buy a smaller one, though I can be satisfied with this making at this price.
it was a gas leak, after all.・・・
The Silver Colt 25 was still a gas leak, there was a trouble that a part of the tank was missing when I changed the valve, but I sealed the tank using [Bus bond Q] and it became able to hit it well after repair grease up, people who want to buy this Colt 25 either ask a person who can disassemble and assemble or can ask a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, or a person who can disassemble and assemble, I bought another black Colt 25, the trick to disassemble is to remove the left side while holding the trigger with the thumb of the left hand, and I managed to disassemble the parts without flying. When assembling, I painted silicon grease on springs and fine parts and assembled while fixing it with grease.When disassembling, first remove the grip, remove the safety screw, remove the safety screw, remove the 2 screws on the left body so as not to scratch the tip of the barrel and use pliers to connect the front site and the interface. If you do not pinch the nah barrel and pull it out, then you can disassemble it if you slowly remove the left side according to the Monaka structure, just don't blame people even if you fail at your own risk.
188 yen, I thought what kind of quality
You can use it separately when you need a quick turn and torque.
It is light and small, and above all it is simple without any trappings.
There was no rattling when I installed the bit, and I thought that if it was 188 yen with this, it would be an amazing cospa.
The rest is about durability.
The frequency of use may not be so much, but I think that it is a good thing to put it in a tool box.
I purchased it together with "1/4 inch hex shank Magnetic Quick Release Screwdriver Knurled bit holder 60/100/150 mm" of the same distributor.
There was no problem here, or rather it was pretty good for the price.
The controller stops working
It is not possible to operate by moving its own machine without permission.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, it becomes a symptom that the machine moves in a different direction and cannot be operated.
This product is better not to buy.
i will warn you once.
It is a terrible product.
IT IS WIRED, BUT I RECOMMEND THE CONTROLLER OF BEBONCOOL PS3.
It is reliable and has not broken yet even if it has been used for a long time.
It can also be used for PC games.
・・・・・- Addendum I was able to refund the Amazon gift certificate by returning it as a defective product within 1 month, so I think that place was good.
Does this increase your computing power?
I think it is suitable for children who understand calculations.
Isn't it impossible if it is not a child who understands the calculation to some extent?
The problem is hard to understand.
Also, where I give tools to the master, I let the thing on the screen slide up with my finger, but I tried it myself, but it does not go smoothly no matter how many times I do it.
In short, it may be easy to slip to people who are familiar with DS.？
I do not like the illustrations of cartoon characters, or rather, DS etc., I think that there is also going to enter from the fun of the screen な For some reason I can not have familiarity.
The method of calculation is also a way to compete for time, for example, how many questions to correct in a few minutes.
I understand how it feels to make you rush in exams... but don't you rush to calculate?
For some reason, I don't like the sound of the gong when it's over.
Even though I'm working hard, I think it's okay to make it sound more comfortable.
I feel like 6,200 yen has lost some money with this.
I know if this is half the price.
I'm sorry, it has become ☆ 2 pieces in this way.
After all the persona songs are good!
Persona 3 is up to ED.
5 played until the middle.
Persona 4 is already Trocon at vita.
What I can do is not change from the previous Persona 4.
It's a great game, but I don't think it's a good game, but it's a good game.
The song is cool after all!
Just listening to it will make you feel better!
The characters in Persona 3 were HD for the first time, so I was impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Somehow Junpei looked handsome (laughs) Persona 5 is beautiful from the original, so there is no freshness ......Thinking so, I feel that 3 is more profitable.
As a sound game, I felt that it was easier to play than 3 5.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was hard to see if the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if it is covered with the background.
This is the best game I've ever played, and I love it!!!!!!!!!!!
If you are a sound game expert, turn on the challenge function and it may become a chewy game.
The Triple Pack has a soundtrack, but it is a solid 4-disc set rather than an omake, so I recommend this one if you like persona songs.
i'm sorry.
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual thing is close to black or charcoal gray although there is a bluish.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking about buying gold, but I wonder if I can give up because the pending price is cheap for now?
Postscript After the review was posted, we received an email from the vendor apologizing and saying that we would exchange it for a new product.
The subsequent processing was also swift.
I think that the correspondence was very good despite the cheap product.
4 stars added to support then also buy gold.
I think that the color is very beautiful almost as shown in the photo.
But after all the buckle is not a double lock, the difference with the explanation photo is obvious.
Only there is a pity.
The evening gets really heavy.
I used it for SIM-free iPhone7s.
In the first setting, I did not know how to do after arriving in Korea and pointing to the SIM, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport to tell me (Turn data Roaming ON from Settings > Mobile Communication > Communication options) and it worked well.
The manual that was attached to the product was not so related...?
However, the radio waves around Gimpo Airport were bad, and I had been grasping 3G for a long time.
When I went out into the city, it became 4G.
Sometimes the communication became very heavy in the evening and night, but if you think about it now, it may have reached the upper limit of 1 day maximum hundreds MB.
better than i thought.
I used a SoftBank Z4 for 2 years, made it sim free and used it with Ymobile, and Z4 became bad, so I was looking for a used Xperia, I found this phone that can use Osaifu mobile with a new product and bought it.
Since I was using mobile Suica, I was worried whether I could use it properly, but there was no problem at all.
I bought the size, weight, silver, so iPhone6?It is an impression that.
Since the GAME does not play, the processing speed is also the same as Z4, it is an impression that it is a little fast In the review, fingerprint recognition was said to be slow, but it is an impression that it takes a little time to recognize, so facial recognition is faster, so I use it here.
I thought it was amazing like an iPhone I made Android Ver9, and I was able to shop satisfactorily.
What I was worried about There is no strap hole that is a little smaller and good ※It corresponds to a case with a strap hole I have not experimented with water resistance It is a little heavy I have only used a little but I am satisfied It is recommended
