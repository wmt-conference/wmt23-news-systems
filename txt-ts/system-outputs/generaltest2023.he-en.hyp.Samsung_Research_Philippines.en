Three cheetah cubs born in Iran
World's fastest animal falls victim to brutal hunting, droughts and deadly car crashes across the Islamic Republic
This resulted in fewer than 20 cheetahs falling in number.
Three Asian cheetah cubs recently emerged into the world's air in the Islamic Republic of Iran.
It's a rare birth that only slightly improves the endangered animal's status in the country due to droughts, hunters and fatal car crashes.
This is the first birth of a cheetah in captivity in Iran.
It should be noted that the Islamic Republic is one of the last countries in the world where cheetahs still live in nature.
Iranian news agency IRNA said the veterinary team, which trusts Thoran National Park in the northern province of Semnan, decided on a captive birth.
It also noted that fewer than 20 cheetahs have been recorded in seven different provinces of the country in recent times.
Due to the threat of extinction, the United Nations implemented a defence plan for them back in 2001.
Now, Iran is hoping the new puppies can bring about cheetah population growth in the future.
In January, Iran's deputy environment minister Hassan Akbari said the country's cheetah population had dramatically decreased from 100 in 2010.
"Their situation is extremely serious," Akbari said, noting that cheetahs have fallen victim to drought in their habitat, hunting and even car accidents.
The cheetah is considered the fastest animal in the world capable of reaching speeds of about 100 km / h.
Cheetahs can be found in various places across the globe, from India to Senegal in West Africa.
Spotify wants to upgrade your car: We've tested the Car Thing
Quietly, Spotify began to try its luck in the hardware world as well.
After years of development, Car Thing was unveiled and launched as a small experiment in the U.S.
We got our hands on the first device in Israel •
Vision: Make your old cars smart.
The Car Thing is Spotify's first hardware product and was built specifically to provide a solution for people with older vehicles.
A few weeks ago, I got my first chance to try the new product, which is currently only available to a few U.S. subjects, here in Israel.
For me, the delivery timings were outstanding, as our home car broke down and we had to drive for a few days with an old replacement car.
After two weeks of frolicking, I realised how the Car Thing could easily become an integral part of many people's system.
On the other hand, with a long waiting list and uncertainty about a global rollout, I believe many would prefer to use other solutions.
From idea to reality.
Somewhere in 2018, Spotify users started getting an interesting offer in their inbox - a new 4G voice-controlled device that makes it smart.
Rumors slowly faded until a year later, when the Financial Times revealed that the company plans to introduce a new smart radio product.
A few months later, the rumors were back in the headlines after the music service updated the status of the car.
Two years have passed since then.
After countless rumors and leaks, Spotify unveiled "Car Thing" last April, its smart vehicle system.
Spotify has chosen to release the new device in a very limited way, with a long waiting list and many delays when it comes to deliveries.
So, of course, right after the press conference that took place, I went on the website and registered.
Two months later, the long-awaited announcement was made.
Reconnecting to the site will buy me the option to purchase the device with a little surprise - it won't cost me anything.
After another month of waiting, the courier finally knocked on my door, accompanied by a small box with Spotify's logo on it.
The Car Thing
First and foremost, Spotify's device has impressed me greatly with its build quality.
The iPhone 11 is slightly smaller than I expected and features a larger, brighter touch screen than I expected.
You'll also find a round button and dial alongside the screen that you can rotate to navigate the interface screens.
And despite the huge dial, which you can see in the photos, the Car Thing manages to keep a relatively thin profile and not stick out.
Personally, I would prefer the company to allow the dial to change so I can control the volume of the smartphone, as I can navigate via touchscreen.
It may be possible to update a future version.
The device comes in a small, minimalist cardboard box, which includes a USB Type-C cable and various adaptors to install it.
Many of you may remember how we used to disconnect our radios and hide them in a drawer after getting out of the car.
The Car Thing undoubtedly brings back that feeling with its construction form.
All the adapters were connected to the device by a magnet that was very strong, which prevented it from falling even when driving on dirt roads.
In addition, throughout the top you can find small buttons, which you can easily set up to play various playlists or podcasts.
By pushing one of the buttons or asking the voice assistant, I set up some frequent playlists and the radio show I listen to every morning on the go.
In doing so, the feature made me feel that the Car Thing is more like a car radio than an extension of my smartphone.
Old car for a smart car
After a fairly simple physical setup, I plugged the Car Thing in.
I was pleasantly surprised by the set-up process.
Instructions were clear, connecting to the Spotify app took less than five minutes, and a few moments later I arrived at the home screen.
In fact, the device connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth and controls the app like a remote, so can copy all of our account information.
That means you'll still have to connect your smartphone to your car, either via Bluetooth or through an AUX cable to hear the music.
The home screen is familiar to all users of the app, as, like the smartphone app, it puts emphasis on album photos and playlists.
Also, on the home screen, like the one on the app, you can find music recommendations to suit your tastes, search screen and personal library.
As mentioned, you can navigate between the different screens using the touchscreen or the handheld dial.
Furthermore, you can call the voice assistant at any time by saying "Hey Spotify."
Through it, you can play songs, playlists, albums, and even search for podcasts.
In my experience she recognized my voice quite easily even when the music was playing in the background and the air conditioner blew directly on the device.
This is likely due to the four microphones installed at the top.
Importantly, the voice assistant does not currently support Hebrew, and as of publication, there is no information on when such an update will arrive.
Is it worth the wait for him?
My experience with the device was great, which is a positive surprise to me given that it's still in the initial release stage.
Even with intense use on long journeys, the device continued to work smoothly without disconnecting from my smartphone.
Still, a little stutter in the interface has occasionally been noted, but I believe Spotify will handle such bugs with future release updates.
The Swedish company has done a lot of work over the past few years, and among the various versions leaked online, the final product is probably
Still, when I first saw the Car Thing, I wondered who exactly the company was trying to designate it for.
After all, its activity boils down to controlling the app on a smartphone, and not much else.
What's different from buying a car stand for a few shekels and plugging it in so that the smartphone is closer to us when driving?
This question is reinforced when considering that iPhones and Android are much stronger than Spotify, and will often buy the user much more functionality.
Despite all this, the more I used Car Thing, the more I realized how it could improve the driving experience.
Being able to see the Waze on my smartphone screen and control music on a completely different screen is one I 've learned to appreciate in two weeks.
One question remains - will Spotify even launch the device to the general public?
And if so, will it also be launched here in our small country?
Swedish society is not saying much at the moment.
It hasn't even shared how many test subjects it currently operates globally, and how much it plans to add in the limited U.S. launch.
The only thing we know for sure is the price that is expected to be $79 (roughly Rs. 255)
Meanwhile, the Car Thing provides an initial glimpse of a concept that Spotify has been trying to crack for years.
Spotify Israel said that there is currently no information about a plan to launch the device in Israel.
- Yeah.
You recruited a Talent for the company?
Make sure your competitors don't "kidnap" you.
The economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is especially true when it comes to the most desirable.
Here are some tips to help you keep it in the workplace.
- Yeah.
Despite the increase, Israel's unemployment rate continues to be one of the lowest in the world, with 3.5% (150.6,000 people unemployed).
In other words, the economy is still in a labor market that is largely dominated by workers, and this is especially true for the most desirable workers.
When it comes to professionals and managers who are knowledgeable, experienced and capable, the trends in the labour market still exist.
This means employers do not have the luxury of resting on their laurels even a minute after Talent is hired, as soon as he enters the company.
Competition for talent is so fierce that even after hiring, 30% of employees leave within a month of starting work.
That is why smart employers will immediately move from hiring Talent to retaining it, first and foremost in their preparation.
An efficient, structured and thoughtful absorption process will get Talent excited about his new job from day one and even anticipate the next.
Here are a few tips on how to prepare and manage a proper absorption process that will help preserve the new talent:
It's not a secret - the organization's willingness to cooperate.
Share the factors that will work with him on his recruitment, explain to them why he is vital and important to society and role.
A new employee who comes to a place where he is expected and understands his value will feel welcome and will strive to prove his expectations.
Knowledge is power, expectations are set.
On the first day, the Talent held a coordination call.
Know his professional background and see where he sees himself in the future, so you can show him the tools you and your workplace can provide.
We are all human beings - we know each other.
During the absorption days, try to know Talent beyond his professional qualities and interest in his hobbies and interests.
A new employee who shows interest in it and allows it to express itself beyond its limits will appreciate it and want to keep it.
The curiosity advances.
Already in the absorption stage, you can create attractiveness that will make Talent want to integrate quickly.
Do this not by discussing bonuses and benefits, but by exposing it to exciting or interesting technology, as this stimulus leads to creativity.
Talent was also encouraged to voice his thoughts and opinions to various projects in the company and made clear they were important to the organization.

Electrification in the pocket: the cost of not closing coal plants in June - NIS 1 billion
Knesset Research and Information Center Report: Failure to close coal plants by June 2022 Estimated at NIS 1 billion
Electricity company: "Fuel use policy is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy"
- Yeah.
The economic cost of not closing coal plants by June 2022 is estimated at NIS 1 billion for 2022, a report by the Knesset Research and Information Center revealed.
According to the report, this cost is embodied in the consumer electricity tariff, which is expected to rise in the coming months.
In 2023, more coal is expected to be used by about 900,000 tons, assuming the price of natural gas remains significantly lower.
The report said that a reduction of NIS 1 billion in the electricity tariff in 2022 would mean a reduction of about 4% in the consumer tariff.
In other words, the economic cost of not closing the stations is NIS 1 billion, and the total cost to the home consumer could be about 4%.
As part of the reform of the electricity sector, a company was set up to replace the coal-fired units 4-1 at Orot Rabin site.
This was followed by a government decision in July 2018 stating that coal production units 1-4 should be discontinued at Orot Rabin Power Station.
Construction of the first natural gas unit will begin in January 2020 and will commence in June 2022, accordingly.
The energy company said in a statement: "Fuel use policy is dictated first and foremost by the Ministry of Energy.
For several years, Israel has implemented a policy of reducing coal use to a minimum, even when the price of coal is lower.
Paying the price: Everything you need to know ahead of rising interest rates
Next week, interest rates on the shekel are expected to rise by half a percent
How much will it cost to pay for the loan?
And what is recommended to do?
All the answers.
Worsening inflation in Israel, which has already reached more than 4% this year, will force the Bank of Israel to raise interest rates next week.
Analysts' estimates speak of a rate of increase ranging from 0.25% to 0.5%.
If interest rates do rise by half a percentage point, they will already be at 1.25%, the highest level in nine years.
For years, interest rates in the economy were near zero.
The sharp rise in interest rates is costing hundreds of shekels in mortgage repayments and weighing heavily on households.
With the help of Shay Bundle, a mortgage expert, we looked at how much we would pay more and what we would recommend doing now.
If interest rates go up by half a percentage point, how much will the monthly mortgage payment increase?
In a NIS 1.2 million mortgage, which consists of a 40% prime rate route, monthly repayments will increase by NIS 125.
How much has the average mortgage increased since the beginning of the year?
Since the beginning of the year, this is a significantly higher increase.
That's because interest rates on the rest of the routes that make up a mortgage (not just a prime route) have also risen.
If interest rates do go up by half a percent, the increase will amount to NIS 620 million in a mortgage of NIS 1.2 million.
The prime track (40% on this track) will complete a price increase of NIS 280, assuming there will be another 0.5% increase next month.
The index-linked variable interest rate track (26.7% on this track) will complement an increase of about NIS 120.
The fixed-rate track - not index-linked (33.3% on this track) will increase by 220 NIS.
So what is recommended to do nowadays?
For those with a largely index-linked mortgage, a bundle recommends considering recycling for non-indexed routes.
Mortgage takers whose monthly repayments have risen significantly and find it difficult to meet repayments, he recommends refinancing.
This is to reduce payments despite rising interest rates, as it is always better to meet repayments and not be insolvent.
As for new mortgage takers - he highly recommends getting to know the different routes and adjusting the mortgage to their financial capacities.
Same in the future when rates drop they will be able to do mortgage refinancing with minimum repayment fees early.
As for buyers of apartments from a contractor - a bundle recommends pre-empting payments to the contractor and taking out a mortgage now.
Keep in mind that the "building inputs index" increases the property price significantly even after the purchase contract is signed.
The price index for residential construction inputs increased by 6.6% over the past year.
The Banking Supervision Department announced yesterday that it is considering creating a mechanism to include the mortgage.
Fuel prices are rising - and Israelis will be forced to pay more than NIS 8 per liter in July
The Ministry of Energy announced that the new price for a liter of 95 octane gasoline will be NIS 8.08.
At the same time, it will be extended until the end of 2022 the reduction of half a liter of tax on diesel fuel
A decade high: The price of gasoline will jump by 36 cents a litre, starting July 1 at more than 8 cents a litre.
The new price for a liter of 95 octane gasoline will be 8.08 and those seeking full service will be required to pay another 21 cents per litre.
Meanwhile, the reduction of half a shekel per litre in diesel tax will be extended until the end of 2022, the IRS said.
As mentioned, the price increase is due to the continued increase in oil prices, against the backdrop of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Were it not for the half-shekel discount subsidized by the government since April, the price of fuel would pass the all-time high of $8.25 a litre.
The discount expires at the end of July and the Treasury is currently issuing a public comment decree extending the gasoline tax cut until August 9.
As of August 10, another half-shekel reduction will be set, so only from that date will the price of one liter of gasoline be reduced by November 15, 2022.
This was reported by the IRS.
We have reached a point where I can't remember five months in a row of surplus state revenues.
We started a few months ago with the issue of the tax reduction on diesel fuel.
We have been working for a week on an extension for another four months of the Blue, Petrol and Diesel tax - instead of half a shekel.
It's good for the industry and the citizenry.
If we cut back, it will affect inflation, lower production and ease the cost of living.
"As Finance Minister, despite the election campaign, I intend to focus on this first," Lieberman said at the Hurwitz conference.
Currently, more than half of the price of gasoline is taxes collected by the government (Blue Tax and VAT) - higher than most developed countries.
The price of fuel has a dramatic impact on the cost of living, as it affects household and business costs, transport costs, and more.
For the third time in a row: Ashdod - the most business-friendly city in Israel
Petah Tikva came in second place in the Ministry of Economy's Doing Business ranking •
Followed by: Rehovot, Ashkelon and Rishon LeZion •
Minister Barbivai: "COVID-19 has emphasized the importance of local government in business development"
- Yeah.
Ashdod is the friendliest city for small and medium enterprises.
For the third consecutive year, the agency's Doing Business Index ranked SMEs in the Ministry of Economy and Industry.
In second place is Petah Tikva, and in third place is Rehovot.
After them are located in order: Ashkelon, Rishon LeZion, Tel Aviv, Haifa, Ramat Gan, Holon, Beer Sheva, Jerusalem, Bat Yam, Netanya and Bnei Brak.
The agency edits the Local Authorities Index.
This is the fifth time, as it allows each authority to compare its performance to other authorities in a variety of parameters.
The index is based on several parameters tested by each authority, which test the level of "friendliness "of the business in its field.
The index divides municipalities into three size groups by number of residents, as a municipality of up to 50,000 does not resemble a municipality.
TA has surged this year
The index is updated once a year and weighs four different rankings in each local authority: business satisfaction, tendering accessibility and tax.
Ramat Gan dropped from second to eighth place, Bat Yam dropped from fourth to 12th place, and Netanya dropped from fifth to 13th place.
Declining ratings do not mean business services have declined, and in many cases it means that other agencies have improved their services.
Among those in the ranking are Petah Tikva, which rose from sixth place to second place, and Rehovot, which rose from 12th to third place.
Tel Aviv, which fell from fourth place to 11th place in 2019, improved in 2021 and rose to sixth place.
Business is a growth engine.
The ranking indicates that the Galilee landscape leads the local authorities with a population of between 50 and 150,000.
It is followed by Kiryat Motzkin, Mateh Binyamin, Modi'in, Reut, Kfar Saba, Ra'anana, Nahariya, Karmiel, Afula and Hod Hasharon.
The 28th and last place is Tiberias.
"The index aims to encourage local authorities to facilitate small and medium-sized enterprises," says Minister of Economy and Industry.
"Businesses are a significant driver of growth in the Israeli economy and account for 50% of the business output and 60% of the economy.
Small business development is in the public interest of all of us, but the local authority has a direct impact on the businesses that are there.
Corona emphasized the importance of local government, and we saw that authorities who promoted small businesses found creative solutions for them.
Ran Kaviti, director of the SME agency at the Ministry of Economy and Industry, adds: "Local authorities have a key role to play.
In the past two years, as we deal with the coronavirus crisis, authorities have weighed more heavily on helping businesses survive.
MailOnline 2021: 20 packages for every household - and a surge in their weight
46.6 million packages arrived in Israel during 2021 - similar to 2020 •
The average weight per pack is 435 grams - a jump of 36% compared to 2020 •
The busiest month: December, when the average package weight was 524 grams.
In 2021, 46.6 million parcels of mail arrived in Israel, nearly 20 parcels per household on average, according to Israel Today.
The number of packages delivered in 2021 is similar to 2020, when 46.5 million packages arrived in Israel, and lower than 2019 when 61.6 million arrived.
However, this year there has been a jump of more than 36% year-on-year in the weight of packages coming from overseas.
In 2021, 20,253 tons of foreign goods arrived in Israel, a 36% jump from 14,860 tons in 2020, and 16,743 tons in 2019.
Changes in consumer habits
The average weight per pack jumped 60 percent in two years - from 272 grams in 2019 to 435 grams in 2021.
Package weight gain is mainly influenced by two major trends, both seller and buyer: the major shopping sites unite items.
Fast delivery within a few days of ordering supports the purchase of more everyday items such as clothing and gifts.
In 2021, as in 2020 and 2019, the month with the most packages from abroad and the highest number of items is December, with 4.2 million.
In December, the average weight per packet was 524 grams, 20% higher than the annual average weight.
The Black Friday Effect
More packages arrived in December than in any other month, likely due to November shopping holidays, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.
Large orders start arriving in Israel between one and two weeks after purchase.
Study: Most Employees Don't Know They Can Get Tax Refunds
Many employees deserve money from the state, which can amount to tens of thousands of shekels.
You've changed jobs?
Did you go to the hospital?
Have you moved from town to town?
You may be entitled to a substantial amount of money in a simple procedure.
All the details are inside.
Most renters are unaware of the fact that they are entitled to tax returns, which can accrue to large sums.
The auditor noted in a report two months ago that two million employees are eligible for tax refunds of NIS 3.6 billion.
Many renters can get a large sum, as four out of five renters are eligible for tax refunds.
In practice, however, several tens of thousands of employees are served annually.
If you think these funds are going down the drain anyway, think again: Renters can apply to the IRS for returns for six years back.
Tax:On conducted an in-depth study of 4,000 of its customers regarding their tax returns during 2020.
The company has over 30,000 customers, so the sample reflects their dispersion in terms of population groups and gender, ages and geography.
During 2020, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus crisis and hundreds of thousands of workers, there were significant changes of NIS 4,300.
The reason is that starting fees are lower than wages, so there is a gap between what the worker paid as a tax and what they actually need.
Incidentally, the highest refund received in 2020 by a customer of the company was NIS 121,054 for refunds over the past 6 years.
What can I get my tax returns for?
One reason to get tax returns is a change in the workplace.
81% of people who switched jobs during the year received an average tax return of NIS 2,943.
Another reason is maternity leave.
The data showed that 74% of women who gave birth and took maternity leave over 16 weeks were eligible for a refund at an average of NIS 3,538 for that year.
Another reason for refunds is contributions.
100% of people who donate and pay taxes have been reimbursed.
Another factor in the refund is the failure to register credits for child support. 63%
The divorcees did not update a credit point for child support, so the tax return for each year that was not updated is NIS 2,616.
Due to unemployment, 93% of those who went on sick leave or unemployment earned over NIS 12,000 received a tax refund of NIS 4021 for that year.
Reimbursement for life insurance payments, life insurance on mortgage, refund for birth, refund for losses in securities, and non-registration of credits.
94% of people who deposited for personal life insurance or for taking out a mortgage were eligible for a tax refund.
For every million shekels of a 25-year mortgage, the cumulative tax return for the period is more than 20,000 shekels for the entire mortgage.
100% of eligible residents were reimbursed for the transition year, since the first year is paid full tax within 12 months.
79% of customers who hold securities were eligible for the tax refund for the said years.
However, those who hold securities should check every year as losses are not rolled out year on year but only through filing a report.
56% of men who have a child do not write credit points in the year of birth on their pay slip.
The return rate can reach tens of thousands of shekels over six years.
This is a phenomenon that exists mainly in the Arab sector.
Tal Carmon, CEO of Tax: "The coronavirus crisis has made the Israeli public much more active.
He's interested, checking and demanding what's coming to him in his income tax returns.
Sitting at home, after hundreds of thousands of Israelis were laid off for months, caused many employees to look deeper into what they deserve.
It is important to know that all tax returns can now be done digitally, easily and simply, without the bureaucracy that used to deter many.
Job market: Fewer job applicants, more wages
Olajobs Report 2021 Summary: Top of Demand - Jobs with No Experience •
Job openings increased by 50%.
Looking for a job, but not hitting the market.
The year just ended saw a 15% drop in the number of CVs submitted, and an average of 23 candidates ran for each job in 2021, according to a report.
Jobseekers were mainly interested in jobs such as administration and sales, for which 1,738,485 CVs were sent.
However, the jobs with no experience led to more than 38,000 searches - likely due to a return of unskilled workers.
Sales and administrative searches were 35,000 and 32,000 (respectively), drivers and couriers had 11,000 searches, and retainers had just under 9,000.
On the other hand, despite the coronavirus crisis, wages in 2021 increased by 2% compared to 2020, and the average wage in Israel was NIS 11,675.
The average monthly wage in the software sector was NIS 17,915, and in IT analytics it was NIS 17,140.
Between the center and the periphery there was a pay gap of more than 2,000 shekels: in the center of the country it was 12,500 shekels on average.
In terms of gender, the average pay gap between women and men, which can also be explained by the type of work and hours, was kept at 36%.
Men earned 13,295 shekels, while women earned 9,740 shekels.
Trying to get back in line
On the business side, there has been growth across almost all sectors of the economy, and businesses have been craving working hands.
Thus, the supply of jobs increased by 50%, registering a record high of more than 40,000 jobs in Olajobs.
A survey of employers found 50% were optimistic about their economic status in 2022, 30% said they plan to increase hiring but 72% say so.
The biggest supply was for jobs with no experience - and such were more than 58,000 on site.
Customer service and administrative roles followed with 44,000 jobs in each sector, sales and software with 41,000 vacancies each.
Einav Boehmfeld, Director of Research and Content, said: "Job seekers are trying to get back on track but are not storming the market.
Also, the prolonged disconnect from the workforce makes it difficult for them to return, and some have found creative ways to earn a living.
Israel's unemployment rate rises to 6.3 percent
Bureau survey data shows that about 270,000 Israelis were out of work in December 2021 •
In November, about 262,000 people were unemployed.
The unemployment rate in the first half of December 2021 was 6.3%, about 270,000 Israelis, compared to 6.1% in the second half of November 2021 (262,000.
This is according to personnel survey data for the first half of December 2021 from the Central Bureau of Statistics.
The proportion of unemployed was 4.5 per cent in the first half of December 2021 compared to 4.3 per cent in the second half of November 2021.
In other words, it's 193,000 unemployed versus 180.3,000.
According to workforce features in the first half of December 2021 among people aged 15 and over, this includes 6,607,500 residents.
Of these, 64.4%, that is 4,252,700 are in the workforce and the remaining 2,354,800 are not in the workforce.
Of those in the 95.5% workforce, 4,059,700 are employed and the rest are underemployed.
Of those who are not in the workforce, 2.3% stopped working because of layoffs or job closures from March 2020.
Workforce surveys provide information about the workforce in Israel and are conducted regularly by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
In the first half of December 2021 around 8,700 people aged 15 and over were regularly interviewed.
In the second half of November 2021 around 8,900 people aged 15 and over were regularly interviewed.
The survey population includes permanent residents of Israel, tourists and temporary residents who have been in Israel for more than a year.
The survey enables the development of the workforce, its size and features, the extent of unemployment, and more.
"Incomprehensible": Subliminal Shrines the Sabbath - and Prepares for Independence
Celebrating the fact that "we can live as we want," excited about meeting the audience and making sure to spend time with the children
Weekend and Independence Day of Kobi Shimony, Subliminal
What does your typical Friday look like?
Weekends are the most important moments in life for me.
Religion and tradition are very deep rooted in my soul.
Fridays are dedicated to children, Or (10) and Yonatan (8).
I pick them up from school, we buy flowers and groceries, have lunch and do something fun together, like play soccer, ride horses or play remote cars.
Sometimes you go to the beach, or even just wash the car, but always stop on the way to buy a gift at the toy store in the neighborhood.
When we return home with our gifts, the smell of cooking welcomes us.
What does your Friday dinner look like?
"I've been blessed with cooks around me.
On my side is a Persian cuisine, full of salads and an atmosphere of laughs, music, poetry and joy.
On the side of my wife Ines, who is also a great cook, comes the Ukrainian dishes, which are deep and spicy, with a lot of meat.
When we get to my mother-in-law, the building's lobby already smells amazing from her apartment.
I usually do the sanctification, along with the children, who know it by heart.
In the end, my fun after eating is passing out on the carpet, and having the kids jump on me like I'm some kind of inflatable.
Do you have any special childhood memories of the weekend?
"As a child, I would wake up on Saturday to Israeli music on the C network and the pale tracker sketches, which we knew by heart.
My father loved nature and we travelled a lot in Palestine, usually to the north.
Every nook and cranny of the country made him proud.
He died three months ago of a serious illness, and for him sanctuary and Sabbath were the holy of holies, especially in the sense of family.
I recently released a song in his memory called'Keeping You Safe', which I created with Oshr Cohen.
I believe he would have been proud of this work, which sanctifies the bond between father and son.
We will soon mark the 74th Independence Day. As an avid Zionist, what are your feelings about the holiday?
Independence Day is a sacred day for me, and part of my meaning and identity.
In Persia and Tunisia, my parents had to hide their Jewish identity, while I am an Israeli Jew who lives with his children in our country.
A week or two before Independence Day, I was already climbing trees and tying strings to the house with Israeli flags.
Today my independence days are filled with performances, and always meet an insanely happy audience, celebrating that we can live as we like.
We must also ensure that our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren have this option, and remember that nothing here is obvious.
Friday: Estee Zakheim Welcomes the Sabbath
"My dream is to open a big table and invite all the dead loved ones": Estee Zakheim dreams of a Friday dinner
Tell us about your preparations for Saturday.
- Yeah.
Preparations begin on Thursday night, when I return from a show or workshop and cook until 3 a.m. everything that requires long cooking.
On Friday, for the first part of the day, I take time for myself, to meet up with friends for coffee, a play or a movie, or I rehearse.
In the summer, Saturdays come late, and I have a lot of time to sit in the neighborhood garden and watch the sunset or just a good series.
At Shabbat dinner, I usually host my mother, Varda, who turned 89 and also friends.
Can you share more about cooking?
"I love shortcuts.
For example, instead of peeling 10 onions, cutting and crying, I buy a bag of frozen onions and fry it.
On my Saturday table you can find meat dishes, vegan tofu dishes, potatoes and cauliflower in the oven.
Most of the cooking I do, and of course they warm up on braces on a Saturday.
Alejandro, my partner, makes chicken soup, vegetable salad, and in the winter, the cholent.
Your husband is a religious man and you're from a secular home.
How does it work?
"Living with a Sabbath is an endless compromise.
"Love thy neighbor as thyself," in practice.
For family trips he couldn't get out, so I often found myself packing up the kids and joining family trips of friends.
Plus, I'm also the on-call driver for the kids, the one who brings them back Friday night from parties and gatherings.
On the other hand, I also enjoy the benefits of Shabbat, because I don 't usually show up on Shabbat and get a kind of forced vacation.
Who would you like to host on Saturday?
I'd open up a big table and invite my dead.
Sometimes I imagine if my brother Daniel were alive, or if my father, Shneor, had seen my children: Uriel (23) and the twins Tamara and Naama (16 and half).
We must have been fighting over football and politics and fading away.
Do you have any special childhood memories of the weekend?
We were a warm and united family.
On Friday afternoon, Mom would make a pile of schnitzels, bring chickpeas and pita bread, and burn eggplant for a tahini salad.
Then we'd go to Aunt Hannah's in Yad Eliyahu, or as she'd say, Yad Eliyake, and she'd make blintzes.
Since only I didn't like raisins, she'd make me some without raisins.
She saw me, the youngest of the brothers, and she cared for me.
On Saturdays we would tour with my father in Jaffa Port, and he would show us where he and his twin brother, Grisha, came to Israel with nothing.

- Yeah.
Nearly two decades after their first love story ended in a breakup, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck are closing in on a romance.
The happy news was shared on Friday evening by Lopez with her fans on her official website onthejlo.com
- Yeah.
News of the engagement comes after Lopez was pictured this week walking around with a huge diamond ring clearly visible on her engagement finger.
A representative confirmed to People magazine that Affleck and Lopez are indeed engaged.
The last time Affleck pulled out a ring and offered Lopez 52 to win it was 2002, when it was an eye-popping ring with a huge six-carat diamond.
Despite the grandiose love gesture, the pair split in 2004, accusing the media of over-obsessing and relentlessly snooping on their lives.
Affleck has since married actress Jennifer Garner, the mother of his three children, while Lopez is known to have been married three times.
Lopez's last romantic relationship was with baseball player Alex Rodriguez, who she split in April 2021 after a four-year engagement.
The Kardashians speak out: "You can't make up what's happening to us"
"The chaos is endless," mom Kris Jenner insists on the new series starring the reality TV family, and gets support from her daughters.
They talk about the big money, the PR grinder, the brand factory and the change Kim wants to make in the world: "I'm not the one who thinks about
This may come as a surprise to many, but the 2022 Disney content empire's most sought-after brand, including Marvel and Star Wars, is.
Details of the first-family contract with Disney were not disclosed, but estimates claim a minimum of $100 million.
In a press encounter with the stars, each accompanied by an entire Beauty team that cares for makeup touch-ups, hair, and wrinkles.
"You can 't make up what' s happening to us," says Kris Jenner, the family's mother, adamantly.
"We're showing how much we've grown since that 2007 series," Khloe Kardashian said.
"When we started we were terrified, a lot happens to us in life and you can't just confine everything to a narrative of beginning, middle.
A lot of storylines have been rushed through editing, wrapped in colourful film ticking over and forgotten aside.
This is not what life looks like in real life.
Now we're more exposed, facing the camera naturally, not just reality TV but an authentic documentary series.
Confronted with their new involvement in producing the show, Chloe says: "We are involved behind the scenes, we see clips while editing and giving notes.
It's a mirror of our lives and I personally feel like I've had emotional growth from watching myself.
Kendall and Kylie were little girls when we started, so they set boundaries more often.
"I have grown up"
Kim Kardashian, for her part, is going all out to change her image, from trashy reality TV to a lawyer with an agenda.
"I grew up raising four black children, that is, from a persecuted community that is discriminated against in this country.
I want to change reality so that my children and the children of all my friends can have a different future, hopefully we can heal the crooked system.
That's my motivation.
"I'm not the same Kim who spends hours thinking about which bikini selfies to upload," she insists," but it' s also not completely gone.
You have to be true to who you really are and take it all in stride.
Ryan Seacrest's reasons for firing them and their new and very lucrative way in the industry mean a move to Disney.

Aviv Geffen and Sarit Hadad: The outdoor festival that creates new surprises in Jerusalem
The international festival will feature musical performances by leading local artists, including circus performances and innovative art exhibitions.

Watch: Tamir Greenberg on his relationship with his father
The Next Star winner finds a second single and revisits his childhood memories and the significant presence of his father in his life.
"The song is about how to maintain a long distance relationship," he says.
Tamir Greenberg in a second single titled Into The Night after captivating audiences with his first single and featured in The Next Star.
In recent months, Greenberg has continued many concerts: Tel Aviv Cultural Center, Tel Aviv Opera House, Amphitheater, Ganei Yehoshua.
"Into the Night" was produced and adapted by Greenberg with producer Autumn Beger.
The video, directed by Daria Geller, brings Tamir back memories of his childhood and the significant presence of his father in his life.
The song is about the relationship between my father and me.
About when I left the country for the U.S. and how to keep in touch remotely," says Greenberg.
Greenberg will perform at Maccabiah's opening ceremony next month, and the song "Tell Me Where the Light Goes "was chosen as the audition song for next season.
Blue and White Produce: Jubilee Shamla is the season's biggest winner and 16th Ninja in the world
Phenomenon climbed Mount Maduriama in 26 seconds and took the title of first Israeli ninja.
Yogev Malka climbed the mountain in 29 seconds, but will not hold the title of ninja.
e
Yuval Shmuel has conquered Miduriyama and is the winner of the fourth season of Ninja Israel and is now the world's first and 16th Ninja.
Shamla has been on the show since its first season when he finished in first place, and in the second season he lost to Gil Maranz.
In season three, he won again and recently returned for season four, stating during filming that this would be the final season.
Tonight he climbed Mount Midoriam for the first time in 26 seconds and finished in first place, beating contestants Yogev Malka and Yishai Klepon.
Malka managed to climb the mountain in 29 seconds, finishing second.
According to the rules of the show, only one person can be crowned each season who has managed to climb Midoriam in time.
Therefore, despite the impressive feat of Queen, as a jubilee full of winners climbed three seconds faster, Malka does not win the world title.
He can re-compete next season.
Well, we get it, full of superheroes, perfect rock harnesses, and Ninja Israel is the most important sporting event in the world.
- Yeah.
Two Olympic medalists and a veteran sportscaster sat in the final of a reality show acting like it was the most significant sporting achievement on earth
- Yeah.
Rotem Sela represents such a perfect feminine ideal for us that it is perverse to present it in this way on television.
She earns more on campaigns than Wonder Woman, she's too pretty, she knows how to put Dana Weiss in her place, and when necessary.
She is a mother as well as a career woman who posts banks and air conditioners, poses and leads shows and reality shows, and acts as an unreachable role model.
And maybe it makes sense that Rotem Sela is too perfect, because the show she hosts has to be perfect, and there is no need to apologize.
In the world of the Ninja, everyone is larger than life, and the guides are first.
Assi Ezer got involved in an affair that was supposed to wipe him off the screen for a while, but since he is not a normal human being.
Listen to the soundtrack: Niv Raskin, who has won European Cups and world records, but is excited about the biggest sporting achievement on Earth.
Two Olympic medalists (Jordan Gerbi and Linoy Ashram) sat next to him, as if to emphasize how rare and high-quality the superhuman world is.
"Ninja Israel "was blown out of proportion to market the season, which ended last night with Midoriama Mountain and Yuval being crowned a ninja.
There he led an almost impassable course, taking down all the superhuman characters that the show had inflated over the year.
Do you want to be a Ninja Turtle?
Not with us.
This is where we look for heroes.
The emphasis was on seeking a successor to Shamla, who is known as the "one-of-a-kind king," and other nicknames to show how perfect he is.
As a result, the girls who tried to compete in the season crashed, and the boys competed over who had more abs and charisma to fill the shoes.
They say it's a sports program that encourages exercise and overcomes difficulties and challenges, but for the vast majority of viewers.
Faster, stronger, taller, more perfect.
As Gil Sassover ranges from punchlines to talks of sainthood
Strange to see the comedian, X Comedy Store, host of the Channel 14 show Kabbalah, where he tastes removals and gives mostly men a platform.
If we play an association game, we will all have similar answers to the question What reminds you of the concept of Saturday preparations?
Say: sponges and cleanliness, gas pots and smells in the stairwell, Yaron Ilan or Avi, but it would be weird if someone said Gil Sassover.
Because Gil Sassover in the middle of the sponge and cooking is the most unrelated thing that TV can offer.
And really, Kabbalah Shabbat, the new show he hosts on Friday afternoon on Channel 14, is spiritually cut off from the time it airs.
Along half of it - Sassover stands.
He speaks quickly, holding a microphone in his hand even as he tastes dishes, and tries to divide the dose between punchlines and conversations about sainthood.
In his defence, the poverty of the budget is felt, and this is probably the maximum that can be produced under these conditions.
However, what was also felt in the premiere show, which aired yesterday from Benjamin's headquarters, is a clear gender divide.
The men sang, played, danced, spoke Torah, marketed restaurants and factories, while the women made do with a small sewing shop.
Happy Women's Day to you.
Getting a Saturday with Gil Sassover, now 14
Secure Housing Association v. Ruthie Russo: Saying'it tastes like assisted living' harms our activities
Yuli Gat sent a letter expressing the union's complaint against an insulting statement by the judge in one of the trailers.
Ruthie Russo: I'm glad some places are investing more in the culinary of this population.
The Association of Nursing Homes and Protected Housing in Israel says: "A letter sent by Chairman Yuli Gat to Israel today:
"Ruthi Russo describes her disappointment with the food he served immediately eliminates our long-standing activity in residential homes.
"Service teams and home managers are fighting for the image of affordable housing for the elderly, including loneliness,
In recent years, more and more families and older people understand that loneliness is the most serious illness in the community.
"Food is one of life's greatest pleasures, so we devote resources and effort to serving our residents the finest food.
Most shelters use professional chefs to build a menu.
We will be happy to invite the judging panel to see the winning dishes served daily to tens of thousands of elderly people in Israel.
Come together, the Israeli media and society, to encourage community housing for the health of the elderly.
Ruthie Russo said: "Glad that some places are investing more in culinary of this population, who definitely deserve great food in life.
I respect the hard work of cooks, cooks, sanity and chefs everywhere, even in the assisted living.
"Double standards: in Russia you cancel a show but in Israel you didn't cancel?"
Nick Cave responds to criticism
The singer was referring to the criticism levelled at him by a Turkish fan, who accused him of double standards.
"The invasion of Ukraine is very different from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
"Mr. Hunt"
Nick Cave cancelled a concert in Russia earlier this week because of the war, saying he stood by Ukraine and prayed the madness would end soon.
This joined esteemed Australian artists and bands such as Iggy Pop, Green Day and Franz Ferdinand, who also cancelled performances in the invading country.
But in Kiev's case, his cancellation notice took a slightly different turn.
Turkish fan Ahmet slammed the singer for being hypocritical as Kiev refused to cancel two shows in Israel in 2017 despite criticism.
Ultimately, I'm here for two reasons: the first is because I love Israel and the Israelis, and the second is because I oppose musicians.
Ahmet vividly remembered Kiev's statements for music and against politicization.
"The Red Hand Files "is a poignant post in which Israel is also an occupying country, and therefore Palestine is the same.
"What bothers me about your announcement about Ukraine is that you did not support the Palestinians who are also suffering from a brutal regime.
In fact, you described Israel as a functioning democracy, but I think Israel is first and foremost the cause of Palestinian suffering.
This makes me very sad, since you represent a double standard here," concluded the Turkish fan.
But the story does not end here, as Kiev chose to reply to Ahmet with a long and detailed letter," Russia invades Ukraine.
The first situation is an earlier unprovoked attack by one country on its neighbour, hoping to change the security order of the whole of Europe.
The second situation is complex friction between two peoples.
The conflicts are similar in that innocent people, who share a tragic fate, are forced to hide in shelters.
I feel great sympathy for all of these communities, no matter where they are and who they are.
Kiev added that while he does not want to elaborate on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he also supports the Palestinians.
"But this is not a time for arguments, Ahmet, this is a time to unite and support the Ukrainians, who are currently in a catastrophe.
I have great admirers in Russia, and I know that many Russians are vehemently opposed to the actions of Putin's regime.
If I could play for them, I would.
In light of the decline in morbidity, the coronavirus project will return to the management of Ziv Hospital.
Prof. Salman Zarqa was appointed to the post in July 2021 and led the coronavirus treatment policy in the third wave and the fourth wave •
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue his role as a projector at the same time.
Prof Zarqa said: "Glad the Omicron wave is continuing to wane, and we still have a duty to prepare for another wave."
- Yeah.
Against the backdrop of declining coronavirus cases, Prof. Salman Zarqa will return to run the Ziv Hospital in Safed on Sunday.
At the request of Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz, he will continue in his role as a projector in parallel.
I am pleased for the citizens of Israel that the Omicron wave continues to wane and that we have our normal way of life back.
Prof Zarqa was appointed to the post in July 2021 and led the coronavirus treatment policy in the third wave and the fourth wave.
As of May 1, Israel is back in "inter-wave mode," which reduces most coronavirus variants, while maintaining sequencing and testing capabilities.
Covert comorbidities
The National Coronavirus Campaign Information Center said, The average number of new hospitalizations is falling below 2,000.
However, they emphasized that "there is a significant latent morbidity and in practice the number of infected is much higher.
The number of institutional tests performed in the community (without weighing in from abroad, MI) is low, averaging less than 20,000.
The low volume of tests makes it difficult to identify and understand the disease trends.
Auditor's report: The actual budget for most years of the pharmaceutical basket committee's activity is less than the recommended budget
According to Matanyahu Engelman's report, for more than 20 years, the Ministry of Health did not oversee the committee' s activities.
The report also said that the minutes of the meetings are published significantly late, if at all.
The auditor also recommends increasing the transparency of the subcommittee's activities - and updating the procedures of the bin work •
The Ministry of Health has not asked HMOs for reports on the extent of use and use of the drugs in the basket - which could analyze and audit.
The Medicines Basket Committee is one of the most influential public committees on our daily lives and health.
Each year, the committee decides on new medicines that will be given to the public free of charge - but a new report by the State Auditor.
Israel Hayom reporter Ran Resnick adds that the State Comptroller's investigation was conducted following the ongoing exposures in Israel Today.
According to the report, Engelman recommends making repairs and improvements to the basket that the public deserves.
In 1998-2021 a total of NIS 8 billion was added to the state budget, with the addition ranging from NIS 0 to NIS 500 million each year.
In 2019, 2020 and 2021, requests were made to add 800 new drugs and technologies to the healthcare basket, at a total annual cost of over NIS 2 billion.
In practice, the budget allocated for the expansion of the basket was smaller than the scope of the requests.
For most of the years (90% of the time), the budget was less than 1.5% of the health basket, recommended by various committees.
The auditor notes that the height of the annual supplement needs to be reviewed and regulated in order to allow for certainty and long-term planning.
Engelman also noted that "the transparency model in basket work is lacking ."
The minutes of the meetings, which are closed to the public, will be published within 60 days, but the minutes of the meetings are often not.
The delay in publishing the protocols impairs the transparency of the decisions; therefore, the ability of the bidders to reject them.
"The Ministry of Health must publish the protocols in accordance with the schedule set out in the protocol."
Out of thousands of submissions, only one financial statement was submitted.
Another review by Engelman concerns the preliminary process of evaluating the technologies submitted to the pharmaceutical basket.
The auditor found that about half (46%) of the technologies submitted did not pass this stage, but the health ministry does not publish the reasons.
Another flaw concerns the activities of the drug subcommittee, which is closed to the media and public, and discusses patient numbers and costs.
The auditor recommends attaching a public representative or exploring the possibility of publicizing the discussions without confidential commercial details.
According to the Health Basket Committee, an "economic assessment "must be submitted to a request for a drug to be added to the basket.
Over the years, however, only one financial assessment out of thousands has been submitted - and the committee makes its decisions without one.
For example, for the 2021-2019 basket committee hearings, applications have been made to add anti-obesity drugs to the basket.
The report found that no economic estimates were attached, including an estimate of how much could have been saved due to obesity damage.
It also suggests that the decisions of the Medicines Basket Committee are inconsistent with the goals and strategy of the Ministry of Health.
In 2019, the Ministry of Health defined preventive medicine and preparations to treat chronic disease growth as goals.
The auditor also warns that since 2011, non-HMO services, including rehabilitation devices and other vaccines, are included in the basket.
This is when the legal framework for this measure is regulated only retrospectively.
In the past six years, NIS 74 million has been used from the addition to the basket of medicines for these services.
Engelman recommends that the Ministry of Health update the basket work procedures and also determine if a separate financial supplement is needed.
About one-third of new drugs are classified as "non-cost drugs," the use of which does not cost HMOs an additional amount because they replace existing therapy.
The reviewer suggests that these drugs should be discussed on a shortened course, so that they can be updated several times a year.
There are no controls on the use of extremely expensive medicines.
Since its inception 20 years ago, the Ministry of Health has not asked HMOs to report or oversee its use and utilization of funds.
Over the years, only two reports relating to 2006-2009 have been published, and they were also published late.
The delay in conducting tests can make it difficult to collect and analyze data, irrelevant to the subcommittee's conclusions.
The ministry also does not audit and oversee the use of extremely expensive drugs and has not carried out any lessons.
These are 10 drugs that accounted for 62% of the addition to the basket ($1.7 billion in 2021-2016).
"It is recommended that the Ministry of Health carry out individual controls on these drugs and technologies and analyze their use.
Controls and analysis will enable systemic conclusions to be drawn on the process and how to prepare and improve estimates.
"Shocking and unimaginable": heated health board hearing on poisoning in Beit Dafna
Metrics of the first Jose who died were normal ten minutes before her death.
MK Silman: If the people there cared that the kitchen would be like home, it wouldn 't look like this.
Ten minutes before the first 40-year-old Jose died of food poisoning, she was given medical indicators that were normal.
"We have night carers who check in during the night and there's a nurse who's doing rounds.
There were several reports of diarrhoea cases and the last time they were taken was 10 minutes before she stopped responding and were normal.
She was monitored like the rest of the dikkers with diarrhea.
She's a nursing patient, we went to get a Mnuch to assist in her transfer and then the same resident didn't respond.
We started CPR and called the clinic nurse," the day care manager said on Sunday morning at the residence.
Three residents died, six were hospitalized, and a quarter of the residents (33 of 131) had diarrhea to eat contaminated meat.
The daycare manager made the comments amid claims that death from food poisoning indicates neglect and a lack of monitoring by caregivers.
Dr. Naama Noss in charge of epidemiology said: "We cannot conclusively determine what the three residents died of.
They only had blood tests.
It also emerged that even residents who were admitted to hospital could no longer get a stool sample because they had not ruled it out.
The Ministry of Health checks sanitary status in kitchens every four years at the request of the Ministry of Social Affairs or for renewal.
The Ministry of Welfare acknowledged that the committee has not yet been appointed to this case and previous cases of spousal abuse in Sharon.
MK Idit Silman said during the hearing: "If people there cared that the kitchen would be like home, it wouldn 't look like this.
Welfare dorms need more.
They are health-sensitive and need extra care.
It is shocking and unimaginable what happened there.
The horrific findings came to light even after they knew the Department of Health had come to inspect.
Where is the oversight and responsibility of the agencies?
How is it that ministers and chief executives are not present in such a debate to give an explanation of what is happening here?
Yigal Nachumi, CEO of Eckstein House, who runs the daycare center, said: "Hundreds of thousands of people in the entire system get up only for good.
The people who died are the people I personally cared for.
I put one of the residents down on my hands.
This is a shocking event for us.
Smadar Ona, a former resident of the same residence as her age, lashed out at him, saying: "Enough with the lies and the nice words.
I was there.
Gali Barmy, representative of the parents in Akeem Israel, said: We have complained about the food before and we have not accepted the criticism.
Oren Hellman, founder of the project, said: "Their names are not known at all.
They're worth less?
Disrespecting the lives of our children.
A suspected omission in Wolfson: The surgeon caused a heart rupture - and the patient died.
This is the first procedure performed by Dr. Pras Abu Aqar as the director of the hospital's breast surgery unit.
The chairman of the medical board complained that the director, Dr. Engel, had been warned before his appointment.
Hospital: "He's well respected and experienced"
A terrible mistake occurred at Wolfson Government Hospital, Holon, when the doctor ruptured his heart, leading to his tragic death.
The surgery on an 83-year-old lung cancer patient was performed on April 19th.
It was the first surgery performed by Dr. Pras Abu Aqar at the hospital, after he was appointed director of the breast surgery unit in Wolfson.
Designed to drain the area around the patient's heart, the surgeon accidentally caused a major rupture, causing serious bleeding.
However, the unusual complication opened Pandora's box, which raised serious questions about the hospital's management.
Director of the Oncology Institute and Chairman of the Medical Board, Dr. Ronen Brenner, demanded an investigation of the affair.
The letter raised serious allegations about Dr. Engel's conduct and the appointment of Dr. Abu Aqar, after the previous unit director.
Huge hole in the heart.
According to Dr. Brenner's letter, the patient has been lucid, functioning and cared for by him for the past four years.
Recently he had a spread of the disease, and there was an abnormal accumulation of fluid inside the pericardium, which contained the heart muscle.
In addition, surgeon Dr. Abu Akar was impressed that he could perform the surgery.
Dr. Hagai Dekel, director of cardiothoracic surgery at Wolfson, who was at the time operating on a child in the next room, saw a hole.
He said the heart was drained of blood, blood pressure was nil, and the surgical approach was wrong.
In addition, Dr. Brenner said Dr. Dekel contacted him and told him that Dr. Abu Akar was not qualified to run a breast surgery unit in Wolfson.
However, despite his explicit warnings, Dr. Engel carried out a tender without sharing it and accepted Dr. Abu Aqar for the job.
He added: "This is an uncomplicated process, which takes a few minutes," adding:" The process of getting Dr. Abu Akar into office is unimaginable.
The question arises as to whether Engel is directly responsible for the failure of the operation and the death of the patient.
Experienced Surgeon
Israel Hayom was presented with information and claims by other senior doctors that reinforce the questions raised in the case by Ronen Brenner.
Dr. Mordechai Shimonov, Director of Surgery A at Wolfson, responded to Brenner's complaint and wrote that Dr. Abu Akar is "one of the most
He added that he was properly tender and Dr Dekel did not take part, in line with his statements of wanting to "disconnect" from the chest unit.
He added: "I wasn't privy to the procedure either, and perhaps I should have been.
Dr. Pras Abu Akar began work on April 10 and is entitled to 100 days of kindness," all the doctors were impressed by his professionalism.
He has already carried out dozens of cases of a similar procedure, and unfortunately the current case ended as it did unfortunatly.
Wolfson Hospital said in a statement: "We share the family's grief.
This is a patient of oncologist Dr. Ronen Brenner.
The chest surgeon mentioned in the article is a highly regarded and experienced surgeon, and was selected in a bid to manage a
"In the words of Dr. Hagai Dekel, his quoted remarks are not accurate and were taken out of context.
It should be noted that this is a patient who has unfortunately been in a very difficult situation.
The hospital is reviewing the details of the case with transparency, and the Ministry of Health knows the details of the case.

A model of healing: Three top doctors tell of their mentors
Prof. Galia Rahav misses the wit and wisdom of the late Professor Marvin Shapira, especially during the pandemic.
Dr. Shlomi Kodesh does not forget, even from the top of his post, the push from the late Prof. Shaul Suknik •
And Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev thanked Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld for the lesson in identifying with the patients •
Three key people in hospitals write about who inspired them and encouraged them to be better, both as caregivers and as people.
Three senior doctors, three teachers of life and profession: Israel Hayom invited Prof. Galia Rahav, Dr. Shlomi Kodesh and Dr. Efrat Baron-Harlev to remember their early days.
Prof. Galia Rahav, Director of the Infectious Diseases Unit in Sheba.
About Prof. Marvin Shapira z "l
The meeting that opened my eyes and changed my life.
Had I not met the late Professor Marvin Shapira, who was the Director of Infectious Diseases at Hadassah Hospital, I probably would have been an internist.
He's the one who made me love infectious disease and inspired me to pursue it.
I met him in the corridors of Hadassah, back in the 1980s.
I never thought I would leave the inner, for I loved patient care; but Prof. Shapira showed me that infectious diseases are also present in the inner.
I am grateful to him for bringing me into this field.
Throughout, I liked his investigative approach, an approach that gets to the root of the problem.
The discussions with him were analytical and logical.
He was a doctor with all his soul, who loved the patients and taught me not to take things for granted and to look deeply into everything.
He was a genuine and honest man, devoid of ego, traits that I loved dearly about him.
Initially, when I was asked to choose a doctor who was a role model for me, I intended to choose my father, Dr. Joseph Rakover.
He was an amazing doctor, who inspired me to go into medicine - but he also reminds me of Marvin Shapiro.
Both, for example, have coined proverbs that doctors use to this day, such as tissues iz de iscio, or von Hughes Itt, an antibiotic.
The late Prof. Shapira was married to a physiotherapist who worked in Hadassah and had two daughters.
He passed away a year ago, and when I visited his family at seven, I cried.
He was something - a witty, smart epidemiologist, who volunteered for everything.
He never complained, not even during his illness.
He was one of the first doctors on the pandemic treatment team, and he is sorely missed during this time.
Had he been with us today, I'm sure I would have consulted him, and I'm sure he would have been one of the team leaders in pandemic care.

About the late Prof. Saul Sukenik
A teacher and a friend who supported me and raised generations of doctors
- Yeah.
I first met Prof. Saul Sukenik when I was a fourth-year medical student, and I went on a tour of internal medicine in Internal Medicine.
Later, I returned to the department in the sixth year, and did the medical school dissertation, writing a computer simulation on a polyarthritis.
Shaul influenced every major juncture of my professional life for 20 years, and was the most significant figure in my design.
During the internship, I debated family medicine and internal medicine, and consulted with him about the choice of internship.
In the end, I chose to specialize in internal medicine with him at Soroka.
During my internship, he provided me with constant guidance in a variety of ways - in science writing (sorry, I didn 't study enough).
To this day, I recognize in myself, as a doctor and as a manager, characteristics that come from Saul.
When I finished my internship and debated whether to go abroad, Saul pushed and directed me, helping me with letters of recommendation and advice.
Training was a very important period for my professional development, and without Saul's support and push, I am not sure it would have happened.
On my return, when I received an offer to join the hospital administration, Saul was again the one who supported and assisted.
Together, we managed complex periods in the Internal Medicine Division.
Saul was able to integrate the teacher, principal, friend and teammate perfectly, without interfering with his various roles.
I aspire to be as successful as he is in this special combination.
He raised generations of students, interns and interns, who are now in the medical system in Israel, commemorating him.
I'm honored to be part of this group.

About Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld
The man who taught me medicine, and most of all listening.
Tommy Sheinfeld, founder and former director of the ICU at the Schneider Pediatrics Center, taught me how to be an ICU doctor.
The obvious thing I learned from him is to take care of the most complex, the sickest children.
The children, some of whom were healthy just a moment ago, are now between life and death.
The obvious is to have very difficult conversations, perhaps the most difficult, with families who never imagined these complex situations.
Sounds strange, but it's the obvious.
But I learned even deeper and more meaningful things from him.
Looking back, since I am a doctor who is a manager and a doctor, it is clear to me today that the connection between worlds.
D. Sheinfeld taught me to listen to many things: listen to children, listen to the monitor, listen to nurses, both young and old.
All this must be done not only to communicate more correctly and successfully, but to constantly gather a lot of information that can prevent...
Preventative processes in childcare are everywhere, and of course in intensive care.
Listening and discourse inspire deeper understanding, both from the care staff and patients and their families.
My understanding today as an administrator is that these insights are also true when looking at an entire system.
The more thorough and rigorous understanding that incorporates all caregivers, the sooner the decision-making process will be precise.
This is why Dr. Tommy Sheinfeld is so much more than an inspirational figure to me.
He's a man who taught me a lot of medicine, but mostly taught me to think fast and accurately, to listen - and then apply.

Medical malpractice at various stages of birth.
In order to win damages, plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that the damage was caused by the same negligence.
Childbirth is one of the most joyous and exciting events in a family's life.
Unfortunately, sometimes births result in serious damage caused to the mother or newborn by the negligence of the medical staff.
In cases where the birth resulted in physical injury, the newborn or the mother, there is room to examine the events that led to injury.
A medical malpractice lawyer will examine whether there were defects in the conduct of the medical staff at the various stages of birth.
It should be emphasized that not every mistake in medical care is negligent (in the legal sense of this term).
When is it about negligence?
When a doctor's error was due to ineptitude or deviation from the reasonable level of caution, the ineptitude and carelessness caused
In this article we will examine the different stages of childbirth, explain what complications may occur at each stage and when they arise.
Axis phase
The contraction phase lasts an average of 8 to 14 hours.
At this point, the cervix gradually opens (to allow the embryo to pass at birth) and at the end of the process should reach a diameter of 10 cm.
Most contraction-stage medical malpractice involves not identifying fetal distress before birth, which sometimes results in cerebral palsy.
Cerebral Palsy (CP):
Cerebral palsy can be caused by a failure to recognize or delay in identifying a prenatal lactation, which is manifested by a failure to supply oxygen.
Generally, proper monitoring of fetal heart activity should lead to early detection of fetal distress, allowing medical staff to act quickly.
Cases in which medical staff ignore signs indicating that the fetus is lacking oxygen or the staff is misinterpreting data.
Cerebral palsy can also be caused by cord prolapse as well as a rupture of the uterus that has not been detected in a timely manner.
Even in these difficult situations, it is appropriate to find out whether the medical staff acted properly.
Anna Rafe Ligne, a lawyer who specializes in representing malpractice victims, says that her office treated a child's tuberculosis head injury.
In another case, she said that her office filed a lawsuit due to gross malpractice by a maternity ward staff who did not recognize a rupture.
The embryo ejected through the rupture of its mother's womb to the abdomen suffered severe fetal distress until it was rescued late.
Due to the severe fetal suffering during childbirth, the child suffered a complex neurological disability.
To win damages, plaintiffs must prove, in addition to negligence, that there is a causal link between the negligence of the infant.
The causal relationship will be examined by medical indicators based on the medical literature only on the causal link between the brain injury.
Among other things, measurements of acidity in the blood of the fetus, its Apgar scores, the existence of neurological and systemic injury, etc.
Fetal Deaths
Active stage of birth
The active birth phase begins when the opening of the cervix reaches a diameter of 10 centimeters and ends at the birth of the baby.
Unfortunately, most medical complications occur during this critical stage.
Delayed delivery and avoidance of caesarean section
In some cases, a dysfunctional birth develops, i.e., a lack of progress of the active birth process.
In such situations, it is customary to perform a Caesarean section to avoid various harms that may be caused to the fetus due to the birth delay.
"There are cases in which failure to perform a caesarean section in a timely manner can cause irreparable harm to the fetus," Raif-Lignza told us.
"For example, we ran a malpractice lawsuit of birth deaths caused by a significant delay in performing a caesarean section.
Unlike any known medical practice, medical staff failed to recognize the fetal distress and perform a C-section despite slow progression.
The delay in performing the surgery caused major systemic damage to her birth which eventually led to her death soon after her birth.
Vacuum birth negligence
In situations where the mother or fetus faces significant danger requiring a particularly rapid termination of birth, a vacuum is sometimes born.
In this process, a vacuum is attached to the head of the fetus and forcefully pulls out the fetus.
Naturally, this involves risks and can cause harm to both the fetus and the mother, and therefore requires caution, precision and skill.
Medical malpractice may mean that the doctor does not follow the instructions and performs the procedure despite repeated or repeated overtime.
In these cases, if the careless vacuum caused damage - among other things, it can cause cranial damage and bleeding that can cause brain damage.
Paralysis named after the ERB
Erb paralysis is a congenital nerve injury in the brachial plexus (a nerve node connecting the spinal cord to the upper shoulder).
The injury is manifested in weakness of the wrist muscles and can reach the full paralysis of the entire arm.
This paralysis is often caused by difficulty in removing the newborn due to shoulder disruption, an obstetric emergency that occurs when the head.
When should you suspect that the paralysis is caused by medical negligence?
In cases where the fetus is estimated to weigh more than 4.5 kg, it is better to deliver the mother by caesarean section.
When the newborn weighs more than 4 kg, consider a C-section due to the risk factors including diabetes and prolongation of the second stage of birth.
In case the medical team ignores an abnormal weight or other risk factors and chooses to continue vaginal birth, there is likely malpractice.
Indeed, in CA 2694 / 90, the Supreme Court ruled that the risk of shoulder stenosis can be predicted to some extent, and prevented.
Placental Exit Stage
Separation of the placenta from the womb and its exodus occurs due to the contraction of the womb after the newborn and is accompanied by bleeding.
The process usually takes up to half an hour after the baby is born and usually takes place spontaneously, without the involvement of the medical team.
After the placenta is removed, the medical team will check whether it is completely removed or if there are any placental parts left in the womb.
During this stage, complications may occur that can cause serious harm to the mother.
One of the known complications of placental residue is called Asherman syndrome, a scarring of the uterine wall that causes placental abruption.
Therefore, in cases where the medical staff did not identify placental residue or did not take all measures to prevent endometrial injury.
Death of the mother
Death during childbirth is a rare occurrence.
In these cases, the event that was supposed to bring happiness and joy to the whole family becomes, sadly, the most tragic event for her.
In some cases, the medical team does not detect bleeding in the mother in a timely manner or responds late to such bleeding.
"For example," Raif-Lignza told us," our office filed a lawsuit regarding the death of a childbearing mother."
"In another case," Raif-Lignza said," our office represented the relatives of a mother who died after the birth of twins.
The woman complained of severe pain and weakness after the surgery, but the medical staff did not properly address her complaints.
Uterine loss
In severe cases, malpractice can lead to a hysterectomy, Adv. Rafe Lingza said: "Our office has filed a lawsuit against a hospital.
In that case, the 31-year-old lost her womb due to a lack of proper care due to massive bleeding seen by medical staff.
What are the benefits of medical malpractice claims for childbirth?
Neonatal compensation for malpractice includes many components of damage, with the most significant amounts given to pain and suffering.
In most cases, compensation for lost wages and pensions is calculated on the basis of average wages.
It also includes medical expenses, medical and rehabilitation costs, housing adjustment costs for baby needs, mobility and more.
"The amount of compensation is determined in each case and according to its circumstances," says Raif-Lignza, adding:" Most lawsuits are settled."
To summarize
Malpractice in childbirth is definitely every family's nightmare.
A proper forensic examination of the events that led to the tragic outcome can help you win the compensation you deserve.
This is the reason for the prevalence of keratoconus eye disease in the south
Research suggests that there is a link between the development of the disease and close marriages
The highest prevalence was found in the Bedouin sector •
It is possible that in any sector with many weddings between cousins, we will find a high incidence of the disease.
Keratoconus is an inherited eye disease that causes some visual impairments.
It is very important to diagnose it early, and to find correct solutions to prevent the situation from worsening.
In recent years, several studies have been conducted to help understand how the disease develops, and innovative therapies have been developed.
The new studies provide research basis for the suspicion that keratoconus eye disease is a genetic disease.
Recent research has found that the cause of the disease and weakness of the cornea may be related to an enzymatic imbalance in the cornea.
The source of that lack of enzymes is genetic, a fact that reinforces the hypothesis that keratocanus is a hereditary disease.
According to Prof. Ariela Gordon-Shag, Head of Optometric Sciences at Hadassah Academic College," A study published in Arab students found a 3.2% prevalence.
The highest prevalence was among Bedouin students - 20% had keratoconus, but there was a small relative sample.
The researcher added that this is an unsurprising finding: "There is a large incidence of keratoconus in the Bedouin sector.
In our studies, we have found that close marriage is a risk factor for keratoconus disease.
So in any sector with lots of weddings between cousins, we may find a high prevalence.
This is an important finding: in cases where a family history of keratoconus occurs, all family members should get a proper eye exam soon.
Arza Fruchter, B.Sc. Clinical Optometrist, said, There is a tenfold appeal to the clinic from remote areas, especially the south.
Fruchter adds: "Over the past decade, I have noticed that most patients are evacuated from the periphery, especially from the Beersheba area.
This is mainly due to the high prevalence of marriages (especially in the Bedouin sector) and various allergies.
So how do you diagnose the disease?
Fruchter explains that keratoconus usually develops in adolescence or in the late teens (16-15 or 20 years).
The disease involves a decrease in vision, in parallel with an increase in cylinder.
Patients with keratoconus indicate distorted and / or blurred vision of images and objects.
These symptoms worsen with the development of the disease, which usually develops slowly and gradually over the years.
However, the disease may also develop at a rapid rate and peak in just a few months.
Many patients also show an increased sensitivity to light.
Three years after the operation in Gaza, the IDF revealed Lt. Col. M. Bennett: Now, the people know the face of the hero of Israel.
Mahmoud Khair al-Din is a lieutenant colonel killed in the operation in Khan Yunis.
He deserves publicity for his family and his children.
Next, the possibility of publishing Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno's photo will be examined from the General Staff's patrol.
Three and a half years after the operation in Khan Yunis, the IDF now permits the dead in action, Lt. Col. M. Mahmoud al-Din, to be released.
The 41-year-old was in the fall.
"It has been three and a half years since Lt. Col. Mahmoud Hir al-Din was killed in a secret operation in Khan Yunis and we are only now allowed to thank him.
"The late Mahmoud was a fighter in a paratrooper patrol and later grew up in the army to be a colonel in the IDF Special Operations Division.
A hero of Israel who was posthumously decorated in the shadow of the Chief of Staff.
"I mourned him at his funeral and now the people of Israel have the right to know him, the name and face of the hero of Israel.
The surroundings looked up to him.
Since the operation, the IDF has banned his name for security reasons, and today, after a discussion with the head of intelligence,
Mahmoud Khair al-Din, a hero of Israel, was born on December 28, 1977 in the village of Horfish, the oldest son of Ahmed and Nun.
He is a member of the Druze community.
He was married to Nehad and had two sons.
He served as an officer, combatant and commander in the Special Operations Division of the Intelligence Division.
Throughout his life, Khair al-Din was a social leader, and the environment looked up to him.
By the ninth grade, he studied at the school in Kfar Khorfish, and then moved to the military school at the Reali School in Haifa.
In October 1997, he enlisted in a paratrooper patrol, and in 2000 he graduated from the officer's school.
In 2002 he was tracked down by the Special Operations Unit in Amman and moved to serve there.
While serving, he earned a Bachelor of Law degree from the College of Management and a Master of Business Administration at Haifa University.
In 2002, he met his wife, Nahed, and in 2004 they married.
Their first son was born in 2009, a year during which he founded a non-profit organization that promotes the status of the Druze community in Israel.
In 2010, he joined Achrai and began guiding a group in Kfar Khorfish, after he made sure it started in the Druze villages to encourage youth.
In 2013, his second child was born.
Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva explained the reasons for the decision to reveal his name: "This is the time we become the hero of Israel.
We have completed work and concluded that there is no security reason to publish his name and photo.
He deserves it, too, for his family and his children.
"An exceptional educator and leader"
"Thanks to many operations, he is nothing short of a hero in my eyes," said Maj. Gen. Haliwa.
"He has made a significant contribution, which has courage and composure, to the State of Israel.
He should get the right place for him.
I didn 't know him personally, but he was an exceptional educator and leader - not only on the operational side, but also on my values.
Maj. Gen. Haliwa said he will also examine whether to publish the photo of another hero, Lt. Col. Emmanuel Moreno, who died during the war.
The operation in Khan Yunis took place on November 11, 2018.
The operation was the culmination of months of painstaking preparations undertaken by the intelligence community.
In the command squad of the operation sat Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot, Maj. Gen. Tamir Heyman and the then head of the ISA Nadav Argaman.
The purpose of the operation has not yet been disclosed, and the IDF emphasized that it was an action of invaluable intelligence.
But in Arab media hindsight, radio equipment that the Palestinians said had been left behind by the forces was presented.
According to Hamas, the operation was aimed at planting listening devices.
According to reports, on the day of the incident, the force was traveling in two vehicles.
The militants were detained at a checkpoint deployed by Hamas members, and something about their behavior aroused the suspicion of Hamas militants.
The activists surrounded the vehicle and began questioning its passengers.
The interrogation on the ground lasted about 45 minutes, during which time she became increasingly aggressive.
Realizing he was in trouble, Lt. Col. Khair al-Din managed to distract Hamas members, and in a split second the commander, Lt. Col. A., opened fire.
Three Hamas members were killed in the fire, and unfortunately so was Lt. Col. Kheir al-Din.
Ten months after the incident, the Chief of Staff, R.A.A. Aviv Kochavi, decided to accept the recommendation of the committee.
The commander and another member of the team were also awarded a medal.
Lt. Col. M. received the commendation for "acting with his team, in enemy territory, with determination, composure, and courage.
Later, he took a forward role in taking control of the enemy and acted resourcefully in promoting the takeover.
Consider switching from tweezers operations to an extensive operation
Israel must ask itself, again, whether it is wrong to change policy vis-à-vis the Jenin sector.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and set fire to the West Bank, but the Jenin militants may not.
The tumultuous weekend we've had suggests that even though the month of Ramadan is behind us, the terrain is still more explosive than ever.
It will take great effort and common sense to cross the next two deadlines: Nakba Day Sunday, and Jerusalem Day in two weeks.
Quite a few elements will come forward in an attempt to torpedo a return to sanity.
Headed, as always, by the terrorist elements, who are concentrating a special effort on trying to preserve the violent atmosphere of recent weeks.
Evidence of this was given during the arrest operation in which the SWAT fighter, Lt. Col. Noam Raz, was killed yesterday.
Fighters in Jenin testified that they do not remember such a scale of gunfire and violence, evidence not only of the huge amount of weapons.
This requires Israel to ask itself, again, if it is wrong to change its policy against Jenin, and to switch from small, mass-based tweezers.
During Ramadan, Israel refrained from doing so, fearing that Jenin would ignite and incendiary the West Bank and the entire arena.
Drawing lessons for future events.
Raz's death is the best answer Israel can give to anyone who claims to have deliberately killed Al Jazeera journalist Shirin Abu Akla.
Operational activity is dangerous for those who participate in it, and for those who are present at the scene.
The IDF takes enormous risks to its forces in order to avoid harming innocent people as much as possible, and sometimes pays for it with warriors.
It shows high morality, but it also has operational value: a terrorist captured alive - as in Jenin - is an otherwise poor source of information.
The IDF did the right thing when it published its interim investigation into Abu Akla's death, and clarified that it was not clear at this stage.
In the absence of Palestinian cooperation, it is doubtful that an unequivocal bottom line in the case can be reached.
In any case, nothing seems to convince the convinced: the world has been quick to condemn Israel without a word of empathy for the victims.
As always, the nature of stories like this perish.
Global public opinion is busy with its own and moving on, certainly as Ukraine continues to rage in a war that is more intense.
Therefore, it is unfortunate that Israel insisted on giving the Abu Akla case more unnecessary moments of exposure with its unsuccessful handling.
Even if Abu Akla's family did not live up to the preliminary summaries, we should expect a little more from the police officers who flew.
Responsibility requires: Acting to calm the situation.
The Minister of Public Security and the Police Commissioner did well to order the investigation.
It seems to lack sufficient preparation and clear guidance, but it is disturbing that this is the second time this has happened in a short time.
In the Dizengoff attack, police also failed to manage the incident, isolating the scene and dealing with the media.
The Commission would do well not only to analyze the funeral itself, but also to draw lessons and conclusions to better address future events.
Alongside the internal handling of the police, pledges also to account for the conduct of elected officials who have lost way and direction.
The Israeli Knesset currently has several members who appear to be a danger to democracy.
They are on the left and the right, using their immunity not to challenge the country, but to harm it.
Ofer Kassif is the latest example of this; if no action is taken against him - including prosecutions for assaulting a policeman - the state.
Such moves, which are defensive democracy, are vital in the explosiveness of this era, when political elements seek to exploit the situation.
Anyone with common sense is expected to rise above all this and act to calm the situation; otherwise, Israel may quickly escalate against enemies.
Senior police official: "Government policy and setting goals are needed"
The Israeli police have launched an operation to eradicate illegal aliens, but there is still a long way to go
There is no single factor in the State of Israel today that includes this whole issue.
"If you want to deal with illegal immigrants, you need government policy, and you need goals, tasks, and responsibilities.
Today, there is not a single factor in the State of Israel that includes this whole issue," a senior Israeli police official told Israel Today.
A month and a half ago, prior to the escalation of the security situation, there were 20,000 to 30,000 praises entering the fence.
In addition, between 100,000 and 110,000 Palestinians with work permits enter Israel every day through 34 supervised crossings.
Palestinians have been employed in Israel since the end of the Six-Day War, and the number of permits is limited by the quota.
The permits are issued by the IDF through the Coordination and Liaison Administration.
Therefore, it is not necessarily a Palestinian whose entry is prohibited due to criminal involvement or connection to the attacks.
The perpetrators of the attacks in Ariel, Dizengoff and Elad were praised, but were not supervised because they had not previously committed a crime.
"Those who want to attack can enter Israel through controlled crossings, and there have been cases like this before.
Thousands of arrests.
Following the attack in Elad and in light of multiple warnings, police launched a large-scale operation to locate illegal aliens.
By the end of the week, some 16,000 praises had been made.
Of these, about 600 were investigated and criminal cases opened, and about 200 were imprisoned.
According to police prosecution policy, proceedings against illegal aliens are carried out only against stumbling criminals or repeated recidivists
Illegals detained for the first time are interrogated, documented and returned to the territories.
This is sometimes repeated a second time, but only the third time he was arrested, imprisoned and charged with unlawful stay.
According to the law, if an illegal is caught within 50 to 100 meters of each side of the separation fence, it is dealt with by military prosecution.
Data from Israel Today shows that in 2021, 40,010 illegals have been processed, transported and relocated.
7,405 illegals were detained and 19,533 had a criminal record opened.
The number of employers, hauliers and walk-ins treated by police in 2021 was 6,537.
Some 469 have been arrested and 5,640 criminal cases have been opened.
"The foundation of the phenomenon of praise depends not on the police, not on the IDF, not on Israeli society and not on Palestinian society.
They are dependent on other factors," says a senior law enforcement official.
"To address this phenomenon, they must be sterilized for working in Israel, and the Israeli side must charge them a price to avoid crossing.
Officials say the failure to charge is due in part to a lack of places of confinement and the fact that arrests are only made.
Legal sources say the decision to charge commendations only from his third arrest is partly because courts cannot handle the number of arrests daily.
Anyone who examines punishment will find that it is not a deterrent.
There is a great complexity.
A police officer said, He's a complicated man.
He could be the father of a family who came into the country to work to earn a few quid and return.
This is the basic platform on which many types of praise enter the country to commit criminal offences or attacks.
They can be adults or minors.
Police previously seized illegals as young as 16 and even children as young as 8 and 10 are sent to road junctions to earn a few shekels a day.
"It also makes it complicated, because in such cases we have to bring the parents and charge them with neglect," says a senior police officer.
Most Palestinians are employed in Israel in manual labor.
The most unusual are electrical work or advanced building work.
In the past, there have also been local authorities who have employed accolades in rubbish disposal, particularly in the north.
Of the 34 crossings, there are about 18 major crossings.
There are crossings of vehicles and goods, there are crossings that only people pass through, and there are crossings that are both.
All the crossings are supervised by the IDF and the Transit Authority.
The accolades are usually driven into the country by private drivers, as it is easy money.
"Some do this for a living, and some gangs whose main occupation is transporting praise, are usually Israeli Arabs who speak the same language.
This can range from £100 to £300 per person.
Registered companies do not do this, because if the company is caught, it will be closed down.
The police emphasize that under certain conditions, transporting an animal can be considered a crime.
A taxi driver who collects Palestinians at regular points, including an orderly reservation, usually does not break the law.
Most of these guys drive with a car because they know they 're going to get their car impounded, so they prefer to drive an old car.

"A criminal investigation should be launched against her": Haifa city auditor on serious charges against Einat Kalish Rotem
City Auditor's Report Shows Alleged Fear of Criminal Behavior by Dr. Einat Kalish Rotem Against Ex-City Officials
"The harsh findings arising from the report require the opening of a criminal investigation."
The municipality of Haifa did not respond.
Monitoring city employees and political opponents and inflated payments to an accounting firm for investigations, at the expense of public funds.
Haifa Mayor Ofer Tal's report, published Tuesday, shows concern about criminal offenses by former municipal officials and political opponents.
Kalish allegedly met with the accounting firm Barlev & Co. and requested an investigative audit.
Investigations were conducted under names and codes given to former City Treasurer Sophie Nakash, testing whether the bids were legitimate.
The auditor's report also indicates that there is complete disarray and lack of control over the work of the accountant she met with.
The city treasurer coordinates and synchronizes the work of the accountant and the municipal branches and the data collected by the accountant.
This caused no one in the municipality to be aware of all the projects undertaken by the accountant, and the extent of work required in each.
Moreover, the hourly reports submitted by the accountant have not been confirmed in many cases as required.
The scope of issues involving the accountant grew disproportionately, with much intervention by the municipality, without any monitoring.
The audit recommended halting the unpaid payments to the auditor until material detailing his work on each of the issues was received.
In addition, invoices submitted to the Haifa municipality were under codes such as gatekeepers, information store, fish shop.
Soon after, City Attorney Marine Klein noted that the mayor herself signed off on the payment in her place.
"It was not commissioned by any audit report, and I don't know what it is about," she wrote.
Investigative audits cost NIS 2 million of which 1.5 million was paid and half a million remained to be paid from the taxpayer.
Former municipal treasurer Ghotki Wakim responded: These despicable acts to tarnish the name of elected officials and taxpayers.
Sophie tapped the city councilwoman in her response: "The auditor's report and the recommendations of the committee speak for themselves."
Haifa City Council member Sarit Golan: The hard evidence and findings of the report call for a criminal investigation into all former employees.
Lior Datz of Gatekeepers: It seems that all the red lines were crossed when a public authority sends investigators to collect information.
The Haifa Municipality did not provide comment.
Accountant Yehuda Barlev's office does not want to comment.
Gantz says Iran and Hezbollah have worked together to harm UNIFIL's operations in Lebanon.
The defense minister attended an international cyber conference at Tel Aviv University, claiming that Israel knows its opponents' cybersecurity systems.
Gantz referred to al-Sayyed's record in Hamas' captivity as a video aimed at extortion - on the back of a humanitarian issue.
Deputy Chief of Unit 8200 revealed they'thwarted attempts to poison the water systems'
Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz spoke at a cyber conference at Tel Aviv University, revealing a joint attack by Iran and Hezbollah.
Gantz referred to the documentation of Hisham al-Sayed, the Hamas captive in Gaza, released by the military wing: "Yesterday.
Hamas is holding the four boys captive in violation of international law, contrary to morality.
Hamas is responsible for this, and our expectation from the international community is to act against this criminal behavior by Hamas.
He added: "The State of Israel is working on a variety of measures, and continues to turn every stone to bring the boys home.
As we have said before, this is a humanitarian issue, this is how we see it, and it is on this basis that we will continue to act.
Extortion attempts and exercises of consciousness will not affect our position and conduct.
Iran is also operating its proxies in the cyber dimension: I can reveal today, that recent activity in Lebanon has been detected.
This was done by implementing a cyber operation aimed at stealing material on UNIFIL's alignment in the region, and using it by Hezbollah.
This is another attack by Iran and Hezbollah on the Lebanese people and the stability of Lebanon.
"Israel knows its adversaries' cyber systems and how they operate.
In recent years, we have seen the phenomenon of Iranian hacker groups working with Israel and other countries," Gantz said.
"The new envoys are terrorists with a keyboard that are just like other terrorist organizations.
We know who they are, we hurt them and their senders, and even today they are in our sights - and not just in the cyber dimension.
No attack on the citizens of Israel will pass on the agenda.
And it's the responsibility of the perpetrators and the state that funds and sends them.
Cyberattacks can be met in a variety of ways in cyberspace and other spaces.
Gantz continued: "Iran leads on cyber terrorism - and moves aimed at influencing democratic processes and administrations, as in US elections.
Operations such as that of the Shahid Kawa unit, which collected information on ships, gas stations and industrial plants in several countries.
"In recent years, we have blocked many attempts to break into private and public companies, both in Israel and abroad.
I also call on the public to demand cyber responsibility and to punish companies and entities that do not comply with the guidelines.
Gantz continued," Our top mission, in the military, industries and defense organizations is to build people, train them, and keep them.
Myself and the Chief of Staff have set this issue as one of the key tasks in the relevant units.
We are constantly reviewing the power building - both in terms of staffing, training and tasks.
In the coming years, we will also have to examine the formation, management and operation of cyber warfare.
Finally, he called for cooperation with the world: "There is great importance to our cooperation with the world in the cyber dimension.
The same cooperation we are building in the region against Iran in terms of defense against various threats - we are expanding the cyber dimension.
The deputy commander of the 8200 unit revealed: We thwarted the attempt to poison the water systems.
Uri, the deputy commander of Unit 8200, said in its first public appearance at such conferences, Israel foiled an attack on the water systems.
Thwarting cyber threats is a key part of our operations.
Our goal is to gain superiority over the attacker, identify him and act to deprive him of his abilities," he said.
We do this both independently and by working with industry and other agencies, through the application and use of the tools we have developed.
8200 will not rest until the threat is eliminated.
Israel's water systems and attempts to poison Israeli citizens were thwarted by an attempt to seize and poison Israel' s critical water systems.
In another case, we also identified that a particular opponent attacked Israel, while identifying that attacker also tried to target U.S. stations.
This was the first indication of this attack.
This threat was prevented by close cooperation with our American partners.

For example, the telescopic pole upgraded and integrated into the facility is taken from the field of maintenance and cleanliness.
The device can simulate movement within a civilian population toward a dynamic target while maintaining eye contact with the object.
Major Assaf Ben David, whose facility is named after him, says: "The facility we developed is a breakthrough in learning and training policemen.
The development provides a relevant response to the threats of attribution and simulates the reality on the ground.
The benefit of development in the face of the relatively cheap cost of production is a significant advantage to us in competition.
Auditor General Warns Central Election Commission Not Prepared For Cyber Threats
Netanyahu Engelman warned during International Cyber Week about Israel's unpreparedness for hacking attacks.
World War III will be a war of hackers, but the world is not prepared for it.
State Comptroller Matanyahu Engelman attended Tel Aviv University's annual cyber conference Wednesday, expressing concern about cyberattacks on Israel.
"We're exposed.
Our data is visible to too many people.
Our money is exposed, our children are exposed, our health is exposed, our security is exposed.
World War III will be a cyber war, but the world is not ready for it.
Engelman said: "In the past year we have carried out penetration tests at the Jerusalem Traffic Management Center, hospitals and tax systems.
In reviews, we found major deficiencies, including the fact that few penetration tests were carried out by public bodies.
The Central Election Commission's readiness for cyber threats has also increased.
"We at the State Comptroller's Office pledge to continue to address this important issue in the interests of the citizens of Israel and the world.
I came to Jerusalem to win trophies.

Returning to the Israeli national team after four years: "I felt I had a place, I wanted to be in the squad for EuroBasket"
I learned to focus only on what I can control.
Oz Blazer in an interview.
Oz Blazer will depart with Israel's players for Poland today, where they will meet the local team in the 2023 World Cup qualifier.
Three days later, the Estonia national team will host an entire group.
In addition to intensive training with the team, Blazer also worked on his future in the past week until signing a two-year deal.
"I have a quiet mind now that I 've found a group," he told Israel Today in his first interview since the signing.
"I have a bit of pressure now because I have to move with my family after settling in the center and it's not easy.
You haven't been in the team for four years, how happy are you to be back, and how much do you want to play in the next two games?
"First of all, I want to enjoy the team and I come in with the attitude of contributing as much as I can, whether it is on the pitch.
Of course I would love to play, but when you come to the team, everyone has to put their ego aside and do everything to make the team succeed.
I'm here for whatever they need from me.
Now you are 14 players, and the European Championship will be joined by Danny Avdija, Gabi Tchachashvili will be back, and there may be other changes.
Do you want to be in the squad for the championship?
"I'd love to be on the field and contribute."
The 29-year-old Blazer (1.99m) has played in the last two years at Maccabi Tel Aviv.
When the season ended, it was clear that he would not continue in yellow, and a few weeks later he moved to the capital, preferring Jerusalem.
You had other suggestions, why did you decide to go to Jerusalem?
"They showed a great willingness for me to be there, so there was relatively easy negotiations.
As soon as I felt a connection with the management and the coach, I knew it was the right place for me.
The situation also seems good and appropriate to me.
I came here to lead and be a big part of the team.
I've spoken to the coach and he has a mentality of hard work and winning and that's exactly what I bring.
I've always loved playing at the Arena, because I get energised even with the crowd is against me, and now that they will be on my side it will be even better.
I'm sure there will be a committed and fun team and I wanted to be a part of that.
Talk a little bit more about your conversation with Coach Dzikic.
"Professionally, he believes in a lot of no-ball movement. He plans to bring good morals with a high basketball IQ and wants a very intense team.
He believes in high energy in defence and attack and with the crowd at the Arena it can be successful.
I looked at your career and saw that every team has at least two years left, if not more.
Do you feel that you can stay in Jerusalem for a few years?
"Wherever I go, I like to connect and give everything, and people appreciate that.
From the moment I signed in Jerusalem, my phone kept ringing and beeping.
I got a lot of messages waiting for me.
So I think we have a good period ahead of us.
Do you think Jerusalem can be a more significant player than the Maccabi Tel Aviv?
How do you sum up the two years in the DUP?
"Unfortunately, there were some things that were out of my control in the last season.
Everyone saw that I stayed professional throughout, and no matter how much I got, I always gave it everything.
I'm proud of the way I've done this past year, and now everyone's going their separate ways.
If it were up to you, would you want to stay in the office?
"After the last year, it was clear to both sides that we were heading in the direction of separation, but that is part of the business.
Towards the end of the season I was a bit hurt in the minutes and my status went down, although mid-year was great, but they decided to go.
After understanding the situation there, I realized that this was less the place for me.
Hapoel Jerusalem is the best option for me, so I chose it.
Lastly, what are your goals for the season?
"There was a lot of talk about what happened in the semi-final last season when I shouted to Ami Biton, 'That' s why I came to Jerusalem. '

All or nothing: 1: 1 between Hapoel Jerusalem and Hapoel Hadera
Guy Hadidah scored an own goal in the 33rd minute but was able to make amends with an equaliser 10 minutes later.
Subsequently, the contact was expelled in a dubious red (74) •
Hadera also stayed with 10 players following a red card for Ido Levy (87), according to reports.
The professional team of Hapoel Jerusalem is good at telling the number of foreigners on the pitch, many more than once.
This time, to their delight, all was well, and the achievement against Hadera would not be taken from them by the Association Tribunal.
Before Hadid's red card, he scored an own goal and equalised to set up a precious point for Ziv Aryeh.
As early as the 33rd minute, Guy Hadidah's private show began.
Plakuschenko scooped wide, and the midfielder levelled and rammed backwards and the ball was stopped in his team's net.
0: 1 for a room that enjoyed an own goal from midfield.
Ten minutes after the own goal, Hadidah was able to correct and huge - Lefkowitz caught air and the midfielder this time rammed into the right exposed net.
1: 1 for Teddy.
In the 74th minute, Hadidah was also able to register a second yellow and a red, this time after sliding towards Marmantini.
Daniel Barr gave a dodgy red card and sent the midfielder straight into an early shower.
In the 87th minute, Bar Nathan also sent in Ido Levy and evened the playing field on the grass.
Recovery Department: Eilat defeated Holon
60: 85 p.m.
Ariel Bethlehem's team recorded a third consecutive victory, this time especially impressive.
Hoover and Schuchman (15 each) excelled.
Hapoel Eilat's recovery journey continues tonight with an impressive 60:85 victory over Hapoel Holon on the way to a 3-0 record.
Since dropping to last place, Ariel Bethlehem's team has already won three consecutive games, a surprise only for those who did not see the game.
We haven't seen Holon this bad in a long time.
All this before the series opener against Bashiktash in the Champions Cup play-offs: just 60 points, a first half without a three and 11% for a three.
Bottom line, an unimpressive evening for all players (except Murphy Manko, who scored Holon's 3 points), including safety Chris Johnson.
On the other side, Eilat is in a lot of good shape thanks to Roy Huber and Joaquin Shukman (15 points each).
The former has bounced back in recent times and the latter has blossomed and also wowed with a basket from three-quarters of the field.
Give them a chance: Maccabi Tel Aviv's Israelis saved Speropoulos.
After a derby loss and eighth in a row in Europe, a defeat against Jerusalem would likely end the long romance between Maccabi and the Greek coach.
So who does Yanis have to send a bouquet to tonight?
To his Israeli team, which was responsible for 42 critical points at the Arena •
Also: Why the yellow club needs to change the Americanization strategy, and take a vivid example from the model of Ariel Bethlehemi in Eilat.
It is hard to remain cynical with the teary eyes and warm, strong hugs that Yanis Sapropoulos gave his players at the end of the game.
Because after a home defeat in a derby and an eighth in a row in Europe, losing a classic to Jerusalem and moving away from it to three wins in the table?
That would have ended the Greek-Israeli affair by now.
So for now, he's with us, and he's got a lot to learn from this game, too, and essentially regarding the EuroLeague.
First, Maccabi Tel Aviv came with a radical change in the habits of attack and ball movement.
The ball moved devotedly, with plenty of movement and drills, and Scotty Wilbkin, demonstratively, left Evans, dribbled very little.
Despite shooting very poorly (2-9 from the field), Wilbkin contributed defensively, and most importantly, Maccabi suddenly looked like a team.
However, towards the end, with less oxygen in the brain, the team reverted to old habits, dribbling and shelling.
The trick is to keep playing drills and pass movement precisely in the clutch moments, and that has to go into nature and team DNA.
The important learning will be done by Giannis and the club regarding the use of the Israelis.
The ones who became water pumpers and towel flippers at European games.
Tonight they scored for the manager who stopped believing in them more than half the team points (42 of 83) and kept the game alive at the end.
Four of the top five scorers were her Israelis.
Don't say Israel isn't Europe.
If they can be dominant against Jerusalem, the most European team in our league, they can help in the EuroLeague as well.
In the first half it was mostly Oz Blazer, who the section has been crying out for a month now that he has to play more.
Scorers, morals, warrior under the baskets (7 rebounds), 2 feet of defensive resolve and game smarts.
Isn't that enough?
The second half starred Jake Cohen, with excellent percentage from all ranges, composure from the line, and a 70: 63 for Jerusalem.
Yiftach Ziv has a complicated relationship, and sometimes he seems to give him too much credit, overloading him, to the point of risking losing.
It's happening in the EuroLeague, and it's happening tonight.
But the important learning has to be the club's, with regard to its Americanisation strategy.
Fact: The senior Israelis no longer want to come to Maccabi.
Tomer Ginat and Yam Madar left for Europe but not for Maccabi, Rafi Menko returned to Holon, and now Noam Debret is choosing Jerusalem.
And it happens that Maccabi gradually stays fewer places for Israelis, because of an informed and rooted choice of club to be based on Americans.
Maccabi will soon reach the watershed, where no Israelis will want to play, and then she will seek Jewish children to become citizens.
But it's a fatal mistake by the club.
And the game we saw should remind Maccabi that she's overreacting to the foreigners, much because of the tax break.
Certainly, we will not argue that Israelis alone are enough, but they are good enough to support four excellent foreigners.
So instead of spending the same money on one star plus eight mediocre ones, you can have five excellent ones.
For example, this season, with money from Williams, Nunley, Evans, Reynolds and Taylor, you could bring in two stars.
It will be more effective, it will be more true, it will be more Israeli, it will be more beautiful and interesting and it will create empathy.
It's true that there are two busy frames and a long season - so you have to rely on your Israelis.
And also because you are an Israeli group that purports to represent Israel, and even receive tax relief for its supposed representation in Europe.
The Basketball Association can help Maccabi, and return to sanity with a number of foreigners adapted to the Israeli league.
6 Brewster, 4 on form, maximum of three on the field at the same time.
Is it for the ongoing failures (already seven years in Europe), only for Maccabi, that the league is overrun with foreigners?
And the players' union, what about you?
That's why you guys went on strike?
There were two Israelis on the field, and now there's one?
Like George Costanza in the Seinfeld pilot.
Bargain to get less?
The previous Russian rule was good for basketball, good for teams, and even good for the Maccabi.
And if anyone needed reassurance in the above direction, Hapoel Eilat came in the early game and explained it so beautifully.
With three foreigners, plus four Israelis who were second only to the youth teams (Hoover, Ben Moshe, Ruina and Shukman the fighter).
It's a tradition in Eilat to play well with three strangers, because there was such a run during the days of Dan Shamir and Sharon Drucker.
Eilat is simply a more balanced and efficient team, and nothing like Ariel Bethlehemi, who started in the open courts in Givat Shmuel.
Everyone is in their prime, everyone is playing together, and all the Israelis are learning and improving their game.
The outsiders are just making up.
When Ben Carter and Casey Prather return from a knee injury, it's going to be a tremendous team.
A song that I dreamt about Elvis.
We can learn from him in the right direction.
Yellow vests:'There was a feeling that the whole world was against us'
The Yellow Jackets are happy after 78: 83: We came back to play the way Maccabi Tel Aviv should play.
On Ami Biton's locker room talk, the optimistic first diagnosis of Zigic's injury and the board's approval for acquisition.
A great sense of relief was recorded Sunday morning among Maccabi Tel Aviv after the important and prestigious 78-83 at Hapoel Jerusalem Arena.
The team's players and officials hugged coach Yiannis Speropoulos, who looked very excited at the end.
Yiftach Ziv and Oz Blazer enthusiastically poured water on top scorer Derrick Williams and the rest of the club smiled with joy.
They, too, feared defeat in the face of the great rivalry that would further undermine the system.
Fans were also left with minutes left to celebrate in the stands.
"We have an amazing connection in the dressing room with Giannis," Oz Blaser said.
"We know things haven't been easy for him either. A lot of pressure has been relieved.
We've been really looking forward to it, the way we played as well.
We came back to play the way Maccabi has to play, with a heart and fight, we stand behind him.
He gave us motivational talks and talked to us.
Before the game, manager Ami Biton came into the dressing room and gave an emotional speech to the players.
"His words had a big impact on how we came out and how we played on the court," said Maccabi.
Despite much joy, Maccabi is already aiming for the important game against Baskonia on Thursday and wants to end the long losing streak in the EuroLeague.
"I believe this game will change the momentum for us," Blazer said.
"We lost a lot of games at the end and this time they led a couple of minutes to the end and we didn't break.
"The last few games we've been under a lot of pressure. Giannis told us if we're relieved we'll win those games.
I believe that this victory will take us forward.
We had a lot of eyes on us and it felt like the whole world was against us, I am proud to go to this war.
Ante Zijic, who injured his right knee during the quarter, was examined by the medical staff in the dressing room and the initial diagnosis was not serious.
Doctors will look at how the knee reacts today and then work out how many days of rest he will need to recover.
The team believes and hopes that the player will be eligible for Baskonia.
With the backing of Sparopoulos and staff, a meeting on Thursday gave manager Nikola Vučić the green light to bring in one or two players.
Anthony Bennett was released from Jerusalem.
The forward, who was selected first overall in the NBA draft, was unable to acclimatize to the team from the capital.
The club said: "Anthony enters our hearts and we thank him for his time at the club."
About four months after signing with Hapoel Jerusalem, Anthony Bennett was released from the team's roster.
The forward (28, 2.03) was drafted first overall in 2013 by the Cleveland Cavaliers and averaged 7 points and 4.2 rebounds in five games.
"Anthony Bennett and Hapoel Jerusalem announce that they have reached a joint decision on the club's contract.
I wish him all the best and success.
Study says Zoom meetings are hurting creativity
Around 2,100 engineers and academics worldwide have been asked to develop solutions to the problem - some in video meetings, some in person.
The result: a virtual meeting impairs creativity and thinking outside the box.
Columbia University Research Leader: The Visual Focus on the Screen Hits the Process of Creating Ideas
Nechama Porata: There is no impairment in labor productivity or critical thinking.
A recent study in the journal Nature examined the impact of video sessions on their creativity compared to face-to-face meetings.
Unfortunately, it has been found that creativity does get impaired in virtual meetings through screens.
The question - led by Melanie Brooks, an assistant professor at Columbia University - was whether computer-distanced meetings preserve creativity.
The study itself began as early as 2016 but received a big boost in the two coronavirus years, during which many workers shifted to working from home.
"People in an in-person meeting move around the room, use objects and use them for creative thinking," Brooks says.
"In a computer session, however, focus on maintaining eye contact with others comes at the expense of creative activity in the brain.
The visual focus on the screen reduces cognition.
People are more video-focused when interacting, which impairs the broad and expansive process of creating ideas.
The space is shrinking.
To test the results, they were tested twice - once at Columbia University and again in real life - on engineers who knew each other.
The researchers divided a group of 602 staff and students into two parts, one of whom was asked to meet in person and develop solutions.
At the same time, 1,490 engineers from five countries in Europe, the Middle East and South Asia were asked to divide similarly.
In both cases, there was a decline in creativity and out-of-the-box thinking among those who met virtually on video.
Jay Olson, a postdoctoral researcher at McGill University in Canada, was not involved in the study, but was not surprised.
People often look to their surroundings to help create ideas, whereas in a video session, thinking converges on the screen and does not.
"When people are in the same room they look around and see the space, where there are objects and situations that can inspire new associations.
Computer relationships change our attention so that we are more focused on the inside and the screen.
There is no harm in critical thinking.
However, before executives run employees back to offices, they note," Working through a computer did not hurt productivity or critical thinking.
In other words, the impact is focused only on creativity and not on the other forms of work in front of a computer.
Professor Alan Langer, a professor of psychology at Harvard University, also qualifies the findings.
She said: "There's a difference between just being creative, like new uses for Frisbee (one of the research questions; EG) and work solutions.
It may also be that when employees are more relaxed after getting to know each other, or working from home, creativity does improve.
Prof. Langer and Dr. Olson also proposed a future study in which such meetings will be paused to roam the room to see how it affects the outcome.
Dr. Olson also suggested that only brainstorming sessions should return to work, suggesting not to be alarmed by one study, but another.
"I wouldn't want workers to be forced back and unhappy. That's a bigger blow," he said.
Musk awaits Trump's return:'It wasn't right to block him'
Twitter's new acquirer said it would reverse a decision, which led to the former president's account being blocked.
"I think it was a mistake," he admitted.
Tesla and SpaceX owner Elon Musk, who recently bought Twitter in a $44 billion deal, said he would back Trump after his presidential run.
I do think it was wrong to ban Donald Trump.
"I think it was a mistake," he said.
"If there are wrong and bad tweets, they should be deleted or made invisible, and a suspension is appropriate, but not a permanent ban.
By 2050, the world will lose 80% of the water available to agriculture.
A new global study predicts a significant decline over the next 25 years.
Solution: Proper management of the water supply.
A new study in Earth's Future predicts that by 2050 the amount of water available for agriculture will decrease by 80 percent.
Scientists from all scientific agencies summarized rainwater, rivers and freshwater sources and compared it to human agriculture.
Water consumption has doubled repeatedly over the past 10 years, while global warming is causing rainfall in agricultural areas worldwide.
According to the study, 84% of the land earmarked for agriculture in the world will experience severe rainwater shortages.
One of the key findings calls on farmers around the world to adapt agriculture to climate change and seasons to prevent waste.
Researchers also recommend that farmers working near salt water sources use rainwater collecting technologies to prevent it from flowing into the sea.
Information about many Bar Ilan University students has leaked online.
Hackers who attacked Bar Ilan University's database a few weeks ago threatened to publish student information if they did not receive a ransom.
The threat was realised and the information was posted across the network.
Bar Ilan University students are under hacker attack when their personal information is posted online by a Darkrypt attacker.
Estimates of the money demanded by the attacker are thousands of dollars, and as the watch went up, it was already several million dollars.
Facebook groups of students and faculty are full of angry messages, with students unable to access their personal information systems.
The university sent an email announcing the attack and that they were working intensively to minimize the damage, detailing some information.
No special instructions were given to those whose data was breached and the university said to have carried out a series of security measures.
Line up for 40 settlements: The fiber optic is coming to Binyamin
The periphery networking trend in high-speed internet continues and now the fiber optic reaches the Benjamin Council of 40 localities.
The project, in collaboration with Telran, X-Fiber and Internet Rimon, will launch immediately after the holidays.
Binyamin Council signed a wide-ranging agreement over the weekend to lay fiber optics in all of the council's settlements.
The agreement with NetFiber in cooperation with Rimon, Telran, and X-Fiber was signed following the conclusion of a major tender.
Work will begin after the holidays and residents from 40 council areas who want to connect to the fibre optic infrastructure will enjoy speeds of up to 1G.
Members can choose between high-speed internet on fiber optics or high-speed filtered internet on fiber optics provided online by a grenade.
The Council has ensured that the market remains open to competition in all circumstances.
Binyamin Regional Council leader Israel Gantz: "This is true Zionism.
This is great news for the residents.
Students will be able to learn remotely if necessary, work from home, and establish advanced businesses in communities with quality internet.
I would like to wish success to the valuable companies in the implementation tasks in the localities.
The people are waiting for you.
Gantz said: "We will soon have the best possible conditions for high-speed internet in Israel.
We worked for many months to bring a foundation for the installation of fibre and now the vision is becoming a reality.
I thank Minister of Communications Yuz Handel who started the project with us last term, and now we are reaping the fruits of the labor.
"I thank Council President Israel Gantz and his team for immediately raising the gauntlet for the quality of life in education and leisure.
Telran Communications Group CEO Shai Aslan: "We are pleased with the decision of the Binyamin Council to connect to high-speed internet infrastructure.
"Building communications infrastructure in Binyamin is the Zionism of 2021, I have no doubt that X-Fibre is proud to take part in the
We tested: What do the post-COVID vaccine side effects mean?
Many people who are vaccinated feel weak, feverish and tired after getting the shot, while others feel nothing.
Could it point to a stronger immune system of those who do experience these phenomena, or is it a baseless rumor?
As more and more people get vaccinated, the lack of information about side effects continues to confuse and create rumors, most of which are not true.
Are the immune systems of those who develop side effects stronger than those whose bodies react less severely to the vaccine?
"There are several levels of immune responses," says Dr. David Dvir, Head of United Primary Medicine and a member of the Headache Advisory Board.
This is how the body reacts when a foreign entity enters the system.
Is there a link between the antibody levels developing and the side effects?
"There is no correlation between the feelings of developing antibodies against the virus.
About 60% to 50% feel the side effects, but about 90% develop protection against the virus.
People who develop strong reactions are no longer protected.
"There is no correlation in the medical literature between immediate response and vaccination levels.
In some trials where people were also given placebo vaccines, about a quarter of them developed headaches.
It's also a mental component - how the person perceives the vaccine, if they expect there to be any side effects.
Many of these could happen normally, but since the public has been vaccinated, it attributes the reaction to the vaccine itself.
According to Dr. Dvir, the reasons for the commonly reported symptoms, such as weakness and headaches, are not yet known.
Regarding myocarditis, opinions differ.
"There are all sorts of theories about this, but it should be noted that the virus itself causes higher rates of myocarditis than the vaccine.
One theory is that it's a strong immune response.
Is it even possible to assess the strength of an immune system?
"When students were exposed to the flu virus, they showed that those who did not sleep or were at higher pressure were more vulnerable to infection.
Apart from that, there are laboratory parameters that test the immune system or its components.
When there's a drop in the immune system, you see it immediately.
People get a lot of viral or infectious diseases.
It's not like someone is walking around with a weak immune system and isn't aware of it.
These are people who get inquiries because of repeated infectious disease events, and what affects the system are banal things: stress, diet, sleep.
We also don 't want a strong immune system because it can cause autoimmune diseases.
MRNA vaccines will soon appear in more contexts, thanks to the vast knowledge they have gained about them in recent times.
"There is no doubt that we will be opening up other vaccines of this kind.
This technology is being tested for many uses beyond vaccines - for oncological disease treatments, for example.
Their effectiveness is that the substance remains very little time in the body - enters, does its operation, and then breaks down.
This technology is not new, but it has been given a serious vest due to the very great need for rapid vaccination.
Now, for example, we know that a three-week interval is too small, and some vaccine experts say we may not need a third dose.
Thousands hurt as privacy defaults severely on Highway 6
Route 6 customers?
Your personal information, including your full name, address, payment amounts, and full details of your travels, may be disclosed.
According to the Privacy Protection Authority, Derech Ertz violated the Privacy Protection Law and its regulations.
After a report by Road 6 operator Derech Ertz about a security incident in Israel, the Privacy Protection Authority began an enforcement process.
Security weaknesses were discovered on its payment site, allowing much information from the invoices of its customers visible.
These invoices included personal information, including first and last names, payment amounts, location, travel dates, and times.
Furthermore, since a company did not legally record access to its systems, it is impossible to know exactly what period of time unauthorized access.
In its infringement letter, the ISA stressed that most companies and large enterprises must strictly review their security and risk-adjusted security measures.
As a result, companies and organizations have a duty to update their systems and conduct risk surveys to assess and prepare for the risks.
Companies and organizations are also required to use automatic documentation mechanisms and to train employees in accordance with the Privacy Regulations.
According to the inspection findings, the company violated the provisions of the Privacy Law and required the company to perform some corrective actions.
Route 6 operator said: "The issue has been dealt with according to the strictest requirements"
Istanbul travel warning: Shocking news for Israelis from Turkish airlines
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus will allow Israelis to change their destination or date of flight
Line up for Israelis who have booked their tickets to Turkey before the travel warning: Airlines will allow change of flight dates.
Reminder: Earlier this week Counterterrorism Command raised the severity of the Istanbul travel warning to Level Four.
This is the highest level and means a high level of threat: do not come to this country and in the event of a stay, leave the country soon.
Turkish Airlines and Pegasus said they would allow Israelis who booked their flight before the flight warning, or before June 13.
This is done by contacting the airline.
Tourism Minister Razvozov said: "Israeli citizens should not pay an economic price because of terrorist threats.
I am glad that major airlines like Turkish Airlines and Pegasus have complied and I hope that other companies will respond to this warning.

Saudi skies approaching: Israeli firms prepare to reinforce lines to the east
Expanded freedom of flight over Saudi Arabia: Airline prepares to launch new flights to the Far East at the expense of European destinations
Israel's largest airline is planning major changes ahead of US President Joe Biden's arrival in Israel.
According to Israel Today, Biden will declare approval for El Al and all Israeli airlines to fly over Saudi Arabia to destinations other than the UAE.
The consolidated agreement means El Al will be able to fly shorter routes to Far East and Australian destinations.
To do this, the airline will have to cancel flights to less profitable destinations, and this is to clear planes for new destinations.
Destinations to which flights will be cancelled from November next year include Warsaw, Toronto and Brussels.
These are three destinations that have quite a small Jewish population, but at this point they are less profitable for society.
In contrast, the new destinations explored in El Al are Tokyo, Hong Kong, Australia, and other places in the Far East.
Here's how the move will play out: Dreamliners flying into Canada will be released in favor of long flights to the east.
The Boeing 737s flying to Warsaw and Brussels will be used for flights to destinations such as London and Paris.
So basically the company could free up large planes to fly to other destinations in the east.
Meanwhile, EL AL expects talks in the coming weeks on whether Israeli airlines can return to Turkey to operate flights using Boeing 737s.

Quarantine exemptions for the vaccinated and recovering from non-red states, foreign tourists are returning.
Landers in Israel were notified by the Ministry of Health that they were exempt from quarantine when they received a negative coronavirus test
Only then did the ministry issue an official statement saying only passengers from orange countries, although returnees from red countries also received.
Also: Tourists from orange destinations will be able to enter the country and many red destinations are expected to be removed from the list.
At the height of a pandemic - the end of isolation for overseas returnees?
The Ministry of Health sent messages to captives on Monday, saying they are exempt from isolation after receiving a negative coronavirus test.
It is also about returning from red states.
Some messages told returnees they could be discharged after receiving a negative response or after 24 hours at the latest, and some received an exemption.
The Ministry of Health said that from midnight on January 4, 2022, vaccinated or recovered people will isolate for 24 hours or more.
The decision will be enshrined in the order of the Director General of the Ministry of Health and will be approved by the Knesset Health Committee.
Vaccinated or recovered persons who returned to Israel from an orange country with a negative PCR test will not be required to take a test.
However, travelers from red states reported that they too had received the message.
Anyone who has not been vaccinated or recovered from an orange country will isolate for 14 days with a negative PCR test from day seven.
The decision to lift most restrictions on travelers, especially the vaccinated, comes a day before the travel agency, Open Skies and Hotel Association.
A hearing tomorrow is expected to demand that all other red states be removed from the list, with Professor Itamar Grotto backing them.
Foreigners will also be allowed to enter.
PM and Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Health, Internal Affairs, Tourism and Transport agreed that starting Sunday, January 9, 2022,
Unvaccinated / non-recovered foreigners (according to the Ministry of Health) will not be allowed to enter Israel.
Foreigners from red countries, except for those whose entry was approved by the Exceptions Committee, will not be allowed to enter Israel.
The outline of the groups will not be renewed at this time.
What about red states?
The committee recommends removing countries from the red list: South Africa, Hungary, Nigeria, Spain, Portugal, France, Canada.
The remaining countries currently on the red list: UAE, US, Ethiopia, United Kingdom, Tanzania, Mexico, Switzerland and Turkey.
Another option being considered by the Department of Health is to exempt those vaccinated returning from red states.
It is currently unclear if there is a connection between the messages they received this morning and the Ministry of Health guidelines.
The Department of Health has not yet received a response.
Sky begins to open: Ministry of Health changes restrictions on Earth's gates
Vaccinated people returning from orange countries will be required to quarantine for 24 hours •
The countries of the US, Turkey, the UK and the UAE will be red-listed.
After weeks of difficulty finding a destination to fly to without restrictions, and after all those returning from abroad were forced to quarantine.
The health ministry decided to recommend that the mandatory three-day quarantine for Israelis returning from orange countries be lifted.
So far, any vaccinated or recovering under Department of Health settings returning from an orange country - must isolate for three days.
Vaccinated and recovered persons returning from orange countries must now isolate for a maximum of 24 hours or more after landing.
Those who are not vaccinated will still be required to quarantine for seven days subject to two coronavirus tests or 14 days
Vaccinated or recovering people returning from a red state must also quarantine fully.
The latest red list recommended by the Health Ministry includes the US, Turkey, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Mexico, UK, Switzerland and the UAE.
In all but Turkey, the average positivity over the past two weeks is more than 5% of total arrivals, which automatically puts them on the red list.
Turkey's rate of increase is rapid, its positivity rate is just over 4%, so it has also been decided to put on the red list.
Prominent countries to be removed from the red list: France, Spain, Portugal and Canada.
As of January 9, tourists who are vaccinated will be able to enter Israel without quarantine, similar to those returning from an orange country.
In this case, too, the decision is subject to approval by the government, which will discuss the issue in the coming days.
It is important to note that few cases in which the government does not approve the recommendations of the Ministry of Health in this area.
Tourists are against the restrictions.
The Travel Ministries Association, Open Skies HQ and the Hotel Association have filed a petition with the HC to lift restrictions on air travel.
The country lifted most of the restrictions yesterday, but said it had left eight significant countries on the red list.
At a hearing this morning in Jerusalem, the petitioners are expected to demand that the country scrap the red list.
The person who will support the position of the petitioners is Prof. Itamar Grotto, who is expected to be present at the hearing.
Tourism Minister Joel Razvozov, who has supported easing foreign travel to Israel in recent weeks, said: "Cancellation of isolation is right.
I thank my colleagues in the Government, who understood the plight of the tourism industry and agreed with me that the damage outweighed the benefit.
Vaccination is the best response to the pandemic, and as such, the vaccinated public deserves to lead a life-affirming routine with the coronavirus.

It was more interesting to hear how many people received stipends in Israel Post, how much the branches are worth, and how much.
Israel Postal Service should not be privatized.
The question is how many packages have arrived and how many have been distributed?
Because some of them have disappeared.
You order packages, and they disappear at the Sorting Center in Modi...
There should be a 5 packet tax they don't just order crap and load up on the mail
This is mainly indicative of the cost of living in this country.
Thanks to King Pacs for making it better to buy everything from China.
We are a household and try not to go near mail and hope no letters come from them and the hatred of mail has led us to give up anything.
Have a good week.
Lay off all the postal workers, and start reestablishing the post office by a private company.
Employers are patronising and some are racist!
On the phone, they speak differently and when they come to the interview, their true faces are revealed.
No wonder they can't find workers.
They are looking for slaves.
Jobs of slaves
Everyone is invited to meet a real Jew.
Well done

He who endures the trials and is in holiness will see only light for the rest of his life.

Great article, dear brother.

This is neither Guy Fiennes nor Nonsense Moses's cyathon.
Smells like greased up PR and invited under the guise of an article by all2in a quid pro quo hiding behind the name of the newspaper editorial.
The joke is on us readers, the captive audience escaping the clutches of the venomous Moses looking for an alternative
I don't like the song, and the video is just as bad.

What a talent!!!!
They want more and more from him.
Tamir Greenberg is a great singer at the level of an international star.

Great man. Coach has to give him more minutes. Don't give up on him.
No.
Bring on Andrean Banks.
We need more strong Israelis in the squad.
The ones that really play.
Much better suited than Wilbkin to the Maccabi that is built.
You can see that there are professionals in Maccabi - Blatt and Ketch.
Maybe individual abilities still don't compare to Scotty, but a team player, and especially a much higher intelligence game.
So sad that Maccabi Tel Aviv relies on foreigners and the Israelis warming the bench
By the way Maccabi was founded for Jewish athletes and not a collection of foreigners so will not succeed with all the stars scraped from around the world
Who cares????
Looking at a game with 6 American and 3 Israeli players for decoration, isn't it better to watch the Golden State game????
A puzzle until the end of the league.
Best of luck
Good column.
Love it.
As for the Israelis, he is absolutely right!
And a comment about Ziv - we saw last season that he is a good player who can also lead a team.
So in the EuroLeague he cannot be a leader, but his declining ability in the league also indicates that he lost confidence (and use of

Ido Eshed deadbeat a Holon fan who was given 500 shekels so he writes nonsense.
Not in the picture Federmann.
Blazer, Sorkin and Jack Cohen are much better than Colliero and Taylor who play 20 minutes and can't score a basket.
It's good to have a good spirit for everyone coaching players and management in the duration of the momentum

Incorrect.
Non-middle human interaction is important in many aspects.
The answer to this study is that social isolation is also bad from the professional aspect and truth, what is surprising and disappointing here.
Then turn off the camera on Zoom and problem solved.
What happened, the researchers used Zoom and so their creativity wasn't enough for this solution?
How do you know what will happen in 30 years?
Someone missed an important point here.
Scientists don't care about warming or rainwater.
They are only interested in population growth.
They are working on more and more vaccines and bastardised methods to decimate the world population so they tell us foggy stories about warming
There is no problem with desalinating water in unlimited amounts.
They said that 50 years ago.
In the meantime there are more people.
The solution is birth control, especially in poor places, and in the case of Bibi's baboons, the rest of the anti-state leftists.
There is an urgent need to reduce the world's population.
Living things (even seismologists) consume oxygen and emit carbon reporting.
Solution: Smolens, kill yourself!
It's green.
Good for the world.
You will be better off, and safe for the planet and the rest of us.
Who are the scientists and how did they do the research?
I don't believe any research that talks about climate warming because this thing doesn't exist
It is trending to control us to usurp our freedom and liberty.
It's all part of the New World Order.
And reporters like Assaf Golan are on their side as he has done during the coronavirus.
I've never heard a presentation of facts from either side of him he always brings out the side that serves the globalists.
We're being looked at.
Just burning money on academic "bullshit" research.
As usual, another rant from the land of the psychopathic cesspools.
Human knowledge is expanding, and with it new technologies and improvements.
For centuries, the world's population has been steadily growing at an exponential rate, and the situation is only getting better.
The Chinese, for example, launched a huge project of war in the Gobi desert, with incredible success.
The Saudis are doing the same thing and succeeding (with Israeli knowledge, by the way).
It's the stupid "climate crisis" of the seismologists that makes the Sahara greener, but hey, that doesn't fit the agenda.
The lefties don't care.
Their urine goes straight to their head and so they don't dry out.
Does the proper management of reservoirs mean cutting at least 70% of the world's population?
It is surprising that COVID came and that most of the population is injected with experimental material whose 5- to 25-year effects are unknown.
Is it any wonder that the 2030 agenda is underway and now this?
Totally baffling the whole story!!
Hahaha what a load of BS.
All scare stories and of course left wing nonsense trying to dominate the world via media, 5 years ago they announced no more rain in Australia.
They said there was no more rain in the country either and the drought is constant and here is rain.
They also said that Rabin did not murder Jews in Altalena and Peres did not know that the children of Tamans were being stolen.
Moshe Dayan, of course, did not rob antiquities, and Weizmann did not mess with his soldiers.
It's obvious that you're promoting Agenda 21 or Agenda 2030.
Nasty crap.
Let them also take care of the contractions, power outages and power outages, and we are on a roll.

Following grifter Bennett, the rest of the licking politicians will toe the line in the field.
Even if you give me free flights, I don't go near El Al, more like a "super shoe"
It was very nice to meet you and not to see you.
You won't see us in our dreams either.
Another great shame, We in Israel are captives of ELAL for all the direct flights in its hands, pigs.
Some are focusing on this issue of flights to the east.
Even if Saudi Arabia allows Elal to fly over its territory, then it will not add more than a few tens of millions to the Israeli economy.
Better to focus on more interesting achievements such as energy supply, Israeli technology, transportation from Ashdod and Haifa.
That's a lot more interesting than 30 planes a week that would save an hour each.
More importantly let IAF squadrons set up in the Persian Gulf to strike Iran and organize the Emirates Bahrain Oman Egypt and Morocco to demolish
And another air force squadron to set up in northern Saudi Arabia and beat Iranian forces in Syria and Iraq east from a less crowded area.
After we are done with Iran, Saudi Arabia can push Oman, Kuwait Djibouti and the Comoros to a peace deal with Israel and get a majority of Arab League countries.
After regime change in Iran, ending the World Cup stabilized the oil and gas market, and Erdogan's change in power.
When all these mutual interests are over, we can talk about a few more Elal flights if Elal even survives that long.
EL AL needs to shut down.
They sell tickets for flights that don't happen.
The worst thing is that there is no way to get a representative
"There is no customer service.
Anyone who buys a ticket in El Al and wants to change or cancel will forget about it, for sure.
You have been warned.
Air Canada is better off.
They prefer to fly foreign anyway.
Arkansas has gone from corporate shit to corporate hell.
El Al have also gone down a notch.
Best call a taxi.
The driver will load the bags for free.
And you sued on the train to the airport.
40 euros a suitcase in Ryanair is a lot cheaper than Viz.
A backpack weighing 8 kilograms can be lifted.
Why are you misleading?
Wizz Air on luggage and seating takes a lot more!!!!
One big quibble
For example, I just got back if I had to go.
The weight limit is 30kg.
7kg trolley
And each extra 1kg $30
Get Informed
All companies rip off the customer.
They advertise very cheap prices but in the end it is a bag the size of a school bag.
A trolley already costs money and a suitcase is very, very expensive.
Good thing the companies don't ask us to come on the flight with underwear and a tank top so there's no weight on the plane.
At El Al, the price is not cheaper, but 50% of the cost on the reservation up to 6 hours before the flight.
Israelis are not surprised at all.
The Israelis were and still are combinators, using a successful method.
A country eats its inhabitants and eats.
To this, genetic stinginess must be added.
Also shame on our country for allowing foreign airlines to fleece the Israelis...
There is no government and everyone here does what they want.
So what have you learned today that it is not enough that you paid for an expensive ticket..
Prepare us all for a surprise.
Pay extra for the plane wheels, windows, suitcases that don't arrive, food, drink, and probably add on the loo
Stay at home and prices will go down.
Oh great get out on the ships
A journey will take several days.
Throw up and then you'll probably get there.
Bennett wants to see how much he can attack and hurt Israel, and still have the support of his new fans.
Open it now?
It's no accident.
Just when the mess starts there is an exemption, it's just crazy what happens here...
This is not the peak of the pandemic.
Simon, not like you.
The number of confirmed cases is rising doesn't mean the number of patients is rising.
Stop getting tested for any nonsense, stay at home if you don't feel well
End of story.
A government of lunatics
The government and Bennett are mostly bankrupt.
Loss of control.
Especially stupidity.
Confusion of the Public Score 0
Just more damage than debris.
Suggest you open a new corner: "The number of daily and cumulative deaths since the beginning of the fifth wave.
The face and the pictures behind it.
Your ratings will soar.
Don't you understand the Minister of Finance for not paying compensation to tourist workers
Brings more contagion
They don't care about the people
8500 have died so far.
Does anyone talk about it?
They bury us, especially the elderly
We've become Russia / North Korea.
If you don't talk about it - it doesn't exist!!
The main thing is for the citizens to put money into the state's coffers to grow the belly and buttocks for the ministers!
Apparently Doberman and Abbas are the Prime Minister!!
Very well, the omicron stay was relevant for the first week, now - there is no reason to isolate half a nation, and there is no point.
When someone comes from an orange state, they are statistically less dangerous than those already here.
This is the first time I have seen sensible steps taken by the Israeli government in the fight against coronavirus.
As if anyone actually sat down and calculated numbers, and not like Bibi - did what he thought would look better in the paper (and failed on all counts).
Recovery government at its best:
A finance minister who tells the tour guides to find a new profession two weeks ago, washes away to open the skies to tourists.
The Minister of Education beeps at the Prime Minister and the Minister of Health, and sets her own policy, plunging all schools into chaos!
A foreign minister, a clown who comes down with corona to a government meeting.
And the most buffoonish PM we've ever had in the country, can't help it and is losing it like the last of the hooligans.
A government without leadership, without direction, in which all of the people of Israel have lost faith.
Go home and have a nice time one hour early!!
My opinion, maybe it came from a bad place but from a place of loss of control.
Now house prices there will jump to 50 million per flat.
Where are all the forecasters?
They are building a bus stop and believe it will affect all homes.
By the way except for protection money after.
Discovering the exorbitant property prices of Arad, the hotel will become a white elephant like its predecessor.
Looks amazing.
Good luck to you.
I feel like it.
What about the art of taking pictures naked?
Give up the rubbish
Serious pate for a field of mucus
Why don't they give benefits to girls in the Muslim Brotherhood occupied Galilee of Harbant?
They are all cluckers
In our current reality, the South is still ours.
Do you need a passport?
Another luxury hotel!
Surely the MPs will be there too!!
What about a popular hotel for a folk person?
Well done for investing in the south [booming]
Arad is evolving and thriving and kudos to the mayor who since the beginning of his tenure has exploded for the better and the glory of Arad.
Cultural, social life, education, and more about height
Just a great mayor who made the city better!
Well done
I wonder how much protection money the landlord will pay.
Prepare money for protection money?
Sounds good, man.
Those who can only afford the best service and security company in the world.
When was it possible to fly to Dubai does anyone know????
Don't on a tin company.
Neither socially nor economically.
In recent weeks, she canceled return flights, you see, texted Israelis and told them the flight was canceled, ruined the entire trip.
The trip was ruined.
Besides it's better to ground planes on the ground, instead of making the flights back to the country, and prevent economic damage too?
Are there any other fools flying?
Doesn't fly free with them either.
Have they returned the millions of customers they've taken prisoner yet?
EasyJet to Geneva round trip 70 euros.
Don't go one way. $560.
From religious cheat who controls the company along with his dumb son I don't even buy for $10, cheaters nonstop...
And then the airline will cancel flights and offer vouchers that will be worthless.
Because their implementation will be plus the change in price.
Anyone who buys tickets puts their money on the wing of the plane.
Tinpot company.
Low-cost exercises.
No luggage, no seat selection, probably no taxes and no food.
Vacation and coronavirus flights...
To all the members of the Ghastly... Ali!
Nature dilutes fools!!
