The July issue is traditionally given up during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to subtract the strips when the soul is torn to Shabrol.
Nevertheless, we will tell you about the MIFF next time (so far, I will only complain that this year the inexplicable idea has finally strengthened in the minds of the organizers that the happy owners of purchased tickets are much more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world sins), and in this issue we report for what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is decorated with another pleasant face - the title character of the picture "Predators" produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try somehow not to miss the story about the "Beginning" of Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman ..."), the most - without fools - expected film of the summer.
And this time we are also publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the works of Alfred Hitchcock, and here you certainly don't need to advertise anything specifically, and it's clear to anyone that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatiana Alyoshicheva, Boris Glazerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolene, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolay Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov, Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexey Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alyona Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, the London-based tsereushnitsa Evelyn Salt, despite a brilliant track record, was suspected of espionage in favor of the Russians and decided to catch them at all costs.
Cornered, she will repaint herself in the familiar black and go looking for the truth herself.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal boy-woman promises to further consolidate the position of the actress in the action genre.
She will arrange one accident after another, run along the walls a la "Matrix" and scatter strong men in the same strict suits like children.
That's about how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, native, who blew up and repaired the world with the "Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was the most superhero guy for him, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and impeccable embodiment of Evil.
And at the same time, everything together turned out not to be a tedious American-type blockbuster about saving humanity, but the sweetest living carnival.
I don't want to remember what Besson did for 13 years between "Element..." and "Adele...".
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this scenario-production fuss and rare, tortured directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele ..." — hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that 13 years before us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he himself, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, sipped wine in a cafe opposite and composed a story about a charming adventurer.
To retell the plot (even in general terms), warming up expectations, in this case, is more sinful than usual.
Here the whole incredible drive lies in the fact that surprises are waiting for you at every turn or remark.
And all as one pleasant.
Either a girl, or a vision
THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF ADELE
The most dashing adventure movie of the decade is to hint that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele" will begin as "Amelie", rush towards "Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardi's comics about the journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin starred in only three films before Adele.
She glorified the actress for her role in "The Girl from Monaco", for which she was nominated for the Cesar Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging to evaluate special effects, scenery or tricks, but carries along with him, like an old-fashioned novelist exclaiming before a great journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: "Go ahead, my reader, great things are waiting for us!"
At the same time, Besson handles genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has watched enough old movies and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not denying yourself cynicism and not being shy of risco
DIRECTED BY Luc Besson
STARRING: Louise Bourguzne, Mathieu Amalric, Frederic Belle, Gilles Lelouch
plot: Strange things happened in Paris in 1912.
The city was alarmed by an ancient monster, which was awakened to life by an old medium.
The fossil creature is being chased by the police, as well as a famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has business not so much with the beast itself as with the medium — she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
RELEASED ON JULY 22
"Adele ..." is the case when a parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it along a new path.
So it was with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster thrillers, with the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (they made a bow to him here and ridiculed him), and finally with the same "Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film consists of verbal trickery, acting clowning and plot balancing act (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts is organic and strong here as never before).
A few words should be said about Adele herself.
She embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of an adventurer who takes not so much the exploitation of sexuality as the purest courage and courage.
In the movies, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of macho man on duty or a hair-eyed romantic
text: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer who only turns around under his feet (only his knowledge of zoology is useful).
Therefore, an energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and, it seemed, completely soured, Luc Besson showed unexpected creative dashing, reminding that the border between the preferences of bored visitors to mega-malls and high-brow regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing an adventure movie without sadness, fear and reproach
THE ROOM OF DEATH
Hermetic horror with a claim to psychologism and political context in 2002, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film was scolded by critics, but the public liked it and earned well at the box office, and most importantly, caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
So the young director got into a factory forging new horrors according to old patterns: Bay set out to reshoot all the horror classics in the form of remakes and commissioned Liebesman to prequel The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
The criticism twisted again, but the audience liked it again — Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new scary", emphasizing the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, using his example, one can observe how a whole genre is tossing in convulsions, trying to invent new ways to influence a jaded audience: the naturalistic blood of splitters merges with the catch-up of slashers.
The plot resembles the Saw franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut painting "Cube". The film is no longer made by Michael Bay.
So in the "Death Room" Liebesman was forced to take a different path: he preferred a smarter option to a stupid massacre or monotonous running from a maniac — almost without the notorious blood, but with a psychological game and riddles.
The evil doctors here are playing cat and mouse with the test subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to work out a survival strategy: team up or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only they are being tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is being tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor who is skilled in wild experiments.
PLOT: For $ 250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given each a pile of sheets with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A survival game begins, which is closely watched by government agents behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for an outright arthouse
He can make small talk, and go with a fire extinguisher in the face, but he can't miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is circumspect and adamant in her sympathies.
She is hurt by her father's courtly lifestyle and openly spies on how he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's Showgirls, dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and the father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main theme of the family conflict is not the difference of generations or the choice of profession, it is, one way or another, already predetermined, but the unsuccessful attempts of the girl to refute the obvious idea that everything is bought and sold in modern Moscow.
The sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan, together with Pavel Bardin, shot a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Three and a Snowflake".
Depardieu convincingly portrayed the father of a growing daughter in the comedy genre
The fractional plot loops around the love affairs of the characters, who talk about psychology all the time, and themselves, apparently, according to a witty director's find, focus on the language of gaze and gesture.
Secondary plot branches (the girl crippled in a car accident, whom Alexey wants to marry, an alcoholic athlete performed by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are drawn only dotted.
Especially sorry for the line about the business of buying football players, and remained behind the scenes.
PLOT: More than anything else, the agent for the sale of football stars is concerned about the fate of his minor daughter Nastya.
The compassionate father himself changes women like expensive shirts, but his daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy "with a rod."
What is the disappointment of a businessman when Nastya, in the struggle for independence and in spite of her father, chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the audience of the film, the author got "into the top nine": "Don't look for a problem where there is none." You can't be more precise.
Their similarity is simply amazing.
In both tapes, there are detachments of harsh guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who framed them, and each company turns out to have one beautiful girl.
The characters jump around almost the same parts of the world (both films start in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - and there and there something explodes stuffed with dollar bills, and a whirlwind of dollars descends on the scenery.
Even villains dressed up in expensive costumes are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played in both cases by Patriks — Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoe Saldana's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvan White used to shoot about dance battles - "The Brotherhood of Dance".
Chris Evans was recently invited to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by a comic book series that came out in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - a comedy series of the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without collusion, brought different material to an absolutely identical rumbling denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action films that evoke a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If we have to choose between these two tapes, then the "Losers" look a little nicer and clearly more victorious in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least there's Zoe Saldana, who looks great with a bazooka
STARRING: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
PLOT: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA were framed by their own superiors: a helicopter with children they were trying to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves were presumed dead from that second.
But they are alive — and they intend to take revenge at all costs on the scoundrel with a languid voice who set it all up.
All this is nice, but, frankly, it's worth spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting only if you don't have any more interesting options at all.
Made from recyclable materials, a conditionally edible action movie
A simple story about a runaway Romanian convict
A Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film screening.
In principle, having only these data on hand, you can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without any doubt, cinema promises to be highly social.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough.
There is a high probability of participation of non-professional actors.
There will also be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily take what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were lectured about Bresson in the early 80s
The film received the Grand Prix of the jury at the Berlin International Film Festival.
The script is based on the play by Andreea Valean, whose work is in particular demand among the directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Cameraman Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All of the above is true for the debut work of Florin Serban, and - understand us correctly - is not abusive at all, but advisory in nature: the Romanian "new wave" is in that blissful stage of development when the faith of its representatives in the methods of
I haven't hesitated about my work yet.
And this moment must be caught: only thanks to this faith can you withstand an hour and a half of the spectacle of a Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pistereanu (whose history, despite the gulf separating the two cultures, can be easily
convert it into an operation a la the 70s, with a cowboy who decided to walk out of jail, from where he will soon leave, to the nearest saloon).
STARRING: Georg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
PLOT: Having cut off his four years, 18-year-old convict Silviu (Pistereanu) he should be released soon, but suddenly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From that moment on, the behavior of the young man becomes inadequate.
An affair with a social worker Anna further encourages the guy to desperate acts, the meaning of which is exhausted by the name of the picture.
What nonsense is all this!
If you want to watch, watch.
A good debut, inspiring a faint hope that a decent direction will someday grow out of the Romanian art house
Cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Coffin (Sop) and his co-author Reno was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
"Despicable Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to look at the ZO), especially if you like when different objects try to jump off the screen into the hall every now and then), it is tolerably written, and, most importantly, there is not a single underlying joke, from- for which, during the "Ice Ages", they had to shyly squeeze into a chair and cover children's ears with their hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the authors' sense of proportion, but the blatant asexuality of the main character, which in turn is dictated by an unwillingness to touch the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the main conflict of single fatherhood, a rather harsh black humor is responsible (which, I would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
In general, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
One can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers who thought through every detail so that all categories of citizens liked the film.
It's not that we want to see the characters of a children's cartoon eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion
PLOT: The nosy villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of cosmonautics have transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the Moon, is forced to resort to the help of children to fulfill a great plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In some kind of advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans — Margot in glasses, Edith in a hat and Agnes, who is comparable only to a seal from Shrek in a killer degree of tenderness.
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is copied from Christopher Meledandri - they are both bald, nosy and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Siegel.
In the finale, Gru dances the part of Travolta
A wheelbarrow rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a conditional desert, from which three pairs of the best tits come out.
Exactly.
By themselves, the bearers of this gift are not so essential.
The camera confidently captures attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately announce the good news — the whole film is sustained in the same spirit.
Rick Jacobson understands the right things about female beauty and the casting was conducted in such a way that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And there's a lot of funny stuff going on.
The "broker", "killer" and "stripper" dig in the sand, pour water on themselves (don't ask why), carry some kind of blizzard and periodically fight fiercely.
The creators believe that a swearing heifer with generous forms, smeared in mud, with a broken nose and teeth shining white is cool.
"Bitchy stuff" is primarily focused on classic sexploitation tapes.
Rick Jacobson filmed episodes of "Xena - the Warrior Queen" and "The Amazing Wanderings of Hercules".
A film close in spirit at the Moscow box office is "A Trunk for Jennifer".
It's also cool when a bitchy beauty turns the balls of a bandit, a fucked-up punk fights in a pair with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are attached to this; and the intrigue is unwound through an infinite number of flashbacks.
In general, for a movie fetishist, a real Klondike of pleasures is found here.
It is clear, of course, that Jacobson and his gang, filming this thrash parody, had fun from the heart, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it weren't for the physical characteristics of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
It can be assumed that this game came to us from the adult night channel (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
STARRING: Julia Vaughn, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hurst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia leader to the desert, who has diamonds for a substantial amount hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to fight, fight with each other and periodically arriving scumbags from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and squeeze.
Along the way, it turns out that all three are not who they were at the beginning.
Apparently, according to the author, it's even funnier this way.
A product for a narrow circle of fans of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his latest picture "Doomsday", razbodyazhennym "Mad Max" for the poor, Marshall gave a serious misfire
The bloodthirsty and biting peplum returns the director's shattered trust.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus is not shy about a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious cinema aesthetics of category "B".
There is in the picture both the hooligan courage of the "Warrior Dogs" and the bestial cruelty of the "Descent".
The "Marshall plan" to cleanse the "peplum" from the stuck post-gladiatorial filth, in general, worked.
In 2011, Kevin McDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle—scarred legionnaires (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough men trying to marry their military duty with an irresistible desire to survive.
Murder and piquant details of the administration of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and thoroughness.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, was directly inspired by the introductory distribution in the German forests from the now standard "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason I absolutely do not want to try to convict Marshall of plagiarism: he works honestly and without complaints.
STARRING: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
A remote outpost, where Centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is serving, is ruthlessly defeated by a Pictish reconnaissance company.
Miraculously saved, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, try to escape from a group of Pictish militants led by sadistic Itaine (Kurylenko).
The subtle art-house artist has so far managed to win back only sharp-featured supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after "Centurion" the situation will change.
Peplum is a revised and expanded edition.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and severe
The continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her complicated relationship with two extremely promising young men — the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf-bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald wizard boy, designed to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The Lord of Fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes an Avatar.

But this time he will have to do the opposite — leave in one head what was not there.
A pictorial lesson on the management of illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.

Several inveterate thugs, led by a flimsy-looking Royce (Adrian Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where stylish fanged aliens open a sports hunt for them.
The return of the iconic character of the 80s to the big screen.
Pay attention to George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-now-director Anton Corbine ("Control") for a very curious existential study of the psychology of an aging contract killer hiding from people in a small Italian town and belatedly comprehending human nature.
"A visionary artist of Corbyn's scale and the magnificent George Clooney is a film union made in heaven," the studio press release boasts.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney's life — with Italy: Filming took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Taking Martin Booth's novel "A Very Secretive Gentleman" as a basis, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: an American took the place of the English narrator in the title, and the main character turned from an illegal gunsmith into a simple murderer.
The rest of the story is close to the original: while killer Jack is trying to sort out his latest case and finally tie up with a lucrative craft, his icy heart melts under the charm of a local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tekla Ryuten), with whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
"Jack tempts fate," reads the official synopsis.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be the one she pretends to be."
Judging by the trailer, Corbine's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashen hair (the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the main role in the film adaptation of "On the Western front without change" Remark
And can I snap you out of a photo gun!?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at the same time this season.
Firstly, in Venice on the set of the thriller "The Tourist" by Florian Henkel von Donnersmark ("The Life of Others").
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's heroine.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico at the site of the "Rum Diary", the film adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson ("Whitnail and Me"), whose last directorial work was the thriller "Jennifer 8" in 1992.
Looking at the work of the posters of the domestic prison drama, you can not even doubt what inspired them.
But you can't approach the question of implementing the idea literally!
However, at least the good thing is that the heroine of the Russian painting, though a stranger, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They have four joint projects on their account: "Lucky Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't mess with Gohan!".
In July, the fifth comedy "Classmates" is released, the sixth one is in the works — "The Pretender Wife" with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes the seventh film — the romantic comedy "Jack and Jill", where Sandler will simultaneously play Jack and his twin sister Jill.
Matthew Vaughn, remembered by the viewer this year with the enchanting action movie "Kick-Ass", will be engaged in the reboot of the X-Men.
In the film "X-Men: First Class", the director first of all called James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the mutant telepath Emma Frost, nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will transform into a blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While the filming of the new Bond series is postponed, its new director Sam Mendes does not have time to be bored.
His to-do list includes the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the film adaptation of the novel by Ian McEwen "On the Shore".
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan has been offered the female lead.
Gary Oldman is considering the role of the practical Major George Smiley - the protagonist of a series of novels by John Le Carre - in the film adaptation of the thriller "Spy, get out!".
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played.
The new version will be shot by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, the creator of the horror "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer is adapting David Mitchell's best-selling fantasy novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, it is not easy (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but extremely interesting work.
Offers from him have already been received by Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
The shooting of an international action film by Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune" is taking place in Crimea.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war for their money in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The premiere of the film is scheduled for early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will play in the comedy "Baby Jesus" together with English pop star Pixie Lotg
Megan Fox fired from "Transformers 3"
According to the Ragatoipe film company, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
Nevertheless, the place of the main character and the new lover of the hero Shia LaBeouf is likely to be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Whitley.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she will have accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not frighten the sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are many examples of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monster"), Angelina Jolie ("Interrupted Life"), Jessica Lang ("Blue Sky", "Tootsie"), Kim Basinger ("Secrets of Los Angeles"), Jennifer Connelly ("Mind Games"), Geena Davis ("Accidental Tourist") and "The first vice-Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Monster Ball") started as models or starred for fashion magazines, eventually received a well-deserved Oscar.
They succeeded in acting (also beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, what is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko.
Their high awards are clearly at arm's length.
In a word, Rosie has someone to take an example from.
Valeria Guy Germanica, who deserved a special mention by the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone will die, but I will stay" and shot the scandalous TV series "School", received the position of creative director at the MT TV channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanica also started casting new presenters.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov suddenly turned into "Freaks".
The main theme of the film remains the same — Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky), a provincial teacher of the Russian language, hurries to Moscow to see his fiancee, but is delayed to train a football team of street children.
The second storyline of the picture received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, Milla Iovovich will play the role of the capital's bride Nadia.
As an additional intrigue, a third one will appear — Nadia's ex-fiance Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the yard team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in filming "The Hobbit" and the presence of a lot of third-party projects, Guillermo del Toro refused the position of director.
The studios are trying to persuade producer Peter Jackson to take matters completely into his own hands, but he is ready to agree to this step only in case of urgent need.
David Yates, who finished shooting the Harry Potter saga, and Neil Blomkamp, whose film "District No. 9", produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination, are named as possible successors.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sotc-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Maddened by the tight schedule, critics and cinematographers rushed at super speeds between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Pearl Hotel, in which press conferences and round tables were streaming, barely managing to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films also behaved to match - almost everyone had someone running somewhere: confused Asians from Yusup Razykov's "Guest Worker" and Dmitry Mamulia's "Other Sky" were looking for their missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's "Live"
The same cops were happily fooled by the hero of the detective Klim Shipenko "Who am I?" — which, however, was remembered by the public rather by the presence of a totally naked Jeanne Friske in the frame.
The heroes of domestic show business also appeared in a couple of competitive films - in the film "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played a trucker carrying a circus animal to slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets speculated on favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film show for two "Satisfaction", where business partners called each other on the alcoduel because of the lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr also bore a tangible imprint of the show — it was not boring at any of them.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian art house, the chairman of the Foundation for the support of Russian Cinema Sergey Tolstikov arranged a picturesque quarrel with critics: "Do you read the articles in the press that I read?" he menacingly asked the audience.
"I'm writing them," the President of YERVEZS replied in confusion! Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexey Fedorchenko's film "Oatmeal" was suddenly removed from the competition program - he will go to Venice: the selectors of Mostra decided that an extra Russian screening was a hindrance to them.
Previously, Kinotavr did not interfere with the giants - films of big festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film "My Happiness" participated in the competition, which competed in the spring with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun on an Azure Beret.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of a former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa's picture at all — but under pressure from colleagues, he was forced to give her a prize for directing.
The award for the best debut — "Missing" — was given to the daughter
A terrible movie encyclopedia of Russian life: a naive, humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to monstrous acts without any apparent purpose.
A precisely staged, cleansing film is an experience shot by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, who calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls the films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the joy of the viewer is in the work of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult picture of Kinotavr has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition — a director's star has been born.
Immaculately dressed and shorn programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in a hole of neat bachelor life.
But a cast—iron woman descends on the house, the unjust hand of punitive bodies falls on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it's useful to work not only with debutants," producer Sabina Eremeeva triumphantly declared from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics felt otherwise: in their opinion, Sabine simply managed to pull the "inner debutant" from the leading figure of the domestic art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - now in our cinema the bison are moving after the youth.
And not the other way around.
A documentary film shot in such a way that it blows your head off more cleanly than from a similar feature film.
The author is also interested in a screwdriver examining an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting through a cast-iron frying pan - all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his sparse-toothed lover and her criminal brother into a real dock oil painting.
The winner of the short meter contest Nikolay Sokolov tries on the black and white style of the French new wave on the world of residential areas.
Let Godard's editing moves in the story of two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb, and the other of playing Bach backwards, look strange, but thank you for a rare attempt to poetize the surrounding reality.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day — about ten AN-12, IL-18, AN-32, AN-24 aircraft, equipped with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals, rise into the sky — liquid nitrogen, granular carbon dioxide (“dry ice"), meteorological pyropatrons with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process looks like this: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) “break” the clouds coming to the city with these reagents. Particles of substances condense moisture around themselves.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned, and exactly in the place where the impact on the cloud occurred."
For ten years, work has been underway on a remake of a sci-fi film, in which Michael Iork played the main role.
Recently, Karl Rinsch was appointed director (he already has a remake of "Creatures from the Black Lagoon" on his schedule), who became famous for his commercials.
Previously, the names of Bryan Singer ("X-Men"), James McTeague ("V means Vendetta") and Joseph Kosinski ("Tron: Legacy") were associated with the project.
According to the plot, the hero, who turned thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death sentence, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a rotoscopic fantasy cartoon of the 80s and plans to make a large-scale movie out of it.
The original was the fruit of the joint work of director Ralph Bakshi (m / f "The Lord of the Rings", 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Fracetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of painted boobs.
In it, the warrior Larn rescues Princess Tigra and the entire nation from the evil ice lord Necron.
Rodriguez promises to pay attention to the creation of inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation in the near future, as he himself plans to do a remake of the classic giallo painting by Dario Argento.
The heroes will be brought back to the wide screens by none other than Michael Bay - the lord of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero have already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and filmed "Two Evil Looks" together in 1990.
This time Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio is producing the film and writing a script for it.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy "Arthur"
"I wanted to bring more strength to the female character to reflect the state of things in China," Chen says.
— Chinese women nowadays run big businesses and win Olympic gold.
Gong Lee embodies this power."
For the second time in a row, you are playing an imaginary character.
Is this an accident?
A pattern.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I present two pictures here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi film market - EMRBE).
And I play a dream woman in both of them.
But... that's how the director saw me, that's how he introduced me, and it probably seems to many that I am like this in life.
A dream girl.
Your partner in the film Alexander Yatsenko is completely different from his hero.
How did you find a common language? What is he like on the court?
He is absolutely not what he seems at first glance.
At first I saw him and thought, "Yes... It's not just that I have to."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded.
And this contact happened just a few minutes after we met.
We've become great friends, I'm not afraid of this word.
I told him about all my fears, all my worries, that I was afraid that I would not succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and this help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, losing our mutual understanding.
And that's why at the premiere we watched the whole movie holding hands.
How was the shooting in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I have never toured there, neither on vacation, nor in my childhood I did not come there.
This city has a special magic, some kind of its own character, its charisma.
And this is a city that I want to return to.
He has his provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always has time everywhere.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play falling in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which many, frankly, did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you?
You know, I'm an amateur actor.
And I am a very trusting person by nature.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I, in fact, put myself in his hands and I want to be the dough from which they will sculpt.
I understand perfectly well that it is more visible from the outside, and I, again, ask for hints and talk to the director for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, with long hours of rehearsals, we come to the organics you are talking about.
And how did you work with the director of the picture Klim Shipenko?
I got high from everyone, the cameraman, the director, the producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because it's so nice to work with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly such a situation.
Do not sleep, do not eat for days - and still, even thunder, even hail.
And if something didn't work out, it was a disaster, and we urgently need to do something to make it work.
It is very easy to work in this atmosphere of madness.
And it seems to me that when people are so driven to morbid fanaticism on what they are doing, it can't fail because too much energy is expended.
What scenarios are you rejecting?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will be working with?
I don't want nonsense, silly dialogues, films that say nothing, carry nothing.
I don't want to work for the sake of just appearing on the screen once again.
Do you have any suggestions, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no concrete proposals and plans right now.
I'm not the kind of person who paints schedules.
The script came, I was interested in it, this premiere happened today.

THE PUBLICITY BOOTH
While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are almost continuously going on in Moscow: American cinema - "Amfest", "2togo\", the other day "2-t-1" will begin, followed by the British film festival.
And here's what's interesting: half of my friends are constantly discussing that someone needs to be boycotted, and someone needs to be supported, for some - well, excuse me — very vague reasons.
At the same time, when one of these festivals is solemnly closed with a terrifying-looking Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The last thing you want to grumble about is this, but if you buy a ticket for money and stay in the hall to look at giant pixels and horizontal figures of actors, then they will show them to you.
Meanwhile, we have no pixels in the scale: "Tron: Legacy" (continuation of the classic picture about virtual reality), "Let me in. Saga" (an American remake of a wonderful Swedish film), "Out of Control" (another Tony Scott approach to the topic of trains) and a wildly detailed story about how films about Conan, the barbarian, the destroyer and the governor were created.

social network
History of the creation of the Facebook network
David Fincher's new film is, first of all, a story about a paradox.
The film tells about the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, quarreled with five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg — the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the title role is just as great as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social outcast with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg launches the site for a number of reasons: partly because of anger at the world around him, partly because of sports interest and partly simply because IT's "cool".
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of the "Social Network" become obvious from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erica (Mara) at five minutes to five: the sonorous, tough dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin are gaining strength already here and do not soften until the very finale.
It's the same with Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss Twins, actors who were unlike each other played.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other with the help of computer graphics.
Natalie Portman studied at Harvard at the same time as Zuckerberg.
Rooney Mara got the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTED BY David Fincher
STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ermie Hammer, Joshua Pence
PLOT: A gloomy and withdrawn Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a turn from the gate on the personal front, undertakes the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few companion friends begin to break down and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sunny in places, even in the dark, remaining cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate lawsuits.
Outside of the stream of incessant discussions, not much happens in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all Zuckerberg's judicial troubles are unlikely to pull at least an additional paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted the 49-year-old Sorkin and the 48-year-old Fincher in this not too generous with the details of the story?
After viewing, there is a persistent feeling that the "Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic technique.
Just some twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing about the same thing, only on a larger scale - with cosmic egos and big things.
Now that the daily solvency has become even higher, the policy is no longer implemented at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt by the fact that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are stomping their feet: who said that rich, beautiful and athletic can't also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, the "Social Network" could well turn out to be a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more in his business - positive or negative?
And what kind of social consequences will his invention entail?
Is he a con artist?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of something like this in it.
But it won't even be necessary here: in their version of history, it doesn't matter at all.
"How does it feel to feel beautiful?" is asked in Tre VeaNez's song "WaBu Uots'te A Vsp Map", which precedes the credits.
The hero doesn't know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is a representative of the lost online generation, which has a weak idea of beauty and even less about feelings.
A tasteful character drama about the high-profile trial of the Internet era
At the beginning of the XVII century, when Ivan Susanin lived, the surnames of people of non-noble origin had not really begun to appear yet.
They managed with the naming "so-and-so, so-and-so son".
That is, patronymics were in use - nicknames for his father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of repeated marriages of the father, a matronym was used - a nickname after the mother's name.
Susanin is just such a case: "Ivan, the son of Susanna."
Serfs of small landowners really did without surnames for a long time - why do they need it when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of many thousands of estates were forced to give their peasants surnames.
So, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the XVIII century had surnames all by one.
In the XIX century. even small landowners did not keep a peasant on the land, but let him go on rent - let him earn by craft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where it was necessary to enter the surname.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of serfs were released on rent.
So, they already had surnames.
The capital's criminologists arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
The criminologists of the central office and the staff of the forensic expert center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the case of a gas explosion in the house on Linnaya, 39, the NGS reports.
According to investigators, the accused, Irina Urbach and Yevgeny Kavun, posing as employees of the fictional organization Mezhregiongaz, examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked sloppily, and, on the contrary, inflated the prices for their services, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Linear, a man and a woman visited three apartments of house No. 39, where they changed the hoses of the plates.
So, in one of the apartments they put a water hose instead of a gas one.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything has been certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a leak and an explosion of a gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, as a result of which 13 people were killed.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, it was possible to avoid a sea surge flood
Arguments of the Week.

Experts were able to prevent flooding due to the closure of the dam a day earlier.
On Friday, the threat of flooding in St. Petersburg sharply increased due to bad weather in the city.
The sea surge flood was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd in a row, according to the St. Petersburg edition of Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water was kept at 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters higher than the lower threshold of the level of dangerous flooding (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which at times reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can sail through the Gulf of Finland again.
It should be noted that the situation with the water level is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This helps to prevent flooding, which may follow the strengthening of the wind.
In Turkey, 8 people were arrested in the case of defects in collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Sanliurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with discovered construction defects in buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake.
As Armenpress reports, this is reported by Habertürk.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people were killed.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of tremors, which were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, an air bomb from the Second World War exploded on Friday, which sappers tried to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard for tens of kilometers, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military involved in defusing the bomb was injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began on its neutralization.
Fortunately, the entire personnel is intact.
Agencies have begun assessing the damage," Norfolk Police Assistant Chief Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write in social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Photo caption: The explosion happened contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no dead and wounded
The 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the shore of the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before attempting to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective wall of sand around it, and a cordon, inside which no outsiders were allowed, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
Explosives experts initially, on Thursday, were going to use a robot to cut off the fuse from the bomb, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to the local press, to use the technique of "slow burning" explosives.
In the process of this burning, an explosion occurred.
During the Second World War, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
Only during the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from the autumn of 1940 to the spring of 1941, known as the "Blitz", 450 thousand bombs were dropped on Britain.
Almost 40% of Belarusian researchers are women%
The number of women among researchers in Belarus is 38.9%, researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences Alesya Solovey told BelTA.
The share of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: among candidates of sciences, women make up 41.1%, among doctors of sciences - 21%.
In all fields of science, with the exception of technical, the proportion of women exceeded 50%.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is medical sciences, in which the proportion of women is 64.4%.
Men predominate only in technical sciences, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the proportion of women among researchers is 49.1% - this is more than in the republic as a whole, by 10.2%.
Among candidates of sciences, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of sciences - 20%.
Among the teaching staff in higher education institutions, more than half are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, one in three is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
Most of all women are among senior teachers and teachers - over 60%.

According to the republican public opinion monitoring conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree with the gender stereotype "science is a man's field of activity" to one degree or another.
More than half of the country's residents do not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation in the mass consciousness of gender perceptions of women's research competence contributes to the involvement of young women in science, the development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful role model of a female scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," said Alesya Solovey.
The International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated annually on February 11.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, encourage women to develop a scientific career and recognize women's achievements in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.-0-
The probability of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its decrease
This statement was made by the Chairman of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina following a meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have recently taken place.
On the one hand, the terms of foreign trade have noticeably worsened - prices for Russian oil have decreased.
On the other hand, the economic situation is better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment slows down, but budget expenditures are growing.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks have generally increased.
"Therefore, this year the probability of a rate increase exceeds the probability of its reduction.
The expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," E. Nabiullina said.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she will note three risks.
Firstly, the rapid unwinding of consumption in the face of increased inflation expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of workers and the lag in labor productivity growth from wage growth.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the future decisions of the regulator, the Chairman of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate are increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5 - 7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not exclude the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its probability and scale have decreased.
On the contrary, the probability has increased that some rate increase may be needed so that in 2024 inflation meets the target near 4%," concluded the head of the Bank of Russia.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual funds (mutual funds) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from the existing retail mutual funds.
This will allow you to start managing the remaining liquid assets and resume operations with investment units.
If there are more than 10% of blocked securities in the retail mutual fund, then the management company must allocate them to a separate closed mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be given shares of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the main fund.
It is also possible to change the status of a retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets into a separate closed mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the case of the sale of such securities, management companies are required to pay at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment units on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summing up the results of the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analytics and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia the passenger turnover of air transport decreased by 6.3%, and passenger transportation - by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and the passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger transportation amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by government support programs.
In 2022, there was a program to stimulate domestic tourism, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by Rostourism.
Also, to ensure the availability of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc. with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and to capitalize Aeroflot by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of subsidizing the industry by the state (25.3 billion rubles have been allocated so far) in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will amount to 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, up to 103.0 million people," PSB analysts share their forecasts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, killed a 6-year-old child
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Six other people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot on the spot.
Later it turned out that he was a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
Law enforcement agencies classified his actions as a terrorist attack, relatives of the terrorist were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental problems, only this week he was discharged from the hospital.
Austria is once again tightening control at the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say that many people remain at the border in cars waiting for it to cross to the Austrian side.
Thus, it becomes a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already passed the asylum procedure in Hungary.
Based on the existing agreements, Austria believes that migrants are obliged to stay in the country where the request was submitted.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send those wishing to cross the border back to Hungary: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is required.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna followed a promise by the leaders of the European Union to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to protect the borders of the commonwealth.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status exceeded the figures of 2016 for the first time and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
Cargo Progress 83 successfully docked to the ISS
The Progress 83 automatic resupply vehicle successfully docked to the International Space Station on Saturday at 3.45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking occurred at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the South Pacific Ocean.
The docking was broadcast by NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by the specialists of the Mission Control Center.
Cosmonauts Sergey Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina greeted the cargo ship from the ISS.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, as well as about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported on the depressurization of Progress MS-21, prepared for undocking from the ISS and further flooding on February 18.
As specified in the press service of the company, the transition hatch of the ship was immediately closed: Progress MS-21 is isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
The MCC also reported that the ISS crew is not in danger: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal.
Nothing threatens the life and health of the crew, they feel good."
"Cases of maternity tourism have become more frequent."
How pregnant Russians got stuck in Argentina
The Migration Service of Argentina has begun to suspend and cancel the validity of the residence permit of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic refused entry to the country to several pregnant Russians who were suspected of having arrived for the purposes of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were still allowed to enter Argentina by a court decision.
For more information, see the material "Newspapers.Ru".
The Migration Service of Argentina has begun to suspend and cancel the validity of a residence permit (residence permit) for Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not remain to live in the country.
This was told to C5N by the director of the service, Florencia Carignano.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permit of those Russians who came to get a residence permit because their child is an Argentine, but at the same time spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian citizen is considered in court, the migration service will file data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came again."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left may have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russians were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to refusal to enter the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission connects the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls at the entrance incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, two more - in the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women arrived in Argentina, but specifically these three were issued an order to prevent them from entering the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the migration law, where one of the grounds for not being allowed into the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the migration service of Argentina, by a court decision, allowed pregnant citizens of the Russian Federation to enter the country, lawyer Christian Rubilar said.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quoted him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows you to make short-term trips to 171 countries without visas, including EU states, the UK and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about the "boom of maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polin, in 2022, from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russians who are going to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number may grow to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that in 2022 about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how the prices for rental housing in St. Petersburg have changed.
It has fallen in price by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that rent has become more expensive by 25% across the country, the Patrol of St. Petersburg reports with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-bedroom apartment cost 25,000 rubles a month, a studio - 22,000 rubles a month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles a month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country became known.
The Migration Service of Argentina did not allow six pregnant Russians into the country, as the purpose of the visit, which was indicated by them, turned out to be false.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the TV channel Todo Noticias.
For five hours pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them confessed that they had come to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, the representatives of the country did not let the Russians into Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure for actions if there are suspicions about "false" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is at the 33rd week of pregnancy, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and also she cannot clearly tell where she will go to rest, then suspicions from the migration service immediately fall on her.
Moreover, experts clarify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions."
The artist's decision to leave the theater was planned.

Kirkorov won a court case against a fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man declared the illegality of the artist's construction, but did not appear at the meeting.
The fisherman sued the musical performer Philip Kirkorov because of an allegedly illegally installed pier at his suburban dacha.
Channel Five writes about this.
Nevertheless, the Saratov angler failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were submitted to the court, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's house.
As the head of the law firm Alexander Dobrovinsky clarifies, the construction of the pier did not leave the plaintiff a chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The star lawyer jokingly said that, probably, the man planned to fish exclusively from the artist's house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He stressed that from that place there is an opportunity to throw spinning further.
The somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Somnologist Sofia Cherkasova told about food and habits That interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
We are talking primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any cocoa-containing desserts.
Their use before going to bed should be limited, because they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "ragged", which means that they do not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop using caffeinated products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to lowering the threshold of excitability of the nervous system and, as a result, difficulties arise with falling asleep.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as shallow sleep and frequent night awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends giving up spicy food in large portions.
Large volumes and spicy food contribute to an increase in internal body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees - but also the absence of elevated body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, it is not necessary to abuse heavy food before going to bed, because it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will have to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also reminded that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and habitual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to the sleep and rest regime and allow the body to recover.

The Deputy General Director of Russian Railways proposed to the governor of the Irkutsk region to develop new sales directions
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to develop alternative sales directions, except for the Far East.
This is both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by Deputy Director of Russian Railways Alexey Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year has shown, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of the companies constantly interact with our "related parties" (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal price conditions for the transportation of their products according to new schemes," Alexey Shilo stressed.
The Governor noted the importance of stable shipment of products, the Irkutsk region is one of the richest mineral resources of the regions of the Russian Federation and has significant reserves of coal and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of the shipment of products for export has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that the Irkutsk Region is an export-oriented region, therefore it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
- Realizing the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to support the volume of transportation.
If there are additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market, then we are also ready to assist in this direction," Alexey Shilo said.

The crossing at the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alijan border checkpoint on the border of Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
Turkish and Armenian media write about it.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, the Turkish Anadolu agency notes.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicines, water and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, Ankara's special representative at the Armenian-Turkish talks Serdar Kilic said.
He expressed gratitude to the Deputy Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-affected region," Kilic wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vahan Hunanyan, in turn, said that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara Bridge and are heading to the earthquake-affected region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margara Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu agency cites other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border crossing was last used to deliver humanitarian supplies to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
At that time, aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria to the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on February 11 that 21,848 people have already been killed in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3,553 deaths were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are overshadowed mainly by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for citizens of third countries as soon as possible.

On February 11, the final of the FIFA Club World Cup will be held at the Prince Mula Abdullah stadium in the Moroccan city of Rabat.
Real Madrid and Al-Hilal from Saudi Arabia will meet in the trophy match.
The game will start at 22.00 Moscow time, and the website will show a live broadcast at 21.55 Moscow time matchtv.ru and the TV channel "Match! Football 2".
Analysts of the betting company BETCITY consider blancos to be huge favorites: you can bet on the victory of Real Madrid in the main time with a coefficient of 1.28, the probability is about 77%.
The success of nominal guests is available for 11.0 (8%).
Even for a draw, a noticeably lower quote of 6.10 (15%) is offered.
Do you believe that the teams will not reveal the strongest in 90 minutes?
A bet of 1000 rubles on a "peaceful" result in case of a win will bring 6100 rubles.
You can bet on the triumph of Madrid, taking into account extra time and a penalty shootout, for 1.14, this market for Al-Hilal goes for 5.80.
The team from Saudi Arabia overcame two rounds on the way to the final, beating Moroccan "Vidad" in a penalty shootout and Brazilian "Flamengo" in regular time (3:2).
You can bet that an outsider at least will not concede to the Europeans in 90 minutes, for 3.90.
Analysts are anticipating a large number of goals: a total of more than 2.5 goals is available for 1.53, TM 2.5 - for 2.60.
Blancos are clearly superior in class to their opponent, whose composition, according to the Transfermarkt statistical website, is only 39.6 million euros.

In addition, to the horror of Al-Hilal, the main striker of Madrid and the current owner of the Golden Ball, Karim Benzema, will recover by the final.

A tanker with diesel from a previously Russian-flagged vessel was not allowed to enter the port of Spain
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the Main Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Spanish Ministry of Transport has banned the entry of the Maersk Magellan vessel into the port of the city to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022, the Spanish Ministry of Transport reported.
"The Tarragona Maritime Command of the Main Directorate of the Merchant Fleet under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has banned the entry into the port of Tarragona for unloading diesel fuel on the Maersk Magellan vessel under the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it carries comes from the vessel under the Cameroonian flag "Nobel", which until July 1, 2022 sailed under the Russian flag," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with the legislation of the European Union, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag from April 16, 2022 or changed flag after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which the ban was agreed.
The Ministry recalled that this is not the first time when ships are prohibited from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, access to the Maltese-flagged Black Star vessel, which was carrying cargo from a Russian-flagged vessel, was denied in the port of Barcelona.

The problems with entry into Argentina that arose in pregnant Russians were explained
According to the expert, against the background of the influx of those wishing to give birth to a child in Argentina, the country's authorities began to monitor more closely the entry of foreign citizens into their territory.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russians to Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by "Lenta.<url>" with reference to St. Petersburg State University Professor Viktor Heifetz, editor-in-chief of the magazine "Latin America".
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transshipment point, and not into a destination.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will remain an Argentine citizen, but the court will make a decision on granting an Argentine passport to parents after obtaining a residence permit.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, they may be refused citizenship.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship under the "law of the soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
The Argentine passport opens up the possibility for visa-free visits to 170 countries, including the EU and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke the residence permit of Russians who received a document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were refused entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false information about the motives of the trip.

The license was taken away from the management company from Kirov
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov region annulled the license for the implementation of entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Care".
In the Kirov region, by the decision of the regional Arbitration court, the license for entrepreneurial activity in the management of apartment buildings previously issued to the management company "Care" was canceled.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made in November 2022, but it entered into force only in February 2023.
The arbitration deprived the "management" of the license for the fact that the organization ignored the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate several times.
Currently, all the objects that were under the management of "Cares" are excluded from the register of licenses for the implementation of entrepreneurial activities for the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The Kirov administration knows that they were left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the Mayor's Office about the current situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the governor of the Kirov region, Alexander Sokolov, set the task for the employees of the State Housing Inspectorate to liquidate 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, since there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could be taken by the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
Antimonopoly officials allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.

There is not a large park on the territory where you can walk with your family.
Large parking lot.
The store is located on the ground floor of the Univer City shopping center.
Opening hours are from 10-00 to 22-00.
In the store you can drink coffee and have a snack with fresh pastries.
There is a small parking lot from the shopping center.
Friendly staff!
Delicious coffee, a large selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh pastries😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Convenient cafeteria area
They came with their daughter to draw up a pension.
They welcomed me cordially, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, issued an application, and told me how to make an appointment for subsequent receptions.
At the entrance, the administrator and security meet culturally, respectfully.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although it would not hurt to buy a cooler with water.
We came 2 times, everything is fine!
I wish all employees peace, kindness, good luck and a decent salary, at this difficult time for everyone!!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there is nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine waiting for a salad with scallops (which tastes simply incomparable!!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place!!!)))
A nice cashier worker asked me to bring her or in the hall to make me coffee, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
After a couple of minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to be in ceramics, so "in the hall".
They did it to me.
I ask why in a cup and not in a cup.
The girl answers, they say, they don't have 300 ml cups.
That's how it fits in a person's head?
Ask with you or in the hall, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
To get an answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Specify the volume.
To hear that 300 ml.
To put a person in front of the fact that there are no cups of such volume.
Here, they say, a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in the Green Outskirts in my memory.
It is doubly noteworthy that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I want. I asked her myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. The cafeteria of the Green Neighborhood and the Green Neighborhood are the sides of the same coin or organizations that are not related to each other in any way?
If not connected, understanding appears.
If related, why did a food and trade company known in the city for its service and quality condescend to the rhetoric of a stall at the Kazan railway station?
Rhetoric because such a case, I repeat, is happening to me for the third time.
I do not exclude that it is not only happening to me.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she was acting on a hunch.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please describe the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to enter the service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw the numbers with Nikulin Yu himself .
And now with children, nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, the programs too.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
The arena is visible from almost any point and the backs of those sitting in front do not interfere with you.
The circus is very intimate, family-friendly!
this time we went to the New Year's program.
A little upset.
There are a lot of clowns and acrobats.
I would like a number with magic tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And in general, a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and please us with your numbers!!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to see the complex, when there were not even walls yet, so that we could see everything live, although how many apartments we considered and no developer offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The most high is the shallow, sparse forests of e, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks are boring and short for me.
The longest ones are on sector e, there are even more less.
But in general, the atmosphere is great, there are many different cafes and bars, so a fun ski mood is guaranteed!
Excellent master Peri!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the cabin is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a wardrobe and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I have already come for an order by the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application, and I wait at the windowsill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Such a service is unacceptable in business today!
The response of the care service is that we are trying.
At the checkout, even without apologies, just - it's not our fault, it's a program.
You have not found any other technical possibilities of communication with regular previously loyal customers.
Impotent people are "trying", but business must work.
Thank you all, we're all leaving.
We will not order more from you and will recommend it even more.
Spoiled mood, waiting for guests, apologies of the hostess - not the best sauce for hot rolls.
Ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
I expected to get the car in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but the fact turned out to be 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania performed).
As a result, I am very happy with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and a normal human attitude.
Thanks again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very warm), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge are available.
Of the disadvantages, it is possible to allocate too little space, there is a terribly small shower in the bathroom.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and there is not much place to dry things, I had to take a dryer from the owners and cram it in instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
And so, in general, a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
The prices are reasonable.
There are wines and beers for those who want to drink.
The center of Moscow, I recommend
A wonderful place with very polite staff, we will definitely come again.
There are all necessary amenities on site, including parking and billiards.
Rooms with good repair and all amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, strolled during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked it, and Russia in miniature, and the Lakes Park and the landscape.
In winter there are a lot of slides natural for kids)
A very cool tobacco and hookah shop)
We are constantly shopping here, the prices are low, and the quality is at the level!
Very responsive staff, will prompt and answer all your questions)
I recommend this store to everyone to visit! ❤️
The location is as convenient as anyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They serve quickly, if any of the visitors are not stupid.
By appointment is convenient.
The staff is attentive, they will prompt, direct, consult even if they did not come on reception days.
In principle, it's fine.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was done quickly and efficiently, the prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought the remote was going to be thrown away, but they did everything to me so smart.
Many thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery of 2 hours on March 8.
They brought flowers in a package after 6 hours, as if they had been stolen (there is barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the website and the color turned out to be completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to recalculate and it turned out that there were an even number of 20 tulips.
The support in Whatsapp responded to my indignation about the color and the number of colors, "apparently they mixed up the color."
The next day I wrote again and was offered a refund of 15%.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of arrogance and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent a statement to the tax service about the fact that I was refused to issue a check.
Rospotrebnadzor and the court are next in line.
I do not recommend anyone to contact this organization.
I have been going to master Samira for more than 10 years , for coloring and hair cutting .
I want to cancel the Professionalism of Master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always happy with her work.
She will always listen carefully to the client's wishes, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I boldly recommend this master to all my relatives and friends.
All her work is always done at the highest level!!!’
A huge saving to Master Samira 😍
I welcome you to this gaming club , I can say the prices are excellent, there are a lot of gaming computers, there are also drinks and food .
Of the minuses, some keyboards are broken, buttons fly off, if you take the "normal gameplay", then computers pull badly:(
Therefore, the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
My son goes to study in his group, and my mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super attentive, the coaches are professional.
They arrange themed holidays for children, monitor cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and study.
A 6-year-old child already holds a punch well, strong OFP.
Recommended to children, moms and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold !!
She performs the work efficiently, caring, clarifies everything .
You can always say goodbye to girls about something !
The third time was !
I won 't regret it for anything !
Finally I can grow my hair after lightening !!!
And Vita is also studying coloristics .
Therefore , it is she who will soon be able to combine blonde with keratin !
And your hair will THANK you🥰🥰
The master receptionist Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, explained clearly everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
Also, during the repair of my car, she provided every assistance.
And also thanks to master Valery Ushakov for the attentive and professional work.
I was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out qualitatively.
The only thing that confused me when I signed up for IT was not enough correct information on the work regulations, when I showed up for THAT, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I want to express my gratitude to the Administration staff.
It took a very rare certificate for the guardianship authorities to approve a real estate transaction, the employees were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, although they could refuse, since this is not part of their duties.
Thank you very much!
Very sincere people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, I did not regret that I came to this particular barber shop!👍
Master Nahida made an impeccable highlighting, haircut, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend it to everyone.
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
It was restored for the 800th anniversary, everything is stylish and clean inside.
There are cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on an excursion, too great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
We have known Olya for more than 3 years, we use the services regularly.
During this time, we saw how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged people, which only causes admiration and trust.
We always leave our friend with a calm soul.
Daily video reports, if necessary, will be picked up / taken away by zootaxi.
And they will also bring clean and delicious)
in general , a fairy tale 🥰
Thank you for your care and attentive personal attitude to our pets 🐕💜
The Well-Fed Moose restaurant is located next to the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
They prepare delicious dishes.
The menu is varied.
Before visiting, it is advisable to book seats in advance, especially on Fridays!
Cute well-groomed zoo.
Smaller than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
We were on weekdays- the entrance is an adult 300₽, a schoolboy 170.
There were few people, we took a walk with pleasure, looked at the animals.
Anteater impressed)
By the way, he was not seen in Moscow.
There are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices on the territory, a clean free toilet, and a phone charging station has also been seen.
In general, I recommend 👍
The salon is at the highest level!!!
I am very satisfied with the services of the cosmetologist Natalia Kuznetsova, I go only to her.
I do various facial cleanses - both hardware and mechanical.
I am 100% satisfied.
Master of his craft👍
Everything tells in detail about the features of the skin, picked up cosmetics caring for my skin type, just perfect.
I go now happy and beautiful!!!
Thank you Natalia!!!
A great club with a huge space, swimming pool, sauna, hammam and excellent coaches!
Of the minuses, there are a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club as a public bath!
Special emphasis on the women's department.
On weekdays, starting at 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I put a three and then only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken Timur, but I can be wrong.
I made out everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything is intelligible, the son also decided to issue a card, and alas, the consultants are busy with their own affairs, the clients are waiting, the consultant eventually approached the son, who doesn't care about everything, several times opened the meeting room, discussing something cheerfully, as a result, the son left without having issued anything, in forgiveness, the consultant said, well, whatever you want, whatever you want, since I was present at this meeting, I was surprised.
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It is a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to the appearance of pellets), the staff knows their assortment, helps in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim girl and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are located near the metro, there is even a small Parking lot.
We recommend it!
I was in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I liked everything about the service and the quality of the food: the prices are low, the portions are medium-sized, so you can eat, or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of a table.
When I ordered, I specified the number and everything that was required, after which the bot immediately called to check the phone.
Nothing further.
When I came to the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table was not booked.
We were lucky that there were free seats and they managed to accommodate us.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent Price ratio/Quality".
I recommend it!
Went to the cleaners last weekend.
For the first time I see such an organized staff who treated many of my questions with the utmost care, suggested how and what is best to do for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I heartily recommend it, the only clinic where they don't want to heat up for money in my memory.
Nice shopping mall.
There is everything!
A large assortment of goods.
Variety of stores.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
never set foot in this store again.
we bought a washing machine, they said we were out of town, so we'll take it ourselves.
the manager in the hall said where to drive to the warehouse, to the question "will they load"? said yes.))
the warehouse was taken out without a box , to the question why ? they replied that everything was loaded this way .
when she began to insist , they put two strips of styrofoam , like this will do !
they refused to load into the trailer, they say it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery )))
when I said that then I would refuse the order at all, they said "whatever you want, we don't care", in the end one still condescended to go down the ramp and help his father shove the car into the trailer.
this is the first time I have encountered such boorish service.
A good shopping center is clean and tidy.a large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmic" entertainment children's center"Nevidalia".
On the ground floor there is a large Hypermarket "Lenta".
Convenient, large Parking, convenient location.
A good supermarket of cosmetics, underwear and household goods.
A diverse assortment, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, advise.
Everyone will find something necessary for themselves.
A good place to spend the evening.
The staff is very nice, pleasant establishment.
I advise everyone never to make a mistake in choosing.The best place in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will be super.
I advise you to visit)
We would like to express our gratitude to Marina, who was our funeral agent.
Having come to us on a call, she took upon herself the solution of all issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was in touch all the time and informed us how things were going.
Thanks to her, we spent a loved one with dignity.
Everything was formalized, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, perfectly aware of the condition of her loved ones, gave advice on how it would be better and just sympathized with us in a human way.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thanks for everything.
Flattered by a lot of good reviews, I turned to Remstirmash and I was assigned a master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for services.
We discussed everything and set a time - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a complex application (how is it? and where is "completely free?") and, if he can, he will appear after 18.00 instead of the appointed 14.00.
We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all the planned things to the side!
In short, an intelligent master Ivan arrived, fixed the breakdown, for which I thank him.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening observations completely failed to meet expectations.
At first there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, children climbed to watch several times, adults crowded and could not let others see.
The objects that we looked at with a telescope were the size of an ordinary star, and without a telescope you can see for free.
The girl did not answer the questions very easily, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear why 600r.
An amazing place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has existed since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
To sit, having eaten 2-3 dishes for two (the portions are very large) + for a cocktail, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho is highly recommended to try.
The price is 420 rubles for 0.5 liters.
And in general, the restaurant itself has very tasty cuisine, I don't know about others, but I really liked it, I will advise my friends to definitely go there)
A great store, I've been buying goods from them for a long time, since the opening.
Good quality goods.
I bought a mixer, five years have passed, and it works properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when they were doing repairs, they took everything they needed in the apartment right here.
Great refueling!!!
It is located very conveniently, there is also a road to the center and the side of the region, in general it is convenient)!
The gas quality is good, I refuel 2 times a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is excellent!!!
Eaglets on the card and for cash, do not cheat on the litre.
The store, I liked it!
You can choose any model, at a reasonable price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help with the choice.
I took my daughter's laptop, for study, because her laptop was covered.
Helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! 👍
A sommelier works.
he helped with the selection of wine, because it is difficult to figure out for yourself in such a large menu.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting, charming Vasily, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
I ate pike perch - magically, respect for the cook.
The children's menu is like everywhere else: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. My ate pizza, she's a FIRE here!
Adults appreciated truffle, and children appreciated ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
The staff is nice, everyone is smiling, friendly.
We liked it.
A brand new WB order pick-up point is located in a convenient location.
Work schedule, from 10.00 to 21.00, without days off and holidays.
There are fitting booths inside the PVZ.
Very nice place.
Real professionals who are always ready to help work here.
There is also a group and a chat in Whatsapp for informative communication.
Quick delivery.
I am glad that the product can be immediately viewed and tried on.
It's great to be close to home.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything stated in the description is available.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient check-in, own Parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
Wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different performances.
Today we were at the Play "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, this is the best of the children's performances.
It was very interesting, a lot of dolls, special effects.
Even the son of 14 years old, went just for the company, and said that it was a very good performance.
We rested with my husband for 10 days in January 2023.
The rest was a success on "5", I liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called, specified what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price is 850r), we got there quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us through the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, it was issued quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator - this is a big plus!
The 2-bed room is spacious, the floors in the room and in the bathroom are warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (a table and two armchairs), panoramic windows (in the 5th building).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in the 5th building.
Everything is clean, towels and linen are changed at your request, but if you do not ask to change, they still change on the 4th day, good quality linen.
The territory is well-groomed, there are benches everywhere, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus takes you to and from the beach every 30 minutes.
To the public transport stop 5 min.
There are friendly guys in the dining room, they will always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but here who goes for what, everything was fine with us, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and meatballs, etc., vegetables for garnish every day, their own delicious pastries, more than 4 drinks, coffee beans, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, that's just cheese and sausage is not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 ° C, the sun.
We liked everything, really rested.
There is a desire to come again and it is in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the pool will not be put into operation in any way and the gym complex.
Thanks to the entire staff of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to the "Flight" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She likes everything very much, the coach praises) this is the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I would never have thought that my daughter is so flexible!
Wandering through the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to look into this promising institution - and we did not lose!
The prices are very affordable, and incredibly delicious pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, not even a crust remains.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend :)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarov hospital with high blood pressure and a high heartbeat.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
The food is deetic, but excellent!!!
I was surprised that at 7 in the morning they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, everyone puts both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!!
While there is a drip, they will come in, ask about how you feel...
Previously, I had to do an ultrasound of the heart, but this is the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Claudia Fedorovna!
A real professional: attentive, competent, gives an exhaustive answer to any question; picked up the dosage and medications, which normalized both pressure and heartbeat, which she could not achieve before after contacting other doctors.
Thank you very much to the head physician Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the well-coordinated work of the hospital!!!
Thanks to the medical staff, nurses, and cooks!
When visiting the customer service, the impression remained good.
The receptionist met me in the lobby.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently help clients with all the questions asked.
The specialist assisted in submitting the application and gave explanations on my question.
For a small store, a very good selection of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, various trifles.
It works around the clock, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It's cool when there is a place in the city where you can ride from the mountains.
The lifts are bugle and on weekends, of course, the queue is going to 40 seconds descent and 5-10 minutes queue.
But in general, it's cool, immersion in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if the roads are muddy and damp.
I turned to the service to repair the iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted Master Alexander directly, who explained all the details of the repair and immediately outlined the price limits.
Thank you for the repair, everything was done efficiently.
The masters are very pleasant in communication, they will show everything and tell everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was touched, the focus was lost.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as soon as possible, everything is working properly.
There are good specialists in this service, with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are acceptable, have.
If you need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires close, prompt and high-quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the content
Excellent railway
Responsive concierges , garbage is cleaned, clean and beautiful on the territory, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We have opened a nice, cozy place of rest in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
A killer and diverse food court in terms of food.
The tables are arranged in cozy zones.
There is no crowding.
Well, we've been, we've tried...
The interior has nothing to do with an Italian cozy cafe...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in a dining room.
Pizza... well, who has not tasted tastier, he will like it to me, it seemed to be some kind of faceless.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter is standing behind you all the time and your interlocutor opposite almost always looks in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We won't come here anymore and I won't recommend it to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best craftsman I've ever had my hair cut and dyed.
She does everything very carefully and efficiently, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also take my daughter only to Lena.
The atmosphere of the salon is amazing.
Thank you very much!
We from Nizhny Novgorod broke down on the way, kind people from Katresurs quickly reacted and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, there would be more such good people!
And in the service there is clean and good!
We came to the concert of Sergei Chigrakov.
Great concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come to the scheduled concerts this year.
A quiet place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music plays on weekends and holidays!
The staff is nice and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I love this place ❤
The park is in the center of the city, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is a place for both children and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football ground, which, unfortunately, is not very well maintained.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at the Crossroads.
The staff is friendly.
I didn't get into bad products.
Often promotions and discounts.
I am glad that it is close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We've been to the bar twice, liked everything, polite staff, delicious dishes and most importantly - great music, DJs know their stuff.
The only thing is, the second time the soloist of the band "Hands up Band" disappoints.
Not only does he sing, to put it mildly, not very much, but he also reads the lyrics of most songs from the phone, especially struck when they were the songs of the band "Hands Up".
Somehow this is illogical (speaking in a bar Hands up, in a band Hands up Band).
We had a rest in early March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of the birthday, they gave a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
Breakfast is just a dump of the head.
There is a mini bar with crazy prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant to the room, pay 20% for the service on top.
The restaurant prices are slightly inflated.
It tastes like three plus.
The water park was included in the price.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance didn't even help open the door seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
We need to work on this to keep the brand.
A great place to get together with friends to steam.
A large and comfortable steam room, there is billiards, an open-air pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
The workshop is on the level!
In a short time, I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husband and 1 wife).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is at a height.
Special thanks to the master for the careful attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful basketball school!
My son has been walking for 5 months and he really likes it, he is looking forward to every workout.
Individual approach to children, interesting classes, warm and sincere atmosphere.
The store is great, the staff will go, I order via the Internet myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus there are always discounts and excise taxes, which is also good
A good AV store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria for several tables.
I often visit - everything suits me!
Nice pool!
I'm specifically talking about the "frog", our coach Anastasia Vitalievna is very much liked by the child and is professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are hair dryers!
I love cupcake bakeries, service, croissants, breakfast and coffee are always on top.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout didn't make coffee until I reminded them, they did, it's impossible to drink, it stinks and the aftertaste of spoiled milk remains, I decided not to finish it and just left.
Last time there was a long black hair in my coffee, it was replaced.
Please be more attentive, after all, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria corrects perfectly, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of both hair and skin, so that the paint lasts for a long time.
It's better not to make eyebrows!
Thank you so much for the organized relocation of my mom!
Moving is always a huge stress, but everything went very clearly, quickly, and efficiently with your company.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been treating teeth with the whole family for a long time in Novodent.
Recently, my son's teeth were treated for 8 years, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because the reception is by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a fan of shawarma, BUT when I want something harmful only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat, lots of filling.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows from me.
Often when you finish the shawarma, you don't eat the bottom anymore because there's a lot of sauce, well, in short, fuuu...., but not here.
That's why you guys are the best🙂
Good teaching staff .
In the dining room , the food is always fresh .
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held during the school year
Nice store, polite staff, good assortment.
However, a big minus is that the goods that are brought are apparently destroyed right in the trading floor.
Sometimes there is not enough space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are standing right on the floor, without pallets, but this is more a remark to the organization, not to a specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Strict splendor, which is carefully cared for.
I got a double pleasure from the concert, largely due to the atmosphere of the House of culture.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really an outing.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
I accidentally got into this online auto parts store.
I called, indicated the wincode, said wait)
After 10 minutes, they called back, offered several options.
Since the car is personally working, I did not save money and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
After another 5 minutes, they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you do not take the whole basket + disk + squeeze, but take a LUK set basket + disk and a separate squeeze LUK, it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
Taking the clutch, I went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it turned out that a flywheel was still needed and the faster the better.
I already knew where I was going), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment on the call (for the first time he also paid upon receipt).
The next day, the flywheel was on hand.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I'm happy that everything came quickly, that we went to a meeting.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a success, but with nuances.
I booked a double table, it turned out they put me at a 4-seater.
But it doesn't matter.
It's just strange that they didn't warn me.
The kitchen is for four, the fish did not work at all.
A presenter with contests made on a school-level powerpoint, to be honest, not very much.
BUT as for the music, everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was on top.
Everything else seems like quibbles.
Thank you for the event
I leave my feedback, with words of gratitude to all the staff of the maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
This institution employs only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God.
Both in the OPB department, and in the maternity department, and in the postpartum department.
But I express my special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Y., this is the head of the maternity ward on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., this is the midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help with the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
A wonderful store.
A large assortment of balloons, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional employees.
Very beautiful bouquets, always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the institution on the recommendation.
The food is amazing, there is no program, the waiters are a little cheeky, but we were in a great team with children and celebrated an important event, were friendly.
There was no fiery feeding of the plateau, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for a good kitchen.
