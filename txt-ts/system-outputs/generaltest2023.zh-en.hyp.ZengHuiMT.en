DESCRIPTION C and C + + compilers are integrated. They all process the input file in one or more of four steps: 预处理( preprocessing), Hii( compilation), ( assembly) MERE ( linking)
The source file suffix identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the suffix controls the default setting: the suffix controls the default setting: for the compiler.
gcc considers the preprocessed file ( file) . i) is a c file and sets the connection in the form of c,
g++ considers the preprocessed file ( file) . i) is a c++ file and sets the connection in the form of c++
The post-level name of the source file indicates the language type and later operations: the language type and later operations:
C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly.
C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly.
CC + + source program; Preprocessing, compilation, assembly.
CXXC++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly.
MObjective-C source program; Preprocessing, compilation, assembly.
i preprocessed c file; compile, assemble, assemble.
ii preprocessed c++ files; compile, assemble, assemble.
s assembly language source program; assembly.
Assembly language source program; Preprocessing, assembly, assembly.
H preprocessor files; files with other descendants that do not normally appear on the command line are passed to the Linker. Typically these include:
0 Objectfile ( Objectfile) .
A Archivefile ( Archivefile) .
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used ( or a compilation error prevents the complete process), concatenation is always the last step.
During the connection phase, all corresponding to the source program are corresponding to each other. e-file, -1 library file, unrecognizable filenames ( including specified filenames) . o H tag files and The a library file is passed to the connector options in the order on the command line ( OPTIONS) .
Options must be given separately: de 'is completely different from `-d -r' .
Most `-=E: and` -W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name ( or -Wname and -Wno-name) .
Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all options, grouped by type, with explanations in later sections.
代码生成选项 ( Code Generation Option)
OverallOption ( OverallOption)
Explicitly indicate that the language of the subsequent input file is language ( rather than the default choice obtained from the file name) .
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option is encountered The language is optional.
Turn off any explicit description of the language, so based on the filename post-level processing followed by the file REASE `-x' option) .
If you operate on only some of the four stages ( preprocessing, compilation, assembly, connection), you can use the `-x' option ( or Ah after the filename) to tell geo where to start, and the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' options to tell geo where to end it is. Note that some combinations of options ( e.g., `-xcpp-output-E') {igeeMEF=c compile or assemble source files, ETER, ETER, are compiled or assembled. By default GCC makes use of ' O 'Cai source file name suffix ' The name of the ec label file. Other names can be selected with the -o option. GCC ignores any unrecognized input text伯 - S F anything after the -ec option.
The target file is up.
After compilation, it stops, and no assembly is performed.
Use pipes instead of temporary files to work between different stages of the compilation process, because the assembler of those systems cannot read data from pipes. GNU's assembler does not have this problem. The assembler can accept C "dialects": supports ANSI-compliant C programs.
This closes some ANSICc-incompatible feature keywords in GNUCc, as well as ANSItrigraph features such as unix and vax that indicate that they are welcome and rarely used, and disables all standard libraries that are available in the host environment ( hosted environment) . The main function returns an int value, a typical example of which is almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding independent environment ( f£reestandingenvironment) does not exist in a standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main. The most obvious example is the operating system kernel in the operating system kernel. For details, please refer to the latest information on the gcc website) .
Function declarations with no parameters, such as `intfoo(); ', are handled in C style - that is, they do not specify the number or type of parameters. ( Only for C++)
Normally, such a function foo means that the argument is empty in C++.
The section list is deleted from here to try to support some aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NUc manual for details, we have removed the details so that when the content is out of date, people will not HERI when the content is out of date.
Except for one thing: For C++ programs ( not C), the `-traditional' option has the additional effect of allowing assignment to this value.
It has the same effect as the '-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of traditional Cc preprocessors.
In particular, what is mentioned above about the preprocessor, but does not include other effects of the '-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers Allow `$' characters in identifiers ( C++ only)
You can specify the `"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disable the `$' character.
( GNUC++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all systems.) )
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types ( MEFc++) .
Normally GNUC++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal--templates generates smaller code for template declarations ( C++ only) by generating only one copy of each template function where they are defined.
To use this option successfully, you must mark `#pragmaimplementatio' ( definition) or `#Pragmainterface' ( declaration) in all files that use the template.
When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instances are external types. You must have the required instance appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved with typedef, which references each instance required.
Correspondingly, if you compile with the default option `-fno-exteznal-templates', all template instances are explicitly set to built-in.
All member functions ( except constructor subfunctions and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class in which they reside.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will pass through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; This is a direct call to.
-fcond-mismatch allows the type mismatch of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression.
The value of such an expression is Void. -fthis-is-variable allows assignment to this ( only for c++) .
Merging user-defined free storage management mechanisms into C++ makes assignable 'this' seem out of place.
Therefore, by default, assignment to this inside class member functions is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this work with the '-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char 把 char 定义为无符号类型, 如同 unsigned char.
Each machine has its own default char type Could be either unsignedchar or signedchar.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signedchar or unsignedchaz when relying on the symbolic nature of the data.
But many programs have been written to use only simple char, and expect this to be a signed number ( or unsigned number, depending on the target machine on which the program is written) .
This option, and its antisense option, make such programs work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as signedchar or unsignedchar, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
These options are used to define signed or unsigned bit fields if the 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifiers are not explicitly declared.
By default, bit fields are signed because the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed numbers, however, if the '-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned numbers.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in writable data segments without special treatment.
This is for compatibility with some older programs. They calculate that changing string constants is a very bad idea. The `-traditional' option has the same effect.
To execute the summary.
Impact of COVID-19 on drug markets.
The impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis.
The global COVID-19 epidemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed health services to the point of collapse, and restrictions imposed by governments have created serious disruptions in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of the outbreak is unclear and difficult to predict, but it has the potential to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers, unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and availability may change, and governments' ability to respond may be hampered.
The transformation brought about by COVID-19 is unprecedented, but some lessons can still be learned from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances, and usage patterns shifted to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.
If governments respond in the same way to the current economic downturn, interventions such as the prevention of drug use and related risk behaviours and drug treatment services could be hit hard.
In addition, interception operations and international cooperation may be prioritized less, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Drug trafficking is expected to be most directly affected in countries where large quantities of drugs are smuggled through commercial flights. Drug trafficking is expected to be most directly affected.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or hidden in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Drug supply activities using commercial air travel may be completely disrupted by restrictions imposed on air passenger traffic almost everywhere.
While international postal supply chains have also been disrupted trafficking through dark nets and the mailing of goods is likely to increase.
In the long run, the recession and related closures could disrupt drug markets.
As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable populations will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, to develop drug use disorders and to turn to illicit drug-related activities-whether in production or transportation-related.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to grow their ranks.
As governments become less able to respond, these shifts could quickly take root as new realities for many communities.
Expansion and complexity.
Market growth.
Population growth patterns partly explain market expansion.
Drug abuse has been on the rise around the world, both in terms of overall figures and as a percentage of the world's population who use drugs.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 2 drug users. It makes up 100 million people, or 4 of the global population aged 15-64, of a population of 15-64 years old. It is estimated that there are 2 drug users in 2018, while it is estimated that there are 2 drug users in 2018. The population is 69 billion, accounting for 5 of this population. 3 percent.
Over the past two decades, drug use has grown much faster in developing countries than in developed countries.
This partly reflects differences in overall population growth over the period, 7 per cent in developed countries and 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects faster growth in the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries decreased by 10%.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets.
In both developed and developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug use is partly due to large-scale rural-urban movements - more than half of the world's population now lives in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.
Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but it is the poorest who bear the greatest burden of disease. Worldwide, drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are more strongly linked to wealthier parts of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthier segments of society.
However, the rate of transition to drug use disorders is higher among people of lower socioeconomic status.
Data from a few countries show a link between harmful patterns of drug use and conditions and low income.
These patterns appear to be less common in wealthier social classes.
Economic constraints stemming from the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate risks for the most vulnerable, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been associated with increased drug use in the past, and the pandemic has forced tens of millions of people around the world out of work.
COVID-19 may lead to further expansion of drug markets The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of reduced control by national authorities, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of the economic crisis.
Trafficking by sea may have increased as a result of COVID-19-related restrictions that have reduced air and land traffic, where the risk of interception is low and higher volumes are smuggled than by air or land.
There have been recent reports of cocaine shipments being shipped directly from South America to Europe by sea from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity enhancement
The emergence of substances not under international control is stable, but new and potentially harmful opioids are on the rise The drug market is becoming increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis cocaine and heroin hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added many of which are not under international control and many are not under international control. Non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.
There are about 500 new active substances in the domestic market of Member States each year.
At present, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opioids.
While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, opioid new psychoactive substances accounted for only 2%, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in opioids are analogs of fentanyl, whose efficacy and harm have been demonstrated, leading to overdose deaths in North America and other regions, but to a lesser extent, these are analogues of fentanyl.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, or to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
Some evidence suggests that the injection of new psychoactive stimulants is also taking place in Europe. A study of the residues of discarded syringes in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce excitatory effects.
2 The use of new psychoactive substances may become entrenched in vulnerable groups.
A single class of new psychoactive substances almost never forms a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported on the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
Controls on precursor chemicals have forced drug producers to innovate. Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and producers have been searching for alternatives - not only loosely controlled substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, so-called "designer precursors" - so-called "designer precursors".
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug producers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality. According to reports in March 2020, shortages of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia drove up methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly.
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation.
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018, between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation has fallen by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has dropped significantly.
But the doping market seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrrolidinyl pentanone, are now ubiquitous on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities have reported a sharp rise in recent seizures of clandestine laboratories manufacturing various illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years to 152 laboratories in 2018, 2018, after a sharp increase in the number of clandestine laboratories manufacturing various illicit drugs.
Methamphetamine market growth in Afghanistan and Iraq methamphetamine market.
As early as 2012, investigations of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another worrying staple in addition to “ fenitalin” and tramadol.
A 2015 study reinforced these findings, with drug users saying marijuana was more difficult to obtain than "phenetalin" or methamphetamine, or methamphetamine.
Recently, a number of methamphetamine laboratories have been identified by the Iraqi authorities, and the Board has expressed concern about the large-scale import of pseudoephedrine preparations used as precursors by monomethamphetamine laboratories.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacturing appears to have begun in 2014 with the manufacture of methamphetamine.
Since then, methamphetamine seizures have been rising steadily.
But seizures in the first half of 2019 a ^657 kilograms - a sharp increase from the previous year compared to the previous year.
Large seizures of methamphetamine believed to have originated in Afghanistan in other countries also indicate that production is rising rapidly in that country's production is rising.
Policy changes and trends.
Most jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical use of cannabis have seen an increase in cannabis use.
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of these jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical use of cannabis.
In Colorado and Washington, two of the first states in the United States to pass legislation, non-medical marijuana use among adults has increased, especially in the past month and daily or nearly daily use. Since 2012, it has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, with use almost doubling last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and frequent use of cannabis.
Short-term data from Canada also suggests that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.
However, 40% of cannabis users in 2019 still obtained some products from illegal sources.
The reason behind the global slump in cannabis herb seizures is the legalization of cannabis.
Global seizures of cannabis herb fell to their lowest level in 20 years in 2018, as seizures in North America declined by 84% over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market have played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect The effect of domestic regulation of new psychoactive substances is still difficult to assess.
Some countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of new psychoactive substance use.
In other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following the adoption of domestic legislation.
Vulnerable populations face harm from both licit and illicit drug markets Medicinal opioids for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high-income countries Painkillers are unevenly distributed across regions in various regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12% of the global population.
Low- and middle-income countries are estimated to account for 88 per cent of the global population, but consume less than 10 per cent of medicinal opioids.
Barriers to access to medicinal opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug use disorders Approximately 35.6 million people had a drug use disorder in 2018.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. Studies in high-income countries confirm this, in which individuals' unfavorable socioeconomic trajectories - not just their status at a certain point in time - are also associated with risk of drug use disorders.
Drug use disorders also deepen socioeconomic disadvantage and further increase the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thereby contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to abusive attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexually diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disasters, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or experience problems accessing treatment services or experience problems accessing treatment services.
According to the disability-adjusted life years ( DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the wider social impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, the global number of disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17 per cent.
The increase in disability-adjusted life years associated with liver cancer caused by untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, was particularly high  40 per cent.
The complex relationship between drugs and violence makes it difficult to determine all the causal links between psychoactive substance use and violence.
Limited data worldwide suggest that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But alcohol appears to play a bigger role in violence than drugs.
While drug use may lead to crime, in some cases the link can be partially attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as socioeconomic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
Large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, has the potential to be carried out without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depend not so much on the volume of trafficking as on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of illicit markets, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
Latest Trends
Drug use Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, opioids are the most harmful to the most.
It is estimated that in 2018, 1 person used cannabis. Twenty-two billion people have become the most used drug globally.
By comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018 to use opioids.
But the harms associated with opioids have been overlooked due to fewer users.
Such substances were responsible for 66% of the estimated 167, 000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, and 50% of the 21 million years of life lost to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug use were caused by these substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates the public health crisis.
In West, Central and North Africa, the opioid crisis was exacerbated by tramadol. In North America it is fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economics, demographics, or general patterns of drug use, but both are struggling to combat an opioid crisis fueled by substances that are easily available and inexpensive to produce.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has contributed to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths over 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of 67, 367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl in 2018, of which two-thirds involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, but with lower numbers.
Part of the reason fentanyl causes overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.
The market for tramadol for non-medical use has grown significantly in West, Central and North Africa.
In the region, an increasing number of patients with tramadol use disorders are being treated.
In 2017, the amount of tramadol intercepted globally increased significantly, reaching a peak of more than 125 tons.
But global seizures fell to 32 tonnes in 2018 after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, in 2018, to 32 tonnes.
Contributing to the crisis in both places is the simplicity of manufacturing and the low cost of production, in addition to the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogs or their precursors.
Compounding the crisis in both places is the availability of these substances on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
The use of stimulants is increasing.
The stimulant sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are on the rise in their main markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is prevalent in North America and Western Europe.
Some 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, so that the use of one drug rises while the use of the other falls, sometimes increasing and decreasing at the same time to meet demand in the same market.
COVID-19 increases the risk for injecting drug users.
Approximately 11.3 million people were estimated to have injected drug use in 2018, and approximately 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people who inject drugs are infected with HIV and 5.5 million with hepatitis C.
About 58 deaths from drug use in 2017 were reported. 50, 000 people, half of whom died of liver disease caused by hepatitis C, while most injecting drug users still have untreated hepatitis C.
5 Opioid shortages caused by COVID-19 restrictions may lead users to replace them with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful forms of use may emerge as more harmful ways of use are used.

EU Summit Debates on Refugee Policy, EU officials Debate on Refugee Policy. Reception process bottlenecks - Chinanews.com.
EU summit squabbles over refugee policy, EU officials. There are bottlenecks at every step of the reception process.
[Global Times Special Correspondent Niu Ruifei in Belgium] According to Agence France-Presse reported on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration. This makes it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The move by the EU is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, where the core issue is the small number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be repatriated.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders, including through infrastructure and surveillance, through means of strengthening external borders.
However, the EU has been at loggerheads with member states over issues such as the payment of fence fees.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs.
But diplomats from some member states say that if the EU shared the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along the external border, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, that limited reception capacity and overwhelmed immigration authorities in member states are unable to prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications across the EU, and that the EU's refugee reception system is in a near-"permanent crisis", according to the European Euractiv website.
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen countries received more than 920, 000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half over the previous year.
Meanwhile, the European Union recorded more than 330, 000 illegal arrivals last year.
Against this backdrop, the summit also agreed on a "principle" that EU countries could repatriate illegal immigrants based on a court decision in another member state based on a court decision in another member state.
In addition, EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of a safe state, " which would open the way for the EU to develop a common list, the report said.

The U.S. escalates its "chip war" and hits the global semiconductor industry hard - Chinanews.com.
Recently, the "chip war" between the United States and China has greatly escalated. First, under pressure from the United States, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to start controlling the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. Later, foreign media reported that the US government is considering cutting off all ties between US suppliers and Huawei and banning US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei. The Biden administration is also preparing to unveil an executive order restricting U.S. investment in sensitive Chinese technology industries... Soon after the beginning of 2023, the United States continued to use malicious tricks to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never stopped cracking down on the development of China's "core". While accurately suppressing the semiconductor production and supply chain to China, it has built a "de-Sinicization" semiconductor industry chain alliance in an attempt to completely "get rid of" China's advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to win over South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or to establish a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, or to establish a "small circle" in the semiconductor industry chain through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and the "Indo-Pacific economic framework". The United States attempts to build a closed production and supply chain cycle led by the United States by introducing politicization, camp and weaponization into the semiconductor industry, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry. In order to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the "core tactics" of the United States against China with great fanfare are also "injuring the enemy by one thousand and self-injuring eight hundred".
Recently, Fanlin Group, a well-known chip manufacturing equipment supplier in the United States, announced that due to the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1300 full-time employees, and plans to lay off 1400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
Global lithography giant Asma Holdings of the Netherlands recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
According to US media analysis, after the US government brutally suppressed China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies suffered, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, chip manufacturers themselves and so on.
The so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry by the United States has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, which has long formed a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, and the whole process reaches 100 days.
Although the semiconductor industry in the United States has a strong foundation, it is relatively weak in manufacturing capacity, especially in advanced process technology, and relies heavily on East Asia.
Even if the United States tries its best to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the "small circle" regional development led by the United States, the regional distribution and interdependence of global semiconductor-related industries are difficult to change.
The United States has strongly "reshaped" and "de-Sinicized" the semiconductor industry chain, which has severely damaged the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the joint participation of countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, including the Innovation and Competition Act, the American Competition Act of 2022, and the Chip and Science Act, to consolidate its technological leadership by taking advantage of its technological hegemony. "Enwei" to its allies, to lure Intel, TSMC, Samsung and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the United States, trying to ensure that the United States has a global leadership position in the chip field.
In the short term, the United States has indeed created trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and has reaped practical benefits.
But in the long run, the hysterical suppression of the United States has forced China's chip industry to make continuous breakthroughs and lose its huge Chinese market, which will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products can be held for at least 360 days-Chinanews.com
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products went on sale.
The seven products of the organization can be selected and held for a minimum of 360 days.
Personal pension wealth management products have finally been launched online.
On February 10, China Wealth Management Network released the list of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products. Seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management and China Post Wealth Management were officially launched.
So far, the "shelf" of personal pension accounts has finally gathered four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension finance, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
According to reports, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all public offering net worth open products, including 5 new products and 2 existing products. Except for 1 product that is a mixed product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income products.
A reporter from Beijing Youth Daily saw that 4 of the 5 newly issued products came from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which were fixed income products. The minimum holding periods were 365 days, 540 days, 720 days and 1080 days, respectively. The corresponding performance comparison benchmarks ( annualized) were 3 3 years ( annualized), respectively. 70 percent to 4 percent. Can I get a rip in the chat boys, too. 10 percent to 4 percent. 60 percent, 4 percent. 40 percent - 4 percent. 90 percent and 5 percent. 25 percent - 5 percent. 75%
The remaining new product is "Postal Bank Fortune Tianyi Hongjin Minimum Holding 1095 Days No. 1", which is also a fixed-income product. The fundraising started on February 10 and ended on February 19. The risk level is Level 2, Level 2, which is Level 2, with a two-level risk level.
Among the two surviving products, one is Agricultural Bank of China Financial Management "Agricultural Bank of China Tongxin Smart" 360-day technological innovation RMB financial products, the nature of investment is mixed, the risk level is three-level, the risk level is three-level.
Another surviving product is "Postal Bank Wealth Tianyi Hongjin Minimum Holding 365 Days No. 1", fixed income type, which began to be raised on December 30 last year and officially operated on January 4 this year. The cumulative net value on February 8 was 1 on February 8. 0011
According to the Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions, the financial products that can be invested in personal pension fund accounts include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public funds and other financial products, including bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and public funds.
The release of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks that individual pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies.
The Measures stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension financial products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products and other personal pension products through personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice specifying that the personal pension system was launched in Beijing and Tianjin, as well as 36 leading cities and regions such as Shijiazhuang and Xiongan New Area in Hebei Province, and Jincheng City in Shanxi Province.
By the end of 2022, the number of individual pension participants 19.54 million, the number of contributors 6.13 million, and the total contribution amount 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot only listed three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public funds.
Now, after personal pension wealth management products are also gathered, investors should choose how to choose.
Experts from Bank of Communications Wealth Management Products Research and Development Department said that compared with other personal pension products, the pilot phase of pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products have three characteristics.
One is robustness, with a more sound risk management mechanism, more robust investment strategies and concepts, and the implementation of independent third-party custody by non-parent banks.
The second is long-term. The term of pension wealth management products in the pilot stage is 5 years or more. The minimum holding period for personal pension wealth management products issued in the next step is 1 year in principle. It is encouraged to hold more than 3 years.
Third, it is inclusive. The product purchase threshold is low. The starting point is generally 1 yuan, and some are as low as 0 yuan. 01 yuan, product custody fees, management fees and other rates are more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long term, high interest rate and high security, which is suitable for people with weak risk tolerance. Personal pension insurance products focus on protection, which is more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns. Personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not guarantee capital or income, there is a certain investment risk, but the expected return is higher, suitable for a certain degree of financial knowledge, high risk-taking ability of people.

The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust-Chinanews.com.
Another large gym "thunderstorm".
Recently, the issue of safeguarding the rights of fitness members in well-known fitness institutions has aroused social concern.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the closure of the institution and running away caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of public security and human resources departments and social security departments.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the organization responded, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the storm was calmed down.
Some stores of individual fitness institutions have business problems and are temporarily closed. Consumers can calmly wait for the problem to be solved. Why the first reaction of many members is "something bad"?
Behind the turmoil of fitness club members' rights protection is the deep-seated problem of the industry's trust crisis.
Traditional gyms in China generally adopt a prepaid model, and "earning money that users can't get" is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through pre-sale membership cards and constantly opening new stores seems to be able to cycle back and forth, but in fact, it is impossible to form a stable profit model.
Negative information about industries such as running in the gym frequently spreads, which has a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From the perspective of market prospects, gyms can certainly be regarded as a good business with "money".
Although the fitness track has ups and downs, it has always been concerned by capital.
A number of data show that the popularity of cultural and sports consumption and other fields continues to rise, and the market continues to pick up.
Specifically in the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the concept of healthy living deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the development of the fitness industry has great potential for development of the fitness industry.
The better the situation is, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development, the more it needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, individual institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the recovery of consumption. As soon as they emerge from the crisis, they sound the clarion call to expand their territory and invest all the financing funds into the construction of new stores.
Undeniably, affected by the epidemic in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn, the industry has been reshuffled, and powerful enterprises have selectively increased their acquisition efforts and re-layout at this time. This may not be a new opportunity.
However, if the development of the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous circle and embark on a stable and far-reaching road, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.
Only by working steadily and re-establishing consumers' trust and sense of security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared with building new stores to seize the market, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to settle down to optimize services and stabilize users with high-quality development.
First of all, it is necessary to rely on services to retain users.
Gymnasium belongs to the service industry, its essence is to adhere to the "user-oriented", to closely focus on the needs of users, the business focus on the quality of service upgrading and upgrading.
Second, digital transformation enhances the user experience.
For example, the current popular Internet gym model enables users to pay per visit and choose their own venue.
At the same time, body data and sports data can be effectively used to meet social needs and achieve a complete closed loop of services from online to offline.
Without private education promotion and a huge annual card, users' worries about fitness institutions running away have decreased, and their trust has also increased.
In addition, we must actively explore diversified business formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become a new entrance to consumption. Peripheral products such as sports supplies and fitness equipment required for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with richer choices.

Buy expensive and refund the price difference.
Nanjing property market reproduces "price difference compensation" - Chinanews.com again.
Yangzi Evening News ( Reporter Ma Zuobo) Yangzi Evening News/Ziniu News reporter found in an interview on the 10th that the "price protection agreement" that has not been seen for more than ten years has returned to the Nanjing property market. A property located in Jiangbei New District claims to "compensate for the price difference". Before the delivery of the house, the discount of other houses is greater than the previous discount. The developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference in price. The developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference in price.
The "insurance agreement" has many conditions.
Mr. Sun, a house-sitter at Poly Yangtze Extraction Platform, a property in Jiangbei New District, told reporters that he found a "statement" while visiting the property last weekend.
The pictures he sent to reporters showed that the developer of the property promised that those who bought the housing between February 1 and February 28 would deliver the corresponding housing from the date when the two parties signed the sales contract. If the preferential discount of other housing resources of the project is greater than the discount enjoyed by the previous purchase ( limited to other unsold commercial housing belonging to the same household type, the same building, the same unit, and the same property type as the commercial housing), the developer can exchange the house for the buyer and refund the difference in price.
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually a "price protection agreement", the purpose is to let buyers rest assured that they do not have to worry about the development of enterprises to reduce prices and promote sales. "Now I am afraid that the price will be reduced after buying it. Go to the sales office to make trouble. I don't have time. If it's not noisy, it's really heartwarming."
Many homebuyers believe that although the "insurance agreement" is giving homebuyers "reassurance", the conditions are not low, but the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a house just in need in Jiangbei, said that the insured property must first be of the same type, but also in the same building and the same unit. There are few houses that buyers can compare prices, so the "threshold" is still quite high. Therefore, the "threshold" is still quite high.
Some buyers believe that due to information asymmetry, sales do not rule out giving additional concessions, buyers "rights protection" is not small difficult.
Whether buyers can be retained remains to be seen.
The reporter inquired on the Nanjing online real estate that in November last year, a total of 252 suites of housing sold in two buildings, with a household area of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc. The average price of the whole decoration is 39843 yuan/m2, and the average price is 39843 yuan/m2 for the whole decoration.
However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in the building is 157, accounting for 62, accounting for 62, accounting for the total number of unsold units in the building. Three percent, of which 128 are in Building 8, 113 are unsold, and 44 of the 124 in Building 7 are unsold. The total number of completed sets of the project is only 33, accounting for only 13 percent.
According to market sources, the "insurance agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008, and the "insurance agreement" also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, in order to attract the attention of buyers, Hengtang Xiyuan on Huangshan Road in Hexi Province launched the "Price Protection Plan". The specific content is "The Company solemnly promises that if the preferential margin of the project is expanded within one year, the resulting difference will be refunded to the old owner according to the difference".
Since then, in April 2011, nine properties in Nanjing have pledged to "pay the difference" by taking out part of the housing supply.
"The property market is picking up, at this time more need a shot of 'cardiotonic' at this time."
Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the real estate industry in Nanjing, said that the "insurance agreement" is also one of the marketing methods of real estate enterprises.
He believes that today's development enterprises need more confidence than buyers, the launch of the "price protection agreement" is actually to give it a boost.
As for whether to retain homebuyers, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, which remains to be seen at present.
Taiwan's economy performed poorly in the beginning of the year due to a number of data recessions - China News Network ( Xinhua) .
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11 ( Reporter Zhao Bo, Huang Yang) Export trade volume "five blacks in a row", manufacturing purchasing managers index ( PMI) for seven consecutive months of tightening, consumer price index ( CPI) again see "3 words"... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have released economic data for January 2023 one after another.
Experts believe that Taiwan's economy has not performed well at the beginning of the year, and the growth pressure is not small.
According to the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan's export 315 in January this year was announced. At $100 million, it dropped by 21 per year. Of two percent, there was the fifth consecutive month of negative growth for the second year.
Compared with the same period last year, the export volume of 11 major export categories has declined.
Plastic rubber and its products, optical equipment fell the most, with an annual decrease of 37 years, respectively. They were 6 or 35, and that was the case. 7 percent.
Exports of electronic components have decreased by 20 years. 1%, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, the IC decreased by 18 years. It was the largest decline in 14 years, 3%.
Cai Meina, director of statistics at the department, said that this shows that the weak demand effect of the consumer electronics industry has spread, and the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that in January, Taiwan's imports and exports fell, and the excess amount was only 23, only 23 yuan. $400 million, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that global terminal demand has decreased, industrial inventory adjustment has suppressed manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials, and the export downturn is unlikely to improve in the short term. Taiwan's export recession in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected.
According to Taiwan's China Institute of Economic Research released in January this year, Taiwan's manufacturing purchasing managers' index ( PMI) seasonally adjusted for 40 after seasonal adjustment. They are up to 4 percent, down from 3 percent in December last year. With 3 percentage points and 7 consecutive months of contraction.
In the economic monitoring index system, PMI takes 50% as the line of prosperity and decline, and the index is greater than 50%, which represents economic expansion. On the contrary, it is a contraction.
Among the five components of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders, production and manpower employment tightened, supplier delivery time decreased, inventory tightened, inventory tightened.
The six major industries all reported PMI contraction, and the industries were ranked according to the contraction speed as electric power and machinery and equipment ( 35) . 1 percent), electronics and optical industry ( 35 percent) . 2%), chemical and biotechnology medical industry ( 39) 2%), basic raw materials industry ( 42) 4), the transportation industry ( 42) . 6%) and the food and textile industry ( 45) . 7%)
In terms of prices, the "General Accounting Office" of the Taiwan authorities announced that Taiwan's CPI grew at an annual rate of 3 in January this year. 0.4%, which has been breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28 yuan. Just a quarter of a year, to set a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special member of Taiwan's "General Accounting Office", admitted that the increase in vegetable prices had indeed exceeded expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2 December last year. By the way, inflationary pressure still exists, and it is still at a high point.
Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism based on media reports on the island such as the United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.
Wu Daren, a professor of economics at Taiwan's "Central University", analyzed that the export recession may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturers and increase the risk of debt default.
At the same time, the reduction in orders has led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and the household economy, which in turn has an impact on consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Economic Research Institute, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the United States has not been resolved this year, and demand continues to shrink. It is estimated that Taiwan's export recession will continue into the first half of the year.
As Taiwan's economy is supported by exports and affected by the downturn in exports, the performance of economic growth for the whole year will not be as good as last year.
"An important engine for global recovery" - Chinanews.com.
"In response to the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, China's economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations show that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
Julio Rios, a well-known Spanish expert on China issues and honorary adviser to the China Policy Observatory Network, said in an interview with our reporter recently that the current epidemic prevention and control in China has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios said that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully reflecting its economic resilience and management level.
While China is unswervingly expanding its opening up to the outside world, the endogenous driving force of economic development has been continuously strengthened, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises have developed in synergy with the development of private enterprises.
Every year, the two sessions of the National People's Congress of China are held. Representatives discuss national development plans and popular livelihood hotspots, gather consensus, people's hearts, and wisdom, and add strength to China's development.
Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term high-speed development and has now entered a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to China's wisdom and China's plan, and expects China's development to bring new opportunities to the world.
Rios said that at present, China is making every effort to promote scientific and technological innovation and inject new impetus into economic and social development. "Capital investment, talent training, and policy incentives will make China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan."
In Rios' view, economic system reform is a difficult task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China not only gives full play to the strengths of the market economy, but also gives full play to the advantages of the socialist system, and takes proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting the development of private, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing industries, adhering to innovative development, promoting employment, improving the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meeting the people's multi-level and diversified consumption needs... China will fully, accurately and comprehensively implement the new development concept, focus on promoting high-quality development, and build a new development pattern. It will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
"Economic stabilization and recovery after the epidemic is the common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
Rios said that he looks forward to the joint construction of the "Belt and Road Initiative" cooperation to continue to play its important role in improving the infrastructure level of various countries and strengthening connectivity in various fields, and continue to release greater momentum.

China's e-commerce industry has emerged as a "new variable". How to bring goods to achieve "content is king"?
- China New Net
China News Service, February 11 China's e-commerce industry has emerged as a "new variable". How to bring goods to achieve "content is king"?
China-Singapore financial reporter Xia Bin.
"We entered e-commerce late, but we realized from the very beginning that if we want to stand out from thousands of stores, content is very important."
Fangfang, a "post-90s" girl from Guangdong, now runs a nourishing ingredients store on Douyin e-commerce, making an offline store with a history of more than 30 years "blossom" online.
Imitating the tone of old Hong Kong movies, accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, the exquisite video is refreshing when you open @ Fangfang's one-person tremolo account.
At the recently held Douyin E-commerce "Looking for Companions · High-quality Content Sharing Special Session", Fangfang spoke as a representative of high-quality creators, introducing her daily creative experience and experience.
She said at the scene that she was speaking. "The carefully polished video has gained a lot of attention from netizens. Many people are interested in my family's ingredients and want to cook delicious food together. The sales suddenly opened up.
”
Fangfang relied on soup-making videos to make more people fall in love with "Lao Guang's taste". A live broadcast sold up to 300, 000 nourishing ingredients, saving the family's old store on the verge of bankruptcy.
"No content, no e-commerce", with the continuous development of short video and live e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early days of the development of live streaming, live broadcast rooms often used low-price discounts to attract users, and the price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at that time.
In recent years, there are not only phenomenal big V such as Liu Xiehong and Oriental Selection, but also many unknown talents and merchants in the vertical segmentation field. They continue to create high-quality content in line with their own brand tone and improve long-term business efficiency.
According to Gao Yaxuan, head of Douyin e-commerce star author operations, 6.27 million creators have monetized content through Douyin e-commerce in the past year, their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and the total turnover has more than doubled.
"Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving and vibrant author ecology.
” Gao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Ecological Health Index ( ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of high-quality content as a "new variable" in the current e-commerce industry from the data dimension, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China. The content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China was assessed.
According to the content ecological health index ranking of the e-commerce industry in the above report, Douyin e-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com rank in the top five.
The report believes that the content ecology of the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept, which integrates e-commerce with content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC ( professional production content) and UGC ( user original content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, and the stronger the commercial value. The proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption gradually integrated and distributed in the public and private spheres will also be higher.
At the scene, Yu Guoming, professor of the School of Journalism and Communication of Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Professional Committee, analyzed and interpreted the report.
He said that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from "consumer accessibility" to "consumer quality" stage, and high-quality, professional and differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and starting point of the new stage of e-commerce development, knowledge payment, professional knowledge, KOL ( key opinion leaders) and other PGC content began to become the standard configuration in e-commerce live broadcasting.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the perspective of improving the content structure, create positive content creation and management standards, and achieve the index and dynamic balance of the content ecological health system in the e-commerce industry.
The other is to realize the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment from the perspective of external ecology.
"In the future, the e-commerce industry will need more data and artificial intelligence support to form a prediction of the stability of future development." In addition, it provides a more standardized and healthy growth space for merchants, realizes the value synergy of enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and creates a healthy content ecology.

Kim Jong-un's father-daughter interaction and intimate wife were left out in the cold.
( Comprehensive, 11th) North Korea held a military parade for the 75th anniversary of Army Day on the evening of the 8th. Kim Ju-ae, the daughter of leader Kim Jong Un, not only attended, but also stood on the rostrum with her father.
North Korean state media released a video on the 9th. Top gifter loves to snuggle up to her father, looking at each other warmly and whispering several times. She gently holds her father's cheek with both hands, and even touches her father's chest. The interactive picture of father and daughter is broadcast all over the country and below.
However, First Lady Li Xuezhu could only step aside.
According to South Korea's "North Korea News" and other reports, in the official photo of Kim Jong-un and Ri Sol-ju's wife attending the dinner with their daughter Kim Jong-ae on the 7th, Kim Jong-ae not only rarely sat in the middle of her parents' seat, but also boarded the rostrum with Kim Jong-un at the military parade on the 75th anniversary of Army Day the next night. She also boarded the rostrum with Kim Jong-un on the podium with Kim Jong-un on the 7th.
North Korean state media "Korean Central Television" later released a video of the military parade, exposing more images of the deep love between father and daughter.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times on the podium. The smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered to each other in their ears. At one point, Kim Ju-ae cupped his father's cheeks with both hands. Kim Jong-un also responded with a bright smile.
Other state media footage also showed Ms. Kim repeatedly touching her father's face as she sat on an indoor sofa chair with Mr. Kim, using her hands. As she walked arm in arm with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hand while touching it.
The first lady, Li Xuezhu, could only walk behind or sit aside, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since the first public appearance of the test-fired Mars 17 missile on November 18 last year, the probability of exposure has become higher and higher in the past three months, and it is now the fifth time that it has appeared on a formal occasion.
North Korean state media mentioned Kim Ju-ae with extremely high honorific titles such as dearest son and honored son, and also broadcast clips of Kim Ju-ae repeatedly shouting and vowing to support the white-headed bloodline in the stands overlooking the parade.
These signs make the outside world doubt whether Kim Jong-un's daughter has been designated as the successor of the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un has pushed his middle school-aged daughter to the position of successor." However, there are also views that such a judgment is still premature. In the case of Kim Jong-un having a son, there are still various possibilities. In the case of Kim Jong-un having a son under his knee, there are still various possibilities.
Chongyang Q&A  How to view the US non-farm payrolls data in January exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website - how to see the US non-farm payrolls data greatly exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observation Network - Professional Financial News Website
Q. May I ask how Chongyang Investment views the US non-farm payrolls data in January exceeding expectations and future trends?
A On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released non-farm employment data for January 2023, adding non-farm employment to 51 new non-farm employment. At 70, 000, it was significantly higher than the market expectations of the 18th. 90, 000 people. Unemployment fell to 3 percent. Fourteen percent - the lowest level in nearly 50 years. Hourly earnings are increasing at a year-on-year rate of 4 per hour. It is up to 4 percent and up to 0 percent. 3, that's slightly slow down.
From the aggregate point of view, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in this data, such as the staff returning from strikes, the revision of the survey statistical caliber, and the update of the quarterly adjustment factor, which may be revised in the future ( referring to the January 2022 increase in non-agricultural employment from 50 to 50 in 2022) . Fourteen thousand people have been repaired to 36 people. Over 70, 000), non-farm payrolls or not as strong as the data suggests.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the proportion is relatively low. High-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care have seen a significant increase in new employment, and data show that there is still a labor gap in the service sector.
Combined with the same larger-than-expected PMI for the service sector, a recovery in job vacancies and labor gap data, and a strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector has ushered in a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that it is difficult to improve the supply and demand tension in the US job market without a recession.
At present, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor force participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor force participation rate of 25-54 years old is close to the pre-epidemic high.
In addition, due to the strength of US residents' excess savings and consumer credit, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of tightening policies on the job market.
Continued tight supply and demand in the US job market will be the undercurrent of the US economy in 2023.
Superposition is now approaching the end of interest rate hikes, and inflation expectations are constantly repeating. We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Before the release of this data, the US stock and bond exchange market was too optimistic about the Fed's interest rate hike path.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Fed has continued to maintain the fragile balance of market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes, but the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statement. It not only expects to stop raising interest rates in advance, but also expects two interest rate cuts at the end of the year. Two interest rate cuts are also expected at the end of the year.
In the context of tight supply and demand in the labor market and unclear impact of tightening policies, we believe that the Fed's guidance on raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some harm to the market.
Nevertheless, the stubbornness of wage growth cannot change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the M2 data turning negative year-on-year and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-leading indicators, the US CPI data has turned to a stage of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only form a foundation for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify. After the release of the next inflation data, the market may enter a new round of gaming.
Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan, died of sudden heart disease and led the transformation of China's first clothing company - Economic Observation Network - professional financial news website.
Economic Observation Network reporter Zheng Yuxin On February 11, the WeChat official account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. ( hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") issued an obituary. Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65, at the age of 65, due to ineffective treatment of sudden heart disease.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the factory director of the state-run cotton mill. With the transfer, Zheng Yonggang became the factory director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd., in 1989.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Meeting of Chinese Enterprise Leaders and the 22nd Annual Meeting of Future Stars of Chinese Enterprises, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 1990s, the market share of Shanshan brand was as high as 37%.
1996 Sugo ( 600884) SH) went public and became the first listed company in China's garment industry.
When the clothing business was in full swing, Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market. Shanshan suits want to always lead the way, and it is unlikely to become the national clothing of Chinese people for a long time."
In 1999, Shanshan began to study enterprise transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, "We came to Shanghai to find out what to do with transformation. We specially found many experts and scholars to hold some Zhuge Liang meetings and retreat seminars continuously."

The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is that great health has a future."
After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute supporting Anshan Iron and Steel was working on the national 863 project, and the scientific research funds were not enough, so Shanshan and the Carbon Research Institute of Anshan Thermal Energy Institute signed a cooperation agreement to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Mesophase Carbon Microspheres" project, engaged in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and realized the commercial promotion of negative electrode materials in China.

This is the first lithium-ion battery anode material production enterprise in China, realizing the localization of lithium-ion battery anode materials.
With the rapid popularization of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. began to develop gradually. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into the main business of Shanshan Co., Ltd., and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year. Until 2013, the revenue of lithium battery material business exceeded that of clothing business in an all-round way.
In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chemical polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established Shanjin Optoelectronics, a polarizer company. The technology content in this field is relatively high. Shanshan's main competitors are the world's top 500 companies, such as Samsung in South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical in Japan, and Nitto Denko in Japan.
Zheng Yonggang once shared the experience of post-investment management, "Chinese private enterprises acquire some international high-tech enterprises, the probability of success is relatively low, why those acquisitions will fail, why those acquisitions will fail." Why do those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone will think about it, I spent so much money, I have to send someone to manage it, right? This is a common behavior. However, Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanjin Optoelectronics and publicly announced that Shanshan, as a major shareholder of Shanjin, decided to implement one enterprise, two systems. In addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman, people from Shanshan enterprises were not sent to Shanjin and adopted the method of authorized operation. The original distribution system, corporate culture and various management models remain unchanged.
ICC Xinliao Information released 2022 negative electrode data showing that Shanshan negative electrode shipments exceeded 200, 000 tons in 2022, a year-on-year increase of 100%, a market share of 16%, artificial graphite negative electrode material shipments continued to rank first in the list, and artificial graphite negative electrode materials continued.
In terms of polarizer business, YanoResearch statistics show that the company's Shanjin Optoelectronics will have a global market share of 29% in 2022 and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan's revenue was 158, which was three quarters. The net profit is 23.4 billion yuan, with a net profit of 23. 1.30 billion yuan. On February 10, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s share price was 19.9 for Shanshan Co., Ltd. 24 yuan/share, total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan said on the interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's graphitization effective capacity was about 100, 000 tons, and the graphitization capacity of the Meishan project was still climbing.

The same resistance to the Communist Party of China, the United States, Japan and the Philippines reached a defense consensus.
Asia  On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan for talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's invasion of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement stating that they will conduct substantive defense exchanges and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy by signing a trilateral defense agreement with the United States.
According to Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes to use the meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies against the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos visited China in early January this year and won an agreement worth $20 billion.
But after that, China-Philippines relations not only did not improve, but declined.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to the US military to ensure security in the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan and is also the closest to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines are now forming an axis with the United States to build an "arc against the CCP" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, conveyed Song Tao's words during his visit The Green Camp is welcome to visit the mainland under the 1992 consensus.
During this visit, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of Taiwan's Chinese Kuomintang, met with Song Tao, director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council of China, and Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.
In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the National Affairs Foundation, an official organization of the Kuomintang, positively commented on Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan that as long as he agrees with the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, China welcomes green camp people to visit the mainland.
The Kuomintang commented that it was a new thing.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao earlier that day news did not mention this statement.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has clarified for days that it refuses to accept the 1992 Consensus.
According to the Central News Agency today, Xia Liyan, vice chairman of the Kuomintang, led a delegation to visit the mainland. During his stay in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and Yin Li.
Xia Liyan met with Song Tao and talked about the political basis of the Kuomintang's "92 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the Kuomintang National Government Foundation, said at the meeting that the Kuomintang's "92 Consensus" is the original "92 Consensus". The "92 Consensus" of the Kuomintang is the original "92 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this is different from the previous meetings he participated in.
In recent video talks with academic circles in mainland China, as well as this one, we did not hear Taiwan-related scholars talk about military unification and the "Anti-Secession Law." Instead, we resumed exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the war between the two sides of the strait is fierce and dangerous, and the Chinese mainland hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the Democratic Party and the Communist Party of China, the other side is still willing to do a good job in dealing with the Taiwanese, and the representative does not want cross-strait relations to be damaged.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally instructed Song Tao that "you must implement the demands put forward by them ( Taiwan farmers and fishermen) ." If it cannot be resolved comprehensively, individual cases should be handled.
The report did not mention whether Kuomintang visitors to the mainland mentioned in person the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and warships, the agricultural and fishery issues in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether reporters from the Central News Agency asked such questions in interviews with reporters from the Central News Agency.
French trade unions have once again staged a rally against the government's retirement reform plan.
On Saturday ( February 11), French trade unions once again launched a national mobilization against the draft government pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their views.
This is the fourth day of action of the social trend against the draft reform of the government pension system.
And how many people respond to the rally call could influence the union group's next course of action.
This is the fourth time in a month that France's eight largest trade union groups have jointly launched a national mobilization, and the first time the protest has scheduled a rally on Saturdays.
Given that Saturday is a public holiday for most French people, and they do not have to choose between taking part in demonstrations and protests, or going on strike with payroll deductions, trade union groups hope that today's rally will attract more people to participate.
Neither the subway bus system nor the union of the public railway company called for a strike today. The bus system should be able to operate normally. Citizens can take buses to the rally site. At the same time, in areas where schools have started winter holidays, people can take normal holidays.
Trade union groups are hoping for more than a million people to attend the rally today, while police expect between 600, 000 and 800, 000 people nationwide and 90, 000 to 120, 000 in the Paris metropolitan area.
Since the start of the anti-government pension reform protests, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support the measure to raise the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstrations on January 31st gathered 1.27 million to 2.5 million people across the country.
The number of demonstrators on Tuesday ( February 7) has shrunk to between 757, 000 and 2 million across the country.
The pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
Numerous amendment proposals have been submitted by opposition parties, especially those led by the radical left, so that the review process has moved very slowly.
And the debate between the government and the opposition has become increasingly fierce and sharp.
A lawmaker from the radical left-wing French Unyielding party recently circulated a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the head of the labor minister on social media, sparking protests from the ruling party over a protest that sparked from the protests of the labor minister.
The Speaker of the National Assembly eventually announced a 15-day ban on the MP from parliamentary activities as punishment for such behavior.
Although the reform plan has triggered the largest social upsurge in France in more than 20 years, so far, although the government has made slight adjustments to the draft, it has not made any major concessions.
Trade unions are already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th, and they plan to organize demonstrations when the draft reforms are sent to the Senate for discussion on March 7th, and they plan to organize demonstrations.
China encourages raising fertility rates to universities to push sperm donation quality standards high.
China's Yunnan Provincial Human Sperm Bank issued a publicity on the 9th, soliciting sperm donations from college graduates or students. Successful donations of 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of 4, 500 yuan.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message rushed to Weibo hot search on the same day, and triggered many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing to follow up the initiative.
China encourages college students to donate sperm, according to a signed report by the Free Times, which encourages college students to donate sperm.
Among them, Beijing has the highest threshold for sperm donation. In addition to academic qualifications, it also requires a height of more than 170 cm, correct facial features, no obvious hair loss, and myopia degree not higher than 600.
According to the report, the Yunnan Provincial Human Sperm Bank pointed out that sperm donors can get a full set of male medical examinations worth 1, 000 yuan, "especially semen and chromosome testing, most people have never done, which is of great significance to understand their fertility status".
Conditions for sperm donors include those with a height of 165 cm or more, college degree or above, no color blindness, color weakness, hepatitis B and other genetic diseases and infectious diseases.
The report quoted China Tianmu News as saying that the human sperm bank in Shaanxi Province printed a promotional poster of "paid sperm donation, infinite glory", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation, and encouraging netizens to forward relevant messages and "let love pass", "let love pass on".
The price in Shaanxi Province is higher than that in Yunnan. Qualified people can receive RMB 300 in cash each time. Donors who complete a certain number of sperm donations can receive a subsidy of RMB 5000.
At present, the highest known price is Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5150 yuan.
East Germany's last communist chancellor has died today.
The successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement, "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall, which separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modrow said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At the time, Communist Party leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
After the Soviet Union came to power, Mikhail Gorbachev demanded changes in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic ( GDR) .
As a result of the election, he no longer served as prime minister.
Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political change and unification that took place in October 1990, which occurred in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reshape, rather than abolish, the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to prison.
The allegations are said to be politically motivated.
Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament from 1990 to 1994 and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004, from 1999 to 2004.
Modrow sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters he did not want the old East Germany to return, but said its achievements should be recognized.
Modro was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz ( now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in a youth fire brigade and towards the end of the conflict became a member of the Nazi militia Volkssturm, which recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final war struggle.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet troops and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he took anti-fascist courses and became a staunch Communist Party member.
In 1949, the year East Germany was founded, he returned home to find a job as a mechanic and went on to study social sciences and economics, earning a Ph.D.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, which almost all young East Germans joined, and rose through the ruling Social Unity Party ( SED) to become president of the Dresden Regional Party from 1973 to 1989. party chairman.
He also served in East Germany's parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran marks revolution anniversary as pro-protest hackers hack president's televised speech.
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Lacy's televised speech.
The president's live televised speech was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute, and the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers with the name "Edalat Ali" appeared on the screen.
There was also a voice shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic" as well.
Hackers interrupted state television coverage as Iran marked the anniversary of its revolution, Reuters reported today.
As Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, Lacey's hardline government faces its boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Lacey still calls on "deceived youth" to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
Nationwide protests continue to sweep across Iran following the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in the custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iranian security forces have launched a deadly crackdown on protests in one of the most powerful challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2, 500-year-old monarchy.
Iranian authorities on Friday released jailed dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on hunger strike as part of an amnesty to mark the anniversary of the revolution.
Earlier Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an amnesty that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
As of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors, human rights group HRANA reported.
Another 70 government security personnel were killed, the report said.
As many as 19, 763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and state media have called for a vote at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the government's protests and support for them.
On the evening of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution on Friday night, state media displayed fireworks as part of a government-sponsored celebration, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar" and "Allahu Akbar".
( God is the greatest. ) "
However, many at the rally could also be heard shouting at "death to the dictator."
And "Death of the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in states across the country.
In Tehran, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed as part of official celebrations.
President Lacey's speech was frequently interrupted by chants of "Death to America" - a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel".
Reuters said Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on national security charges.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah has denied the allegations.
Mesami's release comes a week after supporters warned that he was at risk of death as a result of his hunger strike protests.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against mandatory headscarves.
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday by calling for her freedom to be restored, "including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes to do so."

The balloon incident has rubbed America's nose in it even more.
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China.
The Wall Street Journal reported today that after the balloon incident, the United States is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and would garner more political support for strengthening US technology protection.
The United States said the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official now at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
"This undoubtedly adds fuel to the fire and supports the views of the hardliners on China."
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider broader actions to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and to our allies and partners.
U.S. officials say they have informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident and that international coordination is crucial to countering the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established Ad Hoc Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Communist Party of China in the United States House of Representatives may also pressure the United States to take more stringent measures to slow down China's development.
Members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force the White House to adopt tougher policies, she said.
Many advocates of stricter export controls are also pushing to expand them to include industries such as artificial intelligence, the Wall Street Journal said.
The U.S. government is also already working on a foreign investment review program to examine U.S. investments abroad for potential national security threats from China.
Analysts said the White House could face calls for a faster rollout of the plan, analysts said.
Earthquake relief in Turkey and Syria goes on night and day.
Rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working around the clock to free survivors buried under the rubble of thousands of destroyed buildings since a powerful earthquake struck Turkey and neighboring Syria.
In freezing temperatures, they often appealed for silence as they struggled to hear any sounds of life from the dilapidated concrete piles.
Two more women were rescued from the rubble days after surviving the quake, Reuters reported today.
However, the death toll from the quake climbed to 24, 150 people.
The death toll in Turkey stands at 20, 665 and more than 3, 500 in Syria.
Monday's 7th was held. The 8th magnitude earthquake, which continued with several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan's 2011 earthquake and tsunami and approaching the 31, 000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
A similarly powerful earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17, 000 people.
Rescuers rescued two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings in Turkey after they were trapped for 122 hours following the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, Turkish authorities said Saturday.
Another injured 55-year-old man, identified as Masallah Cicek, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, Turkey's largest city in the southeast.
In freezing temperatures, rescuers often called for silence as they struggled to hear any sounds of life from the dilapidated concrete piles.
Crouching under concrete slabs and whispering "Inshallah" - "God bless" - in Turkey's Samandag district, rescuers cautiously reached into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old newborn, who was 10 days old, from the rubble.
With his eyes wide open, baby YagizUlas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to a field hospital.
Video images showed first responders also taking his mother, who was dizzy and pale on a stretcher but conscious.
Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours and that a total of 31, 000 rescue workers had been deployed in the affected areas.
He said about 80, 000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people were left homeless by the quake and crowded into makeshift shelters.
Questions have grown among the public about the response of the leaders of both countries to the disaster relief effort, as many people lack food in cold winter conditions.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad traveled to a hospital in Aleppo with his wife Asma, according to Syrian state media, reportedly the first time he has traveled to the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Program said it was running out of stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria as the state of war complicated relief efforts.
Erdogan, who visited Turkey's Adyaman province on Friday, acknowledged that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who is up for re-election in a vote to be held on May 14 but could be delayed because of the disaster.
Anger over delays in the delivery of aid and the start of relief efforts could affect the election, Reuters said.
Even before the earthquake, voting was seen as Erdogan's toughest challenge in his two decades in power.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called a "negative campaign for political gain".
Turkey's main opposition leader Kemal Kilidaroglu criticized the government's response.
"The earthquake was big, but worse than the earthquake was the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence, " the criticism said.

What exactly was the "object" shot down over Alaska?
Confusing, speculation in succession.
The U.S. military once again used its most advanced stealth jet fighter, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska on Friday afternoon ( February 10) .
It was shot down ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down an airborne object.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed near the coast of South Carolina after drifting in U.S. airspace for several days.
The second downed object entered U.S. airspace for the first time Thursday night and was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 1, the Pentagon said. It is 20, 000 meters ( 40, 000 feet) and is about the size of a small car. It is much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes there is currently no indication that the object is manipulable.
John Kirby, strategic communications coordinator for the White House National Security Council, said on Friday that while the exact shape of the object flying at high altitude was unclear, it "posed a legitimate threat to the safety of civilian aircraft."
Bryant said the object, unlike the spy balloon found in the United States, did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
"We call it an 'object' is the best description we can make right now, " Bryant said.
President Biden took advice from the Pentagon before ordering the shooting down of the object, and he made the decision "very carefully, " Bryant added.
The official U.S. description of the object could be roughly summarized as such. The size is equivalent to a car, there is no joystick, no suspension device, and the flight height is about 10, 000 meters.
But this information does not yet answer basic questions, such as what exactly the object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is performing.
At present, many online analysis and speculation suggest that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It probably came from China, like the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America on some sort of mission in different locations.
Others have linked this "object" in Alaska to "unidentified flying objects" ( UFO) .
Former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer tweeted on Friday, "I wish this' Unidentified flying object 'was also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO."
"The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth starting an interstellar conflict, " Major said.
Major's tweet came shortly after Bryant confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said Major was not alone in suspecting the object was a UFO.
Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, criticized the administration's cover-up last month and asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence ( DNI) to release a report on "unidentified flying objects."
I can't believe Amazon's customer service attitude.
I guess few people see it here, but I have to say a little bit about it.
This dress was a zippered hoodie when we bought it, and in the end it was a short-sleeved one for me.
Immediately after receiving the clothes, I got in touch with Amazon customer service. At that time, I confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I asked for a replacement, and the customer service said to solve it. Then I immediately saw that the product name changed to short sleeves. It turned out that the link I bought was removed from the shelves.
Then the customer service notified either to retain a certain amount of compensation for the goods or to return the goods.
So that's how Amazon handles it.
It's really hard to believe that the wrong clothes are not my problem. As a consumer, I asked for the goods I should get, and I didn't make any exaggerated requests. Amazon changed its name and said it had no inventory.
This is my first long review and hopefully it won't be my last.
An incomprehensible sleeve.
It is said to be cowhide, and it is indeed relatively hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the local area, and it is not clear whether it is genuine leather. In addition, the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible. Usually the sleeves of the jacket are longer than the clothes. Some, but usually only 1-2 cm. This dress is 5 cm long, and the arms should naturally droop at the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and returns are easy.
But I really don't know when to refund the money.
The workmanship of the clothes is good, because the version is small, so I have to return the goods, but after returning the goods, more than a week has passed, and I have not received a refund yet.
And the buyer has to contact Quanfeng Express, whose integrity is not very good, which is the worst shopping since buying Amazon items.
But the store is still good, actively cooperating with the courier to urge the timely refund, but the real work of Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating, procrastinating for about half a month before refunding, this kind of partner is to drag Amazon's hind legs, poor work efficiency, no sense of service, no service, but the work of Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating, procrastinating for about half a month. This kind of partner is to drag Amazon's hind legs, poor work efficiency, no sense of service, no service, no service, but not the sense of service, this kind of partner is going to be able to hold back, poor work and no sense of service, but the work of the full peak express is not good.
It is more suitable for young people.
99 seconds to kill.
The workmanship, color and feel of the wool pants are good, the softness/thickness is moderate, and there is no kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the version is thin and more suitable for young people.
3XL, with a flat waist circumference of 2 feet 5 and a maximum stretch size of 4 feet. It is 1 foot. Wearing 79/80kg at the waistline, the waist is a bit tight.
It seems that there is no elastic band around the waist, and it is difficult to loosen the waistline.
Plus, it's uncomfortable to wear next to your body.
Very good. The color is not very bright.
I just bought it and it went up by more than 200. That's what's going on.
The first time Amazon used the cooperation of bad delivery every day, the first delivery was not at home, and then took the initiative to make an appointment with the courier for two delivery times, the courier did not deliver, and then directly returned to me, this damn courier has no integrity, strongly recommend not to use that bad delivery every day. It is strongly recommended not to use that bad delivery every day again.
This time, I also returned a T-shirt, and the price increased by more than 100 yuan.
Amazon's self operated products should not appear like this.
When the product is on sale, the price is not low, and the reviews are also very good products.
When I actually received the product, I was stunned. The surface of the product was worn in a large area, and there was wear in many other places. It was either a defective product or an old product. Later, the picture above showed that it was old.
I applied for a return, and when the manufacturer saw the picture, they said it was caused by transportation. Isn't this nonsense?
How can the interior of a commodity be worn?
There are only two possibilities, either defective and old, or I deliberately damaged the product and took it back.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the goods, but in terms of my credit history of shopping on Amazon, I think such goods should not appear in Amazon's own products. Customers choose Amazon's own products to trust, customerwin, wewin. Customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone will work together to improve, thank you, thank you!
I use this product less than a year, there are two E2, I do not know how to deal with it, I do not know how to deal with it.
I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, red E2 often appeared in the two groups on the right side of the receiver. It should be a problem with the transmitter module. This is not consistent with the continuous work of the transmitter module mentioned on the Amazon website. It can not find after-sales service on the Amazon website. I don't know what to do now. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know what to do.
It's okay.
The first purchase was bad.
Doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn, and the label on the fuselage was also broken.
And the screen is always white.
After changing, it will be fine.
The exchange was quick, a little blurry at night, and the viewing angle was not very wide, but it was enough for ordinary household use.
The disadvantage is that I don't have a card, I bought it myself, and I have bought a mobile phone from Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened. This time, there is no. When you buy a mobile phone, there is a sticker-like chapter that can be attached to the warranty card. This time, there is no sticker. This time, there is no such thing as.
I don't know if things are cheap and not available, I'm very confused.
Waiting for vendor response.
There is no mark on the package. I called the supplier directly and said that it was genuine if there was no mark. If I suspected that the leftover materials could be mailed to Johnson & Johnson for inspection, I also left the license plate number and phone number. I promised to send a text message to inform me to enter my information into the warranty card on Johnson & Johnson's official website. I haven't received a text message yet.
I received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's own products are still very reassuring.
The master who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and it was indeed good oil
Because it is the second time to buy.
So I'm still very relieved.
Express delivery is fast, packaging is not picky, with this oil, the sound of the engine drops obviously, and the sound of the engine drops significantly.
Good cost performance, it is difficult to find synthetic oil below 200.
Support the star crown, support the winning card, and effectively protect the car.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service problems ( 8c caterpillars are shipped as 8cm caterpillars) ( 8c = 14cm, 8cm = 2c) .
Admitting mistakes, but constantly passing the buck, always emphasizing that the goods are third parties and cannot bind third parties.
Order number 503-4265464-1830254
The page size options I originally purchased were 7c, 8, and 9c. At that time, I thought it was a trap. I called the Japanese-Asian Chinese customer service and clearly informed that 8 was 8c. However, when the product returned to China, I found that it was only 8cm. I think this is completely a trap deliberately set to pit Chinese people ( according to Amazon's after-sales service) . Now there is no such option on the viewing page.
Chinese customer service. Sorry for the loss, we give you two ways to go.
1. If you return the goods, the buyer will bear all the freight.
2. If you do not return the goods, we will compensate you 1, 000 yen.
( I calculate the account, shoes more than 4000 yen, counted as 200rmb, choose 1, I do not have shoes, the loss is 200 yuan in the 200 yuan.) .
Option 2, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2, 000 yen, the final loss in 150rmb customer service. We have recorded it, and we will deal with it seriously. We replied to an email the next day, saying that I do not accept mediation from Chinese customer service, and that it was over.
And I offered that. When the purchase page has confusing options such as 7c, 8, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me tell me that the commonly used codes in Japan do not come with c, similar to 140, but did you go to other caterpillar pages to see them?
Both US and Japanese codes have mixed standards.
Besides, why did you put 8cm between 7c and 9c? It's the smallest size. What do you mean by putting it there?
Chinese customer service. We provide Chinese service, but we don’ t know that you are going to ship it back to China, so we will not compensate for your shipping cost.
I don't understand this logic again. I am Japanese, and I still need Chinese customer service. China living in Japan doesn't need Chinese customer service either. Tourists to Japan don't have that kind of kung fu to make international long-distance calls. Then the question arises. Who needs to call Amazon overseas to buy Chinese phone calls, nothing more than a Japanese Tao like me.
Isn't Amazon Chinese customer service just these people who are convenient for us overseas shopping?
This purchase is not very satisfactory.
This is the second time to buy Pampers diapers from Amazon. I once bought a box when my baby was 2 months old and chose diapers imported from Europe. The first purchase experience was satisfactory. The baby used a diaper all night. It can indeed meet 12 hours without changing diapers.
But this time I bought L-size diapers, and there are 2 packs in a box packed separately. After opening it, I feel that the paper is relatively loose, which is obviously different from imported Pampers. After using it for my baby, it is OK. There is no leakage of urine and there is no sign of rash.
But by the second pack of diapers, the baby's inner thighs immediately developed a rash after starting to use them, which has not yet faded yet.
I suspect that the quality of the 2 packages in 1 box is not the same.
Should not continue to buy in the future.
Hope to attach importance to the transportation protection of parcels.
This is the worst packaging and transportation I have seen since I have been shopping online for so long. There are no protective measures at all, such as cushioning foam, wrapping cushioning layer materials, etc., nothing is possible.
Just a deformed box.
Moreover, the soft plastic box inside was packed, and the card box was pressed open and deformed.
I hope that the quality of the authentic product is guaranteed, and I will not dare to buy things from Amazon in the future.
I'd rather be half as expensive at home and have some security.
Moreover, the issue of product packaging has been commented on since 2016. Now, in 19 years, it has been the same.
It shows that Amazon does not attach importance to service feedback at all, and it is too far away from domestic JD.com and Tmall.
Nice, but with a little pity.
The color of the whole cup is my favorite, orange-red. Although my family is a male treasure, I still think orange-red and yellow are very eye-catching.
It's smaller than I thought, but it's meant to be taken out, so it's acceptable.
I took it home and tried it last night. After the bottle cap was pushed open, the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw was positive and vertical, my son always had to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this place can be improved.
It seems that it makes sense for other brands of straw cups to tilt the straw. Children's things really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large capacity.
I like that it is lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate compartments are a bit redundant for me. I don't know what to pack.
After buying it, I found that there is another brand very similar on the overseas purchase of Meiya. It is less than 200 yuan.
Fake goods, fake ones are particularly powerful.
Amazon sells counterfeit goods, and I am also convinced.
The customer service said that it cannot be returned because it was used. How can I know if it's a fake if I don't use it?
Because of trust, so sad, after all, is to wipe the face of supplies, really go to the physical store to buy it, recognize the valuable point.
Because it is a second kill, I did not read the comments. I have submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's defend our rights together.
It broke.
Fake goods.
In short, tragedy.
When using the second piece, the pores were fine, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal, because I hadn't used this one before, and then I couldn't stand it when I put it on my face. The smell was very punchy and indescribable. I smoked to the point of coughing out immediately. My eyes were also very painful and tears flowed. I immediately took it off and washed my face.
Do not believe in evil and opened a piece of the same, not so heavy taste, now is applying to the paint is now applied.
In retrospect, it smells like shoddy perm water in a hair salon.
It's really unimaginable that Amazon's own skin care products will have to be avoided from now on.
Profiteers.
At the time of purchase, the activity page said that the "Complete Works of the Three-Body Problem" would be given as a gift for 99 yuan. When I received the goods, I didn't have this gift. I called the customer service and said that I would show them the screenshots of the event at that time. The question is who bought things and saved the screenshots of the webpage. You also need customers to provide you with the activities you have done yourself. Buyers should keep an eye on it next time and save evidence.
Feel after use.
The first time I bought something on Amazon, I felt a few points respectively. Let's talk about the feeling of using up the product first. The first thing is really painless and there is no stimulating taste. Generally speaking, it is very good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, it will fall off after wiping it off, but there will be a small amount of hair residue on it. You can't see it without looking at it in detail, so it's generally good. As for using it once after that, you have to continue to observe it. If you continue to use it, you will know that you will know that if you continue to use it.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second order was placed from the 27th and received on the 12th for a total of 15 days, that is, half a month. Amazon's delivery staff also had a good service attitude.
Third, don't believe Amazon's Black Friday. If you place an order on Friday and wait for 2 days, it will be nearly 12 yuan cheaper, that is, I bought it for more than 170 yuan ( plus freight and so on) . There is a feeling of raising the price when engaging in activities.
What did the customer service say about price fluctuations? I have been following the price for more than 10 days, and it's just like this. The fluctuation is not big.
Affordable, Japanese origin, with Chinese labels, with particles, absolute repurchase.
There are particles in the paste, the refreshing feeling is just right, the teeth are smooth after use, which is much stronger than a second-hand Dongqiang, where it is said that it is imported, but many things do not have Chinese labels, I do not know from where wholesale. I do not know where wholesale.
In the future, as long as Amazon has it, it will never go to second-hand East again.
Give me a suggestion, why can't I print orders on Amazon's app sometimes? I hope to improve some applications and do better and better.
Excellence has been getting worse and worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all.
Garbage Excellence Special delivery time 19:00-22:00 when placing an order regardless of customer needs.
Because there are elderly people at home who are inconvenient to stay in bed after surgery, it is only convenient to receive the mail at night.
As a result, it was delivered directly to the door at 12 noon, and it was not told in advance by phone.
If the delivery time is whatever time your courier wants, why pretend to make a time for customers to choose.
If your own logistics can not guarantee the service, then simply do not do e-commerce.
Let an old man with 3 wounds on his body get out of bed and open the door to collect the express delivery, and he has to find change to pay for it.
Clearly there is a contact number on the order.
From the beginning to the end, no one called to give an explanation.
Joyo.com's so-called complaint customer service is a bunch of outsiders pretending to be there, perfunctory about your complaint and then giving you a so-called reply.
No change or compensation will be made.
Before also encountered this kind of problem similar to the wrong delivery time also put up with, but this time can not stand, too much points, too much, too much.
After the pre-sale of the new book arrived, the cover and back cover were reversed, so there was an obvious quality problem, so I closed my eyes and sent the book to the customer like this.
Leave a bad review and no one will contact you if you leave it on.
Excellence has been getting worse and worse over the years, and there is no service quality at all.
Won't spend another dime on excellence.
Image quality is simply unacceptable.
As a title like "Ancient Atlas", the selection, typesetting, and printing of pictures in this book are really unacceptable. Some pictures even have mosaics, which are too blurry to be recognized.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is illustrated in small format, it should be worthy of the magnificent medieval literature left by the ancestors in the catalogue.
( Moreover, many pictures can get clear original documents from relevant industry resources.) What is the difference between using such pictures to piece together books and not using pictures?
I feel sorry for such a scholarly spirit.
The text is not evaluated, and the Fang family has their own distinctions.
Overall 2 stars.
When I read this book in the second year of high school, I just read and played with boredom. I feel that I should not indulge in such a book. After all, the online articles of the starting point were not very attractive to me in the past.
Then it just closes the window.   It fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively relaxed and pleasant. When Ye Xiu was still in the online game in the first part, even the intrigue between the guilds was often caused by the blood of God Ye, which was not heavy at all.
As for the part of the game, I wrote a little sadness about the change of times and the alternation of old and new ( maybe I am sentimental) .
Reading the whole book took me a lot of study time in the second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
Full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very amazing, some characters are only occasionally brought, but also leave a deep impact on people, such as Ye Xiuhuang Shaotian Su Mucheng, who is described more emphatically, has a large number of fans, while characters not in the writing center, such as Jiang Botao Chu Yunxiu, are also very popular. In an e-sports cool article, people can't find a character that is extremely annoying. This is a full-time success in character description.
On the emotional line, there is no such thing as the 30 million beauties in the harem that are criticized by ordinary online articles or rotten problems. Everyone's feelings in the full text have one thing in common, that is, they like the game of glory, and most of them want to win fair and square.
Small measurements have no big conspiracy, everyone looks so simple and cute.
This may also be why there are no annoying roles full-time.
Full-time IP is very large, also thanks to this.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online articles, full-time is a good book.
How much he will really provide people with some blood, a little touched a little bit.
In April this year, full-time anime will be made.
In fact, I have been wanting to buy this set of books for a long time, because my wallet is never thick enough, and then when I wanted to buy it, I found that fakes are rampant on tb. In fact, full-time recently released another version. I really like the cover picture, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I read it on Amazon and bought a set at once. I bought a set at once.
Next, let's briefly talk about the situation of the goods.
● The plastic seal of the fourth book is not available, but the book is a new one.
● The seventeenth book plastic seal is in but was opened, the texture of the book is also very strange feeling that there is no other hardness.
● The 23rd book is the same as the 17th book, but it is also harder than the 17th book, but it is very old.
● Individual books have different publishers as if 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, different from other books.
● As a whole, I am quite satisfied. 24 books are a large box, which is very satisfying.
The lonely little lion was a lonely lion.
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner". As a result, there were still a lot of words.
I read it three times before I finished reading it to the children, a little lion who can shoot, a little lion who loves to eat fruit juice soft candy.
When I saw the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urbanites can't accept the arrangement of being eaten by animals.
Seeing that in the end, this little lion who succeeded in human society lost himself, he was no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human being.
In the end, there was only the back of the little lion. I don't know where he went.
Perhaps many years later, the image of this little lion will remain in the impression of the grown-up children, and it will be remembered inadvertently one day, which may touch or inspire her.
Cost-effective portfolio.
1. I didn't know TASCHEN before. I bought a lot of their books recently. The reason is that they are too tough, whether it is the topic selection or the production itself.
This work has been published in three versions, the largest version and the Michelangelo complete works, are close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide. The middle version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide. This edition is the smallest, and it comes with a two-volume book edition with a book box.
Personally, I think it's acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two books. As a paperback book, it's better to read it. Second, unlike Michelangelo's Complete Works, paintings account for the main body. Leonardo da Vinci's black-and-white manuscript accounts for the majority. For readers with limited budgets and non-art majors, this edition is the highest cost-effective for appreciating paintings and manuscripts. The highest cost-effectiveness of appreciation works and manuscripts is the highest.
2. The explanation of the painting part is great, including composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background ( such as the Last Supper), but I don't know whether it's the printing or the size of the book. Some shaded parts are too deep to see the details. It's a pity that they can't see the details.
3. Compared with Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.
The former is already a genius, while the latter has a wide range of range and high achievements, which is not enough to describe as a genius.
If you had only seen half of Leonardo da Vinci's paintings before, you would have no language after reading the manuscript.
Rubbish, whoever buys it regrets it.
Never give bad reviews, this sincere garbage, bought a waste of money God horse, give a reason to give a reason.
1. Travel time is not accurate, suddenly it becomes January 1st, time returns to zero.
2 Inferior belts, not silicone, with wrist allergic blistering.
3. Often unable to connect to the phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection does not show up, time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. other
Logistics is too slow.
It shows that it arrived on October 16th, but it was only received on the 21st. Bad review.
The delivery is too bad. Shopping on Amazon is already slow. I didn't expect it to be so slow.
Overall satisfaction.
At first, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was okay. There was an inflatable bag inside. The camera had the same three codes. It could also be registered on the official website. The number of shutters was 0, and the rest could only wait for time to be checked.
The delivery speed is quite fast. I would like to complain about the courier here. The valuables are placed in the concierge and go very fast. I can't open the box for inspection in front of him. I am really speechless about this.
The merchant did it for the sake of the customer before shipping:)
The merchant is more responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, and really thinks about the customer for the sake of the customer.
Shipping speed is also fast.
The diamond film is also quite suitable and effective when applied.
The battery is not fully charged.
The machine is really good. I would like to ask why it is not fully charged from the first time it is charged. The charging indicator is always red.
At present, the official feedback channel of Amazon cannot be found, so feedback can only be found in the product evaluation.
1. On March 29th, I purchased the book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, indicating that it will be pushed to the device on March 31st. At this time, the book cannot be previewed on Amazon's official website ( because it has not yet been released) .
2 The content of the book pushed to the device on March 31 is blank, only stay tuned, and the price of the electronic version of the book on Amazon has been reduced to 18 yuan.
3. Over the past two days, repeated attempts to delete the downloaded blank book on the device and synchronize it again have failed to obtain the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" containing the actual content, but Amazon's official website has been able to preview the book.
At present, I have a few thoughts.
1. The issue of price is actually not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank book on the kindle with a book with actual content, instead of downloading it forever and saying "stay tuned" are all "stay tuned".
2 Pre-ordered books should not be bought again in the future, after all, in case of a jump, and then download a book with empty content, the procedure looks very complicated.
3. I hope that Amazon can provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues. When you have doubts about the download or use of e-books, you can have local feedback ( work orders and online customer service are OK, you can refer to how Microsoft's official mall does it) .
Not very recommended reading.
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it. Write something from memory and feel it after reading it.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as a collection of fragments of life about love.
The tone of this book is extremely plain, as plain as boiled water, the pursuit of simplicity of words and sentences to the extreme, and the plot is like a summer afternoon street, quiet and plain.
Each short story is a silhouette of a short period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no endings.
Finally collected together, titled What We Talk About When We Talk About Love,
I think this collection of novels, as well as its title, is like a kind of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the joys and sorrows on the stage, the sea is dry and the rocks are rotten in urban legends, and it is not just the glue of you and me. Love is not only the above nor should it be represented by the above. Love is also a plain life like water, boring day after day, but also the helplessness of life, the escape of reality, and the loss of the future at a loss.
As you read this book, your mind may recall the quarreling couple next to you, the dull marriages of people you know, and unhappy relationships.
That's why I don't recommend reading it, from an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are dull, and unless your life is rough or as sweet as living in a candy castle, you have to read it with the feeling of being surprised and bored or boring.
From the depth of thought, the daily plot does not brighten one's eyes or expand one's thinking and vision ( this is different from Márquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the short clips do not explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love.
The breakdown of the protagonist's marriage comes from those reasons.
So I don't recommend reading this book. It doesn't make much sense to read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than storyline, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.
Suitable for rough reading, not close reading.
The logic of this book is good, but the content is not full enough.
It explains what and why many sales theories are, but it is weak in terms of how to do it. It only points out the direction but does not give specific practices.
Plus, the book feels like a patchwork.
For example, there are both domestic and foreign; there are well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknown people.
I don't know if the story is compiled for example, but it will be more convincing to cite some cases experienced by the author himself.
Change the title of the customer or customer.
The title is still the customer, the text becomes the customer, the text becomes the customer.
There are also typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering in e-books.
In short, this book is a good choice as an introduction to theory, but it is not suitable for people who are already engaged in sales work and want to improve their sales level.
A quick understanding of the guide to Internet finance.
This book is very shallow, it can be said that it is only an introductory course, which can help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig deep yourself.
And the book was written earlier, and later Alipay WeChat borrowed subsidies to cultivate user habits has not been mentioned. Today's third-party payment share is not so small as mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people go out to eat with just a mobile phone. Merchants have also abandoned UnionPay because of the high flow of banks.
But I am still very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, so he can write such easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write tall and empty, but the difficulty is that it's easy to understand in the world.
Appreciate you and want you to know more.
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not their salary, but whether they are valued and appreciated enough in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, after people's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent thing is to meet their psychological needs-hope to be understood, affirmed and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are "love you in the heart is difficult to open", even if they have love, gratitude and appreciation, they will not say it in their hearts.
In this book, the author elaborates on five languages of appreciation. words of affirmation, meticulous moments, acts of service, pleasing gifts, physical contact, physical contact.
I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can appreciate and appreciate the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues, from the bottom of your heart anytime, anywhere.
In fact, the closer people are, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, so that our lives will become better.
Learn to appreciate that enterprises can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thank you to the translator for bringing us wonderful foreign ideas and the world.
Due to Chinese and Western cultural backgrounds and other reasons, there will be more or less differences between languages. If you have the opportunity to see the author's original version, I believe you will gain more.
Thanks again to the authors, translators and editors for their hard work and hard work.
Suspected shoddy goods, please Amazon strict review.
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, and it is not even as good as the roadside stall products. There is no weight, no bar code, and the ten-bag packaging is also loose. It is not a characteristic of qualified products at all. This is Amazon's worst shopping experience and has applied for a return. It's all about quality. It is recommended that merchants keep their eyes open and refuse inferior goods. Supplementary. I also bought Xinxiangyin, 23 yuan/10 rolls in the supermarket, and added several comparative photos to further verify the authenticity of the product. In order to give consumers a clearer reference and avoid economic losses and further unhappy mood.
Again, I hope that Amazon can be meticulous and strictly control the source of goods.
There is a gap between mediocre products and expectations.
Advantages.
1. Big brand, cheap price.
Advantage 2 The motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are OK to use, but there is a gap between them and my expectations.
Disadvantages
1. There is no indicator light for charging, which saves you the most basic power indicator. It is estimated that customers who buy products for 300 yuan, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, are also alms and have no respect.
2 There is a strong odor when charging, even if it is only charged for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of plastic burning.
The office tried it out for 1 day, and the whole house smelled like plastic.
Compared with the Philips PHILIPS at the same price I have used before, although there is an extra knife head, the quality of Panasonic's product is really sorry for consumers.
Small package.
When I received the express delivery, I saw that the e-commerce version had fallen into the pit again. It was smaller than the supermarket. It should be M, which is different from the picture packaging above the product introduction. The so-called new version, right?
The three stars blame themselves for not seeing the product specifications clearly. I have no problem with you selling the M-size e-commerce version. What does it mean that your product is not the right version?
E-commerce routines are deep, so I still go to the supermarket to buy them when I have time.
just sauce purple
I don’ t like the taste.
Children don't like the taste of toothpaste very much. They say it spicy every time. Perhaps it is more appropriate to use other words to describe it. For the time being, only this word is in the child's vocabulary.
I bought it during the event and it was very cheap, so I'm sorry to give it a bad review. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Genuine yo well packaged.
The packaging is very complete, with an inflatable bag added inside. There are no online reviews, only the appearance of a bare product.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle, as described in the picture, and the express delivery is also very fast, and it arrived the next day after taking the photo.
It's authentic, but it's out of stock. I don't know when it will be on the shelves again.
A bad shopping experience.
I placed the order on Black Friday, but I waited for a long time and didn't receive it. When I checked later, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues around me and said that they didn't help sign for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but said that the sender could only initiate the inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. I finally figured out that the courier was mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several turnarounds, I finally got the courier back. The outer packaging has been removed, and the goods are still complete. I don't know if they have been used. In short, it's very bad.
Wrong picture.
I thought I could receive headphones like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to receive headphones like Figure 2. Even if the pictures are inconsistent, what does it mean that the sound size of the left and right headphones is different? What does it mean?
Although the names are all the same, I hope everyone can pay attention to them carefully. In addition, I would like to ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct picture in time. Thank you very much.
The operating system is generally like the operating system.
Used for a period of time, the overall picture is OK, do not feel any difference, that is, the system makes people look tangled, boot time is obviously a little slow, can not be set up well, and then the software does not need to be commented on, the response speed that is more general, and colleagues compared to the home that is not an order of magnitude. Compared with colleagues, it is not an order of magnitude.
Look at the comments that very humanized design, I did not find where humanized, remote control this commonly used up and down, return key design position is really not complimentary.
So, let's use it as a TV, plus a TV box or something like that.
The price reduction is too great.
The price reduction is too strong, more than 100 are now 99!
I have accumulated a lot of unevaluated orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the evaluation content.
If I use this paragraph to evaluate, it means that this product has at least 85 points or more.
For poorer products, I will never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews, so that other consumers will use them as a reference when buying, and merchants will therefore improve the quality of the goods.
Low price and good line, this is enough if you don't have a fever.
Such a cheap line, but it should be up to the hdmi certification standard, personally compared to the domestic Akihabara these bullshit things ( the price is twice as expensive), the line body is strong, but also relatively soft, 7 meters transmission without noise, after the low-priced line identified times and times think about the low-priced line in the future.
Things are OK, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, I found that the order was placed incorrectly, but the cancellation of the order cannot be cancelled. The wrong link has been displayed on the webpage to contact the online customer service. I can't get in touch with it.
After the goods arrived, the delivery man called me. I said I didn't want it anymore. If I wanted to cancel the order, I didn't cancel it successfully. The delivery man took it back and said to sign for it first and let me apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I told the food category that once I signed for it, I couldn't return it. I couldn't call Amazon customer service. The same is true. I signed for it and couldn't return it.
I have bought items that cannot be returned under the policy in Jingdong and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc., and contacted customer service to return them. Moreover, after Jingdong's diapers were opened, the smell was too big. Contact customer service to return them. If you don't get to Amazon, you won't be able to return them.
Rules are dead, people are alive, contact your customer service, how to deal with it.
Tell me that either I accept it myself or let the delivery man buy it himself. It is not easy for the delivery man to send him. Why should I let him pay for something that he didn't buy himself? It's not what he bought.
OK, I won't return it either. I'll take it myself, but I have to give your service 1 point.
Advise everyone not to spend money in vain.
First of all, I am looking forward to buying it. I think the Dole brand should not be so bad. After receiving it, I think the packaging is OK and the size is not bad, but there is a box that is basically soft. It cannot be seen from the outside. I want to feel it. There is no taste at all in my mouth. It is faint and tasteless. If you bite open the pulp, it is dark yellow or it is broken. If you sell it with good or bad reference, you can eat less than one-third of it. I advise everyone not to buy it, and it is not cheap. The quality is too cheap.
Eat a pit and gain wisdom, and never buy fruit in e-commerce again in the future.
Where is the product anti-counterfeiting label?
The sharp dent in the bottom corner of the bottle should have been caused by a strong impact. From the outer packaging bag, the degree of ravage is worrying. After all, the food packaging is too simple, and it is still internationally purchased. I haven't seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting signs. It is very easy to open the bottle. The key is that a layer of honey in the lid comes out directly from inside. There is almost no adhesion when there is an opening. Are all foreign products like this?
Born in China, I don't understand a little bit.
It should be authentic, right?
And when I took the picture, I was prompted to arrive on the 20th. This was received on the 14th. I bought it overseas for the first time here. I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is all normal.
Delivery service needs to be improved.
I bought a total of 5 delivery vouchers. When I was picking up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 vouchers for the first time, but only 2 vouchers were sent to me. After communication with many parties, it was confirmed that it was a missed voucher. After agreeing, it needed to be reissued. The second appointment, just in time for the rest day, the website and WeChat are not prompted to make an appointment on a working day, causing unnecessary panic. It is recommended to improve in the future.
Nice shopping.
Things are well received.
I still believe in Amazon's self-operated things. Now it is very convenient to buy them overseas. The logistics time to buy them back from abroad is only a few days longer than in China. I have to say that Amazon's customs clearance ability to buy them overseas is still very strong, which is much faster than transshipment. So now a lot of things are bought overseas on buying them. It is much faster than buying them overseas now.
I hope the quality and price of domestic goods can be better. Many things are domestically produced, but it is cheaper to go out and buy them back than in China. I hope to improve.
Garbage.
Seeing such a package, I would like to ask everyone: I don't think it's roadside garbage.
A plastic fragile package is sent from the so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is such a package responsible?
I think this kind of packaging is the same as packing garbage. When I buy this product, the packaging is extremely simple and there are no measures to prevent damage. I just pack it in a simple plastic bag. After I get it, the package is completely deformed. The items inside are also damaged.
If I just come across one like this, I accept it, and I bought a few like this. I ask Amazon customer service, and the customer service says it can be refunded, but the freight is paid in advance, and then the freight is returned to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me ask, I pay the freight in cash, and you give me a gift card back. This means that I want to buy your gift card by myself, and I have to mail the product to the German warehouse by myself. This is not about buying a product to suffer from the crime.
And I have been telling the customer service that who is responsible for such a problem, but the customer service does not say a word that it is their responsibility, and they dare not even take responsibility for half a sentence. What guarantee is there for such after-sales service? Bottom line: admit defeat. But I estimate that Amazon will not give me the opportunity to publish this review, directly back to delete.
The quality is very good 5 stars, and the logistics is poor.
1. The quality is very good, it is a flash sale, the price is moderate, and it is worth the money.
2. Strong, sufficient material, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.
3. Logistics is a flaw. The order placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.
4. If Amazon did not indicate that the expected arrival time is February 7th, I may be very satisfied.
5, but marking the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user is very uncomfortable.
6. If you are not sure of making a promise, please do not make a promise.
7. In fact, I am very concerned about the promises made by the merchants.
8, so I scored low.
The gold thread will fade.
The effect is still there, but whether the feeling is obvious depends on the individual, or the psychological effect.
One thing that is not very good is the gold thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in fact, the gold thread will fade and be placed on the car. If you hold it a few times, there will be some gold dust on your hands and on the car. Some gold dust on the hand and on the car.
I hope the product can be improved.
This square, there is no decorative effect, do not engage in gold thread on it, fall off in the car dirty car is also troublesome.
The items are in good condition and the speed is OK. They are divided into 2 packages and packaged differently.
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but it is 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, the packaging is not the same, obviously a shock too much, thick cardboard attached, sealed layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also easy to dismantle, one is like a domestic express box, put a few buffer airbags even if it is a matter, feel a little perfunctory, feel a little perfunctory, a little perfunctory, a little perfunctory, a little too shockproof, thick cardboard attached, sealed layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also convenient to dismantle, a little like a domestic express box, put a few buffer airbags, feel a little perfunctory, a little perfunctory, a little perfunctory, feel a little perfunctory, a little perfun
Airland mattress is really good heart.
34CM mattress is not generally thick, do not sleep directly on the mattress can be sleeping on the mattress.
The quality is very good. Whether it is the front or the back, it is quite soft. Sleeping is very comfortable. Lying on it, I fell asleep quickly.
After receiving the mattress, there were some stains in two places due to violent express delivery. Yalan customer service was very responsible and efficient to solve the problem.
It's not a self-operated product. Amazon is shameless and shameless.
The page is clearly marked as self-operated. In fact, it is delivered by the supplier. After-sales is the responsibility of the supplier. If there is a problem, contact the supplier yourself.
Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, can not cancel. If you want to return or exchange goods, you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon. Sorry, no one cares about you. You need to contact the supplier to return the goods by yourself.
What kind of self-operated product is this Nima?
Goods are not Amazon delivery, after-sales Amazon does not bear, customer service actually said "I help you contact the supplier", but also claimed to be self-operated, too shameless, naked shameless, naked fraud to consumers.
A gloomy experience.
The filter element purchased online from another store before has a good filtering effect, and there is no scale after one or two more days after the end of 28 days.
Since the quality of the things purchased on Amazon all the time can be, this time I think about buying here, the first time I buy a filter element on Amazon, I don't feel very good, not only began to have scale early, but also the filter element has been used until the 28th day, there will be suspended small black toner, I really don't know whether to continue to use it, or just throw it away. It's very depressing ~ very depressing~ to throw it away.
Not as good as expected.
Compared with the plugboards I have used in the past, the external workmanship is average, and the interior is not disassembled. I hope that as described by the store, from the perspective of ease of use, there is a lack of display on whether each independent unit is powered on or not.
The packaging is damaged. Wait for time to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is badly damaged, and the box inside seems to be new, but the instruction manual does not seem to be new. It was only renovated in September, and the stock is in stock. I hope it will not be broken by then. Please explain why several customers mentioned that the packaging was damaged, but you can rest easy. Thank you, thank you.
Overall good, a little problem.
The first time I bought a water filter kettle, I read several evaluation articles and felt that LAICA was more cost-effective, so I chose this one. I received the goods and installed the filter element according to the instructions. I tried it, and it felt good overall, but when pouring water, it seemed that the raw water would mix with the treated water from the spout ( the raw water tank was not tightly sealed) .
When using it, be sure to wait until all the water is filtered before pouring it out.
The picture is incomplete.
The picture does not show the details of the side, the details of the side are not consistent with the style of the main body, there is a big difference, this is one of them. This bead is made in Thailand, and there is no indication of origin. This is the second place. No indication of texture, this is the three. When I bought it in the UK, it was clear that there were boxes for each item, there was only a simple plastic bag, and there was no product logo on the beads, and I couldn't tell if it was real or fake. How could I tell whether it was real or not?
Be cautious when buying, especially when buying things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service sucks.
The order placed two days ago was found to have dropped by 40 yuan when I received it today. It took me a lot of time to find the customer service. The customer service said that they could not make up the difference. They could buy it again and return it.
This kind of customer experience and service is really 10, 000 times worse than that of a certain treasure.
Not bad, as a novice, it's worth getting started.
The appearance is passable, and there is no comparison with the best King Kong. I have seen the price in the mall before, at least several hundred. This is my first time playing King Kong. It's okay to play King Kong.
Things are good.
The things are really good. I sent them to my girlfriend, but I was a little unhappy when I was not in Canada at noon. The logistics company directly put the mail in the treasure and did not send me a verification text message for pickup. I ran twice.
But the baby is really good.
It's worth buying.
The little monkey is cute. Amazon offers great discounts. Zhou Shengsheng's official website ships directly. He placed an order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon. It's really fast.
Postal couriers are also very responsible.
PLEAAE
A customer's confession.
1 After receiving such defective products, Amazon customer service tells you not to worry, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that the problem will be dealt with by a specialist, and he will inform you of the result.
You can never take the initiative to contact this commissioner, nor do you know her job number, nor do you have a direct contact number, that is, you can not contact her, only she contacts you, only she contacts you.
3 Tragically, after waiting for nearly 3 days, the commissioner contacted me. I left my phone for a while and did not receive a call from the commissioner.
I waited for 2 hours without waiting for the call from the specialist. During this period, I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and sent an email to the customer service to ask her to call me back.
4 Nearly 3 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon will do with the defective coffee machine I received.
5 There is no problem with Amazon's products in the United States. Overseas shopping is a good way of shopping, but it is far worse than the service of Meiya.
For me, I can only continue to wait.
The bottom is uneven.
Because the comments are very good, all of them are looking forward to this pot, and they like it very much when they get it, which is very lightweight, but when they boil the pot, they find the problem. The bottom of the pot is not flat, the middle protrudes, the periphery is concave, and the oil runs to the periphery. The specially bought large fat meat in the pot is fried so much oil that it can't cover the central area. It is pastey, and the pot can't be boiled. It is estimated that such a structure cannot cook normally. It is estimated that such a structure cannot cook normally.
I don't know if I was unlucky enough to get a pot with an uneven foundation. Fortunately, Amazon provides a one-month return service, so I returned it decisively.
I brushed the pot clean and returned it, and I was busy for a long time in vain.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve.
This is a product with a very simple design style.
In the shape of the cube, the designer treats the top into a slightly curved surface.
It's supposed to be very smooth lines.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two parts at the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the top cover of the water box.
The curvature of the top cover is actually inconsistent with the curvature of the control panel, and after splicing, there is a height difference of about 2mm max.
Although it looks like a very small gap.
But it can be said that the whole sense of design is destroyed.
I feel a little sorry for the product designer.
It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet capable of creating such a level of product.
( Of course, I can't ask too much for the after-sales lady's feedback, but when I heard the after-sales lady say that all individuals of this product are like this, not only the one I bought has a problem, her disapproval and truthful heavy burden made me understand that I can't ask too much for beauty.) On July 7, 2019, the water pump failed and the water output was small. It has been repaired for the second time. It broke down again two weeks after the first repair.
Good deal after the discount, Amazon fake discount is very sad.
The baby is born a week to buy, insulation is super strong, the heat preservation is super strong.
There is no trace of heat on the outside of the pot, that is, it can effectively protect the temperature from being scalded.
The air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature after a night.
Amazon said that the anniversary event 320 big discounts, and later found that everyone 249, 289, 299 have, an instant feeling of being cheated, but to go to the supermarket compared it is still much more cost-effective than all kinds of miscellaneous brands at the same price. You can carry it with you when you go out in the future.
Vitamix 6300 Vitamix.
I have been watching for a long time. I see that Meiya 6300 is discounted, and Central Asia buys the same price overseas. Hurry up and start.
The order was placed on September 2nd, and the goods were expected to arrive on the 21st. As a result, they arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days ahead of schedule. The speed is really fast.
The packing box is not big, the original packaging of Vitamix is used directly, and Amazon is not afraid of breaking it across the ocean.
The machine looks quite new and has complete accessories, but the cup shakes so badly on the base that I am afraid that the boot cup will fly out directly.
I asked a friend who has 5200, and it seems that his description is not as loose as mine.
The random recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I can't find the Chinese version online. This is a hassle.
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer. It is estimated that it will arrive in 3 days. Then I will toss it well.
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
It's not a tuba at all.
Second Totes, 1 This one doesn't have an umbrella cover 2. The material of the umbrella handle is 3 in general. Obviously writing Large, it is actually a convenient umbrella for one person. It is estimated that two people use it to choke enough.
On the contrary, the one I bought in Meiya before can be used by three people without pressure.
Doesn't feel good.
First of all, the box is not very strong, and it will be deformed if you press it. Secondly, the design of the back can not prevent ABS scratches on the box surface when it is laid flat. Thirdly, the inside of the box is a piece of cloth wrapped and highlighted by the pull rod.  Wait, all kinds of dissatisfaction, finally the zipper is a little rough, a little rough.
PS. The wheels feel really good.
It can also be used.
Advantages. This backpack is sophisticated and looks durable.
Disadvantages The QR code on the card cannot be scanned ( what the fuck), 15 times. The 6 inch laptop won't fit ( can it be a little longer), this backpack zipper can be locked, but it doesn't prepare a lock for the buyer, it is not said that the service is supreme.
Overall okay, I don't know if it's genuine leather or not.
The overall feeling is ok. I don't know if it's genuine leather, so I can't comment blindly.
Can be loaded A4 format documents, loaded 80 pages thick, but too thick and hard box-shaped objects ( can not be deformed) is estimated to be unable to fit.
The bag is very soft, the inner bag separation is also more humane, or quite good.
It's just that there is a small trachoma at the bottom of the one I got. I don't know if it's my bad character or not.
I was too lazy to toss and exchange goods back and forth, so I couldn't bear it.
Overall, four stars are worth it.
ForRoyal is popular all over the world with camera straps and SLR straps.
This strap is designed to be more scientific, hanging shoulders, practical, and the chest is fixed and protected with soft materials, unlike other fast shooters who use screws to fix the bottom of the camera, and it is also very convenient to take off the camera.
Garbage after sale.
The piano I bought a month and a half ago was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, I was given an after-sales phone number. After many communications, the part has not been received yet. What is the efficiency of this?
It is estimated that it will be more troublesome to repair if there is a problem after that. Friends who are looking forward to good after-sales service should take a detour. It is too much trouble to repair.
There are small flaws, the sound is good, the sound is good.
The headstock is defective, one corner is missing, it feels like a defective product, and there are no gifts, but the price is already good, and the sound of the piano is also good.
Not bad, the first noodle order is good.
It took a long time, except for the bass, which was not good in general, except for the bass.
It's just that the workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
When I bought it for the first time, there was something wrong with it, all the lights were flashing and it didn't work.
I asked for an exchange. As a result, the goods have been in Shanghai for three days, and they have not been delivered yet.
I didn't even answer the phone to the delivery guy.
The courier company said they only have that contact information.
Amazon couldn't find a place to complain.
Did not ask, in the case of delayed delivery, inexplicably delayed delivery according to my request-such a text message came over.
Later on, I will talk about the transit problem.
Anyway, the extremely poor shopping experience began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
I don't think I can get it today.
The label is too sticky and not waterproof.
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not coated. And the label stickiness is very poor, it is not suitable for cable labels at all, it is very easy to fall off. Friends who buy it for cable arrangement need to pay attention to it.
The pen is okay, but the package is too simple. There is no protection in a paper box, and the box containing the pen is glued with a large piece of transparent glue. After tearing it off, the glue is all on the box.
Six hundred yuan of things are treated like this, a very disappointing shopping is very disappointing.
But the pen is fine.
Hope to improve on the packaging in the future.
If the quality is not said, when it comes to writing, it is not as good as 925-25 when it comes to writing.
First of all, praise Tiantian Express. Air parts are super fast, and the service attitude is also very good.
Have been using 925-25, very good, just received 925-85, the quality of the pen is not said, the style is also very beautiful, the reason for giving four stars is because the pen is a little heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the cap adjusts the length of the lead a little shaking, personal opinion, personal opinion, the personal opinion of the nine25-85, just received a little bit, the quality of the pen is not said, the style is also very beautiful, the pen is a little heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the pen cap adjusts the length of the lead a little bit of a shaking, personal opinion, personal opinion, the pen cap adjusts the length of the lead a little bit, personal opinion, personal opinion. The 925-25 is smoother than the 85.
So he became an Amazon loyal fan.
I bought it at a super discounted price, but the child didn't like the reading pen.
It has been opened and tried to apply for a return, but it is picked up at home for free.
That's awesome.
Returns are not recommended, but such a service is the only one in China.
I hope it will not be abused.
In the future, all the books will be moved to buy here.
Headphone bias and noise, as well as noise.
This headset is really rubbish. I don't know if it's something wrong with my ears or if this headset really isn't as good as before.
I bought a blue one from Yi two years ago. The sound quality is not bad, there is no noise, and the bass is also good. After using it for more than two years, I plan to buy another one ( urbeats) . After all, it feels good.
I saw another purple one that looked pretty good. As a result, I bought this one and opened it today. I felt something was wrong. The sound was loud and the sound was small.
At first I thought it was because of the sound effect of that song and didn't think much about it, but after listening for a long time, I realized that this problem was very serious. Not only was it biased, but the bass effect didn't sound as good as my previous one. There was also some noise. Is this the only purple one I bought that has this phenomenon? Or now the headset manufacturing process is really not working.
Pretty bad review, very disappointed.
Be sure to return it during the day tomorrow.
PS looks good.
This AV amplifier has complex settings, rough exterior workmanship, and high heat generation.
The sound should be used for a period of time before commenting.
Just started the German version of DN1080 on August 14. At first glance, the workmanship is very poor.
1. The front panel and knobs are all plastic.
2 The audio input socket and speaker output terminals on the rear panel are all very poor. Just find a 1000-2000 CD power amplifier all-in-one machine that is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, and my transformer is still dented. I had to open the box and restore it by hand. The combination of the top cover and the front panel is loose.
4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is biased towards the transformer end, which is very awkward when moving.
It feels like an entry-level SONY machine, which is made in Malaysia.
It feels much better that Sony will place the foundry in China than the pony.
5. The machine generates a lot of heat. The top cover of the two channels used to watch a movie takes about 2 hours to touch 40-50 °C by hand. I don't know if the transformer is too large and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switching power supplies are mostly used. This silly transformer is estimated to have 4KG.
Sony should have used a silent fan inside the machine to dissipate heat actively. After opening the box, only the large aluminum plate heat sink on the tube can be seen.
Small expensive.

I haven't opened it.
The battery is working.
I really want to dissect it and see what's in its belly.
Later, I thought that if I was disappointed after opening it, it would be too unfair to spend so much money. If you are satisfied after opening it, it will be difficult to install it again, and it will be uncomfortable to use it.
Forget it, even if Sony uses good batteries, let's say.
As for the detailed description of electricity, most people will feel guilty when they look at it.
I'm fine. I've worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. In addition to not understanding circuits, I'm also a half battery engineer. I can withstand it.
Overjoyed.
Before I bought it, I was really unsure. Until I opened the package, I felt very positive.
Finally, when I touched the headset cable, I felt very flexible and the quality was so good that I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and turn on the qq music.
I was amazed that the sound quality was even surround 3D stereo.
I asked in the physical communication store, about 30 or so, but it is definitely not a Pinsheng brand, it is a miscellaneous brand. Therefore, although this Pinsheng is 27 yuan, its cost performance is absolutely worth having.
Worst online shopping experience ever.
After the order was placed on September 28, the system showed that the goods had been shipped, but the goods were still not received until October 12th.
Check the Amazon order status, the seller did not provide the courier number, can not find where the order is where the order is.
So I sent an email to the seller to ask if I could provide the courier number. After two days, I did not reply.
Helplessly, I called Amazon customer service, and the customer service told the seller's mobile phone number. I called the store again. After calling a few times, the phone got through and was told that the express delivery was lost. You can send me another one immediately.
Although I was particularly angry, due to the urgent need for the computer, I didn't tell the seller much. Just send it to me immediately. Good job.
As a result, I called the next day to ask, has it been shipped?
The seller said not yet, it can only be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller said that it would be delivered after five or six in the afternoon. As a result, when I called at seven in the evening, no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again and asked if the goods had been sent out.
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said he didn't send it. He told me that if I was in a hurry, I would order from another place. If I could wait, I would send it in the afternoon.
I can't help it. It will take a long time to place an order from another place.
I can only ask the seller to deliver the goods quickly.
Finally, after countless phone calls, I received my computer on October 16th, and that was available on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, I will add comments later.
I just bought it for half a year and didn't use it a few times. Now I have bad contact. Can I repair it if I ask if it can be repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I haven't used it many times since I bought it.
Just take it with you in your business bag and use it a few times.
Recently, it was found that when the power is turned on, it is not charged. You need to hold the connection between the charger and the cable a few times with your hands to charge it.
It is suspected that the contact at the interface is poor. I don't know if it can be repaired now.
Amazon is strongly advised to stop using EMS
Five stars for goods, one star for logistics, and an average of three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon wants to send EMS, which is recognized by the industry as unreliable. Well, computers are also valuable items anyway.
After buying, the order showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days at home.
Why does it take four or five days to send from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
On the morning of the 22nd, I checked the logistics and finally arrived in Fuzhou. I was ready to receive the goods happily. As a result, without receiving any phone calls or text messages in the evening, I checked the logistics and found that it was signed at noon. It also showed that I signed for it myself.
I was instantly shocked.
lol who am I Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I doubt life, all right?
Finally, I ran to the collection point to move the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier brother reversed the two tracking numbers, but fortunately, the item is not lost, even if it is not lost.
I strongly advise Amazon not to use EMS. If Amazon uses EMS to send express in the future, I will definitely not buy it again.
The goods are not bad.
First of all, just a few days after buying it, I found that the price was reduced, bad reviews, this is not bad, cost-effective, cpu and graphics card are enough to cope with mainstream online games and a considerable number of large stand-alone machines, the heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little light leakage ( ips screen common disease), the sound quality is not very good, the hard disk is not good ( it is recommended to spend some money to add a solid state), yesterday I took it to the after-sales testing of the hardware, there is no problem, the win8 I brought with me is not a problem, the win8 I brought with me. The win8 I brought with me was good. 1. It is not very easy to use. It is recommended to upgrade to 10. The seller delivers the goods very quickly, and the answers to various inquiries are also very fast. The invoice arrived the next day after receiving the computer. It's good. Unfortunately, there are no gifts.
( By the way, when buying keyboard stickers, you must not go to a store called E Cool Digital Center in a certain treasure to buy them. The delivery is slow and the quality is poor. If there is a problem with the product, it will not be returned or exchanged. The boss is also full of foul language. Special exposure.)
Things are good, and the platform bureaucracy is still the same.
Hard disk quality is very good, cost performance is absolutely high, cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, do not rush to use and can tolerate logistics if absolutely recommend to buy.
But what I have to say is that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same. It has not improved from when I swore I would never use it a few years ago. You will never find out the actual logistics situation. The information will always be delivered in a few weeks, and you can never complain. That's how bureaucratic the platform is.
Goods received a few days, logistics information or 10 days later you will receive the goods in a few days.
Logistics is not easy to worry about.
Delivered in this way, not only the packaging is flattened, but also the packaging of electrical appliances is open. I don't know if there is any package adjustment, and I don't know if there is a switch.
FYI.
I haven't tried it yet. I have always trusted Philips. I hope the battery life will be longer than other brands.
I checked online, it may be a common problem of water ingress, and there is no warranty.
Depressed.
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it. I don't know how long it will last.
Buy someone else's opened one.
A machine with a price of more than 300 yuan and a tax of more than 100 yuan is indeed relatively high. I see that now there is more balance in the mind with a price of more than 600 yuan.
When I received it, the state of the sealing tape looked very wrong. It seemed that it had been opened. I quickly took a picture first. Sure enough, it was torn open. After opening, the cardboard inside was still damaged. I was worried that someone else had returned it. I tried it for my husband before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no electricity at all. Fortunately, there was no beard in the blade. How could I return it far away?
It is unknown whether it is easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term. As mentioned earlier, the things sent out when they are out of stock are really unreliable.
The experience is medium to high level.
Almost top-level electric, there are many modes of tooth cleaning, but few people will change different modes of brushing every day.
I haven't had any problems after using it for half a year. I brush it every day, and flush it on Monday for more than 1 Monday.
Brush head accessories are equally cheap to buy on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use. In addition to changing the colors, other seemingly compatible issues are the reasons for the overseas version.
I hope to learn Dafa.
Very cost-effective.
It has been used 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. It is very easy to use and easy to clean.
3. You can DIY haircut to save money.
In summary, a very successful purchase was made.
There are counterfeits.
Last time I bought two packages, they were actually two different versions. Originally, the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but one pack was not. It was white. As a result, the cat had diarrhea after eating it.
I'm not sure if Amazon's supply is fake or if it was switched by an employee during shipment. I'm not sure if the product is fake or if it was switched by an employee.
I will buy it again. If it is still a fake, I will hold you responsible.
It's a horizontal bar.
The Amazon picture shows a slash, but it turned out to be sent to me with a horizontal bar. Isn't this a scam?
The effect is OK.
Cats like to eat, that's the point of it.
And it does work.
Tight, narrow, hoop feet, grind the instep of feet.
Not recommended.
1. UN is the most comfortable series of clarks, but unfortunately this one is too bad.
Additional. Today, I compared the previous UN series insoles ( the shoes were thrown away and kept for use) . The material is much worse than before. The elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before. It is fake soft.
2 The instep of my instep is not high and the part of my instep is about 3 centimeters forward at the highest part of the instep.
3. Purchased three pairs of clarks overseas, only one pair is suitable.
I was so scared that I deleted all the fun from my favorites.
Try rockport later. No, we can only go to the ecco store.
Shoddy, poor quality control, poor quality control.
First of all, it is worth affirming that Prime's overseas purchase of Ups is very powerful, and the order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
Shoe size is a little larger, 25 feet long 10 feet. 5 Shot 7 Shot 7 Shot. 5W, the upper foot is a little loose, but usually like to wear a little loose, pad a pair of insoles just right, just a pair of insoles.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. One sole rubber is damaged, and the other upper has various scratches and a pinhole. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced.
I regret it a little bit.
I bought it for 280 yuan for the event. This price is quite cost-effective to buy Asics. Of course, there are lower prices in the comments.
Now let’ s talk about shoes, the advantages are good. Shoes are very light, running is quite comfortable, but also more fitting, will not be loose and collapsible, will not be loose.
The appearance is very high, but the shortcomings are also very obvious. I usually wear 40 shoes, and I bought 40 this time. 5th, the distance between the front of the shoes and the front of the shoes is about 1 thumb, but this does not affect anything.
These shoes are very "narrow", although there is still a distance in front, they feel tight.
Another point is that the shoes may not be very breathable. Now, I feel that my feet are very hot when I wear them.
Press the instep of the foot.
First of all, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard, running shoes uk7, etc. 5, EU41, the European Union. 5, shoes uk6, shoes. 5. Amazon's love step also bought a few pairs, and there has never been a problem, but this pair I refer to the comments, buy a large size uk7, after the foot because of the big size length is obviously longer, but because the insole is too thick, or the back pressure of the foot very hard, coupled with the hiking shoes are very hard, resulting in the upper foot is very uncomfortable and very uncomfortable, resulting in the upper foot is very uncomfortable.
If your feet are not particularly thin, this one is not recommended.
If you have to buy it, changing the insole can also solve the problem, but the original insole looks very advanced, and it's a pity not to use it.
A perfect shopping trip.
Very satisfied, very like, Amazon overseas purchases are genuine undoubtedly, the quality is also very good, inexpensive, buy rest assured, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very friendly and kind, deal with problems patiently and efficiently, perfect solution to worries, matching express delivery is very convenient and safe, delivery master is very considerate for customers, every time will remind you to pick up goods from the express cabinet in time, thank Amazon to provide customers with such a comfortable shopping experience for customers to provide such a comfortable shopping experience for customers. Thank you to Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience. Thank you to Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In short, our whole family loves shopping overseas on Amazon.
Absolutely bad review.
I am really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Although it has been a long time, I still have to come and spit.
I bought it in a spike in winter, less than 200, and it is useless to keep it at home for a few months.
When I was about to use it in spring, I found that I couldn't connect to the bracelet. Both device manuals expressed support for each other. Later, I found out that it should be a problem with the heart rate belt, because I found other devices and still couldn't connect to them.
I called Amazon and asked me to contact the agency. The agency asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After nearly half a month, things were sent back as they were, and even the express box was the one I used when I sent it.
No replies and no receipts and no test reports.
Can you at least tell me whether it is good or bad ah or not?
Call and ask, saying that sending it back in this way means that the equipment is fine and is good.
But why can't I connect? The agency replied. And dat is da storee of them bein' gud gurl.
It's my bad luck that I'm too lazy to be tossed around by you guys for a 200 yuan thing.
Serious goods are not on the right board.
Very wrong board.
The headband material is very good.
Much better than nike.
Breathability is also very good.
Just the hat in front of you.
Very fine.
Are you here to make fun of me?
No sunlight at all.
I don't return it because it works well as a headband.
Wear it upwards though it doesn't cover the sun.
But it's different from other headband styles.
Keep it.
The quality of the goods is good, Amazon lacks the spirit of contract, and the delivery staff is very good.
I request Saturday and Sunday delivery.
Amazon's policy does not allow delivery on Saturdays and Sundays.
As a result, I drove 200 kilometers from other places to pick up the goods.
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery man was very positive and enthusiastic.
Give a compliment.
The product, I tried it briefly and it's not bad.
But I haven't bought similar products before, so I can't compare prices.
Size logistics.
The workmanship is OK, but the logistics is too slow. The previous shoes were all DHL. This time, Apex is really.   I have bought a lot of UA in China, and the price is not low. I feel that the quality is higher than that of NIKEADIDAS.
In fact, they are all the same, okay, so overseas shopping is good.
Size. I am 176CM tall, 68KG, my shoulder width is generally 180 clothes, bought M, hem slightly longer, other wear just right, I see there is a recommended S size, figure so slim? Still like to be nervous. I think the hoodie is better loose.
Just the right size.
Chest size 99, height 184, weight 84 kg. I consulted the customer service before buying and was told that I should buy xxl. Then I read the comments and decisively bought L. After receiving the goods, I found that the size was just right, and I almost got pitted.
The price of Double Eleven is much more expensive than Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
Z Affordable Goods Problems are troublesome.
The order placed on the 18th, the goods received on the 25th, the speed of snails from Guangzhou to Beijing, snails.
I bought Z affordable goods, and the description told me that there were scratches, but after receiving the goods, I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing.
The child is not willing to return, thinking that the problem is not big, but accessories such small parts, the child's grandfather ran to several nearby hardware stores did not buy the nearby hardware store did not buy.
Finally, Grandpa glued it on.
It seems that we can't buy Z affordable goods in the future.
Toy processing quality is not good.
Most of the bolt holes are not aligned, the bolt is very difficult, it can be seen that the processing quality is not good, and I do not know how long I can play, because it is something promised to the child, it will not be returned.
Other reviews say it's easy to install. Is this the only one I bought that has a problem?
Very average
Could it be that I am unlucky?
The packaging is too old to handle. The workmanship is very average. There's only one kind of music and it's only 8 seconds long and then it keeps repeating itself. The action is to shake your head and walk forward without any change.
Not worth the price.
If it is in urgent need, it will not be returned.
The quality of the toy is good. I would like to complain about the packaging.
I received the express delivery yesterday. I bought it from Amazon. It was marked as EMS delivery. In the end, it was delivered by Tmall Express. How many turns did it take? Amazon and Tmall have a good relationship.
Let's talk about the packaging again. It's wrapped in plastic wrap for several layers. There's not even a packaging plastic bubble wrap inside. When you open it, all the parts are placed in an empty box. Fortunately, the quality of the toy is good and there are no broken parts. It's much smaller than imagined. Because it's not with batteries, it often derails when pushed by hand. I feel that the gap on both sides of the track is too large, and the design is unreasonable.
Good quality, fun.
It's fun, the components are very precise, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is similar to Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.
The assembly process is very interesting. I will spell it, and my 5-year-old son will play. It is very good.
He laughed so much that he would probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The machine is new, and overseas shopping is good.
I took a look at it at Christmas. I bought 150 yuan more expensive before, but now the delivery is a little slower than now.
The machine is still good, all quite new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then connecting the elf ball will send a dream.
It's not bad to play. It's more portable than ps4.
Already bought Zelda, wait for the game, try again.
Production of rotten goods, sale of rotten goods, the result of rotten goods service, bought six watches to give to children, one of the fast figures is not completely displayed, six pieces of time are inconsistent, the difference varies from more than ten hours to more than ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watch had a check time in storage. They replied, "Yes." Since there is, why is the time difference so much? It must be that the watch is not accurate. Simply put, it is a water product. It is not what I said that is ugly. Look, the obvious quality problems ( incomplete digital display) are all sold out. Is it junk goods?
I contacted the seller, the seller said a lot of reasons, but also complained that they should not buy their things, such products, such sellers, such after-sales service, who dares to buy things on Amazon in the future?
In short, I suggest not to buy things from this seller, it is also rubbish to buy things.
Amazon shipping issues.
After receiving the goods, the inspection found that they had been found.
1. The packaging of the watch is seriously worn out.
2. There are serious wrinkles in the table instructions.
3. The watch does not go away, and the desk lamp is not charged and used, making it impossible to adjust the time.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately, and you can only mail it to the United States at your own expense, and then make up the postage.
The reason for the 5 or 2 points is that the customer service is not bad.
I can only say it's okay
The time is not very accurate, about one second faster every day, it has been used for only a few months and it has been more than two minutes faster.
I have used a piece of Citizen before, and I feel that it will not be a few seconds worse in a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, the timing function is a little chicken ribs, basically can not be used, and occasionally will be mistakenly touched to enter the timing mode.
Solar sports watch.
Advantages. Solar charging does not have to worry about having to replace the battery, with world time, a variety of alarms and hourly reminders.
Not enough. The mirror surface is easy to scratch and get dust.
Cost-effective ratio The general domestic price is between 220-300, and more than 180 overseas purchases ( it takes about 1 week) .
Very satisfied with the watch.
It must be genuine. I went to the counter to check the goods. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the material is sufficient, and it is an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It is those three or four hundred so-called mechanical watches that cannot be compared. This is genuine. It is genuine in goods.
The time of the watch is very accurate, and the error is completely within the acceptable range. There is a jewelry appraisal certificate in the packaging of the watch, and the 12 characters on the dial are real diamonds. This is very suitable for you to wear. It is also very face-saving to send out as a gift.
Bentley watches are really good.
Worst shopping experience ever.
On the evening of September 23rd, my wife dropped her mobile phone. On a whim, she immediately came to Amazon to order an 8p. It was in stock but it was not self-operated and there was no price increase ( I was secretly happy) . Due to the slow delivery of non-self-operated goods, the system showed that the latest receipt was expected to be September 27th. The latest receipt will be on September 27th.
My wife died without a mobile phone. She told me to think of something more than 6 o'clock the next morning. Later, I went to Jingdong to see if the 256G was available and could be delivered on the same day. I had to order another one immediately.
When you buy a new one, you want to cancel your Amazon order right away and cancel it.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it is not possible to receive the courier in the early morning. I called the customer service after 7 o'clock and asked to cancel the order. The customer service replied that it has been cancelled. Please wait for the SMS notification to be stopped.
Well, I just waited patiently. When I got on my mobile phone at noon, I saw that the order was still in a state of undelivered. I immediately contacted the customer service and asked to cancel the order as soon as possible. The customer service replied that the OK had been operated.
At 3:00 p.m., I checked on my phone and saw that the order was still there. I couldn't help but contact customer service again and clearly informed them that it had already called for the third time. Please cancel the order and notify the seller not to deliver the goods.
At my request, the customer service contacted the seller on the spot and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would have to wait until he was familiar with the system before canceling the order.
But tell me clearly that the seller already knows, absolutely will not ship please rest assured that will not ship please rest assured that the seller will not ship.
When I looked at the order on Monday, it was already shipped, and I was speechless.
Due to the inability to contact the seller directly, we had to call customer service again.
The subsequent processing was simply speechless. Basically, I said a step, and the customer service continued to operate.
So far, the order is still in the state of delivery rejection and is ready to be delivered again.
Won't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
It doesn't matter if the seller's company collects the money anyway and doesn't follow up.
In summary, large items will never be prepaid in the future. This is too troublesome.
It looks beautiful.

Let me contact Amazon directly for after-sales service.
Another point worth noting is that I saw comments from users on the Internet saying that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and smaller storage capacity cannot be recognized. I hope everyone pays attention to this point.

When buying this mobile phone, think about the two feelings at that time, or can share the joys and sorrows together, but now it is unbearable to look back, life may be like this, some people do not want to meet all their lives, some things do not want to know all their lives, but what can be done?

No matter how nice I was to someone, one day when she changed her mind, all the vows of love and love vanished. All the vows of love and love vanished.

But because my Z2 has been devolved, this phone has also completed its mission.

In the case of DNA, its DNA coding uses the same four nucleotides as it does today, namely adenine ( A), guanine ( G), cytosine ( C), and thymine ( T) . DNA maintains a double helix structure with DNA polymerase, a template-dependent enzyme, and its DNA polymerase may belong to D polymerase. The integrity of its DNA structure depends on a class of enzymes that maintain and repair DNA structures, including DNA topoisomerase. In addition, if its genetic coding basis is DNA, then these codes will be expressed through a single strand of RNA as an intermediary, and its RNa will be generated through DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and its RNa coding uses riboglycine similar to DNA, but the thymine of DNA will be replaced by uracil. In addition, this organism will have a variety of proteins, including tissue protein folding proteins.

This paradox points out that there is no limit-additive measure defined on a sphere whose value is equal to all congruent subsets of each other ( Hausdorff also proved that there is no countable measure defined on all subsets are additive and measurable), and the structure of the group formed by spherical rotation plays a key role herea statement that does not hold true on planes or line segments. In fact, Banach later proved that for all bounded subsets on the Euclidean plane, it is possible to define an area such that all subsets that are congruent to each other have equal measurements ( this is true for lengths on real numbers) . However, this measure has only finite additivity, so it is not a measure in the full sense, but for the property that "all congruent subsets of each other have the same measure", this measure is equal to the Lebesgue measure, which means that two equally decomposable ( equi-decomposable) open sets in a plane or real number have the same area, which means that two equally decomposable ( equi-decomposable) open sets in a plane or real number have the same area.
After the exploration, the new Sam found three jammers and recorded their location coordinates. When he returned to the base, the old Sam just found the secret room where the replicators were placed. The secret room was located underground next to the sleeping box. Because it would only be here when he wanted to go back, it had not been found. The two Sam then entered the secret room to check, and found that there were hundreds of Sam inside, each of which had not been awakened in the freezer.

Some people may think that saying "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" is a reversal of causality, and that the real causal relationship should be "more bad behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment". However, research shows that the relationship between corporal punishment and bad behavior is indeed "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior of children", rather than "more bad behavior of children leads to more corporal punishment", and "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior of children", which is supported by post-analysis. Furthermore, even after controlling various factors that may affect children's behavior, such as the social status of parents, it is still true that "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior of children", that is, corporal punishment itself does lead to more bad behavior of children, and its adverse effects cannot be explained by any other possible reasons. Some studies believe that an educational strategy focused on caring and supervising can effectively reduce the incidence of bullying, while exclusion, indulgence, and corporal punishment are positively related to the incidence of bullying and bullying.

In 1818, Sir Raffles was appointed Deputy Governor of the British colony Bencoolen. He was convinced that Britain must find a strategic location beyond the then hegemonic Netherlands, when the trade lines linked China, Britain and India, and especially needed a stronghold for Chinese trade. In addition, the Netherlands stifled British trade in the region and banned the sale of British goods in Dutch-controlled ports, especially Batavia in the Netherlands. The price of goods and materials collected here is quite unfavorable. The challenge facing Raffles is to establish a new port within the sphere of influence of the Netherlands, but at that time, British ports are no longer suitable as trading centers. They are too far away from the Strait of Malacca. When large ships want to trade with Indochina and pass through this time, they must enter from the adjacent Indian Ocean, otherwise they will enter

The Dakivalli family had planned to take care of Maleficent alone, but she kept crying ( there is another saying that she was born dumb) and refused to drink milk or let the women of the family help her take a bath. He didn't drink milk until the family called Manigai from other groups, and she didn't cry when the Tu'uligit came to help take a bath or change diapers. So later, two families helped take care of her daily life, while the Dakivalli family was responsible for providing food and taking the girl home at night ( it is also said that the ancestors of both families were created by Satan Yale to take care of her), while the other family, Vikivan, was responsible for the vigilance work.

The Supreme People's Court pointed out in its "Notice on Issuing the First Batch of Guiding Cases" that state functionaries take advantage of their positions to seek benefits for the trustee and obtain "profits" with the trustee in the name of a "joint venture" company. If there is no actual investment or participation in operation and management, they will be punished by the bribery court. State functionaries who knowing that others have entrusted matters accept their property are regarded as promises to "seek benefits for others", whether they have actually sought benefits for others or obtained benefits does not affect the determination of accepting bribes. State officials take advantage of the convenience of their positions to seek benefits for the trustee, and buy houses and other items from the trustee at a price significantly lower than the market. For bribery, the amount of bribery is calculated according to the difference between the local market price and the actual price paid at the time of the transaction. After the state functionary receives the property, he is investigated and prosecuted for the person or matter related to his bribery, and returns it for the purpose of concealing the crime, which does not affect the determination of the crime of accepting bribes.

In the "polarized light" timeline, after K2 ordered separate operations, M950A and Raiden acted together to rescue the commander, but the two were quickly overtaken by the regular army team. During the operation, M950A's legs were blown off and could only rely on Raiden When the two were surrounded by the regular army team and were about to be wiped out, a "prototype goblin" secretly took advantage of the fact that the regular army team was attracted by other goblins, and removed its own body to repair and upgrade the M950A.

In the end, only loyal hammer fans ordered more than 100 nuts, and the scarce output made the factory refuse to start work, and these subscribers could not get the goods. Some media people commented that this was also the root problem of the hammer. Luo Yonghao is extremely conceited and has big dreams, but it seems that he does not have the same huge pool of funds and technological innovation. At first, he relied on a kind of "Chinese craftsman dream" to cater to the rebellious style of young people on the Internet and attracted a group of fans. These iron powder are somewhat capable of becoming employees, others are consumer customers, but the ideology will always burn out one day. In the end, the market will test your technical hard power. At present, the hammer is only APP creation or rewriting ability at best, and it is still a brand factory stage for assembling upstream suppliers. The craftsmanship spirit is now being created on the shell. However, there are few changes that the mobile phone shell can actually do. Now automated processing technology also makes each manufacturer have little difference in the shell process,
Before 2021, there were some problems such as difficult to see pop-up window information logo, extremely small close button, camouflage page, induced click and so on. In July 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China launched a special crackdown on the Internet industry. These include rectifying behaviors that infringe upon the rights and interests of users, such as correcting applications to start pop-up windows to deceive and mislead users, forcing the provision of personalized services ( including pop-up windows with jump links on the whole screen, providing false close buttons during directional push, etc.), so that many platforms have a lot of advertising norms, but at this time, some platforms have created a new shake advertisement for the benefit of starting advertising. Depending on the user's "shake" to agree to view the advertisement, avoid rectification. At the end of the year, during the "Double Eleven" and "Double Twelve" periods, some applications launched a shake advertisement online. Although the push was random, it did not appear for everyone or every time the software was opened, but because it was too sensitive. At one point, many complaints were triggered.

Because the environment was conducive to vigorously developing the navy, Gorshkov, the founder of the Soviet Navy, was determined, and senior naval officials were able to move around at the ministerial meeting. Coupled with the support of the ambition of the Russian Imperial Tsar Peter the Great, the ship was designed with a tonnage of 8000 tons and equipped with 6-8 missiles with a range of 150 kilometers, but this was different from the Cresta II class cruiser under construction at that time. There was also a larger tonnage under development, using the Kara class of gas turbines. Such specifications could not fit the nuclear reactor according to the established vision, nor could they pass the high-level review of big guys. So the plan was revised several times, and finally the full load dis

People have different views on whether the abolition of the death penalty can be decided by public opinion. In practice, there have been governments that have decided to abolish the death penalty by public opinion. California held a death penalty referendum in 2012. The content of the referendum is whether the people support the passage of Proposition 34 ( Proposition 34) . In short, the content of Proposition 34 is "California abolishes the death penalty." so once the result of the referendum is to pass Proposition 34, California will abolish the death penalty, but if the result of the referendum is not to pass Proposition 34, then California will retain the death penalty. While the party supporting the passage of Proposition 34 spent more than six times as much on publicity as the party opposing the bill, the final result of the referendum was that 52% of the voters opposed it, while 48% supported it. As a result, the bill did not pass in the end, California continued to retain the death penalty. The death penalty was retained in California, which continued to retain the death penalty.
Meanwhile, 87 vehicles from the 1st Polish Panzer Division under the command of Rafmatchek in the east of the Canadian Army captured Hill 262 ( Mont-Ormel in French and TheMace in English) in order to prevent any counterattack by the besieged German troops from the east. They can also observe the road from Chambois to Vimoutiers ( now the only way out of the encirclement) and attack the scattered German army from a commanding position here.

When external energy is injected into and absorbed by an energy level system in the form of electric field, photon, chemistry, etc., it will cause electrons to jump from low energy level to high energy level. When the photons produced by spontaneous emission come into contact with these electrons that jump to high energy level due to external energy, the electrons of these high energy levels will be induced to move to low energy level and release photons ( so-called stimulated radiation) . All the optical properties of stimulated radiation and the original spontaneous emission, including spontaneous emission, will be induced to move to low energy level and release photons ( so-called stimulated radiation) . All the optical properties of stimulated radiation and the original spontaneous emission include spontaneous emission. The same frequency, phase, direction of travel, etc. When these photons of stimulated radiation encounter other electrons that jump to a higher energy level due to external energy, more and more of the same photons will be produced, and finally the intensity of light will become greater and greater ( that is, the energy of light will be amplified) . Unlike ordinary light, all photons have the same frequency, phase ( coherence), and direction of travel. Unlike ordinary light, all photons have the same frequency, phase ( coherence), direction of travel.
After the two arrived at the warehouse auction venue, they would often encounter some opponents who were also bidders for the warehouse when they walked in the door. They would try to greet each other and make some simple social greetings, and ask each other if there were any local bidders that should be paid attention to. In some venues, there are often bidders who are willing to spend a lot of money to grab all the items under the bid regardless of the cost. This kind of bidder is usually divided into two types. One is a large bidder with a deep pocket money, and he often wins the bid for the warehouse of the venue. The big family has monopolized the warehouse for a long time. They don't want outsiders to come into the auction house to bid, so they will deliberately increase the amount of the bid regardless of the cost, trying to drive away

After the leaves of the olive tree have withered, collected, boiled and soaked, the so-called black water in the aquarium can be used to strengthen the estrus of Thai bettas and improve pregnancy. Especially in the breeding of Thai bettas, because the olive leaves will release pigments. Tannic acid can darken the water color, increase the water color to simulate the environmental conditions of black water, stabilize the mood of fish, quickly relieve stress, maladaptation, strengthen physical improvement, and strengthen physical improvement. The color of the tail and dorsal fin reduces the PH value ( increases acidity), and it contains a large amount of tannin. Humic acid is a form of humic acid. Folic acid, etc., can adjust the pH value of water, the effect of soft water, can make water slightly soft, but also depends on the softness and hardness of the raw water, such as hard, you have to use more leaves to soak in order to achieve the same effect, there is a large-leaf olive leaf soaked fish tank, some organisms die will be late mold, so it is inferred that the large-leaf olive leaves should be more or less inhibit the growth of mildew and mildew. Therefore, it is inferred that the large-leaf olive leaves should have more or less inhibit the growth of mildew and mildew. The anti-corrosion function should be more or less inhibited by mildew.
On the eve of World War II, German firearms engineers conducted research on assault rifles and concluded that although the existing 8mm Mauser rifle bullets have a range of more than 800 meters, the long range is difficult to play in actual combat. The scope is not a common equipment. Most soldiers The marksmanship of rifles is not up to the level of snipers, and the high rate of fire can suppress the enemy in close combat. However, the existing rifle bullets are too focused on the range. Although the power is large, the recoil is also too large. Automatic shooting will be difficult to hold stably, and the hit rate during continuous shooting is so low that it is not practical, so there is an idea to reduce the charge of the existing 8mm Mauser rifle. By shortening the length of the ammunition, not only can the recoil be reduced, It's 92mm and it's only about half the length of the previous Mauser rifle bullets.
In addition, there are dances used on special occasions, such as the "dance of victory" when celebrating the victory of the war and praising achievements, the "dance of friendship" of social activities between neighbors or friends, and after contact with white people and the outbreak of war. The "ghost dance" that calls the ancestors to fight with the souls of the dead warriors, the "corn dance" that prays or thanks for the harvest, or the "Booger Dance" that prays to dispel disease or whites. Booger is considered a demon by the Cherokee, and the Bougues dance is usually indoors, and some of the invited people will wear snake masks that symbolize Booger ( increase the horns of demons after contact with whites) . And use a pseudonym to indicate that they ( Booger) are not out
Cat litter bucket toilets were first promoted in Denver, Colorado, where there have been many school shootings. In emergencies such as school shootings, the police will require teachers and students to hide in the classroom until the police have checked the campus and confirmed safety. Before coming out, Jefferson County Public Schools Superintendent of Safety John McDonald said the idea came up years ago when a school in the area was locked down for hours after a shooting threat, so much so that students who needed to go to the toilet had to use garbage bags and trash bins. After the shooting threat in April 2019, the school district began equipping classrooms with portable toilets based on cat litter. Diana Wilson, a spokeswoman for the district's public schools, said that most teachers supported the decision. And litter bucket toilets have been added to Denver's teacher ration lists, along with pop-up tents
After the demise of Balari Ulu, the location of the tribe became the place where the Haocha tribe people planted miscellaneous grains. Today, the relevant ancient city remains can still be seen, but the whereabouts of its survivors are completely unknown. At the other end of the spectrum, although the Karixi tribe regained its independence and rebuilt its homeland, it also perished under landslides and floods caused by a heavy rain, and only some people in today's Wutai tribe, located in Wutai Village, claim to be descendants of Karixi. In addition, because he led the tribe to win the war, the Dalapathan ( also known as Druluane and transliterated as "Luluan"), a descendant of Boleng, is also known as the "Military Leader". Omomos ( meaning "easy to fog"), the highest point of the old Haocha tribe, and the Kadrangilan family, the original leader family, are listed as two leading families.
The infection group initially caused by the cabin attendant at the end of December 2021 belongs to the Omicron mutant virus, and the virus gene sequencing shows that it is the earlier Omicron mutant virus strain BA. 1 subtype, while the infection group caused by the quarantine hotel in early January 2022 belongs to the Omicron mutant virus strain BA. Canadium 2, although both are homologous to Omicron variant viruses, there are 10 different mutations in their spike proteins, and preliminary studies in the UK and Denmark have shown BA. The 2 sub is better than the BA. The type 1 is more infectious, and the BA is more infectious. Type 2 leads to a higher rate of breakthrough infection in people who have received two and three doses of vaccine, but those who have received the vaccine may reduce the chance of transmission to others, while 12 people have been transmitted in the first generation of the quarantine hotel group, showing that the Omicron mutant virus strain BA is known to have been transmitted. The subtype is more infectious than the virus strain previously found in Hong Kong, and it is more difficult to block its widespread spread.

During the later years of his reign in Anastasius, he realized that his days were numbered and that he had three living relatives, but Anastasius did not know who was the most suitable successor, so he summoned the three relatives to a room with three sofas, one of which had a letter hidden under it, and as long as the person who chose the right sofa was eligible to become the successor. However, two of the relatives were sitting on the same sofa, while the other was sitting on another sofa, but the sofa with the envelope hidden was not selected, so Anastasius came up with another idea at this time, whoever walked in next would be the successor, As a result, the person who walked in was Justin, the captain of his guards. Although Anastasius did not expect Justin to be the successor, he was also satisfied with the result, and Justin became
At that time, the Japanese navy had been ordered to blockade the waters of Hong Kong. When the British torpedo fleet sailed to the waters east of the Lantang Strait, it was discovered by the Japanese fir-class destroyer and the Hong-type mine boat Magpie. Due to the huge gap in firepower between the two sides, Chen Ce then instructed the torpedo team to line up to meet the high speed of the Japanese ship, pretending to launch a torpedo attack on the Japanese ship. In fact, the torpedo boats at that time were in order to reduce the load and carry as many people as possible, and to avoid the danger of explosion after the torpedo was hit by artillery fire, so they did not carry torpedoes. However, when the Japanese ship saw the torpedo fleet coming, it was deceived and took evasive action. The tor
Buddhism opposes some views of Brahmanism. For example, in the Bensheng Sutra, the Bodhisattva questions why Brahma God allows suffering and evil to run rampant, which is similar to the problem of evil. Some Buddhists also deny the existence of Brahma God from the level of justification. Therefore, Buddhism does not believe that the meaning of life comes from the Great Brahma King, who is still trapped in reincarnation. In addition, Buddhism also denies that the Great Brahma is the origin of all things, and believes that the Great Brahma is only one of the five phenomena. Therefore, some Hindu theologians later accused Buddhism of advocating nihilism, but Buddhism refuted this statement, believing that the root of all things is "emptiness". It is emptiness that makes all things appear and change, and meaning is constantly arising with the origin
In the mid-term creation, in addition to inheriting Dai Jin's painting style, he also learned from Ma Yuan and Xia Gui's various methods, focusing on freehand brushwork. At the same time, he imitated Li Gonglin, Gu Kaizhi and other white figure paintings, and also learned from Liang Kai, Wu Daozi, Liu Songnian and other masters. The picture was more relaxed and simple, grand and vigorous. At this time, Wu Wei was well-known in the capital and was later summoned to the palace. But because of his unruly nature and unaccustomed to life in the palace, he was not used to flattery and the upper class society, so he resigned from the painting academy, which greatly changed his thinking. contrary to the idea that he was determined to pursue fame and fortune and get ahead
The Camel fighter was developed from the same company's Puppy fighter. A larger, heavier and more powerful air-cooled star engine increased the power of the Camel from 80 horsepower to 130 horsepower. The nose machine gun was also increased from one to two. Of course, it was also combined with the shooting synchronization system imitated from the Germans. In order to prevent the machine gun from jamming at high altitude due to cold, a fairing was added. Originally, the plane was called "Big Dog", but because of the protruding shape of the fairing, the plane was renamed "Camel", which made the nose heavier, but the horizontal tail did not increase the area. This makes the Camel aircraft tend to nod when flying It becomes unstable, which makes it difficult for pilots who have just driven the Camel aircraft to drive, but
After more than two decades of brilliant results, the abnormally rapid decline in performance after the national team has made many fans unacceptable, in part because the fans cannot accept the country's sudden decline in speed. The Greek national basketball team returned from a disastrous defeat in the European Championships in 1999 and 2001, and lost its qualification for the Sydney Olympics and the 2002 World Championships. The poor record led to problems in the relationship between the team and the Greek Basketball Association. In the end, the Greek national basketball team made a major adjustment before the 2003 European Championship, hiring a new coach Ioannidis and promoting a new group of young players. This adjustment attempt was partially successful. In the 2003 European Championship, the Greek team finally achieved the fifth place, but the public is not very satisfied. Because the fifth place is still a long way from success, fifth place is still a

When Japan surrendered unconditionally in August 1945, he returned to his hometown to run a watch shop and studied photographic techniques on his own. Later, he often went to Hiroshima to photograph the surviving "bomb victims" ( atomic bomb victims) . Since 1952, he has photographed 43-year-old Fisherman Nakamura ( Sugimatsu Nakamura, 1909-1967) recorded and reported. In 1960, he published a photo album "Records of an Atomic Bomb Victim". He won the Special Award of the Japan Photographic Critics Association Award. He won the Special Award of the Japan Photographic Critics Association Award. Afterwards, he continued to photograph various street protests at that time ( Anti-Security Movement, Anti-Narita Airport Construction "Sanrizuka Struggle", Minamata Disease, Women's Liberation Movement, etc.), infiltrated the Self-Defense Forces to expose the truth of new arms development, so he was beaten to break 10 needles on the bridge of his nose, and his house was also burned down by arson. Residents were also burned down by arson. Instead, he was more determined to always stand against those in power, and held more than 600 exhibitions at his own expense.
In February of the 11th year of Yonglu ( 1568), Tachibana Kanzai, the lord of Tachibana Mountain, was instigated by Mori Moto and rebelled against the Otomo family again. At this time, Chikuzen and Lizhong’ s Kenno Zongzhen did not support Jianzai’ s actions in order to implement loyalty to the Otomo family. , was killed by him, and Jianzai welcomed more than 8, 000 Shimizu Sochi and more than 100 military ships from the Mori family on April 6. He also joined forces with Takashi Harada, Harada's father and son, and Takahashi Jianzhong's retainer Etoo Zhang guarded about 10, 000 people in Tachibana Mountain Castle. On April 24, the Otomo army surrounded Tachibana Mountain Castle and its seven cities and villages including Baiyue and Matsuo with more than 30,
The eastern part is the undulating Loess Plateau, with an altitude of 1500-2000 meters. The Yellow River and its tributaries such as Weihe River and Tao River flow through it. It is rich in water resources. To the south of Qinling Mountains is the Bailong River Basin. The climate is warm and humid, the plants are dense, and the annual precipitation is about 500 mm. To the west of the Wushaoling Mountains, there is the Hexi Corridor formed by the confrontation between the southern and northern mountains. The southern mountains are dominated by the Qilian Mountains. The mountains are tall, mostly more than 3000 to 4000 meters. The northern mountains are relatively low, mainly Longshou Mountain and Heli Mountain. The rivers in the region are inland water systems, most of which flow from south to north, including Shule River and weak water, among which the weak water basin is the largest, the climate is dry, and the annual precipitation is about 150 mm. Mainly semi-desert and desert, due to the snowmelt irrigation of Qilian Mountains, alluvial fans are formed at the foot of the mountain. The place where there are rivers in the corridor forms a connected oasis. It is a gra
After the Observatory reissued the No. 1 signal, Lau Fau Shan and Tsing Yi measured 43 kilometers per hour at 2:20m. to 2:50m. and 3:40m. to 3:46m. on August 15, with a maximum 10-minute average wind speed of 43 kilometers per hour, the first strong wind measured during the storm at the two stations. It is also the highest wind speed during the storm at the two stations. It is also the highest wind speed during the storm at the two stations. The highest wind speed during the storm. At the same time, the wind in the southwest of Hong Kong ( Lantau Island and nearby areas, such as Cheung Chau, Airport, etc.) remained high and continued to be affected by strong winds for nearly a whole day. As a result, between 2:45m. and 3:45m. on August 15, strong winds were recorded in four of the eight designated automatic weather stations, which met the requirements of Signal No. 3, which made some citizens think that the Observatory's time to change the No. 1 signal was equally too early, and it was nearly 18 hours earlier than the Macau Meteorological Bureau when the No. 3 typhoon signal was lowered.
Meteorological agencies in Hong Kong and Macau have different opinions on the time and location of Hato's closest approach to Macau. The Macau Meteorological Bureau stated that Hato was closest to Macau at 1:00 p.m. and skimmed about 40 kilometers west-southwest of the headquarters of the Meteorological Bureau. However, the post-mortem report of the Hong Kong Observatory and the positioning of the Macau Meteorological Observatory showed that the pigeon skimmed only 20 kilometers south-southwest of the headquarters of the Macau Meteorological Bureau at 12:00 p.m., and some members of the public questioned whether there was a mistake in the positioning of the pigeon by the Meteorological Bureau. The structure of the pigeon was complete and compact. At that time, there was no central circulation reorganization. The chance of positioning errors should be small. From the radar map, it can be compared with the typhoon Vicente that hit Macau in 2012, with a positioning of 40 kilometers by the Meteorological Bureau, and the eye diameters of Typhoon Vicente and Pigeon Pigeon are also 50 kilometers, but the center of Pigeon is obviously closer to Macau than Vicente. The actual distance of Pigeon may only be 20 kilometers.
In 2009, in order to tie in with the action plan for the improvement of the city appearance and environment in Luohu District of Shenzhen, Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Co., Ltd. invested more than 17 million yuan to carry out comprehensive improvement of the environment along the Shenzhen section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway, and renovated the Shenzhen Railway Station and its surrounding environment.

Leukemia-causing lineage is a complex accidental mechanism and a multi-stage evolutionary process, which is also the key to its carcinogenic incidence of only 5%. In this process, the virus first binds to CD4 + cells and activates the infected cells, expresses IL-2 receptors on the cell membrane, and then forms viral DNA through the action of viral reverse transcriptase, and integrates into the host cell chromosome to form provirus. Under the action of viral tax gene, the genes of IL-2 and its receptors in CD4+ cells begin to express abnormally, causing a large number of infected cells to proliferate. Host cells with virus can be transformed into different cell replication due to the diversity of viral DNA integration sites. In the process of cell proliferation, DNA of a replicated cell changes and evolves into leukemia cells, thereby forming leukemia cell replication.

The first thing in the history of value engineering development was the asbestos incident of General Electric ( GE) in the United States. During World War II, the supply of raw materials in the American market was very tight, and GE urgently needed asbestos boards. However, the supply of asbestos boards was unstable and expensive. GE engineers at that time began to study material substitution for this problem. By analyzing the function of asbestos boards used by the company, they found that their use was laid on the floor of the workshop where the products were painted to avoid fire caused by paint contamination on the floor. Later, Miles found a kind of fireproof paper in the market. This paper can also play the above role, and it is low in cost, easy to buy, and achieves good economic benefits. This is the earliest application case of value engineering. This is the earliest application case of

Later, curiously, he poured some nitric acid on it. Because the correction solution has an anti-corrosion component, the handwriting protrudes, so it is the beginning of using slate for printing with slate.
Usually because some village committees in inland provinces are still controlled by older people with older ideas, they believe that family property-related affairs should be mainly patrilineal inheritance, and that if a woman marries outside her name, it will become "someone else's" and other strange ideas, so unmarried women who do not act in accordance with the laws and regulations, especially those who are "guarded" by the village committee, will not be allocated land easily, and many rural women have no legal concept and do not know how to appeal their own rights and interests. In fact, Article 32 of the Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests stipulates that women enjoy equal rights with men in terms of contracted management of rural land, income distribution of collective economic organizations, use of compensation fees for land expropriation or expropriation, and use of homestead

In 2001, about 100 upper house members formed a relatively loose caucus, which supported almost all of then-President Putin's policies.

Although the most important thing in a democratic country was not consensus, it was difficult for the Federal Committee, as the upper house of Congress, to gather considerable consensus and pass any resolutions. On the contrary, bills were easier to pass after debates with the chairman or committees. Members themselves were asked not to reflect the original ideology of the political party. After the reform in 2000, the committee obviously had to approach the Kremlin authorities. Make it easy to pass important

Therefore, Zeratul immediately led a team to save Artanis, hoping to cut off the nerve cord connected to Kara before he was controlled by Amon. As a result, it was too late

Traditional digital modulation and division of labor use frequency division of labor to transmit different information through different frequency bands. OFDM divides an entire frequency band into several sub-carriers, and makes each sub-carrier orthogonal to each other, so that they do not overlap each other on the spectrum, which can reduce interference. Its operation mode is that the signal is placed in the frequency domain at the transmission end, converted to the time domain through inverse Fourier transform ( IDFT), and transmitted by adding a cyclic prefix, while the receiving end removes the cyclic prefix from the signal, and then converts the time domain signal back to the frequency domain through Fourier transform ( DFT) to resolve the original transmitted signal. The operation mode is that the transmission signal is placed in the frequency domain ( frequencydomain)

The first product of Xuanren's ambition was the SocketA slot converter "PK-OCK7/EV6" in 2001, and the NAS hard disk box "Xuanbox" was launched in 2004. Today, there are many product lines ranging from graphics cards, ATX power supplies to various storage media, adapters, etc., whose product positioning can gain a firm foothold in the computer player circle for more than a decade. The key is to find a small but stable market blue ocean, that is, the prosperity of electronic foundries in Shenzhen can provide a variety of cheap and beautiful computer parts that are rare in Japan. However, due to language and other factors, it is difficult for Japanese DIY player group consumers to connect with manufacturers in Shenzhen to make purchases, and they are also unable to review factory quality and contact demand. This company does this for them in Japan to create value for
Since the roads on both sides of the coastal mountains are only connected by Guangfeng Highway ( Taiwan 11 Line A), Ruigang Highway ( Hua 64 Line), and Dongfu Highway ( Taiwan 23 Line), there are only three contact lines 9 and Taiwan 11. Between Mizuho and Fuli, the distance is 64 kilometers long before there is a highway leading to Taiwan 11. Therefore, since July 1997, the General Administration of Highways has handled the "Yuli Changbin Section Highway New Construction Plan" to solve the traffic inconvenience. It can reduce the driving time from 2 hours before opening to traffic to 30 minutes after opening to traffic. It can also add local development and provide a fast emergency line for medical treatment.

After the defeat of the rampage race, Gallamo angrily punished him to go to the earth to find monsters that could make the rampage race bigger.

In Bobo's hometown, Gloria was surrounded by groups of suitors and sang the song of the soul <BoogieWonderland>, but no half of the penguin's song of the soul attracted her. However, Bobo came back and sang "MyWay" in Spanish. Gloria appreciated it very much, but knew that Bobo could not sing. Later, she found that it was Ramon behind Bobo. As Gloria walked away, Bobo attracted Gloria's attention with the rhythm of tap dancing. Gloria also gradually sang along with the rhythm. As more and more people followed Bobo, Penguin Elder Noha stopped the penguins from dancing. He thought that the reason for the fish shortage was because of Bobo's dancing, which angered the God of singing. So he expelled Bobo from Bobo.

There was no interference during this period, so Campbell began to plan. Campbell and Jill prepared chocolate weighing about the same as chips. When they were running away, they secretly switched the chips and chocolate. Rosa sat in the car and felt quite helpless. However, he was caught by other security guards and was caught in the same boat.
When the Chinese Super League and the Chinese League A abolished the rule that Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan players should be domestic helpers from 2016, coupled with Fu Paul's eye-catching performance in the World Cup qualifiers, he signed a two-year contract with the Chinese League A club Shenzhen Jiazhaoye on December 31 of the same year with a seven-digit transfer fee, and registered with the Chinese Football Association under the Chinese name Fu Paul, but due to injury problems, he played very few times.

Cryptomycetes were earlier described as organisms that parasitized the surface of host cells, lacked cell walls, and resembled chytrids. The type and life history of intracellular parasitism are atypical. However, this classification has many shortcomings. The word "hidden" means that these organisms have been ignored by researchers for a long time, and the mysterious veil was not revealed until the rise of molecular sequence analysis. However, this feature is applicable to many other eukaryotes, not the patent of cryptomycetes. There is room for discussion as to whether the genus Rhodiola is representative, because the life history of cryptomycetes is still poorly understood, and it is unclear whether most species can have both cell surface parasitism and intracellular parasitism. Therefore, the type and life history of Rhodiola may not necess
On the morning of August 25, the National Hurricane Center began to issue a tropical cyclone warning to the islands of the Lesser Antilles. In Barbados, there was no fuel available on the morning of August 27, and local residents rushed to buy disaster preparedness supplies, causing some store shelves to be emptied.

In the U.S. Virgin Islands, local residents do not have much time to prepare for disasters when the track is northward due to the fact that previous Dorian track forecasts will not be affected.
A lawyer may defend anyone, even if the person being defended is guilty of a heinous crime and the evidence is conclusive. All persons accused of committing criminal crimes, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or whether the evidence is conclusive, have the right to request the assistance of a lawyer. But it cannot be concluded that lawyers are inherently evil and lack moral conscience, as this is part of the lawyer's duty. However, due to the image of some people defended by lawyers, the arguments used in the defense process, and the cynicism of some lawyers, the lack of principles and the high fees of behavior, many jokes and satirical cultures against lawyers in society have led to a lot of jokes and satire about the culture of lawyers. The arguments used by some lawyers in their defense are more likely to involve blaming the victim. In Japan, some people have launched a petition to punish the lawyers of the defense team to jointly comment on the defense content used by the lawyers in homicide cases.

Later, when Chen Manyi went to the toilet, her cell phone rang. Mo Junxian checked and found that Chen Manyi had met another man ( supposed to be Hu Huaqiang) and was in a romantic relationship. So he asked why Chen Manyi cheated on him. Chen Manyi responded with a stubborn attitude, which made him think that Chen Manyi had betrayed him and given him false hope. He also recalled that Chen Manyi had concealed something from him, so he felt very disappointed and angry. He lost his reason in anger and pressed Chen Manyi to the ground and pinched her neck tightly. Until he realized that Chen Manyi was wet on the ground due to incontinence, he let go. Seeing this, he immediately performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Chen Manyi. After about 10 minutes of first aid, he still did not respond. At that moment, he was stunned and felt very panicked. After that, he casually put Chen Manyi into the wardrobe and covered it with sundries to buy time to escape.
Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder that occurs when 25-28 genes are deleted from the long arm of chromosome 7, usually as an occasional event during egg or sperm formation. In a few cases, Williams syndrome is inherited from a parent with autosomal dominant disorder ( autosomal dominant genetic disorder) . The patient's special facial features ( wide mouth, upturned nose, long, narrow and small chin, bubble eyes, pointed ears, long neck, slanted shoulders, etc.) are often considered to be missing specific genes, and are usually diagnosed on the basis of symptoms that raise suspicion ( e.g., birth is incomplete heart valve insufficiency, aortic stenosis, SVAS, etc.), and ELN gene probe detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH) to confirm the disease by ELN gene probe detection.
Also based on plant materials, the biggest difference between ancient Egyptian papyrus and Chinese paper is that papyrus is made by gluing papyrus sheets, papyrus fibers have not been decomposed, the arrangement of fibers still retains the natural order, and the single and thick arrangement of fibers is not conducive to writing, folding and drying. Moreover, the raw material of papyrus is only the Nile River Basin. The fibers in Chinese paper are not only different from the orderly arrangement of plant fibers, but also different from the geometric arrangement of textiles. Instead, they are arranged in a random cross pattern. With simple production and appropriate bonding and bonding, they form a material that is both light and strong and absorbs water. Therefore, they can be used to preserve information for a long time. The raw materials are also very diverse. They can use plants from all environments and eventually spread to all parts of the world. Worldwide, they are eventually spread all over the world.
Since fantasy novels are mostly written by Internet writers and published on the Internet at the same time as they are written, they often change their style in the process of serialization to suit the audience ( because they have the possibility of expressing their opinions immediately, they are more like the audience than the reader) . These changes may make the content of the novel often contradictory, but as long as the plot arrangement is brilliant and reasonable, there is no need to deliberately distinguish the categories of works, and the thematic weight of chapters can also be used as a distinction. If the thematic scope of each chapter is in a fictional world and only a few other non-traditional plots are added, it can be classified as a fantasy novel. If the chapter revolves around martial arts and science fiction, magic is only used as an ornament, but it is more recognized as a fantasy novel.

Whenever there is a major disaster ( such as an epidemic), rolls of toilet paper are easily snapped up. Some analysts believe that Western countries or regions that respect Western civilization consume a considerable amount of toilet paper. Due to the uncertain future development of the disaster ( including the response of the governing government to the disaster, the spread of rumors, etc.), it may lead to long-term isolation, which may lead to an increase in people's stocks of various materials. Rolled toilet paper is a conspicuous product that occupies a large space in stores. The rapid rush to buy leads to the situation that the shelves are easy to empty, which will further aggravate people's panic about material shortages and fear of missing out. In the end, it is difficult for stores to replenish their shelves to keep up with the speed of people's rush to buy. The speed of people's buying is very difficult to keep up with the speed of people's buying.
This is not reasonable, because a good nib is often an advanced pen and has a certain weight. Secondly, when writing, you need to press the nib hard to make a thick and thin effect, but the ballpoint pen can only write on a soft material. The ballpoint pen often has a better effect on hard pen calligraphy and has more space to play, but you need to have a certain degree of understanding of different writing skills. The writer needs more observation. What pen calligraphy needs is speed. Because the water-based ink pen tip cannot write too slowly and stop at one point for too long, this alone is far less light than the ballpoint pen. The only advantage of pen is that the ink color is brighter than the ballpoint pen. The only advantage is that the pen is brighter than the ballpoint pen.
Diesel-driven U-boats have low surface speed, only able to catch up with some slow merchant ships, and the maximum underwater speed is less than 10 knots, generally about 4 knots ( except for the XXI type, which is equipped with a 600-ton high-energy battery pack and streamlined hull design, and can continue to operate at an unprecedented high speed of 17 knots underwater for an hour) . Destroyer maximum speed of 30 knots, the actual anti-submarine warfare due to the need to use active sonar and hydrophones ( Hydraphone), the ship speed is generally still 10-15 knots, U-boats in the underwater face of enemy destroyers depth charges are difficult to avoid, the lack of mobility is a fatal shortcoming of U-boats.
Taoism is the native religion of China, and its ideas originated from the Yellow Emperor ( entrusted by the Yellow Emperor School) . The earliest forms of Taoist cults were Taiping Dao pioneered by Yu Ji and Wudoumi Religion ( Tianshi Dao) founded by Zhang Daoling.

Chapter 1
Hao Ren, as his name suggests, is a good person.
His family lives in an unknown northern town. If Beijing plans to build a 20th ring and 30th ring, it can barely be regarded as the foot of the son of heaven. If all the good people in the world are counted on his head according to the homophonic sound, it can barely be regarded as famous all over the world. No one knows him on the road, with a square face that looks ordinary except for a little manly. After more than 20 years, the goal of life is to be a good person. Other than that, he has no characteristics - this means that he has no characteristics - this means that he has become famous.
Although the weather in the north is cooler, it is also very irritable to walk on the road under the sun during the day. Therefore, all kinds of vehicles can be seen everywhere in the busy city center, but not many pedestrians are walking outside. The tall young man in white T-shirt, gray trousers and ordinary appearance is one of the few pedestrians.
Hao Ren feels that students are becoming less and less dedicated these days. When he was working outside, he would never give a glance to see that he was a bachelor with such a thing in his hand, but anyway, this kind of hard folding fan is quite suitable.
"The last two, even if it's not enough, forget it." Hao Ren muttered as he looked at the last two job advertisements in his hand. Fortunately, these two places were next to each other, and he could quickly complete today's "task", and one of them was right in front of him. It was an advertising company that absolutely couldn't see how powerful it was from the outside, but the signboard at the door was loud. Galaxy Media Pan-Cultural Development and Promotion Company, a listen to this name is the goods that must fall within half a year, Hao Ren was rushed to this name at that time, the main purpose is not to apply for a job, but to see what kind of strange person the company owner who can come up with such a magical name will be.
He walked excitedly for several hundred meters to bypass the isolation fence of the road, and then ran to the door of this advertising company with a particularly bullish name under the sun, and was surprised to find that - the company did collapse, the sign at the door was still hanging, but there was a notice of closure on the glass door, the date was two days ago, and the recruitment notice in his hand was four days ago... This is really a world that is changing rapidly. These days, two days before the company collapses, I have to recruit two new employees by the way to suppress the shock or shock.
Hao Ren looked down at the last one and threw it into the same place two seconds later. By the way, he reflected on whether he was blind when he screened this thing two days ago - a clerk from the office of the bus company was required to be 25 to 40 years old. He could bear hardships and stand hard work, understand computers, and work experience is preferred. Female gender is preferred, and female gender is preferred.
He came to the city center with this thing in his hand, just to see how bright the glass door of an advertising agency that was busy recruiting two days before it closed down was, and he was literally full of food.
Hao Ren, gender male, hobby female, age 25 years old, no * * hobbies, the advantage is that eating is not picky, currently single, few relatives and friends, he lives alone in the old house left by his parents in the old city south of the city. Like most young men, his life goal is to make a monthly payment at the age of 25 and marry a beautiful daughter-in-law. If possible, it is best to have a car, parents are unable to be filial, so at least you have to live well enough to not be ashamed of your family. Now this series of life goals has been completed by one-third of the goals. He’ s 25 this year.
This is such a sad story.
He came to the city today to look for a job, but in fact he personally didn't have any urgent need for a source of livelihood for it. As mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lives in an old house left by his parents. He should thank the older generation for the family business left behind. At least the house is quite large - it is an old two-story house that has been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For several years, Hao Ren has been relying on renting out houses to make a living, but because the place where he lives is really remote, even remote to the extent that I want to wait for the demolition of the old house, I am afraid that I will have to plan for several decades.
To be fair, there is no need for Hao Ren to come out and look for a job with such a stable income, but this person is a little hypocritical when he has been idle for too long. He always feels that he should make a little effort to open up the road of life. In addition, the more important reason is that the place of his old house is too biased, which is almost out of human civilization. Since the last migrant workers and couples have moved from the rental house, no one has come to rent the house for half a year. Looking at the empty two-story "apartment" for several months, Hao Ren realized one thing from the bottom of his heart. Unless the municipal plan is tilted towards him, otherwise if you want to survive, I'm afraid you really have to come out and look for a job.
After studying urban planning at home for three days, Hao Ren thought that it was unlikely that the surrounding area of his home would become a commercial center overnight. Considering that as a big man, he could not abandon himself, he finally decided to find a job first, at least with income to maintain life.
How to say that back then, he was also a hardworking and good man who worked part-time to earn tuition fees. Lang Lang Qiankun could still starve himself to death.
However, his fate is not based on human will. Basically, he was running outside the first day... All that's left is to run blindly.
It was useless to think so much. Hao Ren stretched out and decided to take a break under the shade benches in the small roadside park. After the hottest hour at noon, he would go to a small restaurant to fill his stomach. Then he took the car home and went home.
Even with the rapid economic development, it can still maintain a bit of leisure and openness in a small place. He found a piece of paper to wipe the bench clean, then lay down, covered his face with the fold printed with the logo of the women's hospital and the beautiful girl, and rested indifferently.
But just as he lay down for less than a minute, the sun shining through the edge of the fold had dimmed, as if someone had come to his side. Hao Ren slightly accidentally showed his face and was shocked to find that the sky was already sunset, while a petite and slender female figure was standing next to him. This figure just blocked the sunset that had already set. Because the relationship against the light could not see the woman's appearance, it could only be confirmed through a dark outline that the other party was a short-haired slender girl with short hair.
"Yo, you're awake." ”
At this time, the strange girl seemed to finally realize that her position against the light made it difficult for people to see her appearance, so she grinned and turned slightly sideways so that the other person could see her appearance clearly.
A very beautiful girl - this was Hao Ren's first impression.
This mature girl has short hair with a shawl. She may be very fond of sports. Her skin is slightly wheat-colored, healthy and full of sunshine. Her beautiful appearance is the most noteworthy is that she has big eyes, which are more energetic than any pair of eyes Hao Ren has ever seen, as if the whole person's spirit and spirit should be penetrated from these eyes.
Behind her was a large suitcase that looked quite weighty.
Looking at Hao Ren who was a little stunned, this beautiful girl with short hair burst into an unprecedented brilliant giggle ( although it seems a little inappropriate to say so, Hao Ren did think it was a giggle) . The smile was clean and pure. Now it seems that it is rare to see it on the face of girls of the same age. The other party fumbled hard in his small bag for half a day. Finally, he took out a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Hao Ren. "Excuse me, you know where this place is." ”
Hao Ren patted his face to wake himself up, regardless of what was going on with this rash girl, but looked down at the address on the paper... Hey, I'm going to this is not my own home or this is not my own home.
Chapter 1
The twilight of the morning pierced the ink blue sky, and the vast sky was white with fish belly.
In Xianyu County, Wuzong Academy, in the back of the mountain forest, a skinny young man in a loose martial robe squatted down with both plates, the tip of his tongue against his teeth, and his whole body concentrated on the left and right punches. He struck a thick tree and hit a man.
The boxing method is smooth, retractable and retractable, the inner strength is contained without vomiting, the hardness is soft, and there is already a bit of heat in the boxing.
The young man's name is Su Yu. He is fourteen years old. He is handsome and handsome. He is tall and straight. He is childish.
In the dark-haired room, a pair of eyes as vast as the stars and as deep as the everlasting stars showed wisdom that did not match his age.
Three hours later, the sun hung high in the sky.
Su Yu stopped punching, looked down at the bloodstained fists, and sighed softly. "I worked twice as hard as others, and the results I gained were not half as good as those with superior qualifications. ”
"When I come to another world, I really don't know if it's a blessing or a curse. ”
Two months ago, Su Yu took a plane and unfortunately had an air crash. When he woke up, he found that he had traveled to a world called Shenyue Continent.
Become a student of a Wuzong school in the mainland, a certain Wuzong school.
It took him two months to digest the memory of the original owner.
In Shenyue Continent, martial arts are respected, the law of the jungle is the law of the jungle, and it is cruel and strict.
Human beings practice martial arts, reach the peak, and reach the realm of transcendence and sanctification.
Martial arts are divided into nine levels, each of which has three levels: Xiaocheng, Dacheng, and Peak.
Beyond the nine layers of martial arts and breaking the shackles, he leaped into a god and became a mythical figure, known as the "Holy King of the World".
The realm of human sage-king is the ultimate martial arts, which is the limit pursued by hundreds of millions of human beings.
Rumor has it that the Sacred King of the World can move mountains and fill the sea, soaring clouds and driving fog, and can do anything.
A holy king on earth, enough to change the fortune of a dynasty for a hundred years, is a god-like existence.
However, how difficult is cultivation in the world?
Su Yu is the supreme genius of Qingshan Town under the jurisdiction of Xianyu County. At the age of 14, he cultivated to the peak of the first level of martial arts and became a century-old genius in the minds of everyone in Qingshan Town.
However, when he was enrolled by Wuzong Academy in Xianyu County, which was above everything else, Su Yu realized what kind of frog he used to be at the bottom of the well.
Wuzong Academy collects all geniuses in Xianyu County and collects them once a year.
And he, of all the geniuses in Wuzong Academy, is only at the bottom
Wuzong Academy divides students into three categories according to their qualifications.
Golden students, excellent-level geniuses, are often the best in a city. Top geniuses who suppress other geniuses in the city will be trained by Wuzong University.
Silver cadets, potential level geniuses, have superior talents in small towns. With a little effort, there may be hope.
Su Yu is a silver student. He understands very well that in fact, silver students have no hope of cultivating to great success, but it is a pity to give up. It is a pity that food is tasteless and discarded, like chicken ribs.
Silver students are not optimistic. The cultivation resources given by the academy are very limited. The possibility of getting ahead is close to zero.
"Su Yu, hurry back to the academy, the Duke of Qin has summoned you to see you." "An urgent voice cut through the quiet sound of the mountain forest, and a middle-aged man in blue ran up the mountain panting, with a few anxious faces on his face."
"How can you neglect the Duke of Qin? Hit me up with this. "Blue clothes middle-aged impatient, came forward to buckle Su Yu shoulders, regardless of the pain Su Yu thin body, grabbed him quickly down the mountain, holding him down the mountain quickly."
Su Yu gritted his teeth, endured a sharp pain in his shoulder, and remained silent.
Blue middle-aged, is the deacon of the school, manages daily student activities, in the words of the Earth School, is the teaching director of the school.
After half a cup of tea.
Academy, a luxurious and elegant, exquisite as a dream lounge.
Only core students, senior officials of universities, and dignitaries can rest here. In addition, gold students and silver students are not eligible to do so.
Su Yu is also the first time to come to the luxury lounge, ordinary poor boys come here, may be nervous, it will be nervous. But Su Yu, in his previous life, was a business elite, a five-star hotel, a presidential suite, and a luxurious dance party. He was a frequent visitor, with a calm mentality and a sense of humiliation.
In the lounge, there are three people, a pair of young men and women, a noble temperament, extraordinary man extraordinary.
When his eyes swept over the 14-year-old girl, Su Yu's eyes paused for a moment.
It was a woman with a beautiful face like an elf. Her jade face was as delicate as a carving. Her skin was as fair as the snow of spring. Her figure was exquisite. She was dressed in white clothes that were not dirty. She looked like a fox fairy. She was very beautiful. She was very beautiful.
However, she looked at Su Yu's eyes, there is cold, there is a trace of complexity, as well as a trace of complexity.
Beside him is a sixteen-year-old boy, handsome, handsome, and expensive.
"Oh, I'm Duke of Qin, it's good to see you." "Qin Guogong, one of the three great dukes of the Fenglin Empire, at this time, but without any arrogance, but unusually cordial, with a smile, invited Su Yu to sit down and invited Su Yu to sit down."
Su Yu shook his head coldly in his heart, not moved by the kindness at all.
Those in high positions have attracted the attention of hundreds of millions of people, so they pay great attention to their own recuperation and their own image.
Just like politicians on earth, they are obviously at odds with each other, but after meeting, they still shake hands and greet each other with a smile on their faces. They only stab knives under the stage and do black hands.
"I am Qin Feng's father. This time, I came to him for his affair with Qing'er. "Qin Guogong handsome face, emerge warm smile" things, I have heard Feng er said, for this, as Feng er's father, I apologize to you, for this, I as Feng er's father, to you. ”
Bitterness flashed in Su Yu's heart, the bitterness of another Su Yu's remnant soul. The girl in front of her, named Jiang Xueqing, is a genius who came out of Qingshan Town with Su Yu. At the same time, she was included as a student of Wuzong Academy.
Two childhood sweethearts, two little guesses, golden boy and jade girl, a match made in heaven and earth.
However, after entering the Wuzong Academy, Jiang Xueqing, who came from a small village, was impacted by the huge and prosperous world, and gradually became intoxicated in the flashy world.
With her fox-like beauty, it is difficult to avoid being sought after by young dignitaries and handsome geniuses.
Initially, she was able to convince herself to stick to her heart and spend the first academic year with Su Yu.
However, gradually, she understood the cruelty of the world, and gradually transformed from an innocent little girl. It was difficult to have a future after knowing Su Yu. Following her, she was likely to suffer and become a subordinate.
Finally, her inner defense line loosened.
Two months ago, he completely cut off contact with Su Yu and became the son of Qin Guogong and the companion of Qin Feng, the duke of the small country.
Although Jiang Xueqing adheres to the duty of a good girl and has never overstepped the relationship between men and women, but since then, the two have often accompanied each other, inseparable, and become the envy of the immortal couple in everyone's eyes.
And Su Yu became the laughing stock of Wuzong Academy.
Su Yu was hit hard and begged Jiang Xueqing to change his mind many times. He didn't hesitate to kneel and beg, losing face, but Jiang Xueqing refused coldly, but all of them were coldly refused by Jiang Xueqing.
Su Yu could not bear the great sorrow of life and threw himself into the lake. It happened that Su Yu of the earth had an air crash, and his soul crossed over to him, a sad and pitiful weakling.
When the Duke of Qin saw Su Yu falling into memories, he only sighed when it was difficult for him to give up his friendship with Jiang Xueqing. He sighed and sighed. "Feng'er is young and ignorant, his fault, I am willing to pay compensation, what do you want, but, as a father, I hope you can fulfill Feng'er, he is serious to Xueqing girl, is serious to Xueqing girl, is serious." Xueqing girl, is serious about the matter. ”
Listening to Qin Guogong's words that seemed to come from the bottom of his heart, Su Yu shook his head secretly in his heart. This trick is okay to deceive ordinary people, but it is useless to him.
You stole my girlfriend and let me be fulfilled. This is not to apologize, it is clearly to overwhelm others with power.
Qin Guogong seemed to have a mild attitude, but in fact he was full of naked insults and insults.
Ask, if it is the monarch's woman, is the emperor's woman, by his son's eyes, he Qin Guogong, dare to let the monarch give his woman to Qin Feng? He didn't dare, because he couldn't afford to mess with the king, he could only afford to mess with civilians like Su Yu.
Su Yu shook his head lightly and got up to leave. He had no nostalgia for a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing. Even if Qin Guogong was not oppressive, he did not intend to compete for her.
As for Qin Guogong's so-called compensation, although Su Yu lacked cultivation resources, although he was a poor boy, although he had nothing to do with it. However, he still has a will not admit defeat and has not yet fallen to the step of being given alms.
Jiang Xueqing understood the character of "Su Yu" and stubbornly refused to admit defeat. Seeing that he wanted to leave, she only assumed that he still refused to give up. With a gentle bite of her silver teeth and a gentle movement of her lotus steps, her snowy eyes were like the glint of the cold moon. "Su Yu." Please respect my choice. ”
"Now that I have come to this day, I will speak out thoroughly, and I hope you will be willing to die." "Jiang Xueqing eyes flash cold."
"Qin Fenggui is a small duke, and he will surely be the pillar of the empire in the future. He can give me glory and wealth. Can you give me a poor boy from a mountain village? "? Can you give it to me? ”
"Qin Feng is respected as a golden student. In the future, he will catch up with the holy king of the world and stand above hundreds of millions of people. He can give me a sense of security. Can you give him a silver student? ”
"Su Yu, accept the reality. I don't deny that you used to be my nostalgia and the most dazzling genius in my heart, but that was because I was too young and simple. The real world is cruel and real. I have no choice but to choose. ”
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last trace of concern in her eyes, staring at Su Yu's eyes, gradually distant, as if looking at strangers, gently sigh, gently sigh. "Brother Feng is very good, as long as you promise not to look for me in the future, he will try his best to compensate you, give you a few Melting Spirit Pill, promote cultivation, your strength has improved, in school days will be a lot of good, in the day will be a lot of good, in the school days will be a lot of good, in the future will not look for me, he will try his best to compensate you, give you a few Melting Spirit Pills, promote cultivation, your strength will be improved, in the school days will be a lot of good, in the school days will be a lot of good, in the school days will be a lot of good, in the day will be a lot of good, in the school days will be a lot of good, in the school days will be a lot of good, in the day. ”
After thinking about it, Jiang Xueqing took out a palm-sized statue of a woman carved in crystal from her sleeve.
Glittering and translucent, shining with gorgeous deep luster. The most beautiful thing is that the woman in the crystal statue is ethereal and beautiful, like a fox fairy, so beautiful as a fairy, so fascinating.
The statue looks like a woman, lifelike, no different from its owner, Jiang Xueqing.
"This is the love gift you gave me, now, back to you, we, from now on two do not owe each other." "Jiang Xueqing, mercilessly stuffed the statue into Su Yu's hands, turned around and returned to Qin Feng's side, looking out into the sky, no longer looking at Su Yu, cold and heartless, no longer looking at Su Yu, cold and desperate.
"Chi Yao, I treat you like my love, why do you want to kill me? " He said. ”
Zhang Ruochen roared loudly, thinking of the previous pounce, pressed the bed made of gilt, and suddenly sat up with a "creak" sound.
Only after realizing that it was just a dream did Zhang Ruochen exhale a long breath and dry the sweat beads on his forehead with his sleeves.
No.
That was not a dream.
How could everything that happened between him and Princess Chi Yao be a dream?
Zhang Ruochen was originally the only son of "Emperor Ming", one of the nine emperors in the Kunlun Realm. At the age of 16, he cultivated to the perfection of the Heavenly Extreme Realm with a constitution that was opposed to heaven.
However, when he became the first person of the younger generation in the Kunlun world, he died at the hands of his childhood sweetheart's fiancée, Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chi Yao is the daughter of Qing Di, one of the nine emperors.
Emperor Ming and Emperor Qing were the best friends, and Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao were even more married. They grew up together and practiced together.
One is valiant and the other is extremely beautiful. She can be called a golden boy and jade girl. She could have become a beautiful story in the cultivation world. Zhang Ruochen never expected that Princess Chi Yao would attack him.
After dying at the hands of Princess Chi Yao, when Zhang Ruochen woke up again, he found himself eight hundred years later.
The former Princess Chi Yao quelled the rebellion of the Nine Emperors, unified the Nine Kingdoms, established the First Central Empire, and became the ruler of the entire Kunlun Realm - Empress Chi Yao.
Eight hundred years ago, the nine emperors who dominated the Kunlun world completely became the past and disappeared into the long river of history.
The Nine Emperors were dead, and the Empress was in charge.
In this era, there is only one emperor, that is, Empress Chi Yao, who rules the world and commands all directions.
"Why did she want to kill me?
How can her heart be so ruthless, or that women's hearts are so ruthless. "Zhang Ruochen's eyes were sharp, his heart sank like iron, and he was full of doubts about his belly. But like, no one can help him answer it.
Eight hundred years have passed, and the sea of mulberry fields has long since passed. The things are people and people. Except for the Empress Chi Yao, who is cultivated as a peerless person, her youth is still, and she is not old and dying.
Those who had been deceased had all turned into loess and turned into white bones. Even the mighty Nine Emperors of that year all disappeared in the world, leaving only a section of brilliant stories for future generations to recite for a long time.
"Squeak." ”
A beautiful woman in a weak palace dress walked in from the outside and looked at Zhang Ruochen sitting on the bed with a concerned look, "Dust, you have nightmares again." ”
The beautiful woman in front of her was the princess of Yunwu County King and Zhang Ruochen's mother, Concubine Lin.
The original owner of this body died on the bed three days ago because he was weak and sick.
After Zhang Ruochen was killed by Princess Chi Yao, he woke up again and appeared in this body, bringing the boy who had died of illness back to life and death.
More coincidentally, the original owner of this body, also known as Zhang Ruochen, is also known as Zhang Ruochen. When Zhang Ruochen just woke up, he still rejected Concubine Lin very much.
After all, in Zhang Ruochen's eyes, Lin Fei is just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Ruochen gradually found that Lin Fei was really very concerned about him, simply meticulous, see Zhang Ruochen nightmare was scared to wake up, but also regardless of the cold, immediately rushed to Zhang Ruochen room. Zhang Ruochen's room immediately came.
In his last life, Zhang Ruochen never saw his birth mother. It is said that she died when she was born.
Unexpectedly, after being killed by Princess Chi Yao, being reborn in this body actually gave him an extra mother and felt the warmth of maternal love. "Maybe she doesn't know that her dust died of illness three days ago." ”
If she were to be told the truth, she might not be able to withstand the blow of this bad news.
Zhang Ruochen looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes softened, and he smiled slightly. "Mother, don't worry about me. It's just a dream. ”
Concubine Lin's thin body was draped with a date-red hooded mink fur. She sat beside Zhang Ruochen's bed and stroked Zhang Ruochen's forehead. She was worried. "It's been three nights now, you've always been awakened by nightmares, every time you call 'Chi Yao' by the name of 'Chi Yao'." Who the hell is she? ”
Naturally, it is impossible for Concubine Lin to associate the name "Chi Yao" with the empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after Empress Chi Yao unified the Kunlun Realm and established the First Central Empire, she was known as the "Great Wisdom and Great Virtue female Holy Emperor", and no one dared to mention the word "Chi Yao" at ordinary times.
Will make taboos. Zhang Ruochen said. "It's nothing, mother, you heard wrong." ”
Concubine Lin sighed and said, "In the future, don't call the word 'Chi Yao' directly, even in a dream, that is the queen's taboo name." It is disrespectful to call the queen by her name directly. Once she is heard by someone with a heart, she will be executed. ”
Zhang Ruochen nodded, pinched his fingers tightly, and said with deep meaning. "Absolutely not anymore." "
From now on, I will be her nightmare.
Concubine Lin looked at Zhang Ruochen, who was thin and pale, and sighed softly, feeling extremely sad in her heart.
Although born in the family of the county king, but he has been weak and sick since childhood, has been sixteen years old, still can only lie in bed all year round, I am afraid this life can only be like this.
Outside, there was a messy sound of footsteps.
"What are you doing?
A beautiful maid tried to stop the eight princes who broke in, but was gently pushed by the eight princes and fell more than ten meters away. The eighth prince was a martial artist. He reached the late stage of the Yellow Extreme Realm with a palm strike, which was enough to knock a stone plate weighing 300 catties ten feet away. Not to mention that it was just a maid weighing 100 catties.
You can bounce her out with the flick of a finger.
The maid screamed and fell heavily to the ground, breaking her left arm and breaking it.
The Eighth Prince was dressed in a golden robe and wrapped in a jade belt around his waist. His body was strong, his arms were slender, and his pace was steady. He walked into the Jade Shu Palace and stared at the maid coldly. "A maidservant dares to stand in the way of this prince. He is really looking for death. He is really looking for death. ”
Behind the eight princes, there were six guards wearing Lin leather armor. They were tall and had a tiger back and a bear waist. They were obviously powerful martial arts monks. They belonged to the guards of the palace.
After Concubine Lin heard the commotion outside and calmed Zhang Ruochen's emotions, she closed the door and walked out.
She stared at the eight princes standing outside, frowned slightly, and said. "Your Highness, the Eighth Prince, this is Yushu Palace. Even if you are a prince, you can't rush in." ”
The eighth prince Zhang Ji raised his head and stared at Concubine Lin, with a loud voice. "The queen has ordered that the dormitory of Concubine Lin and her ninth brother be changed to the 'Ziyi Partial Hall'." In the future, the owner of Yushu Palace will be the biological mother of this prince, Princess Xiao. ”
Concubine Lin's face changed slightly. She had expected this day to come, but she did not expect it to come so soon.
Concubine Lin smiled miserably and said, "Is the queen going to drive our mother and son out of Yushu Palace so soon? " Well, okay.
Mother said that she wanted to settle in Yushu Palace tonight. Please ask Princess Lin to move to the side hall now. ”
The eighth prince smiled coldly, not polite in the slightest. "Concubine Lin, there are many poor people in this world, but not everyone is worthy of pity." But not everyone is worthy of pity. Since the ninth brother is weak and sickly, what is he still living in the world? ”
"He's your ninth brother. ”
Concubine Lin wanted to say something more. Suddenly, the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruochen's body was weak, and he could barely stand with his hands on the doorpost, staring at the eight princes not far away.
His seemingly weak and windless body seemed to contain an unyielding will. "Don't ask them, we will move out now." ”
"Dust, why did you get out of bed? " Dust, why did you get out of bed? It's cold outside, so I'm not going back soon. "Concubine Lin hurried forward to help Zhang Ruochen, for fear that he would catch the cold wind."
Concubine Lin looked at Zhang Ruochen's firm eyes and seemed to be infected by his emotions. She nodded with tears in her eyes.
Concubine Lin and Sam supported Zhang Ruochen and walked out of the Jade Wash Palace step by step, except for the maid who was pushed out by the Eighth Prince and broke her arm.
None of the other servants followed them out of the Yushu Palace. Everyone can see that Concubine Lin and the Ninth Prince have completely lost their power, and it is difficult for them to have a foothold in the county palace.
Originally, they were the servants of Yushu Palace, but now they naturally and wisely chose to stay in Yushu Palace, and all went to please the new master, the Eighth Prince.
Ziyi Partial Hall, usually the place where the princess who had fallen out of favor lived, was very remote and covered with fallen leaves. It seemed that no one had lived in it for a long time.
The night is deep, and the cold wind is bleak.
Sitting on the cold stone bench, Zhang Ruochen's thin body was wrapped in a coat, but he still felt cold and cold.
"This body is too weak. Only by practicing martial arts can the body gradually become stronger and stronger.
Otherwise, even if I am the son of the county king now, I can still only be manipulated by others. "Zhang Ruochen thought to himself."
Eight hundred years have passed, and Zhang Ruochen doesn't know where he can go now.
Since God has arranged for him to be reborn in this body, whether it is for the sake of revenge against Empress Chi Yao in the future, or for the sake of the mother who takes good care of herself, he must become stronger. The humiliation and cold treatment I suffer today is entirely because I am too weak to resist, unable to control my own destiny, and even the place where I live is occupied by others.
If you want to get the respect of others and want to get a warm and comfortable living environment, you must become a warrior and prove your ability to do so.
In the Kunlun Realm, if you want to become a martial artist, you must first open the "Divine Martial Mark".
The so-called "Divine Martial Mark" is the qualification given by the gods to human beings to practice martial arts.
Those who do not open the "Divine Martial Mark" will never be able to cultivate true qi, and will not be able to become strong between heaven and earth. Zhang Ruochen was already sixteen years old and still hadn't opened the "Divine Martial Mark".
After the age of sixteen, he missed the best age to practice martial arts. Even if he opened the "Divine Martial Mark", it was impossible to achieve much achievement.
They are also the sons of Yunwu County King, why eight princes can be superior. Can drive Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin out of Yushu Palace?
It is because when the Eighth Prince was ten years old, he opened the "Divine Martial Mark". Now he is a young martial artist in the late Yellow Extreme Realm.
"As long as I open the 'Shenwu Seal', I can practice the Nine Days Ming Emperor Sutra."
With the mystery of the Nine Days Ming Emperor Sutra, even if I have missed the best cultivation age, it is still possible to catch up with other geniuses and become a martial arts powerhouse again. "Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra" is the supreme treasure of Ming Emperor cultivation, in addition to Ming Emperor, only Zhang Ruochen knows the complete cultivation method of "Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra", and then only Zhang Ruochen knows the complete cultivation method of "Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra".
"Tomorrow is the sacrificial ceremony. I hope to get the approval of the gods and open the 'Divine Martial Mark' ”
Zhang Ruochen tightened his fist and was eager to open the "Shenwu Mark".
After Concubine Lin tidied up the room, she came over to help Zhang Ruochen, "Chen'er, you should rest early." And tomorrow I’ m going to the sacrificial ceremony. ”
Don't worry, mother. I will definitely be able to open the 'Divine Martial Seal' tomorrow. "Zhang Ruochen said.
"Well, I'm sorry."
Concubine Lin took a deep look at Zhang Ruochen, and sighed softly in her heart.
Chapter 1
With a bang, a rusty iron door was opened, and the lingering sound of the iron door was blocked by the surrounding ancient buildings.
After a dozen breaths, a young man with a drooping head was dragged out of the iron gate by two jailers, dragging his arms. The young man with a drooping head seemed to have no breath, and even his arms were thin and only bones remained. The tattered, blood-stained clothes on his body showed how devastated and tortured the young man had been.
The thin man was thrown to the ground by two jailers, splashing some dust, and then there was no movement.
"This kid should be dead, right? "A chunky jailer asked, staring at the young man who was lying motionless on the ground.
Another jailer hum, "should be dead, who let him do not know whether to live or die, dare to be rude to Miss Jane." He actually dared to be rude to Miss Jane. Now it's good, not only was the Ning Mansion destroyed, but he himself was also liberated. It's just that he should live. ”
"Old Hui, be careful what you say, we'll drag him out and deal with it first, and then we'll talk about it." "The short and fat jailer quickly warned.
Hearing the words of this chubby jailer, the other jailer called Lao Hui involuntarily shrank his head and was about to pull up the man who had no breath on the ground, ready to drag him away.
Just then, a somewhat weak voice shouted, "Brothers, I want to take my husband away." ”
Only then did the two talking jailers see a woman in coarse linen standing on the side. Although the woman was wearing coarse linen, she could still vaguely see her vulgar gesture. The only regret is that her face has been disfigured and covered by slightly messy hair, which makes people reluctant to look at it again for a second time.
Both jailers recognized the woman, one of the only two surviving members of the Ning family left alive.
Ning Gao was the butler of the Ning Mansion. When the Ning Mansion was raided, he left the Cang Qin Kingdom to go out on business, so he escaped a bullet. And this woman is the daughter-in-law of Ningfu, and also the wife of this thin man who was just thrown out of prison. Her name is Ji Luofei.
She escaped a disaster by staying at Cangqin Erxing College. Of course, this is also because Ji Luofei has little to do with the Ning family. The reason why she married the Ning family is because the Ning family and the Ji family are family friends. She and Ning Cheng have been engaged since childhood. It's just that the Ji family declined in the most inexplicable way, leaving only a disfigured Princess Jiluo in the end.
Even so, Ning Hongchang, the grandfather of Ningcheng, still took Ji Luofei into the mansion. Prepare to wait for Ningcheng to really gather gas, and then let the two get married.
"Okay, okay, drag it away. It's ugly to put it here. "The chubby jailer collected the silver coins and waved impatiently, saying.
They were going to dispose of Ning Cheng's body, but they did not expect someone to come and dispose of it, and return the silver coins. Of course, they would not refuse such a good thing.
When Ji Luofei heard this, she quickly carried Ning Cheng on her back, accelerated her speed, and soon disappeared from the prison gate.
"If this Ji Luofei hadn't been disfigured, she would have been a beautiful embryo either." "Looking at Ji Luofei's back, another jailer tossed the silver coin in his hand and said in a judgmental tone, " In a judgmental tone.
"Don't talk nonsense, that Ji Luofei is also a Cang Qin two-star academy people, even if it is ugly, it is not our turn." "The chunky jailer patted the talking jailer on the shoulder and pulled him into the iron gate again.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled an extremely pleasant fragrance. The first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a white neck. The next moment, Ning Xiaocheng reacted. He was carried by a woman, and the fragrance came from the woman who was carrying him.
No, he remembered that after being rejected by Tian Muwan, he was in a very bad mood. As a result, he went the wrong way. One person went to the elevated road and went to the elevated road. Then a yellow light from the sky hit him, and then there was nothing and then it was.
Could it be that he is not dead yet? why the hell is this?
Ning Xiaocheng just thought of here, all kinds of information crowded into his mind, he was reborn, even if he was born again.
To Ning Xiaocheng's horror, his reborn body was originally called Ning Cheng. He was shocked because his original name was also Ningcheng.
It was only because he often had a nightmare that he saw himself in a very strange place, being secretly imprisoned by someone, and then tortured to death. Although it was just a dream, Ning Cheng still changed his name to Ning Xiaocheng.
Unexpectedly, he still called Ning Cheng, and was really reborn in the environment of his dream.
Ning Xiaocheng wanted to raise his hand to wipe the cold sweat on his forehead, but the woman carrying him looked back and did not say much.
Sorry, I don't have the strength to walk. "Seeing that the woman looked back at herself, Ning Xiaocheng apologized and said apologetically."
"The Ning family is gone, you are lucky to be alive." You are already very lucky to be alive. "The woman's tone was calm, it seemed that even if Ning Xiaocheng really died, she had this calm attitude." She also had this calm attitude.
Ning Xiaocheng fell silent. He had sorted out some bits and pieces of information just now. He should now be called back to Ningcheng, the only member of the Cang Qin Guoning family.
Ningcheng's parents went to the Mango Sea to look for spiritual objects when Ningcheng was very young, and then never came back. Ningcheng has been living with his grandfather Ning Hongchang in Cangle City, the capital of Cangqin State. Although the Ning Mansion is large, there are not many people.
Of course, Ningcheng also became the first person in Ningfu, and Ning Hongchang never cared about Ningcheng. All the bad things Ning Cheng did in Cangle City were carried down by Ning Hongchang. Cangle City is full of princes and nobles. Although Ning Hongchang is also the elder of Cangqin Kingdom, he is still inferior to those princes and nobles.
Finally, one day, Ningcheng made a basket that even he could not bear. He actually offended Jian Sujie, the apple of the eye of the Jian family in Cangqin State. Don't say that the Jian family can't be provoked by the Ning family, that is, Qiu Yingguang, the fiancé of Jian Sujie, and the Ning family can't afford to be provoked by the Ning family.
Thinking of this, Ning Cheng sighed and sighed. The result he could not afford was, of course, imprisonment. Grandpa Ning Hongchang exhausted his connections and family wealth in order to protect him. As a result, he was not saved, but instead took the entire Ning family into the prison. This news or his predecessor learned from the jailer's mouth, it can be said that the Ning family is also because he was destroyed.
After Ning Cheng sorted out these things, he sighed again in his heart, there is no reason in this world, whoever has a big fist is the reason.
At the same time, he also understood who the person carrying him was. The disfigured woman was his fiancee, called Ji Luofei, which was somewhat similar to a child bride on Earth.
Later, the Ji family inexplicably declined, leaving only a disfigured Ji Luofei. But Ning Cheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still took Ji Luofei to the Ning family and prepared to help the two get married after Ning Cheng gathered his energy.
Ning Hongchang indulged Ning Cheng in other things, but on the matter of marrying Princess Jiluo as his wife, he would never let him step in. The original Ningcheng was very dissatisfied with the disfigured Princess Jiluo, and often scolded her without beating. Fortunately, Princess Jiluo was submissive and never refuted anything to Ningcheng. Moreover, Princess Jiluo is different from Ning Cheng. She has qualifications and can cultivate.
Not only that, but also with the help of the Ning family, into the Cang Qin two-star academy, and is already a gathering qi three layer cultivator. In the Cang Qin Kingdom, anyone who can cultivate is called a cultivator.
By this time, Ji Luofei had already carried him into an extremely low black stone house. Although the Black Stone House is low, its area is not very small, at least it should have some. There is even a small courtyard with a deep well in it.
Even if it concerns himself, Ningcheng must clarify this matter. And even though he guessed it was the Jian family and the Qiu family who did it, he had to ask for some clarification.
"Why ask me what you did yourself? "Concubine Ji Luo simply replied and put Ningcheng down."
After saying that, she poured another glass of water and fed it to Ningcheng, then said, ''Zacchao.'' Then he said, ''Zacchao.'' She poured another glass of water and fed it to Ningcheng. "I go to boil water to give you a bath, and some things will be forgotten, you know, it is not good for you to do so. You know that it is not good for you." ”
Ningcheng watched Concubine Ji Luo go in to boil water, and did not continue to ask, he understood what Concubine Ji Luo meant. With his ability, the more he knows, the faster he dies.
I don't know if Ji Luofei added something to that glass of water. Ningcheng felt that after drinking this glass of water, the whole person regained some strength.
Ning Cheng sat on the old wooden couch, thinking of his current situation in his mind, and then thinking of his sister Ning Ruolan. At the same time, he really didn't understand why Tian Muwan treated him like that. According to his understanding of Tian Muwan, Tian Muwan was definitely not that kind of snobbish girl.
Chapter 1
Chu Li drove the boat on the lake, and the lake breeze was blowing on his face, refreshing and refreshing.
Duke Yi's Mansion is a vast lake with ninety-nine islands. The Yanwu Hall he is going to is eighteen miles away from the East Garden.
On the boat, he was of medium stature, dressed in a blue shirt, but his appearance was usually quite heroic. Looking at the vast lake, his thoughts drifted away.
Nineteen years, two months and three days, it has been nineteen years, two months and three days.
A researcher in high-energy physics, a promising academic, a great scientist in the future, a small mistake in the experiment, came to this world after the explosion, reincarnated and turned over a new person.
"Bang." "The muffled sound broke his contemplation. Turning around, a golden carp jumped non-stop on the boat.
Chu Li shook his head and bent down to throw the carp back into the lake. Straightening up, a tall building caught his eye.
The 100-meter-tall building flashes with bronze light, heavy and solemn, showing the majesty of the state government.
This bronze high-rise is a martial arts hall.
In front of the martial arts hall is an open martial arts training ground, paved with red mud. Hundreds of people are practicing martial arts, practicing swords, boxing, and palms, or competing with each other. It is very lively and lively.
Chu Li went ashore by boat and set foot on the martial arts training ground. Without taking a few steps, a handsome young man suddenly appeared. His face was like a crown jade, his eyebrows like a sword, and his expression was flying.
He was tall and tall, a head taller than Chu Li, holding his shoulders and looking down at him. "Chu, what are you doing here? "  ”
Chu Li frowned. "Get out of the way, good dogs don't get in the way. ”
The handsome young man laughed and said. "It's hard to believe that you want to practice martial arts." ”
Chu Li suddenly smiled and continued to walk forward. "Zhuo Feiyang, I fell to the ground and screamed, believe it or not, you will not be able to eat and walk around." ”
Fu Wei forbids private fighting, and forbids killing each other. Fu Wei is divided into guards and bodyguards, one martial artist and one martial artist. Private fighting is especially strictly prohibited between the two.
Chu Li is an unqualified bodyguard, while Zhuo Feiyang is an eighth-grade bodyguard. It is taboo for a bodyguard to attack a bodyguard. He screams when he falls to the ground. No matter how talented Zhuo Feiyang is, he will be severely punished.
Zhuo Feiyang Jian eyebrows wrinkled. "Chu, OK, shameless enough." "Chu Li continued to walk forward."
Zhuo Feiyang stepped aside, with a gloomy handsome face. "Chu, you can only use these small means." ”
Chu Li smiled and said. "To deal with a fool like you, small means are enough." ”
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him, clenched his fists more and more tightly, as if waving them out the next moment, but Chu Li looked at him lazily, full of provocation flavor.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly showed a bright smile and raised his hand vigorously. "Junior Sister Zhao. ”
In the distance, a graceful and beautiful girl curls up, her skin races snow, apricot eyes and willow eyebrows, temperament Chu Chu, gentle as water, gentle as water.
Chu Li's face changed slightly. Zhao Ying entered the mansion with them at the same time. She was beautiful, kind, and gentle. She was the kind of woman that men would like to meet.
"Brother Zhuo, Zhuo." "Zhao Ying walked over lightly and said in surprise." "Brother Chu, Senior Brother Chu. ”
Chu Li sniffed the faint fragrance she brought and smiled. "Junior Sister Zhao, it's been a long time." ”
Since he was assigned to the East Garden, he spent most of his time in the library. He wanted to use knowledge to change his destiny. He rarely came to perform in the martial hall.
This time, I came to the martial arts hall because I encountered problems in practicing the Small Pulse Cleansing Technique. I would like to have a look at the secrets and practice notes related to the Small Pulse Cleansing Technique.
Zhao Ying smiled and said. "Brother Chu, congratulations, East Garden is a beautiful job." ”
Chu Li smiled and nodded. "It's not bad. ”
The East Garden directly belongs to the third lady Xiao Qi's Yu Qi Island. Only he and Li Yue are the guards. They are not only leisurely and comfortable, but also have the opportunity to meet the third lady. Once they get the green eyes of the third lady, they can achieve great success in the near future.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath. This guy was so lucky that he actually entered the East Garden. God was so blind that he had to take good care of him.
"Junior Sister Zhao, don't pay any attention to this waste. I just practiced the Swordbreaker Technique yesterday. Let's learn from each other." ”
Zhao Ying frowned and felt that Zhuo Feiyang's words were ugly.
"Okay, not to mention his trash. It's just useless. "Zhuo Feiyang busy compensating for his smile, swept a glance at Chu Li, Chu Li." "Even though he's just a waste." ”
Zhao Ying stared discontentedly.
"Junior Sister Zhao, it's okay, " Chu Li said with a smile. "There is no need to be concerned about such arrogant fools. ”
"Brother Chu, Senior Brother Chu. "Zhao Ying said angrily."
Chu Li reached out and made a gesture of surrender. "Junior Sister Zhao, come and play in the East Garden. The scenery is very beautiful. Brother Li's cooking skills are also excellent. ”
"Hmph, what's there to see" he said. "Zhuo Feiyang curled his lips." "But it's just flowers and plants. It's not as good as practicing martial arts when you have that time. Playing with things has lost your ambition. "According to what you said, the third lady and the eldest son are both playthings and have lost their ambition, so it's not as good as you are." "Chu Li seems to be smiling rather than laughing. The West Garden belongs to the eldest son Xiao Tieying.
Zhuo Feiyang handsome face red, sneer again and again, decided not to quarrel with him.
"Brother Zhuo, Zhuo." Senior Brother Chu. "Zhao Ying said angrily in dissatisfaction." "Why don't you stop for a while? Why don't you stop? ... Brother Chu, I will go over to play. If you have something to do, be busy first. ”
Chu Li took a deep look at her and gave her a deep glance. "Junior Sister Zhao, someone has a good skin. It takes a long time to see people's hearts. Junior Sister, don't trust others easily. ”
"Chu, what do you mean? " ”
Chu Li ignored him and hugged Zhao Ying with a smile.
Zhao Ying turned and left.
Zhuo Feiyang was busy trying to keep up. When he was about to leave, he suddenly stretched out his hand while Zhao Ying was not paying attention.
He almost slapped Chu Li in the face, very confident that Chu Li had no time to avoid, seemingly not paying attention, but it was the internal force, the speed is extremely fast, the speed is extremely fast, very confident that Chu Li has no time to avoid, seemingly not paying attention, but it is the internal force, and the speed is extremely fast.
Chu Li gently tilted his head, Zhuo Feiyang's fingertips brushed against his cheeks, and he could feel the breeze. The strength of this palm was not light.
"Snap." ”
A crisp loud slap sounded.
Chu Li slapped his left palm on his face, crisp and loud, with little force and a loud voice, and then quickly withdrew his hand.
Zhao Ying hurriedly turned her head to look at it. Chu Li's expression remained unchanged, as if the palm hadn't hit him on the face.
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him gloomily. Chu Li smiled and touched his face. "It's really good kung fu. I admire it. ”
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him deadpan.
"Brother Zhuo--" "Zhao Ying sank her jade face."
"I'm sorry, I really didn't mean it. "Zhuo Feiyang gritted his teeth, his voice squeezed out of his teeth, and said coldly." "I'm sure Younger Martial Brother Chu won't care, right, Younger Martial Brother Chu." ”
Chu Li turned his head and smiled. "Junior Sister Zhao, forget it." ”
Zhao Ying looked at him in embarrassment and hurriedly dragged Zhuo Feiyang away. If they stayed any longer, the two would have to fight.
Chu Li stared at Zhao Ying's graceful back motionless, touched the hot left face, started the big round mirror wisdom to suppress mood fluctuations.
If it weren't for Da Yuan Jingzhi, Zhuo Feiyang would inevitably be plotted against by Zhuo Feiyang.
In this world, martial arts are respected and deeply rooted in his heart since childhood. Zhao Ying is gentle and kind, protecting himself openly and secretly, which makes him quite moved.
But as a man, he needs a woman to protect him. As a man, he really can't bear it.
He walked through the crowd on the martial arts training ground and entered the martial arts hall.
He took off the wooden plate at his waist and handed it to the young man in front of the hall. The young man's eyes were electric, and he glanced at it to signal that he could enter.
There were rows of bookshelves in sight. He walked casually, stopped occasionally, reached out and pulled out a book, quickly flipped through it, put it back and continued to walk, stopped again, pulled out another book and flipped through it again.
In an hour, he flipped through twenty-two books.
As if he already knew the location of these books, it was good to pull them out directly. In fact, it was his first time here. The small washing vein recipe was seen in the library.
The entire martial arts hall was presented in his mind, every row of bookshelves, the name of every book, clearly and vividly.
He walked to the second floor and went directly to the third row of bookshelves. On the second floor, he pulled out the Broken Delusion Sword Spectrum, rummaged through it, and then pulled out seven secret chambers. It was the cultivation experience of Broken Delusion Sword Spectrum.
When he left the Martial Arts Hall, his mind was already imprinted with thirty secret collections, twenty-two small pulse washing notes, one delusion breaking sword spectrum, and seven delusion breaking sword training experiences.
He drove the boat on the lake, the breeze came slowly, and the original raging anger had dissipated.
Thirty secret books in my mind began to merge.
The midday sun was burning, and he sailed back to the East Garden.
The East Garden is a small island with a radius of two miles, divided into flower beds, each with a rare flower, and the whole island is floating with the fragrance of flowers.
There was only one small courtyard on the island. Chu Li pushed the door into the courtyard, and a cool breath came to his face. A big tree covered half of the courtyard, driving away the heat.
He entered the west wing, brought out a Qingfeng sword, and waved it in the center of the courtyard, slowly like a Taiji sword. In a moment, he sweated and his forehead shone brightly.
He never forgets it at a glance, and the secrets he has read are imprinted in his mind once. The puzzling swordsmanship he just learned from the Martial Arts Hall is indeed amazingly powerful, but it also consumes a lot of energy.
"Squeak... A strong young man walked out of the main hall, with a big face and small eyes.
He staggered like a black bear, stretched his waist twice, yawned twice, and spoke lazily until he spoke lazily. "Brother, I'm back so early. ”
Chu Li focused on practicing his sword, and he only gave a hum. Li Yue, a nine-grade bodyguard, is in charge of the East Garden together. He has a good appetite for food, excellent cooking skills, and good martial arts skills. However, he is afraid of death and will not break into the nine-grade building. He is willing to be a bodyguard.
Guogongfu bodyguards and guards are divided into nine grades, wages difference of ten times, wages difference of ten times.
Guards pay less, grade to endure seniority, three years nine products, ten years eight products, twenty years seven products, forty years six products, seventy years five products, seventy years five products. Guard upgrade regardless of other only look at martial arts, break through the nine-grade building, break through the first floor and one-grade promotion.
He has a lot of money, and he can often go out of the house to do tasks, and live a colorful and colorful life. Unlike guards who can only stay in the house to serve people, anyone with a little ability can be a guard.
Li Yue shook his neck, stretched his legs, and made a series of crackling noises at his joints. Then he began to practice with his fist, which was like a meteor, whistling the wind.
"Brother, don't practice swords, practice boxing with me, " he said. ”
Chu Li spat out two words, a layer of soybean sweat on his forehead.
Martial arts flourished in this world, and practicing martial arts started with children.
After the age of eight to eighteen, once the meridians are finalized, no matter how magical the mental method is, it will take twice the result with half the effort. It will take several times as long to build the foundation.
Before the age of eighteen, he grew up in the Akiba Temple where the Great Wisdom Source Sutra of Sophora flavescens was taught, and missed the opportunity to build a foundation. The spirit is twice that of ordinary people, and the spirit is tyrannical.
In addition, he was a high-energy physics researcher in his previous life, and his understanding of the world is far from being comparable to that of ordinary people.
With the combination of the two, he finally practiced the source sutra of great wisdom and achieved the supernatural power of great circle mirror wisdom.
His spirit is strong, his cultivation duration is far longer than that of ordinary people, his supernatural powers are in his body, and his observation is subtle. Therefore, the progress of his small pulse washing formula is very fast, and he can build a foundation in five years.
"Hehe... , with your sword, the chicken can't be killed, what are you doing? ”
Chu Li suddenly withdrew his sword and snorted. "Compare. ”
He was panting heavily and his whole body was soft. He leaned his sword on the ground to support himself. Breaking the false sword technique was too exhausting.
1. Chapter 1
In the antique room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
This was the instinctive reaction of an excellent special forces soldier.
As soon as the hand fell, an electric shock-like soreness came, causing a wave of weakness.
Ling Tian opened his eyes.
There was a gentle female voice in my ear.
Ling Tian saw a delicate face, looking at him with a caring face.
This is a classical beauty, so beautiful that it is suffocating. It can be used to describe her as a pouring country and a pouring city.
Ling Tian, a native of China.
He served in the most outstanding Wolf Fang special operations force in China. During his service, he made countless contributions.
He participated in the world-class special forces competition, won the personal honor of being the first in individual combat ability, and was recognized as the "King of Soldiers" by the people.
Later, in a transnational SSS-class mission, because of his personal negligence, a comrade-in-arms sacrificed to the death of a comrade-in-arms.
Under self-blame, he chose to retire and left Wolf Fang.
After retiring, he was silent for a period of time and chose to go abroad, becoming an ace in one of the most prestigious mercenary organizations in the world.
As long as it is his task, the success rate is 100% of the unprecedented ancients.
Although he retired from Wolf Fang for many years, he still cares about China.
As long as it is a mission that is unfavorable to China, not only will he not accept it, but he will also find out the person who issued the mission and carry out cruel and inhumane killing.
Over time, he became a thorn in the side and a thorn in the flesh of countries other than China.
In the eyes of other countries, he is a ticking time bomb.
However, as each killer evaporated from the world, Ling Tian lived more and more happily, and no killer dared to take this 'death mission' anymore.
Killing Ling Tian is tantamount to seeking his own death. This is a well-known word in the world of mercenaries and killers.
Throughout the earth, he rarely encountered opponents and had never been defeated.
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted agent.
Country R has created a colorless and odorless biological and chemical weapon intended to be transported into China to carry out a terrible conspiracy.
Of course, Ling Tian will not sit idly by and watch this.
He did it.
With the help of the broker, the location of the batch of biological weapons was found.
Just as he was killing a bloody path, he entered the underground research room and prepared to destroy the batch of biological and chemical weapons when they were destroyed. The underground research room was suddenly dented, trapping him in a fully enclosed cage.
When I saw people from R country holding all kinds of guns, they appeared outside the cage. Ling Tian understood.
He was betrayed by the person he trusted the most.
Otherwise, with his shrewdness, the conspiracy of the R people would not have succeeded in it.
Until he was killed by random gunfire, Ling Tian still couldn't figure it out.
"God, what's wrong with you? Don't scare your mother. ”
A gentle voice came, full of anxiety.
He was absolutely certain that he did not know this woman.
But the woman's eyes now seem to be looking at her closest relatives, without any hypocrisy, full of sincerity.
Just when Ling Tian was about to argue with this beautiful woman, just as he was preparing to argue with her.
If Ling Tian was struck by lightning, he was completely stunned, as if he had been punctured.
The only thing that makes Ling Tian satisfied is that this guy is also called Ling Tian, whose full name is 'Duan Ling Tian''.
Duan Lingtian, fifteen years old, was fifteen years old.
Qingfeng town Li Jiawai surnamed son, Qingfeng town Li Jiawai.
His mother, ‘ Li Rou’, was the ninth elder of the Li family.
His father In his memory, there was no father at all.
In the process of fusing this unfamiliar memory, Ling Tian also knew the reason why Duan Ling Tian was lying in bed with serious injuries.
Early this morning, Li Xin, the youngest son of the seventh elder of the Li family, scolded Duan Lingtian for being a bastard born by a mother but not taught by a father.
However, how could he, who hadn't even completed the quenching process, be the opponent of Li Xin, who was directly seriously injured by Li Xin and was dying?
After fusing all the strange memories, Ling Tian sighed in his heart.
He knew that from this moment on, he would integrate into this strange world as Duan Lingtian.
From now on, he is Duan Lingtian, Duan Lingtian is him.
"Ma'am, the master has sent for the medicine. ”
There was a sound in his ear, and Duan Lingtian looked up.
A servant girl hurried in from outside the room and handed Li Rou the exquisite box in her hand.
The box was opened. Suddenly, the fragrance of medicine drifted away.
"Tian'er, come and take the elixir. My mother will heal your wounds." ”
Li Rou took out a black elixir from it and handed it to Duan Lingtian's mouth.
Taking a deep breath, Duan Lingtian opened his mouth and swallowed the pill.
The entrance of the elixir melted, turned into a warm current, and entered his body.
Then, Duan Lingtian saw it again.
A cold airflow entered his body and turned the elixir into a warm current to heal his wounds.
An hour later, Li Rou stopped.
Duan Lingtian found that most of the soreness on his body had disappeared without any burden.
What he just took was an elixir of immortality.
At this time, Duan Lingtian found that Li Rou's face was pale and her forehead was still sweating. It was obvious that he had spent a lot of energy to heal his wounds.
"Mother, are you all right? " ”
Duan Lingtian felt warm in his heart.
This 'Niang' was called affectionately without any unnaturalness.
"Mother is fine, just take a break and rest for a while." ”
Li Rou smiled and shook her head.
For the sake of his son, consuming this essence energy is nothing.
"He and the Seventh Elder are still waiting in the Criminal Court." "Half an hour later, the servant girl walked into the room again and said softly."
"Put it. Tell the man the master has sent that I will take care of it myself and personally take care of it. ”
The amiability on Li Rou's face was gone, and her face was cold.
"Mother, what kind of elixir did you give me just now? I feel that my injury is almost healed. ”
Duan Lingtian got out of bed and stretched his body slightly.
"That's the'Eighth Grade Golden Creation Pill '" ”
It turned out that even the Li family in Qingfeng Town only had two of these eighth-grade Golden Creation Pills. Now, one of them has been used on his son with a foreign surname.
Obviously, his mother's position in the Li family is not low.
"Tian'er, the head of the family is still waiting, let's go over and do it." ”
Li Rou took Duan Lingtian to a spacious courtyard of the Li family's mansion.
This is the place where the Li family enforces the family law. Court.
It was noon and the scorching sun was in the sky.
There were people standing around the court, all the children of the Li family watching the fun.
In the courtyard, a teenager was tied to Xing Zhu and exposed to the sun, with two middle-aged people standing beside him.
The cross-eyed middle-aged man on the right saw Duan Lingtian's mother and son, with an angry face on his face.
"Duan Lingtian is also here... The efficacy of the family's treasured Eighth Stage Golden Pill is really fierce. "Yes, I also saw Duan Lingtian when he was carried back. He was half dead. ”
"Li Xin is also, usually casually bully Duan Lingtian also even if, nine elders will not say anything, but this time he unexpectedly under such a heavy hand, almost killed Duan Lingtian, nine elders do not get mad, it is strange that nine elders do not get mad. ”
One by one, the children of the Li family saw Li Rou and Duan Lingtian coming and whispered to each other.
Li Rou took Duan Lingtian and saluted the middle-aged man on the left.
"Ninth Elder, there was something wrong with my son Li Xin today, but now that your son is fine and my son has been exposed to the sun for a morning, can you put him down? "? ”
At this moment, the cross-eyed middle-aged man, that is, the seven elders of the Li family 'Li Kun', a face of haze, haze.
Who knows, Li Rou didn't pay attention to him at all.
Instead, he brought Duan Lingtian to Li Xin, who was tied up in front of him.
"Tian'er, how did he hurt you in the morning, now, you will return all of it to him one by one." "Chapter 1
When Gu Xijiu woke up, he found a fatal problem. The surrounding environment has changed so that she doesn't recognize it at all.
Looking out through the gap in the corridor, there was a moon hanging in the sky, and the stars were shining all over the sky, and she was lying horizontally being carried forward.
She was a little confused, couldn't help but move, and then discovered a more deadly problem - she was naked. Her body was only wrapped in a thin silk quilt, which wrapped her tightly from head to toe, and only a pair of eyes were exposed outside.
Her cold eyes first fell on the two big men carrying her.
Kong Wu is powerful, his muscles are knotted, and he is dressed as a warrior in ancient costume. Although he is carrying people to walk, he is silent. At first glance, he is practicing his martial arts skills. The appearance of martial arts is not low.
Gu Xijiu's fingers tightened in the quilt.
She is the king of modern killers, ruthless and ruthless, and she roams the world, but she did not expect to encounter the assassination of the person she trusts the most. That person's name is Long Xi, who was her former instructor and doctor. She doesn't trust anyone, but she trusts him and even likes him. If you want to marry him, you want to marry him.
She was already dead, but instead of having tea with Yan Wangye, she somehow came here inexplicably.
At this time, of course, she would not think that she had arrived at any shooting base.
She crossed over.
Crossing into this body, he was wrapped like a zongzi carried to a rather luxurious hall.
"Ah ...... Ah ...... Help ...... Help ...... Ah, ah, don't ...... "The woman's delicate and painful scream came out instantly, calling back Gu Xijiu's drifting thoughts. Her eyes swept quickly and froze slightly. The natural beauty of the decoration in the hall is beautiful, whether it is a rosewood table and chair, or a flower and bird tortoise screen, all show two words - luxurious - luxurious - luxurious - beautiful.
The man above was handsome and twenty-seven or eight years old. His long hair was pinned with a green jade hairpin, and it was scattered on his shoulders. His muscles were smooth and his movements were strong and powerful. His lips were slightly pursed and lightly hooked with a cold smile. It was considered to be a cool and handsome fierce man.
Below was a tender girl. She looked very young and had beautiful eyebrows. Unlike the expression that the man enjoyed on her face, the little girl's face was pale, her mouth was slightly open, her throat was hoarse, she sobbed, and her hair was soaked with cold sweat. It was obviously extremely painful. Gu Xijiu's face changed slightly.
This bastard, strong x seedlings ah! Who the hell is he?
The two big men carried Gu Xijiu in, but they didn't disturb the man's good interest. His movements were faster and fiercer.
The little girl finally couldn't stand it and shouted hoarsely, her eyes rolled, her head tilted, and she didn't move.
"Spoilsport." "The man cursed in a low voice, rolled over, got off the girl, and kicked the girl out of bed like rubbish.
The girl did not move, her little face had turned waxy yellow, and there was blood flowing down the corners of her lips. I don't know if it's dead or alive.
"This is also too useless, carry to the mass grave to feed the dogs and dogs." "The man's tone was full of resentment of desire and discontent."
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff, is a small town in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in the northern part of Arizona, on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, near the gambling city of Las Vegas to the west, and the famous Colorado Grand Canyon to the east.
The United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon of Colorado, and Las Vegas. Many Chinese people have heard of these four names, but Flagstaff City, which is wrapped in the middle of these four regions, is estimated to know not many people.
Half a year ago, Li Du was also one of those 'not many' until he came to Flagstaff to study abroad.
Flagstaff City is not famous in China, nor in the United States, but it does have several good universities, such as the University of Arizona, Flagstaff American College and so on.
The school where Li Du studied abroad is called Flagstaff National College. The difference between Flagstaff American College and Flagstaff American College is only one word, but there is a huge difference between these two words.
Flagstaff American College is a branch of American College, which is a very good private university, providing undergraduate, junior college, preparatory and other educational work.
This is a pheasant university, and Li Du was completely tricked into going to graduate school.
As a result, his tuition and research funds were only paid in the first half of the year, and the school was closed down. People from the school board and the admissions department got the news in advance and ran away, leaving a group of international students with confused faces to be driven away by the police.
Li Du is lucky, because the school accommodation is too chaotic, he did not live in a dormitory in order to study quietly, but found an apartment room to rent, now at least there is a place to stay. Those of his classmates who paid for the accommodation to live in the school are wandering on the streets now.
But his situation is not much better than that of his classmates. It is the end of January, and his rent is due. If he does not pay the rent in time, then he may have to live on the streets.
Sadly, he has no money at this time.
Of course, he can borrow money from his parents and classmates and friends in China, but that has to be the premise that he is studying abroad. Now that the school is banned, he will definitely not be able to study as a graduate student. There are no other faces to ask his elderly parents for money. As for finding classmates and friends.
Sitting at the door of the small building with a sad face, the pine door behind Li Du was pushed open, and a blonde girl stuck her head out and came. "Hi, Li, you are here." ”
The girl is his landlord, named Hannah Fox, and the house is the legacy of her parents who died in a car accident and belongs to her and her brother Hans Fox.
However, Hans claimed to be ‘ busy with big business’ and would not come and stay for a few days throughout the year. The empty bedroom was rented out by Hannah to generate income.
Hearing the greeting, Li Du got up and said. "Oh, yes, Hannah, what's the matter? " ”
The girl shrugged and smiled, and a pear vortex appeared on her beautiful face. "I just saw a few cans of beer when I cleaned the refrigerator. It must have been Hans who left it behind." I remember you like wort beer and it wouldn’ t hurt to drink it. ”
She was carrying half a dozen six bottles of beer in a common wooden box with a distinct Budweiser LOGO on it.
Seeing these beers, Li Du also smiled. There was only a small refrigerator in the apartment. He opened and closed it every day. What kind of beer was in it?
Besides, with Hans' temper, if there was beer, he would definitely not stay. This guy is addicted to alcohol like his life.
According to his guess, Hannah bought the beer to comfort him. After learning that their school was closed down, Hannah had comforted him many times, which moved him very much.
But Hannah didn't have many ways to comfort him, either giving him an inspirational book or beer.
The American girl once asked him to understand Chinese culture and learned the saying 'one drink solves a thousand sorrows'. She thought that according to the Chinese character, getting drunk and sleeping could alleviate her worries, so she gave him beer several times.
Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness and owed the girl a favor. In American society, some gifts cannot be refused, otherwise they will be misunderstood and rejected for friendship. He cherishes the friendship with Hannah very much.
He took the wooden box, and Hannah left with a smile. She said before leaving, and said. "There are a lot of problems in life, but it's still beautiful. ”
After repeating this American slang phrase several times, Li Du opened the package to take out a can of beer. But as soon as he opened the wooden box, an amber-like crystal suddenly fell out and fell to the ground with a 'click' sound.
The crystal was about the size of his thumb belly and fell heavily on the concrete floor, with several cracks appearing on it.
The reason why he guessed it was amber was because it was light yellow in color and wrapped in a small insect, which was very similar to an amber he had seen in sixth grade elementary school. At that time, their textbooks had a text called "Amber". When the Chinese teacher gave them a lesson, he brought an amber.
The crystal reminded him of some good times in his childhood, when he remembered his teacher saying that amber wrapped in small insects was precious. It's a pity that this one has already cracked, which makes him very sorry, otherwise he won't be able to exchange for two months' living expenses if he sells it.
The crystal had fallen so badly that it had shattered when he picked it up, and the purple bug wrapped in it was exposed.
The bug looks like a locust. It is about two centimeters long. It has strange appearance and compound eyes like a locust. However, it only has two legs under its stomach. There are strange lines on its legs and no wings on its back. It looks very clumsy.
Li Du had never seen this kind of bug before, so he raised it up strangely to see it clearly.
It was at this moment that something strange happened. The insect's claws suddenly moved, and then quickly regained their vitality, twisting their bodies to break free from between his fingers.
Before he could react, the bug jumped behind his palm, its head drooped, and slowly, little by little, it got into his palm.
Li Du was scared to pee. He really wanted to pee.
With a scream, he stumbled into the house and shouted, saying goodbye. "Hannah, call 911 quickly." Help, there’ s a bug in my hand. ”
It was estimated that his screams were too harsh, and Hannah came out with a panicked expression. "What? What bugs are? ”
Li Du spread out his hand to show her. That's it, the worm in my palm. ”
Hannah's face was blank. "The worm in your palm." What bugs do in the palm of your hand? ”
Not only was there a bug, but the bug was still moving. After it got into Li Du's palm, it seemed unwilling to be lonely. It would drill out again, and half of its body would drill out.
Li Du pointed at the worm that was drilling out and said in horror. "This, just this, purple locust, can't you see it." ”
Li Du interrupted her and shouted. "I know what you mean, you think I'm crazy." But I’ m not crazy, Hannah. ”
"Xue Te, this worm has come out again." ”
Just as he was screaming at the top of his lungs, the bug slowly drilled out of his skin and jumped to the ground, probing up his upper body to support it with his legs, and walked on the ground with his legs just like a human being.
As it happened, it landed next to a drainage outlet. The bug didn't pay attention to it and fell headfirst.
Seeing this, Li Du was overjoyed and said, '' "That's great, the bug fell into the drain." ”
Subconsciously, an idea appeared in his mind, that is, what is in the drainage outlet? There will be no sewage and drown the bug.
However, a scene that made him unbelievable happened.
Chapter 1
The land of China, the north desert.
Ice and snow ravaged the entire land, and the vast mountains and valleys were all covered in silver. Goose feathers and heavy snow rustled down. From a distance, the sky and earth looked one color.
On the winding mountain road, a caravan was resting. The wind and snow were too heavy, and it was difficult for the carriage to walk. It had to wait for the wind and snow to be lighter before going on the road.
"Look, the coffin puller. ”
The exclamation of a middle-aged man caught the attention of everyone in the caravan. A group of people raised their heads curiously and looked into the distance. After only a few glances, they were all shocked physically and mentally.
The wind and snow roared all over the sky, and the world became confused. A mysterious golden ancient coffin loomed in the distant mountain road, gradually appearing in everyone's eyes.
The golden ancient coffin was two meters long, one meter wide and one meter high. The walls of the coffin were engraved with simple patterns and runes. The pattern rune emitted a faint glow, isolating all the falling snowflakes, which was extremely strange.
Another thing that shocked everyone was the coffin puller in front of the ancient coffin.
It was a teenager who looked only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was naked on his upper body, hunched his back, grabbed two huge chains of cold iron with both hands, carried the chains on his shoulders, and was struggling to pull the ancient coffin forward step by step.
In the ice and snow, the teenager pulled the coffin.
The picture is visually stunning and breathtaking, breathtaking. The gloomy light emanating from the golden ancient coffin behind reflected the teenager's body somewhat blurred and could not see his face clearly. In a trance, everyone seemed to see a god pulling the coffin and coming.
"This young man is born with divine power. ”
The middle-aged man exclaimed again, and many people looked back at the teenager carefully, making sure that he did not have any mysterious light shining on him. They were moved again.
An ordinary willow coffin weighs three or four hundred catties, and the whole body of this ancient coffin is cast in gold, needless to say, at least three thousand catties or more.
If a teenager doesn't have profound strength, then he is not a real warrior. Even a strong man has only five or six hundred catties of huge strength. a teenager who could pull a three-kilogram ancient coffin by himself looked a little laborious, but it was shocking enough
"Young, quite handsome. He actually came to pull the coffin. This young man wants to be unlucky for the rest of his life. ”
An old man sighed, and many people nodded in agreement one after another. Although it was uncommon to pull the coffin, it happened occasionally in the history of the Northern Desert, and everyone knew something about it.
After the important clans of the Northern Desert family died, they liked to be buried in a giant golden coffin. These giant coffins will not be buried under the earth, but placed on the top of the iceberg, which is said to protect the people of the clan.
When the family declines or encounters major changes, the family will hold a coffin pulling ceremony to find a new iceberg to transfer the ancestral coffin in the family, replace feng shui, and recast the family's well-being.
This led to the appearance of the coffin puller.
Pulling the coffin is a detrimental thing to one's qi. In the minds of many Northern Desert people, when pulling the coffin, one's own qi will be absorbed by the corpse in the coffin, and the body essence and yang lifespan will also be absorbed. It will be unlucky or sick for a lifetime.
Therefore, pulling coffins is the most humble occupation in the Northern Desert. No matter how high the commission is, young warriors will not be tempted. Only elderly warriors who have fallen into disrepair will pull coffins.
The teenager has beautiful facial features, a height of about 1.75 meters, a wide shoulder and a narrow waist, slender legs, and knotted muscles. Wearing a simple animal tooth around his neck, he looked wild, and it was very good in terms of appearance alone.
Fourteen or fifteen years old, handsome in appearance, with a horrifying divine power, the condition of the teenager is not bad. But he came to do this most despicable and insidious job of pulling coffins.
"He is not afraid that his luck will be taken away, his life will be greatly reduced, and he will be unlucky for a lifetime of unlucky life. "The middle-aged man stared at the golden ancient coffin and swept a few eyes, and said with relief. "This seems to be the ancestral coffin of the Liu family." That's right. I heard that the Liu family has undergone great changes recently and has offered a sky-high price for money. ”
"Silence, the Liu family is coming." "An old man suddenly said. Everyone in the caravan quickly shut up and looked into the distance.
STOOOOOOOOOOP
In the distance came the howls of beasts, and a group of warriors wearing black battle armor and riding silver giant wolves rushed towards them. Before they got close to the fierce breath of the giant wolf, they rushed forward.
"The Silver Wolf Guard is indeed the martial arts of the Liu family. ”
Everyone nodded secretly. In the entire Wuling City, there was only one army riding a silver wolf. It was the strongest silver wolf guard of the Liu family.
The Silver Wolf Guard stopped after catching up with the teenager. A middle-aged giant in front of him, holding a long whip, looked at the teenager and shouted coldly. "Lu Li, hurry up." If you don’ t get to the Black Eagle Ridge before dark, you won’ t get paid for that. ”
The teenager, known as Lu Li, looked up and was surrounded by a dozen huge silver wolves one meter high and two meters long. He did not have much fear and nodded. "Don't worry, my lord, I will definitely make it before dark." ”
With a deep shout, the giant man galloped away with the Silver Wolf Guard and soon disappeared into the vast mountains in the distance.
Lu Li glanced at the caravan staying nearby and continued to pull the coffin forward in silence. He grabbed the cold iron chain with both hands and carried it on his shoulders. Every step he took was extremely difficult, and his muscles trembled all over his body. Despite this, his footsteps did not stop at all, and he quickly crossed the merchant team and walked towards the distance.
"It's really heavy ah." ”
After walking for a few miles, Lu Li stopped after going up a steep slope. He was exhausted and panting, but the cold weather was so hot and sweaty, you can imagine how much he was physically exhausted.
He wanted to rest for a while. After placing the ancient coffin, he sat on a stone and took out water and dried meat from the sack behind him. He chewed and swallowed to replenish his strength.
I should be able to get there before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat and looking at the sky, his eyes quickly brightened, muttering to himself that he was talking to himself. "Pulling a coffin can be exchanged for a pill. I don't know if the quenching pill of the Liu family is really as legendary. One can increase the strength of five hundred catties. ”
"If I can really increase the strength of five hundred catties, I now have three thousand catties of strength. I only need to pull a dozen coffins to reach ten thousand catties of strength, and I can... Awakening the bloodline has awakened. ”
"Look who in the tribe dares to bully my sister. Heeeyy, I’ ll be able to live a good life with my sister soon after. ”
Thinking of this, Lu Li's tired face glowed with glory, and he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward. This time, his footsteps were more steady and fast.
Rustle with sand and sand.
After walking for a few miles, a voice sounded behind him. Lu Li looked back, his face slightly sad.
The back is also a librarian, but it is an old man, but he is an old man. The old man's hands holding the iron chain were shining with white light, and there was a faint white light flowing from his feet as well.
Lu Li murmured enviously, the white light was a mysterious power only possessed by martial artists. The strength of the warrior with Xuanli will increase a lot. This old man used Xuanli to walk vigorously and easily pull the ancient coffin.
The old man caught up with Lu Li. He looked at him and said with a frown. "Young man, why are you pulling the coffin too? It can damage one's luck. ”
Lu Li smiled and didn't say anything. The old man looked at him a few times and stopped talking and quickly pulled the coffin away.
"If you can't awaken the bloodline again, what is the future? " Only a lifetime of mediocrity, being bullied every day, causing her sister to suffer along with her. ”
"No, this is not the life I want." ”
Thinking of this, Lu Li's face became a little distorted. He roared angrily, gritted his teeth and quickly pulled the coffin forward.
The wind and snow were getting bigger and bigger, and the sky gradually became dim. The gloomy light emanating from the golden ancient coffin in the vast mountain road was looming, which was unusually enchanting and fascinating.
Chapter 001
"Brother is going to find a job, you do your homework at home, here is ten yuan, don't forget to go out and buy something to eat at noon." Don't forget to go out and buy something to eat at noon. ”
In front of a low hut in the slum area, Lu Li patted the little girl's head and rubbed it pitifully. It was good to see her sister so healthy and lively alive.
"Brother, I know, " the little girl grumbled, "don't rub my hair, it's all messed up by you." ”
Sister Lu Xin is very considerate to help Lu Li sort out her clothes, and like a small adult, she tells her to be like a small adult. "Must work hard oh my brother is so able to bear hardships and I'm sure I'll be able to find a job this time." ”
"Don't worry, my brother will find a good job, earn a lot of money, and let Xinxin live a good life." Lu Li hugged his sister and secretly added that he would not watch you lose your life little by little because he had no money.
"When Xinxin grows up, she will also make a lot of money, " the little loli twisted in Lu Li's arms, waving her little fist in earnest.
No matter how reluctant, Lu Li said goodbye to his sister.
When he got on the bus, his hand in his pocket paused and couldn't help but laugh bitterly.
The money I gave my sister for lunch just now has returned to my pocket. I should have expected this little girl to do this. It's really cute and sad.
Now in the 23rd century, science and technology are infinitely developed, and various intelligent technologies are flooding every corner of the world. This development has brought rapid progress to people's lives, but incidentally, it has also minimized the demand for manpower.
Unemployment is no longer a rare thing, especially for people at the bottom of society like Lu Li, finding a stable job can only be a luxury.
If there is no accident, he will remain unemployed all the time.
The gold mining group that joined a game union did not stabilize until by chance, but by the time he entered the game called Dawn, the game had been open for nearly a year and the level was too far behind, so he had not been able to rank among the super masters.
Two years later, her younger sister Lu Xin was found to be seriously ill during a physical examination at school.
There was no money to pay for millions of treatments. During that time, the game had been pursued by several unions. It was painful to watch his only loved one weaken day by day.
That kind of taste was even more uncomfortable than cutting meat with a knife. Lu Li hugged his sister more than once and cried bitterly.
However, fate has taken a turn. On the day of receiving the notice of critical illness, Lu Li cried for a while and then fell asleep in front of his sister's hospital bed. When he woke up, he found that he was reborn and was reborn three years ago.
While happy that his sister was still healthy, he knew he had to make money, a lot of money, a lot of money.
Only with money can she cure her sister's illness as soon as possible, and only with money can she let her sister live the happy life that innocent and cute little girls should live like her countless peers.
Only when you have money will you be proud, and you will not be inferior at any time.
Calculated, Lu Li was very helpless to find that even if he was reborn, it was not easy for him to become rich.
All he seems to be able to do is play the game - the Dawn he's been playing for more than two years - and there are only a few days left before the game opens.
Lu Li had already given up on looking for a serious job. Today, he came out and went directly to the headquarters of the Star Moon Trade Union, which he had served in his previous life.
Xingyue Trade Union is not the top ten games, nor is it the top four in China. It is just a game alliance composed of a group of college students. The leaders of the trade union are all rich second generation. Because they are willing to spend money, they have developed in a similar way.
Located next to the university town, Qinghu Community is the most beautiful place in this generation. It is surrounded by mountains, water, and cherry blossoms. In front of it is an office building, and behind it is a villa area. Only very wealthy people can set up a company here.
The beauty at the front desk took a somewhat disgusted look at Lu Li's clothes, dialed a string of numbers, and then informed Lu Li that he could go in for an interview.
"At present, we only recruit death squads, and we don't accept gold miners anymore." The person in charge of the recruitment was a girl. She was dressed in a trendy dress. While applying nail polish, she was in charge of the interview without raising her head.
The so-called death squads are actually cannon fodder. It is normal to die more than a dozen times a day.
The reason why Lu Li wants to find a studio to join is to use the studio's game helmet for free. Although the gold player has no future, he can at least upgrade. The cannon fodder that is destined to be difficult to upgrade is not what he wants. Death in the game will lose experience.
"What, 20 gold? " "The nail polish was smeared on her face at once, and the girl screamed like a stepped cat, like a stepped cat."
Although Dawn represents the most advanced virtual technology today and has the world's most first-class design team, it is not confident enough to dare to go public without the inside, but the content of the test is relatively small, and it is a decentralized test. It will not affect normal games.
In just a few days of testing, the most impressive thing for players is that gold coins are not easy to play, and there are too many places to spend money.
Players in normal games basically can't make ends meet in the early stage, and experienced gold farmers can't save a few silver coins a day.
Some senior professional players estimate that it will take at least a week or more to save enough 20 gold to establish a guild, brush the appropriate monster in a 100-person gold group, and remove the consumption of equipment and potions. This is still the third time in the game. Before the system update, the money explosion rate was high before the money explosion rate was high.
And this kid, he promised to come up with 20 gold within a week.
20 gold, that's 200, 000 copper coins.
"Have you participated in the inside? Did you find any bugs to brush the money? " "The recruiting beauty moved her heart and asked suspiciously, " she asked suspiciously.
Lu Li smiled without saying a word, looking extremely unfathomable and unfathomable.
"Ao Jian, I have something to do here, come here... Well, someone came to apply for a gold collector and said that he could hand in 20 gold within a week. I suspect he had a BUG who brushed money. "There is no way to recruit beautiful women. I can only call the senior management in a low voice." The senior management can only call the senior management in a low voice.
Not long after, I heard a rush of footsteps, and when I turned my head, Lu Li was also a little surprised.
In addition to Xingyue's boss Ao Jian, the people who came over actually followed several people. Lu Li had been in Xingyue Trade Union for two years in his previous life. Most of these people knew each other. They were all high-level members of the trade union.
"Oh, don't tell me, this guy is the one who can get 20 gold a week, " the little man walking next to Aojian couldn't help but wail. The game is called half a cigarette. He is the leader of the Star and Moon Union Thief Group. He is a very frizzy person.
"You have a way to get twenty gold coins in a week, sure it's the game Dawn." "Ao Jian's face is not very good-looking, originally holding a glimmer of hope, but seeing the appearance of Lu Li, this glimmer of hope is gone." This glimmer of hope is also gone.
Lu Li looks ordinary, his face is sallow and dark, his clothes are wrinkled, and there are obvious signs of wear and tear at the corners. He is the kind of person who rolls and crawls at the bottom of society.
"You don't have much to lose even if you can't get it, don't you? " "In the face of the huge aura, the social elite behind the front cluster, Lu Li has no embarrassment of the small people at the bottom, but smiles faintly. His calm eyes seem to be full of endless confidence.
Chapter 1
"Ye Mo, Ye Mo, are you all right? Hurry up, class is about to start. This class is ruthless. Get up quickly. "A somewhat urgent voice sounded in Ye Mo's ears. Ye Mo had a very strange feeling.
"This idiot, it is estimated that he has been seen without a face, covering his face." "Another voice sounded in his ear, but Ye Mo woke up this time but came over.
Ye Mo looked around somewhat blankly. No one knew him. They were all unfamiliar faces.
Seeing Ye Mo's bewildered look, another burst of laughter came. It was obvious that the laughter here was directed at him. Seeing that the laughing people around him seemed to be laughing at him, he didn't dare to ask aloud for a moment, so he could only be on his guard secretly to prevent someone from attacking him.
Looking at the classmate sitting next to him, it seemed that he was the only one who didn't laugh at himself. He kindly pushed himself to wake up just now.
"How is it like a school? "Ye Mo subconsciously asked in surprise."
"Ha ha... "Another burst of laughter came from the hall.
"Ye Mo, I think you're confused. Can Yan Yan also write love letters casually? " You're all right in the Ye family, now you're not in the Ye family anymore, be careful in the future. ”
My deskmate sighed. Naturally, he didn't believe that Ye Mo wouldn't remember after such a while. He just loved face and was already in love. He has not yet recognized the reality that he is no longer Ye Mo of the Ye family.
Ye Mo's head was throbbing with pain. He remembered that he and his master Luo Ying were refining Hui Yuan Dan. Later, the group of miscellaneous hairs from Xiliumen came over, and then there were explosions and all kinds of fighting sounds. He remembered that his master hugged him and used an escape talisman behind him, but how did he appear here? But how did he appear? Is this still the mainland of Luoyue?
By the way, I am sitting here now, where is Master? The master was only three years older than him. Moreover, the reason why Xiliumen came to attack them suddenly was because the master was too beautiful. The young master of Xiliumen wanted to marry his beautiful master. After being rejected by the master, something happened only after the master refused.
If Master fell into the hands of Xiliumen, the consequences would be unimaginable. Thinking of this, Ye Mo could no longer hold back his inner panic and suddenly stood up.
"What's the matter? I don't know if the class bell rang. "A young woman with a cold face walked up to the podium with a few books in her hand, and coldly glanced at the students laughing in the hall below, and the laughter suddenly diminished.
Everyone knows that this is Yun Bing, an English lecturer. The most annoying thing is that the students are coaxing, and once they are targeted by her, there is absolutely no good fruit to eat. Ye Mo already felt that something was wrong. Although he could understand these words, the obvious language was not his original language. Could it be that this is no longer the mainland of Luoyue? Frowning, Ye Mo wanted to know more clearly. A burst of headache came, and a lot of messy information was remembered.
Ye Mo was completely kicked out of the Ye family after his father's death, specifically because Ye Mo wasn't Ye Wentian's seed. More specifically, after Ye Mo's father died, Ye Mo's bloodline was re-identified again, and it was determined that it was not the species of the Ye family, which led to the matter of being driven out of the Ye family.
But he also has a younger sister, Ye Ling, and a younger brother, Ye Zifeng. It's just that neither of him is the same mother, but half-siblings, who are half-siblings. Three years ago, his father seemed to know that he was indebted to Ye Mo, and specially proposed to the old man of the Ye family to marry the Ning family. Ye Tianwen probably knew that he was not in good health, so he wanted to help Ye Mo find a backer, so he found the Ning family in the capital.
For being able to marry the Ye family, one of the top five families in China, the Ning family was of course willing to do so. He promised Elder Ning's granddaughter, Ning Qingxue, to Ye Mo.
During a medical examination at the hospital, Ye Mo was found to be impotent. To put it bluntly, he couldn't be humane. Although the Ye family wanted to try to hide the fact, but overnight it seemed that the whole capital knew that the Ye family, one of the five major families in China, had a heavenly impotence, and the Ye family had lost a big face.
"Ah... "The memory was turned over here, Ye Mo screamed, stood up, and almost immediately took off his pants to see. He already understood that he might be reborn into a person also named Ye Mo, but he could not be humane, which was better to kill him than to kill him.
That classmate, what's your name? What do you shout during class? Come to my office after class and go to my office. "The beautiful teacher who was lecturing was interrupted by Ye Mo's exclamation. Her face was very ugly.
The rest of the students in the class were secretly laughing. They let a college student go to the office at every turn. It is estimated that only this English teacher can come out. Not going is not enough. The credits are in the hands of others.
Ye Mo sat down decadently. Although he did not understand the insider details of the family struggle, he also understood that he was probably driven out of the Ye family because of impotence, not necessarily because he was not a member of the Ye family. Besides, who knows if there are some tricks in the DNA test.
What Ye Mo was worried about was not that he was kicked out of the Ye family. He would not care about this at all. What he cared about was that he was impotent. And what happened to his master Luo Ying is what happened.
However, he also understood why the students in the class laughed, because his predecessor had obviously been kicked out of the Ye family, but he was still dead set on going after Yan Yan, the hottest girl in the class, and Yan Yan, the hottest girl in the class. As a result, the man posted his confession letter on the blackboard, and then stood on the podium and looked at himself contemptuously and said what he said. "Master Ye, can you sleep with me? " ”
Later, after the news of impotence came out, he wanted to find a girlfriend because he was ashamed to save face. However, what he did not expect was that the girl who was originally very flattering to him would actually treat him like this. In a state of embarrassment and anxiety, he fainted and cheapened his rebirth.
I was actually reborn in such a place. On the podium beauty teacher's class he could not understand a word, that is, listen to understand, Ye Mo will not listen to, for him now is a day of things, he is absolutely unacceptable, he is absolutely unacceptable. Instead of regenerating like this, it's better not to regenerate.
It doesn't matter if you don't go to college, the most important thing is to figure out your current situation. His impotence is related to the reputation of the Ye family. Although he was driven out of the Ye family, who knows if he will suddenly be killed by others? Maybe there were other inside stories that caused him to be kicked out of the Ye family. Now his safety is not guaranteed.
After the bell rang, of course, the first thing Ye Mo did was not go to the beautiful teacher, but rushed out of the school in a hurry. He wanted to find a place to see if his little girl was really impotent.
Fortunately, there are not many other things next to Ninghai University, but there are many small alleys. Ye Mo hurried into a remote and deserted small alley, and quickly pulled down his pants.
Xiao * * is indeed very small, but Ye Mo is not disappointed because of Xiao * * small, but really shushed a long breath. He is not impotent, but because the small * * is too big, blocked by a meridian development, resulting in this false impotence situation.
But that's it, with the current technology on earth, it is undoubtedly a fool's dream to open up his blocked meridians, but this is not difficult for Ye Mo, although he still does not have the ability to open the blocked meridians, so that his small * * magnificent, but as long as he reaches the third level of Qi training, this meridian will automatically be washed away by the冲 of the three layers of Qi training. This meridian will automatically be washed away by the冲 of the three layers of Qi training.
It's just that Ye Mo immediately began to be a little disappointed again, because under the circumstance that the vitality of the earth is so thin, it is undoubtedly a difficult task to cultivate to the third level of Qi cultivation. Maybe he can't reach it in his lifetime. In that case, he is still equivalent to impotence. Sighing, Ye Mo was about to pull up his pants when a sudden scream made him shudder.
"Playing hooligans... An absolutely high-decibel soprano sounded in front of Ye Mo. Ye Mo had just paid attention to checking his own little * *, and had actually forgotten to check the surrounding situation. I didn't expect that this small alley was still connected, but I couldn't see it here at the corner in front of it.
Ye Mo is not an exhibitionist, and he doesn't have any capital to expose now. Hurry up and pull up his pants to slip away.
"Ye Mo, why are you? " He said. "After the woman screamed, she actually asked in a surprised tone. It was obvious that she knew Ye Mo.
Chapter 1
In the dead of night, Qingzhu Senior Community, Jinhai City, is silent.
Shi Feng sat quietly on the soft leather sofa, holding a stack of documents in his hand, looking at the swimming pool outside the floor-to-ceiling window, full of loss and unwillingness.
As the leader of Youying, one of the four major game studios in Jinhai City, a large guild with tens of thousands of people in command, and a well-known master sword magician in Jinhai City, he can only sit at home and drink to relieve his worries.
Ten years of gaming career.
Ten years of bloody fighting.
After experiencing countless pains and tribulations, he finally led the Shadow Guild and established ten city-states in "God's Domain". When he could begin to compete with first-class guilds and enjoy endless glory, a piece of paper became a cloud of smoke and never returned.
Shi Feng never expected that his ten years of hard work would be in vain. For the sake of the game, he gave up so much, but in the end he became someone else's wedding dress. It was all because he opposed the shadow being merged into the super guild to dominate the world. The next day, the Lanhua Consortium gave him an answer, deleting the 200-level Sword King account that he had spent ten years of hard work on, and going to the finance department to settle his salary and pay the salary.
All he could get was five million credits and a mansion. Compared to the top ten city-states established, the virtual kingdom of Doujin is less than a drop in the bucket every day.
Shi Feng thought of himself for the shadow to pay so much, let the Lanhua group into a big consortium, a lot of credit is his, but the result is like throwing garbage, he lost, for the Lanhua consortium, he will retaliate, he will certainly retaliate for the Lanhua consortium's work, he will retaliate.
"I'll never just let it go. It's a big deal to start all over again. ”
Shi Feng's eyes flashed with confidence and firmness. The termination document in his hand was torn to shreds. Then he picked up a bottle of red wine on the table and suddenly poured a few mouthfuls.
Even without the Sword King account and the support of the team, the technology and knowledge in the game would not betray him. As long as the technology is still there, it can also rise in the divine realm and establish a virtual kingdom of its own again.
Early in the morning, the sun has just risen.
a drop in the face
The phone keeps ringing.
Shi Feng was awakened by dissatisfaction, but got up to pick up the bedside cell phone, last night's hangover is still dizzy to this day is still dizzy, last night's hangover is still dizzy.
"Hey, what's the matter? " ”
"Brother Feng, I'm Blackie, what are you asking about? "? We agreed to become a professional player, today is the school's shadow studio recruitment day, you have not always wanted to be a core member of the shadow, you have not been want to be a core member of the shadow? ”
Shi Feng was a little confused.
He had just been fired by the Lanhua Consortium, so how could he go to the Shadow Examination? "Brother Feng, Brother Feng, Feng."
Are you listening to me? They're going to test it at ten o'clock, if you don't come over soon, it'll be too late. ”
Blackie, don't be ridiculous. I was just fired by Shadow. ”
"Brother Feng, how much did you drink yesterday? I haven't woken up yet. Shadow hasn't hired anyone yet. How did you get fired? Well, here we go quickly. ”
Before Shi Feng could react, Heizi hung up the phone.
Shi Feng, who was dazed, looked at his mobile phone and found that this shabby Love Crazy Six was not his mobile phone at all. His mobile phone was the latest Love Crazy Twelve.
Immediately look around. The small bedroom of less than fifteen square meters was in a mess. There were books about game strategies everywhere, as well as the laptop on the desk in the corner, which was also a very backward old model. There were many clothes scattered in the large wardrobe beside the wall, and a familiar face appeared in the fitting mirror of the large wardrobe.
Shi Feng was startled when he saw this familiar face.
Shi Feng immediately got up and walked to the fitting mirror and took pictures again and again before he was sure that he had really become younger.
Yesterday I slept in a spacious and luxurious bedroom, and now when I get up, I'm in this shitty place, and I'm younger.
Shi Feng still had some memories of this place. That was ten years ago, in order to conquer the Divine Realm, I gritted my teeth and rented a small house when I was in my senior year. I lived there for more than half a year. Later, I earned some money in the Divine Realm, so I went to the city to rent a large apartment-style house.
Back then, it was extremely difficult, and the situation at home was not good. In order for him to go to college, he still owed a lot of foreign debts. In this way, his parents still worked hard every month to earn enough living expenses to make themselves suffer.
Shi Feng was intent on making money to change his family, but college students were all over the street. It was more difficult to find a job with a good income than to reach the sky, so he thought of the most profitable virtual game. In order to improve his game technology, he bought a virtual helmet and has become a professional player as the goal. He has practiced hard skills in virtual games. He has practiced hard in virtual games and practiced hard.
At that time, he ate white steamed buns and instant noodles every day. In order to save money, every time the class organized a classmate party or fellowship, he did not participate in it, so he became a little transparent in the class. The boys despised it, and the girls saw it far away. Every time he went to the supermarket to buy instant noodles, he had less than ten credit points in his wallet, and he did not even dare to buy a ham sausage with one credit point. The saleswoman looked at Shi Feng pitifully and recommended special ham. Shi Feng looked at the tempting ham and touched his wallet again. He gritted his teeth and refused to buy it.
"Is someone kidding me? ”
Looking at the familiar scene and the young self in the mirror, Shi Feng shook his head and denied the idea.
Even the most developed United States does not have such rejuvenation technology, who would joke with a down-and-out uncle with a joke.
Shi Feng looked at the time on his phone again.
April 19, 2129.
"Could it be that I was reborn. "Shi Feng showed a wry smile on his face and joked."
He remembered that today was August 5, 2139, which could not be April 2129, when he was still in his senior year.
Shi Feng shook his head, wanting to wake up, but he still held a trace of expectation in his heart, hoping that he would be reborn and really return to ten years ago, so he walked to the computer desk and turned on the laptop.
If the time of the mobile phone can be faked, then the news on the Internet can't be faked.
After a few minutes on the Internet, I will be.
Shi Feng was completely shocked. All kinds of information he inquired about on the Internet showed that today was indeed April 19, 2129. Even the official opening time of the world's fiery divine realm was clearly written on the official website. The countdown was April 25, six days later.
"Did I really go back ten years ago? " Shi Feng stared at the news report of the divine realm, leaving tears of excitement in the corners of his eyes.
At this time, Shi Feng's mood was indescribable. There were regrets, grief, joy.
It was as if everything in front of him was a dream.
However, the chirping of cicadas outside the window and the air conditioner blowing out of the air conditioner reminded Shi Feng that all this was really true.
Looking at the family photo taken in college on his mobile phone, Shi Feng never found that his father had white hair and his mother had wrinkles around her eyes. They were really old and not as energetic as before.
When he noticed that his parents were old, it was a year and a half after the opening of the divine realm. The high debt, excessive labor and pressure made both parents seriously ill. They could not afford to get sick. If they wanted to recover, they would need millions of credit points. However, at that time, Shi Feng was just a squad leader of the Shadow. The money he earned could not afford such expensive expenses at all.
In order to raise money, Shi Feng tried his best, but unfortunately it was still not enough. Even if Shi Feng tried his best to maintain it, his parents still left a few months later.
In his last life, he did not take good care of his parents, and who knows the pain and regret.
Even if Shi Feng earned millions of credit points later, it became an eternal pain in Shi Feng's heart.
Unexpectedly, fate played such a joke on him that he really started from scratch and everything returned to the original point.
"Okay, great, hahaha. Since I am reborn, I will change all this, earn enough money, cure my parents' illnesses, and not let them work hard for their lives. "Shi Feng wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes and swore secretly.
Just as Shi Feng was planning his future, Heizi called again, constantly urging Shi Feng to go to the university for assessment.
However, Shi Feng was not in a hurry. He put on his clothes and packed himself up before heading to Gimhae University.
He was all too familiar with the Shadow.
I remember when I was in college, Lan Hailong, the eldest son of Lanhua Group, opened the Shadow Studio and provided a lot of funds to organize the master students in Jinhai University to fight in the divine realm. At that time, he also went to the examination and became a core member. Sunspot became a peripheral member. At that time, he was happy for a long time.
Three years later, Shadow Studio had his leadership, which made Lanhua Group make a lot of money in God's Domain and became a big consortium. Unexpectedly, he was fired by Lan Hailong himself in the end.
Since he has been reborn, he still has an incomparable advantage over God's Domain. Naturally, he is not prepared to join the Shadow again and become a tool for others to make money for others. He wants to take a different path and struggle for his own life. He no longer has to let his parents send living expenses and pay off all debts. Therefore, he wants to start a business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and live a good life. Live a good life.
When Shi Feng came to the No. 1 teaching building, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned young man walking up and down the gate, extremely anxious. This person was Heizi.
"Brother Feng, you are finally here. Fortunately, the registration deadline is not closed. Let's hurry in and sign up." Let's hurry in and sign up. "Blackie said anxiously after seeing Shi Feng."
Shi Feng shook his head and said very seriously. "Heizi, I'm not going to Shadow anymore. I want to open my own studio. Would you like to come? "? ”
Sunspot met in a virtual game, the technology is very good, and then we broke into the world together. It can be said that he was a biological brother. In the days when Shadow worked together, although he had no game talent, he was very strong in management. He managed hundreds of thousands of people in the guild in an orderly manner. If he had the help of sunspot, the goal would be further achieved, but he would follow the choice of sunspot. After all, he now has nothing, and Sunspot's family is not good. In order to make a living, he decided to become a professional player and join Shadow to earn living expenses.
After a full minute, Kuroko looked up at Shi Feng.
Brother Feng, don't be silly. You know how much a virtual helmet costs one by one. That's 8, 000 credits, it takes at least six people to open a studio, workplaces, pay salaries, etc., just start-up capital needs 70, 000 to 80, 000, and follow-up investment, that's a lot of money, but now do you have that much money? But now do you have that much money? "Hei Zi knows Shi Feng's situation very well, knows that Shi Feng's family is not good, wants to persuade Shi Feng to give up this crazy idea, wants to give up this crazy idea."
"You're right. I don't even have the money to buy a virtual helmet from Shenyang right now. "Shi Feng silently nodded and admitted that, as Heizi said, even seventy or eighty thousand were said to be less. I remember that the 100-person studio recruited by Lan Feilong spent more than five million. In the later stage, in order to improve the quality and strength of the studio, a lot of money was spent.
"If that's the case, why bother taking risks? Going to Shadow isn't more stable. At least Shadow can provide virtual helmets, otherwise we can't even play, let alone become professional players." "Blackie saw that Shi Feng understood the key to the problem, and suddenly he was relieved, and pulled Shi Feng to enter the teaching building.
Shi Feng shook off the sunspot's hand and looked at the sunspot seriously. His expression was extremely serious. "But I still plan to open my own studio and don't want to be controlled by others. Blackie, are you coming? ”
Shi Feng will not force sunspots, after all, he does not have any protection, nor can he tell the secret that he is a reborn person, only hope that sunspots can believe him.
When Blackie saw Shi Feng's serious expression, he always felt that today's Shi Feng was very strange and crazy. It was impossible to make money in the early stage of virtual games. Everyone knows this. Is there any way for Shi Feng to make money in the divine realm? Even if they make money, it will be a few months later, and they don’ t have that much time to waste.
Heizi hesitated for a long time, gritted his teeth, and finally agreed. "I know who told you to be the eldest brother, I open the studio with you, but what about the virtual helmet, we can't play games without the helmet, we can't play games." ”
Shi Feng's tight brows suddenly loosened, he patted Heizi's shoulder happily, and said with a smile. "That's my good brother. Don't worry about the virtual helmet. I remember that there is a college student trial discount in Shenyang. Every university has a distribution place. As long as you rely on your student ID, you can get the virtual helmet for free trial for ten days. Let's go and see. Let's see if the virtual helmet is available. ”
The dark face of the sunspot became livid at this time. He felt that the future was dark. Why did he believe in Shi Feng? Could it be Shi Feng's confidence and stability? Is it really okay to start a business with Shifeng?
What can you do in the divine realm in ten days?
Ten days later, I will definitely miss the good time for major studios to recruit people. In the end, I still don't want to buy virtual helmets, but how can I get the money?
If you want to earn 16, 000 credit points in the ten days when God's Domain opens, even a group of professional players can't do it.
"Leave the money to me." ”
Shi Feng patted the black shoulder and smiled confidently.
Earning sixteen thousand credit points in ten days is whimsical, but he has the courage to be a reborn person. No matter what difficulties he faces, he will break them one by one. And the opening of the Divine Realm was the beginning of his rise.
Subsequently, Shi Feng took Heizi to collect the trial helmet and bought all the money for instant noodles, which he placed next to the computer desk in the rental room. There were two full boxes, enough food for more than ten days. After that, he explained some things about the divine realm and quietly waited for the opening of the divine realm to be quietly waiting for the divine realm to open.
At nine o'clock in the evening of April 25th, a few glimmers of light flickered in the dark and silent cabin.
Shi Feng lay still on the bed, closed his eyes, and gently clicked the start button of the helmet.
"Divine Realm, I'm coming." ”
I can't tell what kind of sound this is. It seems that it can penetrate the body and rush into the soul. People can't help but tremble a few times in this cold snowy night.
The desolate north wind whimpered through the heavens and the earth, and bursts of white snow fluttered with the wind, dividing the sky into pieces, sprinkling the earth layer by layer. From a distance, it looked like it was covered in silver and desolate everywhere.
It's not late at night, it's just dusk, but the darkness of the sky is the same as the night. It gives people a heavy feeling. It seems to be pressed against the heart, and they can't breathe. On the silver land, a huge silhouette can be seen, which is a majestic city, as if a giant beast is approaching.
In the center of the city, there is a towering tower-shaped altar, in the shape of seven corners, the whole body is dark, straight into the cloud peak, standing majestically in the storm and snow. The whimpering wind blowing on the altar is mixed with such a rattling sound, scattered into the distance, with primitive roughness, don't have a charm
The hoarse murmur floated out of the altar in the snow. It seemed to merge with the wind. It was faintly indistinguishable.
"If there is hope, then where is it? If there is no hope, why let me see it? Why let me see it?  That voice was like madness, almost hysterical as it roared for nine days in a roar.
Below the altar, there were countless figures in coir raincoats standing there silently. From a distance, there were hundreds of thousands of them. There was fanaticism emerging, as if the person on the altar said a word, they could give everything for it.
Snow, it's getting bigger.
"Since you let me see it, there must be hope, but hope... Where is it? " "The hoarse voice on the altar was bitter and contained sorrow. It lasted for a long time.
"Today, Ming Huang returns by mistake, Santai opens up wasteland, and the snow and wind come. If it is ever built, the old man will be considered a barbarian again." "The voice suddenly became louder, and I don't know what means I used, but I saw that the wind and clouds in the sky changed, and all the countless falling snowflakes suddenly stopped, and then all rolled back, roaring from all directions and condensed together, making heaven and earth tremble.
There was no more snow falling in the sky, and all the snowflakes condensed to form a huge snow-colored black dragon. As soon as this dragon was formed, it immediately looked up to the sky and hissed, and its voice was so shrill that all those who heard it were immediately shocked. It seemed like they were about to be torn apart by this sound.
Shocking bursts of blood secreted from the snow dragon's body, and soon filled its whole body, making the snow dragon look like a blood dragon. It screamed miserably and struggled to rush towards the sky, like a meteor piercing straight into the sky, as if to blow open a hole in the sky and open a hope.
Its speed was so fast that it was endless in the blink of an eye. It seemed that the dragon had hit an invisible diaphragm somewhere. The heavens and the earth shook, and the buzzing sound spread to all directions. The blood dragon screamed mournfully again. The body collapsed layer by layer at a speed visible to the naked eye.
At the moment when it was about to be completely broken, the hundreds of thousands of silent people under the altar all pinched their hands, bit the tip of their tongues and spewed out a mouthful of blood. The blood seemed to be pulled by some kind of force and galloped up. If the sea of blood rose, it went straight to the collapsing blood dragon. After fusing with it, the collapse of the dragon eased and rushed to a higher sky.
Seeing that the blood dragon flew higher and higher condensed everyone's eyes, but at this moment, the blood dragon's whole body shook violently, and after letting out a sharp hiss that spread tens of thousands of miles, it could no longer stop the collapse of the body, turning into countless blood-colored snowflakes and falling down. From a distance, the world has been dyed into a red yellow spring.
Even at this moment, the moment the blood dragon collapsed, from its mouth came a voice completely different from the mournful roar. "Shang... "
At the top of the altar, in the very center, sat cross-legged an old man in a purple robe. The old man's face was wrinkled and covered with brown spots. He murmured with his eyes open, but his eyes were dim. Obviously, a blind man was blind.
There was a complete spine in front of him, emitting a white awn, and he held a stone tablet in his right hand, which stayed above the thirteenth spine.
His empty eyes silently looked at the sky, for a long, long time, with a long sigh.
In his words, the right hand holding the stone piece moved again on the strange spine, rubbing the animal bone, making a clicking sound, and dispersing into the distance. His figure was obviously bleak, and this sound fused, revealing a sad loneliness and decline.
In the middle of the night, it was dark, but it was not calm in the reckless mountains. The ferocious beasts were infested, the roars shook the mountains and rivers, the trees trembled, and the leaves rustled down.
There was another beast roar. Lin Feng shrank his neck and dusted the leaves that fell on him. Looking at the mountains in the darkness, he secretly sighed that this place was completely different from the earth.
Lin Feng sat under the tree in a daze, and several tough young men on the opposite side looked at him with disdainful eyes. A little fat man even shouted at Lin Feng. "Leaving you a foreigner in the village is not for you to eat. Hurry up and work to live." ”
Lin Feng came back to his senses, didn't speak, patted his ass and stood up and walked away.
Behind him, the little fat man snorted. "Useless waste, physical strength is not even as good as a child, he should be thrown into the mountains to be eaten by ferocious beasts." ”
Lin Feng curled his lips, brother, a person from Earth who has traveled through time, how can he compare his physical strength with your group of animals?
This Tianyuan Great World is a world dominated by cultivators.
In front of this wolf village, it is just a small village in the vast mountains. Naturally, there are no practitioners, but every villager practices martial arts and strives for strength. Even women and children are no exception.
Only in this way can we survive in this world where ferocious beasts are rampant and even ancient relics are infested.
Just like now, although it is late at night, the young and strong in the village also have to go into the mountains to hunt. Many prey are used to coming out at night. Although entering the mountains at night is dangerous, the harvest will also be greater.
The villagers have become accustomed to this kind of life, and the children who stay in the village do not sleep, so they gather together to play and wait for their adults to return from hunting.
The children who were still dragging their noses were playing with dozens or hundreds of pounds of stone locks as toys, while a group of teenagers were competing to see who could lift the giant tripod weighing a thousand pounds at the entrance of the village.
Lin Feng looked at these small animals and sighed secretly. Comparing his strength with them, he really seemed to be a waste of wood.
But this will not make Lin Feng feel depressed. Although he is talked about behind him from time to time, he still temporarily lives in this small mountain village called Wolf Village by virtue of his trickery skills. It really hurt him that he was thinking of something more in his head.
Super Ancestor System.
At first, Lin Feng was still happy in his heart, thinking that crossing over meant having benefits, but the system explained that the first item made him feel cold.
"The main task of the system is. The host opens a mountain and establishes a sect, establishes the largest sect in the world, and becomes the first patriarch. ”
"The main task is divided into different stages, and each stage needs to be completed within a limited time. If the timeout is not completed, the host will be directly obliterated. ”
Lin Feng was speechless for a long time as he looked at the system description, especially the last sentence, "Erase the host, " and finally squeezed out a few words from between his teeth. "I bought a watch last year. ”
After the anger, Lin Feng helplessly read the task content, he is not prepared to risk challenging the system to see if the other side can erase him, just came to this world ass have not sat hot, he does not want to die again, he does not want to die again. He does not want to die again.
Main Quest 1 0  Take in four personal disciples who have passed down the mantle.
Mission description. Even if he is a casual cultivator, if he wants to inherit his mantle, he must accept apprentices. The most important resource of a sect is always people. They are disciples and heirs with outstanding talents. Famous teachers produce high disciples. Famous teachers are difficult to find, and high disciples are even more difficult to find.
Task time limit. A year, timeout is not completed, directly obliterate the host.
"Damn it! " "Lin Feng sighed. As for the newcomer we have just crossed over, he is as immature as a refreshing cabbage. I should quickly find a Daniel as a master and hug my thighs.
Brother System, at least give me this secret book so that I can accept apprentices. This poor and white one, what do you want me to teach others? Sneak and brag.
Even worse, the system explained that there was a novice gift pack, but told himself that the gift pack system was malfunctioning, and the novice gift pack was delayed.
Open the exchange system, but all kinds of good things dazzling, magic weapons, magic powers, only you can't imagine, without him no goods, no goods are not available.
The problem is that everything needs to be exchanged for points, and Lin Feng doesn't even have a single exchange point right now, so he can only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was scolding his mother in his heart when there was a sudden commotion at the entrance of the village. It seemed that the hunting team had come back.
The teenagers waiting in the village cheered and greeted the entrance of the village. Lin Feng glanced indifferently, but was surprised to find that all the young and strong people who had returned from hunting had returned empty-handed. Without prey, not to mention, even their weapons were not seen.
For these villagers, weapons are the second life. Living in this mountain, it is impossible to survive without weapons.
The corner of Lin Feng's mouth hooked up into an imperceptible smile. "There seems to be a story. "Thinking of this, he also walked towards the crowd at the entrance of the village."
Before he got close, he heard someone roar and say angrily. "Wolf Wind is the hope of our Wolf Village. Now that we have been severely injured by the people of Stone Village, we must not give up." ”
Lin Feng looked up and saw a young man in the middle of the crowd sitting on the ground with a withered expression. His body was covered with scars, and there was a cold glow of hatred in his eyes.
"This is the genius that Wolf Village people talk about." "Lin Feng secretly observed, for this wolf wind, he is also known for a long time, the idol of the whole wolf village teenagers, is regarded as the hope of the village, today Lin Feng is the first time to see a real person, today is the first time to see a real person." Lin Feng is the first time to see a real person.
Although Wolf Wind was injured and depressed at this time, he was full of qi and blood. Although his physical strength could not be compared with that of cultivators, he was definitely the top among secular martial artists.
According to the Tianyuan Great World's doctrine, there is this level at a young age. If you cultivate cultivation Qi, you will also have a future. In the final analysis, cultivators are to guide the spiritual Qi of heaven and earth into the body, refine the magic power, and strengthen their own foundation.
Lin Feng quietly called up his super ancestor system, which had a disciple talent detector. He pressed OK at Wolf Wind to determine.
"The subject's aptitude is too low to become a direct disciple of the host. ”
Lin Feng frowned, this system is too picky, he had originally thought of accepting four disciples casually first, to fool the system's one-year deadline, and finally expel these disciples from the door wall, just do it.
But now it seems that it is not so easy to drill loopholes in the system. Even a talented young man like Wolf Feng who is famous in ten miles and eight villages is not qualified. Lin Feng wants to collect all four disciples to complete the system task. The difficulty is too great.
"One year, one year... Lin Feng sighed depressedly.
In the crowd, an old man beside Wolf Wind was livid and snorted. "Wolf Wind is my grandson. Of course, we can't just let it go, but it's not now." There has been a lot of noise in the mountains in recent days. It seems that a mountain treasure is about to be born. First get the mountain treasure, and then settle accounts with Shicun. ”
Rural clans often have armed fights, Lin Feng is not interested in this, but the word "mountain treasure" into the ear, let his heart slightly move a little in the heart.
Lin Feng was thinking about Shan Bao when he suddenly heard someone in the crowd curse in a low voice. "I don't know how Shicun raised such a little monster. It's not even four years old. A little doll can defeat the genius wolf wind in our village. It's really a ghost. ”
Lin Feng's eyes suddenly lit up.
The little doll under four years old defeated the wolf wind in front of him.
Wolf Wind was already considered to have some talent, and the person who injured him was not even four years old, so what kind of talent should it be?
The little fat man beside Lin Feng cursed in a low voice. "Damn kid, we must kill him. ”
Looking at him, Lin Feng echoed. "Yes, yes. ”
But I was thinking in my heart that this little doll might be able to get recognized by the system. Thinking of this, Lin Feng quietly withdrew from the crowd. He now wanted to grow wings and fly to the stone village, but he didn't dare to leave the village alone, otherwise he would directly feed the ferocious beasts in the mountains.
At this moment, a mechanical dull tone suddenly sounded in Lin Feng's mind.
"The novice gift package is released. Do you want to check it immediately? "? ”
After Lin Feng was stunned for a moment, he was overjoyed. He had never felt that the boring and dull system prompt sound was so pleasant to the ear.
Looking for a place where no one was around, Lin Feng clicked on the gift bag and opened it.
Novice gift package. The host obtains the fourth level realm of the basic cultivation period, obtains a chance to draw a lottery, obtains 300 exchange points, obtains the Taoist secret book "Jiuxiao Tianlei Zhengfa", and obtains the supernatural power Nine Heavens Moving Thunder Guide.
Lin Feng was stunned. A warm current fell from the top of his head and went straight between his chest and abdomen, quickly rushing through a hidden acupoint in his body.
There are twelve important acupoints hidden in the human body, which cultivators call the twelfth floor.
The practice during the Qi training period is divided into twelve floors, in order to open the twelfth floor. Every acupoint is opened, and the aura is transformed into mana, and the practitioner's mana will go up to a higher level.
Lin Feng now felt a warm current fighting back-to-back battles, walking all the way, until he opened the four acupoints in his body before disappearing. With Lin Feng's breathing, the vitality of the outside world was rapidly sucked into the body, hovering in the four opened acupoints.
Each acupoint is like a star cluster universe that is constantly running, and the aura is constantly transformed into Lin Feng's own mana, just like the beginning of the universe and the evolution of all living things.
Lin Feng felt that his whole body had become lighter. As soon as his mind moved, the magic in the acupoint was like a spring. The explosive power was dumb and ready to move.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body and felt relieved in his heart. "Finally, I have a little self-protection." "But thinking that the ultimate goal of the system is to establish the first sect in history, and that he wants to become the first patriarch in history, Lin Feng suddenly felt a lot of pressure and hurriedly checked other things in the novice gift package."
"Lottery chance to draw." "Lin Feng looked at it. In addition to the exchange system in the auxiliary training system, there is also a lottery system, but it is gray and is still in an inactive state. For the time being, there is no need to think about it.
At present, we can only hope that the purchasing power of the 300 exchange points is higher.
While thinking about it, Lin Feng entered the exchange system. He was poor and white before. He didn't even have the heart to look at the price.
Taking a closer look at the price tag, Lin Feng cursed the system for being unscrupulous. The lowest level bottle of Qi-raising Pill costs ten exchange points, and a slightly spiritual ironmaking sword costs thirty points.
Even if you want to get a basic outfit, a set of feather clothes and a star crown, you need fifty points.
The most basic magical powers such as "fireball" and "palm thunder" cost 100 points for stalls.
As for those high-end goods with a string of zeros hanging on their buttocks, Lin Feng didn't dare to look at them at all for fear of dizziness.
Lin Feng looked at the pitiful 300 in his "Existing Exchange Points" column and shook his head. "The start-up capital is too little. ”
Fortunately, the Starter Pack opened a Daoist secret and a divine ability, otherwise Lin Feng would really be blind to catch it.
Daoism is the foundation of cultivation, mainly to improve the realm, while divine abilities are practical martial arts or spells with many wonderful uses.
Surprisingly, the grade of Jiuxiao Tianlei Zhengfa in the gift package is very high, and the existing exchange system cannot even be exchanged. It must be upgraded before it can be exchanged.
As for the system upgrade, Lin Feng needed to complete a certain number of system tasks before it would be opened. It was too early to say.
The Nine Firmaments Heavenly Thunder Dharma is one of the top Thunder Dharma in this Heavenly Origin Great World. However, it has been lost for many years. The predecessors who practiced it in the past were all big bulls who walked horizontally by virtue of this Dharma.
According to the instructions, the novice gift package is a random way to open a method, can open nine sky thunder method, Lin Feng is the ancestral grave smoke, 300 exchange points although the purchasing power is limited, but Lin Feng heart depression swept away at this time, the depression swept away by the air.
Such a top-level Daoist technique, if there is no damn main quest, Lin Feng must first find a place where no one practices a divine skill and then come out to kill the four directions.
But now that we are going to collect disciples, that is another way of saying it.
Dissatisfied, Lin Feng quickly adjusted his mentality and acted quickly.
He quietly asked the path to Stone Village, and quietly left Wolf Village without alarming others.
The two villages are now in a state of hostility. Lin Feng, who has become a cultivator, is not afraid of the people of Wolf Village posing a challenge, but he is afraid that they will expose their identity in front of the people of Stone Village.
Fortunately, now the people of Wolf Village are gathered at the entrance of the village, because there is a lot of discussion about Wolf Wind being injured. Lin Feng goes around the back of the village, and no one notices his movements.
Walking on the road, Lin Feng did not hesitate to invest directly in fifty exchange points to buy himself a wardrobe.
How could Lin Feng from Earth not know the truth that "Buddha wants gold clothes, people want clothes". If you want to sell things, publicity and packaging must first be done well.
Looking down at his feathered star crown, white robe and wide sleeves, Lin Feng nodded with satisfaction. The system is expensive, but the quality and appearance are really not to say.
When Lin Feng came to the entrance of Shicun Village, the first thing that caught his eye was half a huge piece of dead wood with a diameter of more than ten meters. The whole body was scorched black.
Lin Feng took a look and speculated that it was a lightning strike tree. It had been struck by lightning many years ago. The huge crown and vigorous vitality of the old tree had been destroyed. Now there was only a stump 89 meters high left on the surface.
But just looking at the size of the existing trunk, you can imagine how huge the tree was when it was alive.
The dead tree was scorched black, and there was no sign of life at all.
At this moment, an old man came over, coughing as he said. "This tree has been withered for ten years. "He walked up to Lin Feng and looked up and down at Lin Feng. "The little old man is the village chief of this stone village. I don't know what can help this Taoist master. ”
Lin Feng smiled slightly, and naturally a breath of dust and pride appeared on his body. He was accompanied by a head of the line, a white robe with wide sleeves, and a feather star crown. The sales were completely uncritical. Absolutely tall in the world, Fan Er, an outsider.
"discovering the target is suitable for becoming a direct disciple of the host. ”
Just as Lin Feng was about to speak, he heard the sudden sound of the system prompt and almost choked on his saliva.
The old village chief of Shicun looked at Lin Feng strangely, but trembled in fright.
I saw Lin Feng's eyes glowing green, staring at the village entrance like a hungry wolf howling.
At the entrance of the village, a pink carved jade peck, a snow-white and cute child was working hard to pull the tail of a big yellow dog. The child's voice was clear and loud. "Don't run, " he said. ”
The system beeped in Lin Feng's mind non-stop. The talent system has been sorted out, and the target information of No. 1 is as follows. ”
Roots and Bones -> 10 Understanding->8 Mind  >8 Fortune  >8 ”
"Summary." The target talent is extremely high, it is recommended to earn under the door, carefully taught, must be a pillar of the clan. ”
Lin Feng did not see anything else, his eyes stared straight at the blood-red number "10" behind the root bone, and then at the blood-red number "10" behind the root bone.
The root bone of 10 means what.
For example, when someone else runs, it takes 100 meters from the starting point to the end point. If the end point is the same, this little one starts from a place of 90 meters.
No wonder, no wonder he was less than four years old when the wolf's face blossomed with peach blossoms.
Little Dot also found Lin Feng at this time. He looked over dazed, blinking with big eyes, full of Meng Zhengtai.
Lin Feng smacked his lips. Not only was his bones strong enough to defy the heavens, but his comprehension, spirit, and fortune were all at the super genius level as well.
It's not a bit stressful to accept such a product as an apprentice.
Lin Feng pondered, gradually showing a warm and sunny smile on his face.
If someone who was familiar with Lin Feng in a previous life saw him showing such a smile, they would definitely hide as far away as possible.
Chapter 1
The morning sun shone through the light silver veil and landed on the bed, making her eyes almost unable to open.
At the party last night, she drank too much in a moment of joy, and it was Lu Yanchen who picked her up later.
Time sat up, the thin silk quilt slipped off, revealing a touch of red on the white sheet, while his greasy white skin was covered with hickeys.
You can tell from this look that it is the result of a night of indulgence.
"I love you. ”
When the love is strong, his touching love words seem to still be in his ears. Time was full of peach blossoms, eyes were shy, turned around and looked around.
Where is Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out to buy breakfast?
Time lifted the quilt and got out of bed. When his legs touched the ground, he was weak and almost fell to the ground.
When the time came out again, Lu Yanchen also came back and slowly walked into the living room, his slender and straight figure carrying a strong and oppressive aura.
Time raised his eyes and fell into a pair of deep eyes. His eyes were as calm as an unfathomable clear pool.
It was the first time such an intimate relationship had happened, and time was inexplicably shy, lowering his eyes and not daring to look at him.
When she was confused, she vaguely heard him say that he wanted to give her a surprise.
Are you going to propose to her?
Time was a little overwhelmed, and his heart was beating wildly.
As soon as she made a sound, she was interrupted by Lu Yanchen's deep voice. "Break up." ”
What did he just say? break up.
The surprise he wanted to give her was to break up.
He's teasing her, joking, or seriously, breaking up for her.
A scream of extreme pain was hidden in his throat and could not be sent out. It took a long time for Time to find his voice.
Very light, very light, as if low in the dust. "Break up, before we have sex... After that, Lu Yanchen, what do you mean? What do you mean? ”
Lu Yanchen's indifferent expression did not change a bit, "Last night, who called me to pick her up, and who hugged me tightly and told me not to stop, you also enjoyed last night very much." You also enjoyed it last night very much. ”
Time was stunned like being struck by lightning.
She was dumbfounded, looking at this man who was completely different from what she remembered, she couldn't control her trembling, and asked three words with difficulty, "Why is it? "? ”
After speaking, he turned and looked out the window, smiling faintly at the corner of his mouth.
That smile in the eyes of time, like a mockery.
Time's face was as pale as snow. The agonizing pain started from the heart and spread to the limbs under the pressure of the nerve endings. The dizziness-like darkness hit. Her fingertips pinched her palms tightly, and she didn't let herself faint.
The air suddenly became cold and bitingly moist, and people shivered and choked, making it impossible to stay for even a minute.
Time has gone.
Chapter 1
Rain Country, Cangyun Town Ling Family, the moon passes through the sky in the middle of the day.
It took Ling Han a full ten seconds to finally confirm that he had indeed been reincarnated and reborn.
It is absolutely incredible for a strong man to take ten seconds to be sure of something, but it also proves how incredible what happened to him is.
In his previous life, he stood at the peak of martial arts and had unprecedented achievements in alchemy. The pioneering "three fires" technique triggered a revolution in the alchemy world and was honored as "Alchemy Emperor".
But he was not satisfied, and wanted to go further, reaching the legendary Void Breaking Realm, shattering the void, and turning mortals into gods. To this end, he visited countless monuments and finally entered the Black Blood Valley. After going through many dangers, he found a mysterious ancient pagoda.
Without disappointing him, golden words appeared on the ancient pagoda. It was a supreme cultivation method called the "Inextinguishable Heavenly Book". When he reached the highest level, his body would be immortal. He would coexist with heaven and earth and live the same life as the sun and the moon.
But even with Ling Han Tianren realm of martial arts cultivation, still feel that this "indestructible scripture" is obscure and difficult to understand, as if reading a heavenly book, completely clueless, completely clueless.
He forcibly wrote down this exercise, and when he was about to study the ancient pagoda, the ancient pagoda vibrated lightly, releasing an immeasurable divine light, which instantly shattered his flesh and body. But oddly enough, his soul did not dissipate and fell into a state that seemed awake or awake, like a dream or not a dream, which had lasted for tens of thousands of years.
During these ten thousand years, his soul has been trying to figure out the Immortal Sutra - he can't do anything else except this. After ten thousand years, he finally comprehended the first level of this exercise.
It took ten thousand years for a strong man in the realm of heaven and man to comprehend the first level of a method. What kind of concept is this?
You should know that Celestial Realm powerhouses generally have a lifespan of less than a thousand years. Normally, no one in the world can cultivate this immortal sutra, because they have already died of old age before they even start.
But Ling Han mastered the first level of the Immortal Sutra in this strange way, and then he suddenly came to life and was reincarnated on a 16-year-old boy also named Ling Han.
"No matter what happened, in short, I am alive again. ”
"Although this body is only the cultivation of the second layer of the refining body, the waste material can no longer be waste material, but I used to be a strong man in the heaven and man realm, standing on the top of martial arts, and a master of alchemy. If I have poor qualifications, I will use pills to make up for it. I don't believe that I can't return to the peak with pills. I don't believe that I can't return to the peak. ”
"Besides, I can finally cultivate the immortal Sutra, which is a supreme cultivation method, even... It may not be owned by the mortal world, but from the legendary divine world, otherwise how could it take 10, 000 years to understand the first heavy cultivation method? ”
"In this life, I will surely surpass my predecessors and achieve the throne of God. ”
"Also, what is going on with this body? I only cultivated to the second level of body training at the age of sixteen. Is it because today's martial arts are too withered? ”
Boom, countless memories poured into my mind, which belonged to another Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in the process, two completely different people also fused together, regardless of each other, indistinguishable from each other.
"I see. ”
Ling Han nodded in his heart. The reason why he is now on the second level of body refining is that his spiritual roots are too poor.
If you want to become a warrior, there is a prerequisite, that is, you must have spiritual roots. With spiritual roots, one can absorb the spiritual energy between heaven and earth, refine one's own body, and turn it into one's own primordial power.
Some spiritual roots absorb spiritual energy quickly, while others absorb spiritual energy slowly. Therefore, spiritual roots are divided into four major grades of heaven and earth Xuanhuang. Each major grade is divided into three small grades: upper, middle and lower. It is the best of the upper grade of the heavenly level, and the worst of the lower grade of the yellow level is the worst.
The key to judging the quality of a spiritual root lies in its purity. The purer the better, but Ling Han's spiritual root has both five elements and is the most messy. In the martial arts world, this is the worst spiritual root, which can only be said to be barely inferior to the yellow level. Therefore, at the age of 16, he only practices to the second level of body refining, while his peers how to reach the fourth and fifth levels of body refining.
Ling Han in his previous life was the Heavenly Spirit Root, and he was also the Heavenly Grade Upper Grade Nine Yang Fire Spirit Root. In addition, with the talent of alchemy that no one can match, it took only two hundred years to reach the Heavenly Human Realm with alchemy. This is an unprecedented record.
"The Five Elements Miscellaneous Spiritual Root, this is the lowest level of spiritual root. No wonder that although the predecessor worked extremely hard, he only cultivated at the second level of body refining. " "For me, although the Five Elements Miscellaneous Spirit Root is a bit tricky, but with the help of elixir, I will definitely be able to return to the peak in at most 400 years. ”
"Huh." ”
Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, with an unbelievably shocked expression on his face. He was stunned for a while, and with his powerful soul power, he re-examined the spiritual root in his dantian. The shocked expression suddenly turned into ecstasy.
"This is not the root of the five elements. The five elements are completely balanced, forming a lotus lotus." This is the Five Elements Chaos Lotus, the best of the best, even rarer than the Nine Yang Fire Spirit Root, and can be called the Divine Level Spirit Root. "The predecessor's cultivation was slow because the divine spiritual roots needed special techniques to exert their true power." ”
"And I... Just mastered a Five Elements Heavenly Extreme Art that matches the Five Elements Chaos Lotus. ”
"One hundred years." No, it will only take 50 years for me to reach the Heavenly Human Realm again. ”
Rao Yi couldn't help but show joy in Ling Han's cultivation base in the Heavenly Human Realm in his previous life. Spiritual roots were born destined, and he couldn't change them the day after tomorrow. In his previous life, in order to break the void and become a god, he visited countless monuments and obtained a large number of secret techniques. The Five Elements Heavenly Extreme Technique is one of them.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts. In this life, he will create brilliance again and create immortal myths.
"How did the predecessor die? ”
Ling Han picked up the memory, and soon he showed an angry face.
Formerly the only son of Ling Dongxing, the head of the Ling family, his mother and grandparents passed away very early. The Ling family is a martial arts family, and every member of the clan practices martial arts and respects martial arts. Like Ling Dong, what can you do to sit on the position of the head of the family? It was his strongest strength that he fought against.
But because of the problem of Linggen, Ling Han was regarded as a waste material since he was a child, and he ate up his white eyes.
In order to give his son a bright future, Ling Dongxing and Huyang College reached an agreement - Huyang College will recruit Ling Han as a disciple, full training, and in exchange, Ling Dongxing will enter the purple light valley, for Huyang College to find a long time ago lost things for Huyang College.
Huyang College was established by the Yuguo Dynasty and has countless resources. If it is fully cultivated, even people who waste materials can also be promoted to the Juyuan Realm.
But the people of Huyang College can't be idiots. If that thing is easy to get, how can they be willing to offer such favorable conditions?
Purple light valley, dangerous, take a wrong step may die, but for the sake of his son, Ling Dongxing set out seven days ago without hesitation.
Yesterday, people from Huyang College came and informed the Ling family that they would pick up people according to the agreement today. But at this time, Ling Chongkuan, the great deacon of the Ling family, ran over to discuss with his predecessor and asked him to give up this precious quota to his grandson Ling Muyun.
The reason is that Ling Muyun is a genius with unlimited prospects. Such an opportunity cannot be wasted by a waste material.
Naturally, the predecessor would not agree. This was an opportunity that his father had traded his life for. But Ling Chongkuan said it was a discussion. In fact, he was just informing his predecessor. He didn't take his opinion to heart at all.
The predecessor could not bear to attack, but Ling Chongkuan was a strong man in the Yuan Gathering Realm, and he could be suppressed with one finger. He was an opponent either.
With just one punch, his predecessor was seriously injured and he was locked in his room. Obviously, he didn't want him to make trouble in front of the people at Huyang Academy. And by the time Ling Dongxing came back, the wood had been turned into a boat.
And the predecessor of the heavy injury was so angry and dead.
Ling Han snorted, really deceiving people too much, the quota that his father risked his life for was actually taken away by Ling Chongkuan grandpa and grandson like this.
This is shameless dog stuff.
I can't stand it.
He got up from the bed and suddenly felt soreness all over his body - he was alive, but the wound on his body wouldn't get better without a reason.
"Linggen was also traumatized." "Ling Han frowned. That blow inflicted damage on his spiritual roots, and the spiritual roots were wounded. This was a very troublesome thing. Ordinary healing stones were ineffective.
"As far as I know, there are seven kinds of elixirs that can repair the spirit root, but the materials needed for the four are too expensive to even sell the whole Ling family in exchange - Moreover, my spirit root is only lightly damaged, so I don't need such advanced elixirs. ”
"Of the remaining three, two need to be refined into pills. With my current cultivation at the second level of body refining being too reluctant, I am too reluctant to cultivate. Then there is only one choiceYuanxin Fuling Powder, you only need to mix the medicinal materials in proportion, and boil them into medicinal juice. ”
"Heal the injury first, and then stop Ling Chongkuan and grandpa. Although I don't want this quota, I must not let my father's life-changing opportunity be cheap for this shameless grandpa and grandson.". ”
He sat down cross-legged and began to run the Immortal Sutra.
This is the first time he has run this possibly divine level skill, but because he has been trying to figure it out for tens of thousands of years, he is also very calm in controlling it now.
Buzzing, a powerful vitality suddenly arose in his body, and his energy was consumed a lot, but the injury quickly recovered.
In just a few minutes, he was completely injured.
"As expected of the Inextinguishable Heavenly Scripture, I have just begun to practice and have such a wonderful effect." It's just that this is completely different from other exercises. The normal exercise is to use the spiritual root to transform the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into elemental strength, but the immortal sutra is just the opposite, tempering the elemental strength of the body and treating injuries. ”
"After reaching the highest level of practice, immortality is not impossible. It is not impossible to achieve immortality. "That's why it can be called the Book of Heaven." "Unfortunately, the current level is not enough, otherwise I can repair the spiritual roots with the immortal Sutra." ”
Ling Han opened his eyes, looked at the gradually whitening sky outside the window, and murmured, muttering. "Now, it's time to meet that shameless old man Ling Chongkuan and give him a surprise." ”
He put on his shoes, walked to the door, and opened it.
Immediately a tall figure appeared at the door to block his way. This person's name was Zhang Yuan, one of Ling Chongkuan's lackeys.
"Master Han, the deacon has ordered you to stay in your room today." You have to stay in your room today. "Zhang Yuan said with a smile that although the man opposite was the son of the head of the family, he was a famous waste material. In his eyes, it was a joke in his eyes.".
Ling Han's gaze turned cold, and he said. "You dare to stop me." ”
Stop is you, the big deacon said, today must not let Ling Han to make trouble, when necessary is to beat up on the line is ok. Zhang Yuanpi laughed without a smile. "This is the order of the Archdeacon, please don't embarrass me, Young Master Han." ”
Ling Chongkuan this old dog is really cautious, beat him into a serious injury is still not assured, but also sent someone to guard the door, and this can also see how important it is for Ling Chongkuan to let his grandson enter Huyang College - but when this hope is dashed, Ling Chongkuan's disappointment and annoyance can also be imagined to know.
"Go away." "Ling Han said coldly.
Paaaah!
Ling Han raised his hand and slapped it coldly. "What are you, tell you to roll or not? " ”
What, he was actually slapped by a piece of trash. Zhang Yuan stroked his face in disbelief, this waste actually dared to attack him, and also hit, this is what kind of joke.
Paaaah!
Ling Han waved his hand again and slapped him firmly again.
"Baa -- baa -- baa --"
The sound of an acoustic sheep call echoed through the silent mountains.
Li Qiye climbed up the hill. The night wind was sharp and cold, but at this moment, he was so anxious that he was sweating. At the age of thirteen, he climbed up the mountains on his hands and feet, and the night looked particularly lonely and creepy.
Although the night seemed terrifying, Li Qiye's heart was burning with anxiety.
Li Qiye, who came from a tenant farmer's family and had poor parents, began herding sheep at the age of seven.
Today, Li Qiye herded the sheep as usual, but when he drove the sheep back in the evening, he found that one sheep was missing, which could ruin him in a hurry. He hurried back to the hill to look for it. However, he rummaged through the hill and did not find the sheep.
Thinking of the ferocity of Zhang Dahu's landlord and the loss of a sheep, Li Qiye was anxious and panicked.
Now the whole hill has been searched, and there is no shadow of the sheep. At this time, Li Qiye thought of one place, and only one place did not search - the Immortal Demon Cave.
Looking up at the night in the valley in front of him, he was like a wild beast. He opened his mouth and devoured people at any time. He faintly heard the sound of wolves crying and ghosts calling in his ears and overlooked the blurred night of the Immortal Demon Cave. Li Qiye couldn't help but play a shiver.
Immortal Demon Cave, a place that has a fierce local reputation, is said to have a demon living in it. Anyone who enters will be eaten. After entering, no one can ever come out alive.
However, at this time, the crackling sound of Zhang Dahu's whip echoed in Li Qiye's ears. If he lost a sheep, Zhang Dahu would definitely beat him to pieces.
"Well, well, well, our immortal raven has finally been refined, lacking only the soul. Today, I just want to borrow your soul and use it with one." "I don't know how long it took, but a deep and gloomy voice sounded in the fairy cave."
After a while, there was a rapid sound of flapping wings, and a strange bird like a crow flew out of the Immortal Demon Cave.
"Fly, fly, this seat must borrow your soul to remember the burial ground, fly over the remains, as long as the Nine Realms are still there, this seat must find the place." I must find the Nine Realms. "In the fairy cave, a deep and gloomy voice echoed."
From then on, between heaven and earth, there was a Yin Crow flying, entering the burial ground, entering the Immortal City, and crossing the fierce realm... Involuntarily, he flew over the Nine Realms. After all kinds of hardships, he did not die for millions of years.
Time passed, times changed, invincible figures rose, and giants fell one after another. Slowly, I don't know from what time**, a mysterious crow began to appear, a mysterious crow out of prison, began to find a way to dominate their own destiny, began to find a way to dominate their own destiny.
From Medicine God, to Flying Immortal Emperor, to Blood Seal Immortal Emperor, to Mingren Immortal Emperor, to Sun Swallowing Immortal Emperor, to Ice Feather Immortal Emperor... Finally, to the Black Dragon King...
Generations of invincible giants have risen, and generations of gods have fallen away. However, over tens of millions of years, that crow still faintly appears in the long river of time.
The cold wind is like a knife, and the snow is falling profusely.
As soon as Lu Sheng opened his eyes, he saw that he was sitting in a yellow-gray carriage, the carriage was shaking a little, and there was a voice of a little girl speaking softly beside him.
Outside the carriage, there was a lot of noisy voices. There are cries, shouts, and cheers.
Lu Sheng sighed deeply.
He knew that he could not go back. From an old man who was eating and waiting to die in a state-owned enterprise, after getting drunk once, he woke up to this world.
It's been five days now...
He sniffed. There was the smell of wine, pancakes, and fried fruit in the air.
"Oh, the white cinnamon wine in Osmanthus Square is getting more and more fragrant. "The intimate servant girl in the carriage is small and delicate, " she said in a milky voice.
In addition, he is born with a baby face and has a small and delicate appearance. It looked no different from a ten year old.
The little face was chubby, white and red, wearing a small green cotton skirt, and the little hand was still rubbing the hair rope for Lu Sheng to get out of the car and tie his hair.
This kind of hair rope is made of expensive bark, which will naturally emit a faint fragrance, but the only downside is that it will be hard in cold weather and need to be rubbed with hot hands.
Lu Sheng smiled and did not speak without saying anything. The carriage stopped quickly.
He lifted the curtain and stepped out of the car. The gray-white street was paved with bluestone bricks, each the size of a washbasin.
Cars came and went in the streets, and there were people leading horses to and fro with them. The hawkers and the girls and women who came out to hang out were not afraid to show their faces and laugh again and again.
Lu Sheng looked up at the winery in front of him. The white plaque is rectangular, with three big characters written in the middle of the dragon and phoenix dancing. Osmanthus Square.
"Please come inside." The A-frame booth is reserved for you. "A boy greeted him with a smile on his face."
Lu Sheng nodded, looking like a rich boy making a pie, took the silver-edged white paper fan from his small hand, shook it lightly, and the fan unfolded. There was a picture of mountains and rivers on it. The mountains and rivers rose and fell one after another, overlapping light and dark, and at a glance, it was the inscription of everyone's demeanor.
He followed the boy into the winery with ease and familiarity.
The winery is divided into two floors, and there are many people sitting in the lobby on the first floor listening to people singing songs.
A girl in green stood crisply in the empty space with a soft voice. There was also a middle-aged woman playing the pipa beside her.
The song is a biography of Sanhui, which tells the story of the poignant love between the expedition general and the mountain fox girl.
Unfortunately, the drinkers present were all rough people, and only a few literati could understand them. The rest of them turned a blind eye to the two young girls, but they turned a blind eye to them.
Lu Sheng stopped and saw that the first floor was so lively that he simply found an empty seat on the first floor and sat down.
"This who ordered the three will pass." "He casually asked the boy, " he said.
His status in this sweet-scented osmanthus square is different. If this sweet-scented osmanthus square is equivalent to a high-end entertainment club on earth, then he is the supreme VIP customer here.
Such expenses are already considered top customers in small northern cities like Jiulian City.
"It's Young Master Zhou. Zhou Que Zhou Gongzi. ”
Lu Sheng did not embarrass him, so he waved his hand and let him go.
After he pulled Xiaoqiao to sit down, his eyes swept around the crowd on the first floor, and soon he saw a pale, thin-faced young man dressed in white, holding a golden ruffled fan with a loose bag in his hand, and shaking it gently.
"I guess I took a fancy to the little girl singing again. "Lu Sheng shook his head and said."
"The eldest son warned him last time, this guy is really a bad man." This guy is really a bad man. "Xiao Qiao pouted discontentedly."
Lu Sheng smiled and stopped talking. Start listening to the music quietly.
A table of food and wine was quickly served on the dark red wooden table. Lu Sheng picked up a clip of fried shredded meat with lettuce and put it in his mouth.
Take a sip of cinnamon wine that's about the same as a drink The faint scent of sweet flowers is mixed together, just like drinking fruit juice.
This northern snow city, ice shrimp is a specialty here, in the thick ice hole at will, you can play a large number of translucent shrimp body translucent.
Ice shrimp is half the length of ordinary shrimp, but it tastes delicious and delicious.
Of course, the price is also extremely expensive.
Eating once a month is considered a luxury for ordinary people. There is no place like him to have a meal like this.
While Lu Sheng ate delicious food, drank wine, and listened to the little song, his heart was thinking about other things, but he was thinking about other things.
It has been so many days since he came to this world similar to ancient China. But according to his observation, there are many oddities in the world.
At first he thought he was back in ancient times, but then he found out that he wasn't.
The customs and festive climate here are far different from those of any dynasty he knows.
Thinking about something, the door of the winery opened again, but once again.
A group of strong men in short jackets walked in one after another and sat down at a table near the corner.
These strong men know at a glance that they are not locals, their dress is more like coming from the Central Plains region, the dress temperament is not as rough as the north side.
A strong man at the head was bald, with copper earrings and a fleshy face, but at this moment he sighed and sighed. ”
"Brother, what are you worried about? We can't get through Lijia Village. We can take the second road. It's also possible to take a detour from Zhang Village. "Another man frowned and said.
"What do you know? When I came to meet up, I walked from Zhang Village. The situation is similar to that of Lijia Village, where many people have died died. ”
"What the hell is going on, big brother, tell the brothers, and also let us increase our knowledge and increase our knowledge." "A man urged."
The bald man sighed again. "I don't know exactly what happened. I only know that several fishing villages near Suiyang Lake have had accidents. It seems that there are water ghosts at work. ”
" No, isn’ t it? ”
Lu Sheng's table was not far from them, and they could hear their undisguised chat.
Originally, he was just listening and playing, but he didn't expect these people to talk about divine and divine things.
His road family in this life is one of the largest in this northern ice city, and his wealth is still small.
To put it on the earth, it is at least a wealthy person with assets of over 100 million.
When he came out to drink these days, he also heard a lot of rumors about monsters and ghosts in the wine shop, but most of them were legends.
This is the first time that these people have had such a personal experience. So Lu Sheng pricked up his ears and listened carefully.
It's a good thing that those people don't hide it either. He continued to talk loudly about the strange things in the fishing village.
"That water ghost, I saw it with my own eyes. It's more than ten feet tall, with a green face and fangs. It's covered with a lot of water plants. Darling, if it weren't for your big brother, I ran fast. Now you don't want to see my people. "Baldhead is still having palpitations now.
"Brother, there is really such a thing as a water ghost. "A man doesn't believe it."
"I'm afraid it's not a story you made up, big brother." ”
Lu Sheng also felt funny when he heard this. It was estimated that he was just bragging about where the reckless man appeared. During this time, he had seen many of these people.
After eating and drinking, he asked the boy to bring over the song list of the singer girl and browse it at will.
Although the biography of Sanhui is good, it is not suitable for the occasion. He plans to change it to a more cheerful one.
Paaaah!
But at this moment, the bald man blushed and patted the table.
"A bone that the water ghost landed on the ground." I secretly picked it up afterwards. ”
He carefully took out a jade-like green stone from his arms and patted it on the table.
"Isn't this just a piece of miscellaneous jade? "? "A man laughed."
"Miscellaneous jade." This is a miscellaneous jade.
"This brother." Can’ t you show me this thing? ”
Suddenly a gentle voice came from the side.
Lu Sheng stood at the table of several people with a smile on his face, glancing over the green jade on the tabletop.
"This thing, you dare to take it." This is what the water ghost left behind. "The bald man said in surprise.
That's what he's holding out for show now, planning to throw it away in a while.
After all, this is not something that people leave behind. If you really want to attract the water ghost to find trouble, then it is really not worth the loss.
"I'll just take a look. "Lu Sheng doesn't believe in water ghosts. He just sees that the jade looks good. It doesn't look like ordinary miscellaneous jade.
To know the general miscellaneous jade, store stalls can be bought everywhere, is the jade scraps polished out at will, the price is extremely cheap and cheap, the price is extremely cheap.
But somehow, as soon as he saw this piece of jade, he felt something was wrong.
Tsing Yi White Fox Fur, wearing a sapphire hat, wearing cloud pattern black boots embroidered with silver thread, wearing black boots.
All dressed up can be spent in this osmanthus square for several months. It is even enough for ordinary people to live for more than a year.
"Young master, it's not impossible, " he said.    One or two silver will do. ”
Lu Sheng asked Xiaoqiao to take out one or two pieces of silver and put them on the table.
The bald head decisively picked up the jade and stuffed it into Lu Sheng's hand. Several people changed their eyes, got up and walked away.
Lu Sheng didn't speak either. He watched several people leave. He squeezed the jade in his hand and picked it up to look at it carefully.
That is to say, I will be able to be so rich and powerful in my life. "He shook his head. One or two pieces of silver was nothing to him. According to the memory of this body, his monthly expenses on weekdays were at least a hundred taels of silver or more. Occasionally, it may cost thousands of taels.
Thinking of this, he secretly said that he was a prodigal.
Holding the jade, he ignored the sight of the surrounding guests watching the fun, but left the winery on his feet and walked toward the waiting carriage outside.
But just out of the winery, not halfway, he was suddenly stunned, picked up the jade and put it in the palm of his hand.
The jade actually melted in the palm of his right hand, just in the palm of his right hand.
The originally hard stone turned into a dark green mucus in just a few seconds, and a scream came faintly from the mucus.
The whole mucus suddenly exploded into a mass of green smoke, slowly drifting away from Lu Sheng.
He was stunned to stand in place, shaking his eyes to see that the jade is still in his hands, but the green inside has not known when quietly disappeared.
He stood stunned, constantly recalling the previous images for a while.
Xiao Qiao kept calling him from the side.
Lu Sheng came back to his senses and looked at the jade in his hand. It was simply an ordinary pebble, not even jade.
"Let's go, go back to the mansion." ”
The two got into the carriage, the coachman picked up the whip and whipped it a few times, and the two long-haired black horses began to walk slowly.
In the carriage, Lu Sheng didn't say a word, constantly looking at the pebbles in his hand. Xiaoqiao also discovered the abnormality of the stone at this time.
"I'm on it again. "She muttered in her heart, but she didn't say much. The eldest son was fine this time. The biggest time he was cheated before was for a so-called antique wine pot, which cost thousands of taels of silver. He almost angered his grandfather to death. This time it is only one or two silver, the young master sometimes eat a meal also more than this amount of money.
The carriage went all the way back to the house. As he passed the city gate, Lu Sheng heard someone shouting outside.
"     I heard before that the water ghost was removed. A traveling Taoist took action to solve the danger of the fishing village. ”
"Is there anyone from the court? " ”
"I came early. I heard that even Ouyang, the head of the magistrate's yamen in the city, almost fell into the trap." Fortunately, I met a wandering Taoist. It was said that as soon as the Taoist made a move, there was a flash of golden light. The water ghost screamed screaming when he was in the warehouse, turned into green slime, and then exploded into smoke and dispersed. ”
"Of course not. ”
Lu Sheng heard that it was the officers guarding the city gate chatting and chatting.
From time to time, he would deliberately pass by the city gate here. The officers and guards here were well-informed and liked to brag about strange things everywhere.
"That's a coincidence.    "Lu Sheng's face was calm."
He recalled the jade before, and his heart sank.
In the autumn of 9999 Shenzhou Calendar, East China Sea, Qingzhou City, East China Sea.
Qingzhou Xuegong, Qingzhou City Holy Land, Qingzhou City's high-ranking nobles, and more than half of the powerful people in the Zongmen family, all walked out of Qingzhou Xuegong from Qingzhou Xuegong. Therefore, people in Qingzhou City are proud to be able to enter the palace to practice. Once they have the opportunity to enter the palace, they will study hard.
However, it seems that not everyone has this awareness. At this time, in a school house in Qingzhou Academy, there was a young man lying on the table sleeping soundly.
Above the lecture hall, a girl in a long blue dress also noticed this scene. A touch of anger could not help but appear on her pretty face. She started to walk towards the sleeping teenager.
Qin Yi, 17 years old, an official disciple of Qingzhou College and a lecturer of outer disciples, has a beautiful face and a hot figure. In the schoolhouse, a pair of eyes moved with Qin Yi's moving posture. Even if he was angry, Qin Yi's pace was still elegant.
"This guy actually slept in Senior Sister Qin's lecture hall again. "It seems that only then noticed the sleeping posture, many teenagers around are a little speechless, obviously, this is not the first time, this is not the first time."
"With Senior Sister Qin's appearance and figure, even looking at her is enough to be pleasing to the eye. What on earth is in that guy's mind? ”
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular lecturer, no one. As for the reason, as long as you see her, you can understand. I don't know how many people regard her as a goddess. Her lecture halls have always been crowded with study halls until they are full.
Qin Yi's pace was very light, and there was no sound when she walked to the teenager's side. She stood at the table and looked at the sleeping face in front of her. Her beautiful face was covered with frost.
"Ye Futian." "A soft voice came out, but it was not shouted from Qin Yi's mouth, but from behind Ye Futian.
It seemed that he heard someone calling him in his sleep. Ye Futian moved his body, propped his head with both hands, and opened his eyes leisurely. Under his hazy eyes, the curtain was undulating peaks and mountains.
"Good lord, good." "Ye Futian couldn't help but whisper. His voice was very soft, like he was talking to himself. However, in the quiet environment at the moment, the voice still seemed particularly abrupt. For only a moment, many eyes froze in the air, and then turned into anger.
"How dare he... Blatantly belittling Senior Sister Qin. ”
An angry gaze turned into a sharp sword, making Ye Futian shiver coldly. It felt like something was wrong. His gaze moved upward along the seductive land, and then he saw a face as delicate as jade but full of anger.
"Eh... Ye Futian had a black line on his face. How could it be Qin Yi?
Looking back, he saw a pure girl of fifteen glaring at him.
Ye Futian glanced at the girl, then secretly scolded, was killed miserably, no wonder the size is not right, no wonder the size is not right.
"Sister Qin, I... Ye Futian just wanted to explain.
"Ye Futian." "Qin Yi interrupted him indifferently, and said. "Qingzhou Academy was founded under what background." ”
Obviously, Qin Yi is to avoid the embarrassment just now, change the topic, but her anger at the moment, Ye Futian can clearly feel, he even faintly feel from Qin Yi flowing out of a wisp of sword, sharp, stinging every inch of his skin, stinging every inch of his skin.
"Three hundred years ago, Emperor Donghuang unified the Eastern Shenzhou and ordered the princes of the world to create the Wufu Academy to flourish the martial arts. The Qingzhou Academy was established under this background. "Ye Futian responded. Of course, what he said was the official history record. There was another name in the wild history he saw in the family. However, that taboo name was never allowed to be mentioned.
"What are the professions of spiritual practice? "Qin Yi asked again.
"Cultivation can be divided into martial arts and martial arts. There are many professions in martial arts such as warriors, knights, and swordsmen. There are many professions such as mages, alchemists, and weapon refiners. And mages are divided into many departments. Of course, there are also people with different talents who practice both martial arts and martial arts. "Ye Futian responded."
"You seem to be missing a profession." "Qin Yi looked solemn and asked seriously."
The young man's face showed a touch of divine brilliance. "The strongest profession recognized by China is the one who is favored by God, the Master of Destiny, and has the talent bestowed by God. Most of those rare talents, such as summoners, beast masters, and star wizards, come from Destiny Masters. No matter whether they practice martial arts, Destiny Masters can have stronger talents than others. They can have stronger talents than others. ”
All the people around are fascinated, the Master of Destiny, the legendary profession, the destiny of heaven, and the favor of God. Not only that, even Heavenly Destiny Mages are naturally suitable for both martial arts and martial arts cultivation. ”
Qin Yi's eyes showed longing, and then he looked at the young man in front of him, and said angrily. "I didn't expect you to know a lot about this. ”
"Of course. "Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said seriously." "I am a destiny mage. ”
Puff ” Not far away, a teenager who was drinking water choked violently and coughed violently. A pair of eyes around him looked at Ye Futian like an idiot.
There is such a brazen person in the world, worthy of being a legend of Qingzhou Xuegong, not only openly teasing Qin Junior Sister, but now falsely claiming to be a Mage of Destiny, in order to attract the attention of Qin Junior Sister.
However, what kind of person is he, who has been practicing in the Entrance Palace for three years, has been wandering in the Awakening First Realm Qi Gathering Realm, his body is weak, and it is obvious that his physical cultivation has not been completed, such a mediocre and even useless figure, that he is a Destiny Mage, and that he is a Destiny Mage. He claims to be a Destiny Mage, a Destiny Mage, and has been wandering in the Awakening First Realm Qi Gathering Realm. It still has to be shameless.
Qin Yi's chest rose and fell again, and suddenly it was magnificent. She looked at Ye Futian angrily. "Since you are a Mage of Destiny, the Palace of Nature has a soul, release the soul of your Palace of Life and let me see." ”
"My soul is still sleeping and cannot be summoned, and I fell asleep in the lecture hall because of the soul." It is also because of the fate of the soul. "Ye Futian responded calmly."
"Ye Futian... Qin Yi suddenly shouted, her beautiful eyes fixed on the young man in front of her, and she said. "Three years ago, you entered the school palace at the age of twelve. At that time, I was still an outer disciple and visited your talent test. You perceived Reiki as a talent and shocked the school palace. Many teachers paid attention to it. However, in the next three years, you did not inch in, and you always stayed in the awakening first reunion realm. You had nothing to do all day, lazy and absent-minded in the lecture hall. You really did not practice. ”
"In the past three years, you have abstained from all the exams, whether it is the spring exam or the autumn exam, and you have directly ranked last to last in the Academy. Ye Futian, do you have a heart of shame? ”
Accompanied by Qin Yi's angry roar, the entire schoolhouse became silent, and needles could be heard falling. Everyone stared at Qin Yi's excited face. It seemed that this was the first time they had seen Sister Qin like this.
Ye Futian also seemed to be suppressed. Those dark eyes stared at the delicate face flushed with anger in front of him.
"Has it been three years? "Ye Futian whispered in his heart, but he didn't expect that three years had passed unconsciously, and the guy in the Palace of Life had not changed at all, and he was somewhat surprised. Senior Sister Qin, the iceberg sexy goddess who had always been indifferent, had been paying attention to him all the time. Since he stepped into the school palace and detected the talent of perception, the talent of perception had already begun.
The space was dead silent. Qin Yimei stared at the young man in front of her, with a handsome face with clear lines, clean and deep eyes shining like stars. At the age of fifteen, apart from being thin, she could not find any other faults. In another three or two years, she must be a beautiful man.
"My tone is not too heavy." "Qin Yi saw that the corner of Ye Futian's eyes seemed a little lonely, so he couldn't help but secretly say in his heart, and his anger dissipated a little."
"There is still a month to go before the autumn exam. If you still abstain or fail this time, it will be useless to intercede for you for the rest of your life. The Academy will not allow you to stay any longer. You actually don't understand that you really do not understand. If you still abstain or fail this time, it will be useless to intercede for you for the rest of your life. "Qin Yi continued, the eyes of the people in the school house condensed, it seems that the school palace can not bear that guy to endure." It seems that the school palace can not bear that guy.
If so, I am afraid it will be recorded in the history of Qingzhou Academy. After all, it is extremely rare to be expelled from Qingzhou Academy.
"He goes, I go, " he said. "At the end, an indifferent voice came, and many people looked at the young man sitting in the corner. His eyes were complicated, with envy, jealousy, worship, and fear.
"It has been decided in the Academy that there is no need to participate in next year's Spring Festival for the rest of his life. He can choose any palace in the Academy, the Knights, and the Magical Palace to practice. His future can no longer be affected by you. "Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed, the fate of him and Yu Sheng will eventually go in completely different directions."
The corner of Ye Futian's mouth outlined a faint smile, some cynical cynicism.
"Shut up... Sitting in the back, he stood up for the rest of his life. Those eyes pierced Qin Yi with a bright sharp light.
"Sit down." "Ye Futian didn't turn his head back, he said indifferently, Yu Sheng's eyes froze, looking at the back in front of him, and then sat down quietly, as if Ye Futian's words were iron orders to him.
"I decided... Ye Futian showed a slightly frivolous smile on his face and looked at Qin Yi, saying. "Officially participated in this year's autumn exam." ”
Behind, a bright light flashed in the eyes of the rest of my life.
After three years, is he finally going to be serious?
Qingzhou Academy has been practicing for three years. Everyone in the academy only knows that he is extremely talented for the rest of his life. He is a genius with golden attributes and perception, and his martial arts talent is also extremely high. He can practice both law and martial arts. Although he is an outsider disciple, his realm is higher than many lecturers.
However, who really knows that sleeping teenager?
"Your body is weak, and you are still in the state of awakening the first reunion. Even if you participate in the autumn exam, how can you pass through the big exam? " Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed secretly in his heart. Even if he got up now, he was afraid it was still too late.
"If it passes, it will be. Ye Futian seemed to have no self-awareness at all. There was a strong confidence in his tone.
"If you can pass, you can do whatever you want in the lecture hall in the future. "Qin Yi said.
Ye Futian's eyes flashed a strange brilliance, looking at the beautiful figure and hot figure in front of him, his eyes couldn't help but look at the place he shouldn't have seen, and the weak way was weak. "Can you do anything you want to do? ”
"This guy, what do you mean by this... Many people stared at Ye Futian.
"This shameless bastard, where are his eyes looking? "It seems that he noticed Ye Futian's eyes, many people have the urge to run away, he even dare to flirt with Sister Qin."
Qin Yi naturally noticed Ye Futian's eyes, and the sympathy he had just born disappeared instantly. Beautiful eyes stared at Ye Futian viciously, gritted his teeth and cut his teeth. "If you want to do anything, you can do it. ”
In the deep mountains and dense forests, all demons gather.
For the first time, all ethnic groups put aside their grievances and appeared at the same time, tiger rabbit fox snake... All kinds of demons have arrived. For a time the whole forest was full of voices of various demons, large or small, delicate or enchanting. On the top was sitting ten demon kings, the ten top powerhouses in the demon world, but at this time, an equally heavy expression appeared between the brows.
"Ladies and gentlemen, you must think that you have something in your hearts about what has happened here recently." "The tiger clan has always been strong, and the tiger king first opened his mouth to make all the demons quiet down." We are all demons. Under such a crisis, I think all ethnic groups should put aside their prejudices and work together to solve the current problem. ”
"What is the purpose? ”
"Do you still have to guess about this? " "Tiger King snorted coldly, "Except for those cultivators in the six factions and three sects, who would do such a thing? Do we have fewer demons slaughtered by him over the years? ”
"But we have always been very different from these immortal cultivation sects. Why did they suddenly block our way out of the realm? " "The Fox King looked puzzled."
"I didn't eat the first son of their three sects and six sects." "The Snake King also guessed, "They don't have to tear their faces off like this, will they? " ”
"That's right. "The Leopard King also said indignantly, "So many years have come like this, which demon has not eaten a mortal, how can the three sects and six sects suddenly attack hard? " How can the three sects and six sects suddenly attack hard? I don’ t think it’ s them. ”
"Yes, everyone knows that the evil spirit of our world is detrimental to their cultivation, so they never go near the border forest, so how can they stay here specially? "? ”
"But... Apart from the six factions and three clans, who else has the strength to kill all the demons that are out of bounds within three months? "Tiger King still insisted on his ideas."
The Eagle King nodded, as if recalling something, and the feathers on his body trembled. "I heard that those demons who went out of the realm all died without bones, and there were also those who were skinned and cooked. There are air-dried corpses on the old trees in the forest. It's so cruel to do it... Animals are not as good as animals. ”
"It's simply too bullying to deceive demons." "Tiger King smashed the armrest of the stone chair with a palm, and stood up angrily, " Dear Demon Kings, I think that instead of guessing who did it here, we should kill out together and figure out who did it. I don't believe it, no matter how high their cultivation base is, they can stop this army of ten thousand demons. ”
As soon as he said this, the other nine demon kings immediately showed an expression of approval. Indeed, instead of being afraid, it was better to take the initiative to attack.
The deer king replied, "my son died in their hands. instead of guessing here, let's go out and kill him. What about the three sects and six sects? when have we monsters been afraid of them?? ”
Isn't that why we're here today? Whoever he is, kill out to avenge the dead. "Even the most timid Rabbit King stood up to respond, but the Rabbit Clan died the most."
That's right, if this revenge is not avenged, it will be in vain for demons. ”
"The demon soul of the clan is above, and I swear to avenge this revenge." ”
Other demon kings also stood up to respond one after another, and even the demons of all ethnic groups on standby appeared one after another. The bright claws of the bright claws shouted the slogan of revenge excitedly. The whole army was waiting to be sent.
So what ...... "A thin voice suddenly sounded in the demon group, " I don't think there's a need to go, let's go. ”
In the wave of mass indignation, a voice of opposition suddenly appeared. Although the voice was not loud, it succeeded in attracting the attention of the demons. As soon as the shouting stopped, the sight of all the demons pierced the past in unison.
"Who is it? "Tiger King is a tiger roar, searching for this gutless demon class."
The demons looked around. They were obviously the demons with the most sensitive five senses, but after searching for a long time, they couldn't find the person who spoke.
"Who just spoke was the one who actually said that." "Tiger King was a little angry, " Where did the cowardly demon come from? There are all kinds of things for this king to stand out. ”
"I'm here, here." ”
The demons inspected the surroundings several times again, but they still didn't see who the voice was.
"Here, here... ” That voice started again, 'On the left, it's not right...' After that, a little on the right, wrong. Look here, look at this, look at this, look at it again.'. ”
The demons followed the voice and looked left and right several times, but still did not find the person who made the sound.
"Alas, " he said. Never mind, I’ m here. ”
Until a sigh, a figure suddenly used both hands and feet and climbed up on the platform where the demon kings were sitting. It was only then that the demons saw the person who made the sound.
It was a woman in a gray robe. Her shoulders were weak, and her eyes were still pulling down. She exuded a lazy temperament. She was short and thin, and her face was still a little sallow.
A word "weak" appeared in the minds of all the demons at the same time, too weak, too weak. Even the demonic aura on her body was pitifully weak, as if any demon breath atmosphere, can blow her away.
No wonder the demons searched for a long time just now and didn't find this person. Such a demon is really inconspicuous.
The bloody Tiger King suddenly couldn't see it, and sprayed his tiger nose and said fiercely, "Hmph, you bastard, just a few cultivators scared you, and you have changed into this kind of appearance." "Demon can be transformed, but this is the Ten Thousand Demons Conference, so most of the demons here have revealed some prototypes to distinguish races, only she maintains a complete human form, which makes the Tiger King even more uncomfortable." Don't dare to show people in their original form. What kind of demon are you? What kind of demon are you? ” I’ m a human being. ”
"I'm a human being. "The woman replied.
"Human demon." "Tiger King froze for a moment, " what kind of demon is a human demon? " I’ ve never heard of it before. ”
"What kind of chaotic weak demons dare to come to the Ten Thousand Demons Conference? "The Tiger King glared at the woman indignantly." You gutless little demon, don't talk nonsense here, it will affect our morale to go to revenge before we go. ”
"No, I'm serious." "The woman raised her hand unrepentantly, but her shoulders drooped unconsciously, making her look weaker." You really don't need to go out and seek revenge. ”
"Still talking sad words. "The Tiger King was angry and roared, "Believe it or not, I ate you little demon." ”
"If you eat me, there's no need to make a trip in vain. ”
"What do you mean? ”
"I mean, the guy you just said killed all the demons and beasts... She sighed, patted the dusty robe and raised her head, still listless, but pointed to her nose and said, "Maybe... It's me." It's me. ”
The audience was silent for three seconds, and the crowd was silent.
"Kill her." ”
The ten thousand demons who reacted rushed towards the woman at the same time.
Small animals and so on-so troublesome.
Five minutes later.
The first and last Ten Thousand Demons Conference has come to an end.
Chapter 1 Tony Dunn.
The loud noise stimulates the nerves of the brain, and the decibels can cause deafness. A dazzling white light shot into his eyes, and the sun * * drummed with pain.
Tang En couldn't help squinting, but the white light didn't disappear, instead it spread to the whole world.
What the fuck is going on? Am I at a rock 'n' roll scene?
Tang En opened his eyes cursingly in his heart, but what rushed into his eyes was a big scary face. A black face covered with sweat, and the heat from the two black holes under the wide nose seemed to have stained his face. The white teeth in the gaping mouth are as frightening as wild animals, and of course the bad breath that comes out of it.
Then came a fierce, head-on collision. Tang En felt as if he had been hit in the chin by a heavy punch, and the whole person fell backwards and fell.
The weight of the two men was on those poor plastic bottles, and they were overwhelmed and declared disintegration. The white water splashed out, and even a column of water shot out from the mouth of a bottle, directly rushing to the face of the "pond fish" behind, and other "pond fish" like frightened sparrows rose into the sky.
"Damn it. ”
"Damn it. ”
"What's going on here? ”
"Team doctor, team doctor." ”
"How do you kick it. ”
Dunn lay on the ground, staring blankly at the unfamiliar faces surrounding him. Some of them had anxious faces, some were gloating, and some covered their faces without seeing their expressions. The surroundings were still noisy, but the loud noise just now had changed its tune, which was permeated with boos and laughter.
Where is this place? Who are they? WTF IS GOING ON
Wait, let’ s see what happens on the sidelines. "The commentator on the live broadcast suddenly became excited. He stood up and looked down from the top stand." Forest's main striker David & # 183; Johnson was knocked into the courtside coaching bench during a struggle with opposing players. Poor coach Tony & # 183; Donn was standing on the sidelines directing the game.. Oh, my God. Looking at the tragedy on the ground, this is really a collision between Mars and the earth.
Dawn lay on the ground, his light gray suit soaked and crumpled with grass clippings and dirt, looking like a freshly used rag.
A man with a big nose and a black beard, somewhat like Grade Mario, appeared in his field of vision. He quickly took out white gloves from the back-colored leather bag he was carrying and put them on. Then he began to examine Dawn's body.
Hell, it looks like he landed on the back of his head.
"Can you hear me? "He stretched out his hand and shook it in front of Tang En's eyes, his tone obviously much more anxious than before.
At the same time, the TV screen began to repeat the scene just now.
David Johnson was pushed hard by the opponent in a fierce fight with the opponent's No. 14, and then the big black man slanted his body and rushed towards Tony Dunn standing on the sidelines. But the strange thing is that Tang En could have avoided it. He had plenty of time, but now he stood on the sidelines like a puppet, watching helplessly as his teammates crashed into him.
The scene is over. The Forest players anxiously gathered around the coaching bench, and the center of the crowd was naturally Dunn lying on the ground and David Johnson, the black striker who made a mistake, knelt on the ground and kept praying. Johnson even knelt on the ground and kept praying. If something happens to his coach, he will be the first player to kill his head coach on the court.
Unlike the nervousness of the Forest players, most of their opponents stood on the court, watching the play with their arms folded. There were also curious people who took on the responsibility of being spies for the whole team, kept running to watch the fun, and then ran back to share the situation in the crowd with their teammates. They ran back to share the situation with their teammates.
The Forest fans in the stands didn't seem to be worried about the life or death of their head coach. They took this opportunity to curse their team's poor performance loudly. All kinds of words starting with "F" or "s" burst out of their mouths. Countless middle fingers raised high set the "0" on the big screen. 2. "The matching eyes are dazzling."
Forest team doctor Gary F1eming is still doing his best. He saw Tony's eyes move a moment ago, but why didn't he respond next?
He patted Tony. Dawn's face, still unresponsive. The team's acting head coach was lying on the ground like a wax figure, his mouth slightly open and his eyes round, as if he had seen something very surprising.
The blue sky, the white clouds like cotton candy, the faces with different skin tones and expressions, and the noisy environment are all familiar, but so strange, as if they are thousands of miles away from me.
The referee signaled the team doctor to watch and deal with it himself. He could not suspend the game endlessly because of an off-court injury. He blew the whistle to get the players back on the court and the game went on, even though the Forest players were no longer interested in fighting.
"But his life may even be in danger." Fleming was angry at the referee's indifference. He pointed at Dunn, who was still lying on the ground, and shouted at the referee.
"Then call an ambulance, I'm just a judge." "The referee pushed back without showing weakness, " Moreover, he didn't seem to be as dangerous as you said he was. He pointed behind Fleming and ran back to the court.
Fleming turned back and saw Dawn standing up slowly, touching the back of his head. He hurried up to support him. "How do you feel, Tony? " ”
Dunn asked blankly in return. "Where is this? ”
Fleming turned around and cursed an expletive. It's been really unlucky these days. "Des, Des, come here." "He waved for a golden man on the coach's bench to come over."
A man named "Des" ran over and there he was. "How's Tony? ”
"It's terrible." He even asked me where I was just now. ”
Des' reaction was the same as Fleming's just now, and he also turned his head and cursed a dirty word.
"I suspect it was the result of a blow to the back of his head when he fell to the ground." ”
"Is it bad, Gary? " "Des bit his lips, a face of gravity."
"I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad. Fleming shook his head.
"what does that mean, " he said. ”
"In a good situation, he only has short-term amnesia. Resting for a while, he will recover after a while. A bad situation... Do you still need me to say you? ”
Des waved his hand to signal that he understood. "Send him to the hospital? But now the game is still going on, and we are lagging behind, and we need him to direct the game... ” As he spoke, he turned his head and glanced at Tony Dunn next to him, but he was surprised that Dunn was slowly moving towards the player tunnel by himself.
"Hey, hey." "Des hurriedly dropped Fleming and ran forward to grab his colleague.
"Tony, where are you going? " "In a noisy environment, Des's tooth and claw shouting actually only has the effect of" whispering ".
Dawn looked back at Des blankly, a look that chilled Des. Now the afterglow of the setting sun was shining golden, but he couldn't see any brilliance in those eyes at all.
"Tony, where are you going? " "Des repeated another sentence.
"I... I don't know, maybe... Is to go home... Dawn murmured, still wanting to break free from Des' hand.
Fleming also ran over from the side. "Tony, you can't go home now." We are playing, you are the head coach, you have to command the team. ”
The pulling of the three people at the entrance of the passage attracted the attention of the two teams' bench, as well as the stands, and even the players on the field would glance at it from time to time.
Tang En suddenly laughed. "I'm a coach. "This is ridiculous. How can I be a coach... Although I am a fan and often play football manager games, how can I be a coach? It must be a dream, or a damn nightmare.
Fleming said next to him, as if introducing the two people he had met for the first time. "He's Des, Des, # 183; Walker ( desa1ker) . The former England international, a centre-back on the pitch, retired from the team only last season, and now he is your colleague, your assistant. ”
Dunn nodded and then said to Des. "Okay, now you direct the game for me, I'm going to take a break, " he said. "After saying that, he broke away from Des's hand, no longer paying attention to the loud booing behind him and the two stunned people, and walked into the passageway.
Fleming looked at Dawn's back and then at Des Walker.
Walker sighed heavily, turned and walked back. "This game can't be played. ”
Dunn sat in the passageway, his back against the wall, looking blankly at his surroundings. On the white wall opposite him is a huge sign. Below the big red "mushroom" are three wavy curves, and below that is an English word. Forest.
Where am I going? What exactly is going on.
Tang En touched the back of his head, where there was still a dull pain.
***, sneak up on me and hit me behind.
"What am I called, " he said. He muttered to himself, but suddenly covered his mouth. It was not until this time that he realized that what he had been speaking was bird language - English.
"***, how did this happen? " ”
Dawn, who finally realized where he was, was stunned again, which was so unbelievable that his brain stopped responding after the load calculation stopped responding. And all this seems to have nothing to do with him anymore.
That was the scene at the City Stadium this afternoon, when Forest's acting head coach Tony Dunn stood on the sidelines and was knocked down by his team members before appearing to fall into a brief coma. When he got up again, he walked straight into the player tunnel.
By the faint light of the street lamp outside, Dawn stood in the bathroom and looked at herself in the mirror. A middle-aged gweilo with a tall and straight nose, deep eye sockets, blue eyes, and a slightly curved brown head.
In fact, Tang En from Sichuan, China is only 26 years old. At this moment, the people in the mirror even have forehead wrinkles. Thirty-four years old. This is Tony Dunn's age.
Not only did he inexplicably lean over an Englishman, but he also traveled forward four years and three months.
Although he never felt that he was handsome and could attract many women's favor.
He growled at the mirror before shattering it with a punch. The self in the mirror suddenly became countless, and the fragments fell to the ground with a rattling sound. Countless faces looked at Tang En, as if mocking him like a mockery.
Dawn felt a little dizzy. He stepped back and leaned against the smooth wall, gasping for breath.
Dawn, who had been quietly in the dark for a few minutes, gradually calmed down, and he decided not to think about such a complicated problem first. He has a habit of drinking in China, and once he encounters something unpleasant, he goes to find a place to drink. Chengdu's bars are everywhere, maybe you can find a one-night stand or something by the way. He habitually regarded Nottingham as Chengdu in his heart and decided to go out and find a bar to drink.
Glancing at the hazy sky outside, he put on a thick windbreaker and walked out the door.
"OW in my own home o. 3 lost to the weak brigade Walsall, the Forest team has really had a bad year recently. The highly expected Paul Hart did not bring good results to the team. After the last round, he submitted an application for resignation to team chairman Nigel Doughty, and he was quickly approved and approved. ”
Today's sports news is being broadcast on an elevated television, naturally focusing on what happened on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest game.
There was a burst of boos in the noisy bar.
A drunken man raised his middle finger at the TV set. "That Tony. Dawn, I know he is. The little furry kid who used to be Paul Hart's assistant on the youth team was Paul. ”
When the drunk had just finished his long speech, Tang En just pushed the door and entered. The sound of the door attracted the attention of most people who were drinking and chatting in the bar. Everyone turned their eyes to the door. When they saw who the person who came in was, they were first surprised, and then they all had playful smiles on their faces.
A typical middle-aged British man stood up with a glass of wine and shouted loudly, "Our coach Tony Dunn has arrived." ”
"Whoo, whoo, whoo." "The people inside the bar hissed" welcome ".
"Toast to his beautiful off-court defense of Johansson's breakthrough in the cup." "The middle-aged man raised the wine glass in his hand, and the people around him immediately followed suit and raised the wine glass in his hand. "Cheers.
Another man, who was visibly drunk, stood up crookedly and walked in front of Tang En. He held a beer bottle in his hand and stretched it to his mouth. He burped and asked. "Coach Tony Dunn, that was a beautiful defense, but the referee and public opinion were obviously not... Neither thinks so... Uh...
After asking, he turned his head and laughed at the other people in the bar.
So he pushed the bottle in front of him with a gloomy face. Then he walked straight to the bar and said to the bartender inside. "A bottle, please... "He habitually wanted to say a bottle of" Xiao Er "-a small bottle of Erguotou. Although he is from Sichuan, he went to college in the north and has liked this kind of liquor since then. But now he can't speak" Xiao Er "in English. More importantly, he quickly realized that this is in the UK, not in China, but not in China. He lowered his head and muttered a curse, then changed his tune. "The strongest wine." ”
The others who had been watching him shouted loudly when they heard him say he wanted the strongest wine.
"Yo. Tony the Coward Drinks Too. ”
The young bartender was also at a loss as to what to do with the excited guests. He tried to get the wine but was stopped by those alcoholics. "Get him some juice." Juice. ”
"No, no, it's still milk. We have the freshest milk." ”
"Ah ha ha ha, ha ha, ha, " he said. ”
The owner of this bar was alarmed by the noise outside. He came down and stood at the top of the stairs. He saw almost all the guests who had not yet fallen asleep on the table gathered around the bar. In the middle of them sat a man wrapped in a black trench coat, laughed at by the drunkards. He laughed at the drunkards with all his heart.
His loud voice immediately quieted down the tavern. The drunkards who had been arrogant just now all quieted down when they saw the person standing behind them.
Dawn wondered what kind of person could make a group of people honest with just one sentence. He turned his head slightly and saw a man coming out of the shadows at the top of the stairs.
The young bartender hurriedly pointed at Dunn and said to the man. "Boss, he wants a strong drink. ”
After seeing who the person sitting was, the visitor was a little surprised, but he still said, ''But he still said.'' "Just give it to him." ”
"But... But they don't let The bartender looked embarrassedly at the drunks who had returned to their seats.
The man looked around the bar, but all the people he saw lowered their heads, either pretending to be asleep or keeping their heads down and drinking hard. Tang En became more and more interested in the capable middle-aged man in front of him.
"I don't think anyone has any objection. Pour him a glass of Scotch whisky. I'll treat him." "The bar owner turned to ask Dawn, "Single or double are still double. ”
The drunkards watching the excitement next to him burst out laughing.
The bar owner laughed, too. "I forgot who you are... He filled the glass with half a glass of golden whiskey and then added half a glass of water. Then he handed it to Tang En in front of him. "This is my hometown wine." ”
Dunn took a sip and immediately coughed. He seldom drank foreign wine. What's more, this pure Scotch whisky has a strong smell of coke.
There was a burst of schadenfreude laughter in the bar.
"The Tony Dunn I know never drank and lived like a true traditional Puritan. And he won’ t look at me the way he does now, and you don’ t know who I am. "The man stared at Tang En, and Tang En realized that he seemed to be seeing through everything by this man.
He had to find a way to hide himself. "Uh... I, " Dawn lowered his head and took another sip. This time, he didn't dare to let the wine stay in his throat for another second. He swallowed it directly. The uncomfortable feeling was indeed lighter.
There was another burst of laughter.
The man touched the back of his head to show understanding.
Someone nearby helped Dawn out, and a voice shouted. "Looks like our coach Tony really broke his head." The person sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, a two-time UEFA Champions League winner and 1978 Stanley Matthews Award winner. Mr. Kenny Burns. He’ s a hundred times better than you stupid ass. ”
The people behind him laughed loudly, and the "stupid donkey" kept shouting, but the object of his ridicule could not prevent him from fiercely returning his hand and pouring out the only half cup of wine left in his hand. The golden Scotch whisky shone brilliantly in the light, drew a beautiful arc in the air, and then shot it precisely on the face of the unlucky guy - precisely like David; Beckham's right foot free kick. "Bang." ”
His dirty words were smashed back by a thick wine glass, and Dawn jumped on the opponent with an unexpected speed and wine glass. He could not bear it any longer. He came to this place inexplicably, traveled forward for four and a half years inexplicably, and was ridiculed and insulted inexplicably... He wants to find someone to vent now, whether he beats someone else, or someone else knocks him down.
The two crashed into the table behind them, and the empty wine bottle fell and shattered on the ground with a crisp sound.
The laughter stopped abruptly, and everyone was stunned. They didn't expect Tony, who looked like a coward just now. Dawn will suddenly explode.
The first person to react was Kenny Burns, the owner of the bar, who pushed the fat man standing by the bar and shouted. "Silly standing on what to do." pull them apart and pull them apart. ”
In addition to the tragedy on the ground, blood had oozed from the forehead of the person who was beaten. A red circle appeared there, which was the mark of the mouth of the cup. On top of that, his left cheek was punched as red as if he were drunk.
Dawn, on the other hand, hadn't done anything except mess up her head and clothes. Being pulled up, he seemed to have exhausted his anger and didn't have the stance of still rushing to chase after him. He sorted out his clothes and head, and then spat at the unlucky ghost who was held up by his companions. "I don't care who the fuck you are, don't mess with me." ”
Then he turned to Burns and said something. "I'm sorry for making a mess of you here." Today is too ***... "He was annoyed at the thought of being crossed, " another day... I will personally apologize, and please don't worry about compensation. ”
Then, without waiting for the owner of the bar to say anything, he turned and walked towards the door. When he passed the fat man, he sneered at him. "Keep your milk for yourself, fat pig, and drink it." ”
Everyone watched him push the door out, but no one thought of stopping him, so they watched him leave, leaving a mess behind.
There was silence in the bar. At this time, the drunken drunkard sat up from the table, looked at the silent room and the mess, and asked in confusion. "Did I miss something? ”
I don’ t want to be a gweilo. “ Let me go back, let me go back” . Can Dawn say that?
Since your “ past life” is pretty bad, why not use this opportunity to live a different life? Although he has never been a football coach, he has also watched football for more than a decade. He has played football manager games every generation. He understands the nature of some coaches' work. Isn't this a good opportunity for a challenge?
He stopped thinking about the boring question of why God had chosen him. He just needs to think about how to be more like a real professional coach now, and although it's going to be hard, it's worth trying.
"Hey, man, man." You broke into my house without my permission, and I’ m gonna call the police if you don’ t leave... "An old voice suddenly sounded beside him."
Dunn looked blankly at the old man standing opposite him. He was holding a lot of newspapers in his arms and a half-bitten hamburger in his hand.
"This... Is your home." "He pointed to the bench beneath him, " he said.
"Of course. ”
"Ah, I'm sorry to bother you... "Tang En stood up from his chair, and the other person immediately sat down and lay down. Cover yourself with newspapers in your arms and press them firmly between the back of your chair and your body.
Looking at the contented beggar eating hamburgers and lying in the "newspaper nest", Tang En even thanked God for not letting himself "possess" him. Fate did not treat him badly.
A taxi dropped off in front of him, and he stepped forward quickly, then got in and got in. Dawn took one last look at the beggar lying in the cold wind enjoying his "dinner" in the car and asked the driver to take him back to the strange home.
Starting today, a brand new world slowly unfolds before Dawn's eyes. On a sunny Saturday morning, Zhao Yao walked on his way to sterilization.      He is on his way to sterilize his cat.
In the cat bag in his hand is a yellow cat, also known as an orange cat, a kind of garden cat. The head, back, and limbs were covered with layers of yellow-orange markings.
Chest and stomach is a large fluffy white hair, the tips of the limbs are white, it is said that this kind of snow white gloves have a second killing effect on girls, will control their brain waves, so that they make a "ah ~ ~ ah ~ ~" sound.
Although it is a male cat, it has big eyes and looks very feminine.
At this moment, the cat was letting out a heartbreaking howl. The vast majority of domestic cats are very, very homely, and they are only willing to stay at home for the rest of their lives. Moving or going out is a very scary thing for them. Zhao Yao only kept comforting the cat loudly.
At the same time, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dark meteor slowly crossed the outer space and gradually flew over China. The surface of the meteor shone with a strange luster, as if constantly releasing some kind of ray into the surrounding void.
Inside the Star Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao put the cat bag at the front desk. The male cat was sterilized. I made an appointment before. His surname is Zhao. ”
"You haven't been to us before looking at the records. You need to fill in the information column of the medical record card. ”
In outer space, the meteor slowly crossed the sky over China and began to move in the direction of the Pacific Ocean. Where the meteor passed, many cats suddenly shook their bodies, and a deep luster flashed in their eyes, just like the luster emitted by the meteor.
At this moment, Matcha suddenly moved and struggled to jump up, running towards the hospital gate.
The little nurse let out a scream, but Zhao Yao on the side suddenly rushed out and grabbed the escaped matcha.
Zhao Yao's speed was still too slow to catch the body of Matcha, but only the tail of Matcha.
When the tail was caught, Matcha let out a roar, and instinctively turned around and bit Zhao Yao. This is the instinct of cats, and the speed is extremely fast. In an instant, a mouth was opened on the back of Zhao Yao's hand. Zhao Yao's back ached and immediately released his palm.
Perhaps knowing that he was in trouble, Matcha did not continue to run away, just curled up in his body and looked at Zhao Yao with some unease.
Zhao Yao hugged the matcha airway. "Silly cat, what are you biting? You rebelled, right? " ”
The eyes of the matcha cat suddenly flashed a faint light, and the traces of blood on the teeth disappeared completely.
Zhao Yao also felt his head suddenly dizzy, and then he wanted to see if the wound on the back of his hand was deep, but this look was slightly dull, only to see that the back of his hand was clean, there was no wound or blood.
The little nurse on the side took the cat and comforted him. "Good boy matcha, it's okay, it will be fine in a while, don't be nervous, don't be nervous." ”
This call was heard in Zhao Yao's ears, but it was not a simple cat call, but it became an understandable word.
Zhao Yao pointed at the matcha in front of him in shock, with a surprised face. "This... This... The cat was talking. ”
The little nurse looked at Zhao Yao suspiciously and said. "Mr. Zhao, are you all right? " ”
"Didn't you hear? "Zhao Yao said hurriedly, " Zhao Yao said. "It... It's in the middle of a conversation. ”
The little nurse frowned and looked at Zhao Yao's eyes more and more strangely.
"You understand me, meow." ”
"Take me home." ”
Wuwu Wuwu, scared to pee ~ Meow ~ Meow. ”
Zhao Yao suddenly opened his mouth wide and looked at the little nurse who was still comforting Matcha. He looked at Matcha again and said, "It's a small nurse who's still comforting Matcha. "You can understand me." ”
"I can understand, I can understand, I want to go home, take me home, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo. ”
The little nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao, who was talking to the cat, but her face became more and more strange.
Despite the strange eyes of the little nurse, Zhao Yao quickly picked up the matcha and stuffed it back into the bag, trotting all the way out of the hospital.
In the rental house, the matcha cat returned to the familiar environment and immediately relaxed. Lying on the coffee table, she began to lick her small white hands, her eyes narrowed, and her face leisurely. Fur licking has always been a very relaxing behavior for cats.
In front of the coffee table, Zhao Yao stared at the matcha cat in front of him and said tentatively. "Can you still speak? ”
As he spoke, he stood up and was eager to try with a face. "Does the host want to play games or not? " ”
"Hey, this... Wait and play again. "Zhao Yao scratched the back of his head and said at a loss, somewhat at a loss." "When you learn to speak, you learn to speak." ”
Looking at the innocent matcha cat, Zhao Yao had a strange expression on his face.
The matcha cat did not feel strange about the situation in front of it at all. It suddenly jumped into Zhao Yao's arms and squinted against Zhao Yao's body. "Play some games with me." ”
Looking at the matcha cat in front of him, who spoke like a five-year-old child, Zhao Yao touched the other person's head, and the latter revealed a purr of enjoyment.
"Counting, you are only one year old, and now you are only five years old in human years, right? " "Zhao Yao's mouth filled with a smile." "It's still a child. It doesn't seem to be good. ”
A month later, at nine o'clock at night.
Zhao Yao opened the door of the rental house with a tired face, took off his clothes, and sat down on the sofa.
Although the rental house he lived in was only 30 square meters, it was fully decorated. It was the house of a newlywed couple, and it was very close to the company. He didn't have to worry about traffic problems because he worked overtime every day, so although the rent was not cheap, he still let Zhao Yao show willingness to express.
After Zhao Yao lay down, the matcha cat unconsciously climbed up to his side and rubbed his head against his arm, looking affectionate and flattering.
Zhao Yao smiled and rubbed Matcha's head, which showed an expression of enjoyment.
But at this moment, the phone on the sofa was also pushed over by Matcha.
Chapter 1
Tang Mo'er was lying on the table, her thin white arms resting on her small head, her long black hair flowing like satin was hanging in the air, revealing half of her young girl's bright little face, um, hot, so hot, so hot.
What’ s going on?
There was a steady stream of dry heat in her body that burned her little face, making her feel uncomfortable. Today, she came to the imperial capital from Yecheng and just drank a cup of boiled water handed over by Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, her half-sister who was a different mother, was a minor.
"No, Tang Mo'er jumped down, hurry up and chase after her, we can't let her run away." ”
Tang Moer a excited spirit, awake more than half, Han Xiaowan unexpectedly designed her.
What to do.
Tang Mo'er looked at the man as if she had caught a life-saving straw, "Sir, help me, I've been drugged, and there are several men behind me who want to forcefully explode me." ”
The man's deep and cold narrow eyes glanced over the girl at the men behind him. Although his eyes were pale, they made people shudder.
Those men are punks and have seen some of the world. This man who covers the headlines of the entire financial magazine and controls the economic lifeline of the entire imperial capital They have seen it on TV. They have seen it on TV.
Gu Mohan.
They absolutely couldn’ t afford to mess with this man, so they turned around and ran away. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, an earth-shaking battle is being staged. Angels with flaming wings, knights with heavy armor, and crusaders with golden swords are fighting a group of black-smoked bone dragons, ferocious and terrifying death knights, and countless skeleton soldiers composed of the evil army.
The battlefield between the two sides is not a plain full of war and smoke or a burial ground full of bones, but a dark and invisible darkness. This is undoubtedly a very strange imagination.
But what is even weirder is that outside this battlefield, in the void shrouded in endless darkness, a few faint voices can be heard whispering.
"Operate it, hurry up and operate it, " he said. lolsky ”
"When you talk about others, you can control your death knight first. Death knight and mobile bunker fight ah!  ”
"Where are my troops? Who is attacking my troops? Where is the enemy? ”
After the battle ended, the angels, knights, and scattered skeleton soldiers that originally existed on the battlefield also disappeared into the darkness of the background. Once again, the absolute silence shrouded in endless darkness returned here. It seems that nothing happened.
But several voices continued to communicate, and even more other voices joined in.
"My teammates are a bunch of pigs. Leash dogs are better than them all. Not only did it not help the situation in the slightest, but it also grabbed the command of the core troops.   "The voice that failed before said a little reluctantly."
"BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Obviously because the undead creatures are too weak, if they were replaced by my demonic army, they would definitely be different.   "The other voice fought back without showing weakness, and made such a forceful justification for his wrong command." "I had thought that the Death Knight could easily take care of those bunkers. ”
After hearing this voice, a few chuckles could not help but come from the darkness, and the two sides of the argument suddenly lost their temper, and said helplessly to the victorious side of the victory. "The skills are not as good as those of people. I am willing to bow down to the wind. ”
And the winner unexpectedly carried out a round of ungraceful ridicule at this time.
"Ha ha, " he said. Justice will triumph over evil in the end. ”
"In the face of our strength, whether it is undead or demons, even gods will be killed for you to see." ”
Such words undoubtedly made people even more angry. The two sides, who had already calmed down, immediately launched a new round of scolding. The third person of the victorious party drifting away from this new battlefield asked helplessly. "I should not have organized this round of games. ”
It turned out that the tragic and heroic war before was just a game.
A voice not involved in the game responded. "It's great to be able to simulate a realistic war with your consciousness, so that we, the bystanders, feel as if we were there. You are really good at surprising us. I hope your Excellency is coming down. ”
Facing the sudden gratitude from the other party, this guy called Hope replied in a low-key manner. "You flatter me, it's just a pastime." ”
Yes, that battle, which was like a life-and-death duel between the camps of justice and evil, was just a pastime, and it could only add a little fun to this endless prison.
This is the realm of the void beyond the plane of reality. It is supposed to be an eternally dark, cold, and silent Jedi. No living beings will survive. It is a realm more terrible than death.
However, in such a place, this dead place that could hardly accommodate any living beings, there was a group of indeterminate creatures stubbornly living. They had lost their bodies, and only the last consciousness remained in this void.
They call themselves Voidwalkers and are forever imprisoned in this prison called Voidness.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were the supreme powerhouses of all races and fields, the mages who reached the apex of the magic path, the warriors who touched the limits of the martial arts, the alchemists who created all things, the faithful and noble missionaries, the demons who dominated the hell, the lich who controlled the soul, and so on. They have left their names in the history of various planes.
Many people think that they have long since disappeared, only those historical records prove that they once existed, but they do not know that these old monsters are strong enough to be described as perverts. In fact, they are imprisoned in the endless void outside the plane. They have spent incalculable years there, and they seem to be imprisoned here forever. The seemingly thin barrier between the real plane and the void is a wall of sighs that they can never break through. Rao is that powerful that they once possessed, but there is nothing they can do about it.
But they never gave up hope of getting out of trouble, because there is a very special existence among these 33 Void Walkers, that is, the fifth walker codenamed Hope.
Hope's original name was Bai Yi, not from the large and small planes of human existence outside the void, but from a strange place called Earth. Before his death, he was an editor of a small news website. His daily job was to extract news from other websites at home and abroad, and then replace it with one such as explosion.
Headlines like Men Will Cry and Women Will Be Silent are published on their own website, a noisy and boring job.
Later, because of an accident, Bai Yi's consciousness did not disappear immediately. Instead, he entered this mysterious void by mistake, met several other void walkers, and finally survived like this. Until this moment, he remained strong.
The Voidwalkers insisted that he, who came from a different world, would be the key to getting out of this endless prison, "Only you are different. If you want to get out of here, you are our only opportunity. I firmly believe in this, so I use the code name hope to call you." "The first void walker, the one code-named magician, once said to him like this."
They have always believed in this, believing that they will one day see the light of day, even though they have been imprisoned for countless times, hundreds of years. Thousands of years.
If you want to persist in this eternal prison for thousands of years without going crazy, chatting or discussing alone is obviously not enough. In fact, the most important way for Voidwalkers to spend their time is an activity called memory sharing.
This activity is based on an awareness technique called memory backtracking, which allows people to recall every detail of their experience, even every punctuation in the newspaper, which can be clearly recalled.
Then through a certain degree of editing, remove some memories that you don't want others to see, such as sleeping with a woman or sleeping with your left and right hands, and then exchange memories with each other, which is equivalent to enjoying a long movie about someone else's life. This is a great way to kill time.
The memories of the thirty-three Voidwalkers were equivalent to letting him experience thirty-three lives. Even though he later forgot most of his memories in order to avoid memory confusion and only retained their knowledge and experience, his state of mind also screened out childish and impetuous weaknesses in these thirty-three life experiences, became mature and calm, and was no longer the ordinary person on earth who was ordinary on Earth.
That's why he was placed with high hopes by other Voidwalkers. However, after countless years, even he could not find any opportunity to leave. The only thing he could do was to make this boring time a little less boring.
At the same time, the reality of East is about to usher in the nightfall. When the afterglow of the setting sun fills the entire Xiansai College, the students finally finished their heavy schoolwork for the day. Vigorous laughter, walking in twos and threes on a tree-lined pathway in the college.
Miya, a second-year student of the Soul Armor Department, is also one of them. She has a lovely face, her long black hair is combed into two equally lovely double ponytails, and she is wearing the standard uniform of Xiansai College. After a simple farewell to her classmates, she came to the square of the college alone, found a bench at random and sat down, and then rubbed out some half a piece of bread left over from dinner from her coat pocket. Carefully tear the bread into a little crumbs, and then sprinkle it on the bluestone floor of the square. Then sprinkle it on the bluestone floor of the square.
A moment later, there was a sound of wings flapping in mid-air, and several white pigeons quickly fell to Mia's feet, pecking at the crumbs she spilled while cooing. Mia squatted down carefully, and her long ponytails swept gently on the ground with her movements. She quietly looked at the group of pigeons she was already familiar with. There was a smile of relief on his face.
Beautiful maidens, docile pigeons, quiet squares with several statues, accompanied by various lush vegetation around them, gathered together into a beautiful picture in the golden afterglow of the last sunset.
This is what Mia does every day, and it is also the most relaxing time of her day. As a student with average qualifications, life in Xiansai College, an institution of higher learning, will always seem extraordinarily hard.
It's getting dark. Let's call it a day. I have to go back to practice. Goodbye, gentlemen pigeons. Mia kept a relaxed smile on her face and bid farewell to the pigeons. She lifted her slender legs wrapped in white stockings under her short uniform skirt and quickly rushed back to her dormitory.
Evening is also a very important time to study, especially for a student with average talent like Mia, the effort required is not as easy as the smile she seems to have on her face forever.
1. Chapter 1
In the Su family mansion, in the huge martial arts field, a martial arts awakening ceremony is being held.
The young man on the altar, named Su Yu, is the son of the elder of the Su family, and he is extremely talented.
Su Mo, the son of Su Hong, the head of the Su family, completed the nine-fold quenching body at the age of 14, and is known as the first genius of the Su family.
Now that a genius like Su Yu has appeared, then with Su Mo's talent, the awakened martial soul will certainly not be worse than Su Yu.
If Su Mo can also awaken a Martial Soul above the fifth rank of the human level, then this time, two top geniuses will appear in the Su family. Their future development of the Su family will be no small matter.
When the presiding elder called out the name, the shocked disciples, elders and others all looked at the handsome young man next to them. In their eyes, the meaning of expectation was extremely strong, even surpassing the previous Su Yu.
Sumo, looking calm, raised his footsteps and walked to the altar.
Su Yu walked down the altar with a proud face and gave Su Mo a cold smile. His eyes were full of provocative intentions.
Sumo ignored the other, took a deep breath, sat cross-legged, and closed his eyes tightly.
From the bottom of the altar, a talisman light immediately floated out, constantly drilling into Su Mo's body.
His talent in the Su family is the top existence, only fifteen years old to complete the quenching body, talent is not bad can not be described as bad talent. However, he was always crushed by Su Mo.
At this time, more and more runes flashed on the altar, wrapping Sumo's body.
Sumo sat cross-legged with his eyes closed and his breathing was slightly rushed. From his body, the roar gradually sounded.
Everyone stopped breathing and stared at the altar above with dead eyes.
Boom!
Finally, with an explosion, a pitch-black phantom suddenly rose up. The pitch-black phantom was like a black hole, slowly spinning inside it. It could not be seen from the bottom, giving people a sense of coldness.
At the same time, above the shadow, a yellow halo flashed.
argh
In an instant, everyone's eyes glazed over immediately.
A halo.
The lowest level martial soul.
How can this be possible?
Even Su Yu's face was dull and stunned.
Because, he could not have imagined that the first genius of the Su family had only awakened a human-level first-order martial soul, the lowest-level martial soul.
Su Mo pan sat on the altar, eyes slowly opened, see their own soul, is also stunned, is also stunned.
"A human-level first-order martial spirit..." "Su Mo muttered to himself, with a wry smile on the corner of his mouth. He never thought that he had awakened a lowest level martial spirit.
The most rubbish martial soul. " "I actually awakened a useless soul."
"What is the first genius? It is the first waste of my Su family. ”
All of a sudden, including the elders of the Su family, the deacon, and others, everyone's eyes on Sumo changed. They were disappointed, disdainful, and despised.
On the altar, Su Mo slowly got up and unconsciously clenched his fists unconsciously.
After a cold glance, Su Mo sneered in his heart. "These people are really snobbish. ”
In the past, Su Mo was extremely talented, and everyone was polite to him. Everywhere he went, he was hugged and flattered.
Now that he has awakened the soul of garbage, these people immediately changed their faces.
Su Mo shook his head, not bothering with them, walked down the altar and strode away from them.
His face was itchy, and there seemed to be a patch of grass around him.
"Didn't I die in a car accident? How did he come back to life? ”
He was a little surprised, but before he could figure out how he narrowly escaped death, the sight in front of him immediately made his eyes widen with excitement. Then I was confused.
It can't be. How can such a beautiful girl be anywhere?
Xu Que's eyes widened. Just like this, I watched the beautiful girl completely fall off the skirt in front of my own eyes, and the blasphemous pants inside were also taken off bit by bit. In my eyes, it was a tender white and tender white, with a unique body fragrance on the woman.
"Girl, what are you doing? You can't defecate anywhere. ”
The scene suddenly froze. She let out a scream, put down her skirt in a panic, bounced up from the spot, and actually flew across the air with a sharp sword.
What the fuck is this bullshit? The sword flies into the sky.
So, it's a real fucking fairy.
Xu Que was startled, and at the same time, a large section of strange but familiar memories suddenly surged out of his head, as if he had experienced them innately.
I fucking crossed over.
Immediately read files in the mind that did not belong to their own memories, Xu Que sorted out everything, Xu Que sorted out everything.
This place turned out to be a world of cultivating immortals, just like the little fairy in front of her who was so angry that she flew into the sky with her sword flying. People can cultivate various skills to become immortals.
And the owner of his body is actually the current emperor's son-in-law, but this emperor's son-in-law is a complete unlucky egg.
He himself is just a poor orphan, but he has a unique spiritual root that is rare in a thousand years.
When he was young, he was recruited by the emperor as his emperor's son-in-law by chance, and provided him with countless heavenly materials and earthly treasures for cultivation. In just six years, he condensed abdominal pills and stepped into the golden pill stage.
When he stepped into the Golden Core Period, he really entered the bridal chamber with the princess, so he spent seven days and seven nights in the marriage bed. As a result, the beautiful and coquettish princess was like a fox, unexpectedly replacing him with all his cultivation, and even the spiritual root talent was taken away one by one.
The genius emperor's son-in-law was reduced to a useless person as soon as he was newly married. He had no use value at all. He was sent out of the palace overnight in a low-key manner. On the way to the frontier, he was slapped to death by someone arranged by the emperor. He died of anger and was finally dumped here.
"Oh, what a pity." ”
Sorting out these memories, Xu Que's face was full of regret, he shook his head and sighed, annoyed and chagrined. "Damn it. Why didn't you take a step earlier and travel to the joyful time when you were doing sports in bed with the beautiful princess. ”
Thinking of the glamorous charm of the beautiful princess selling her soul on the wedding bed, her proud figure, and her charming breathing, Xu Que felt more and more regretful that she was one step too late.
"Bold lecher, how dare you spy on my girl's toilet? Give me your life." ”
At this time, a coquettish rebuke suddenly came, and it was actually the fairy who went and returned.
Her face was flushed with shame and indignation, but her eyes were filled with endless killing intent. At her feet, she stepped on the cold sword and killed Xu Que.
"Damn it, fairy, this is definitely a misunderstanding. It was you who squatted on my bed, and... Even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, please pull up your pants first, okay? You’ re like this, I don’ t have the motivation to run away a lot. "Xu Que shouted and ran away with his legs.
The woman's face suddenly changed, and she mentioned the blasphemous pants under the hem of her skirt with a red face. With a cry of Bah, she angrily scolded and said angrily. "The prostitute wants to die." "At the foot of the sword flying speed suddenly accelerated, whoosh toward Xu deficiency to kill Xu deficiency to kill."
Running furiously, Xu Que frantically thought of ways to escape.
All of a sudden, there was a flash of inspiration in my head.
Immediately, his footsteps stopped, he reached out and touched a familiar token from his arms, turned around and shouted at the woman. "Bold demon girl, I am the emperor's son-in-law of the Huoyuan Kingdom today, you dare to disrespect me." Be careful that I kill your nine clans. ”
At this moment, a series of system prompts suddenly sounded in Xu Que's head.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu deficiency' to activate the forced face system, this system will escort you, help you pretend to help you fly." ”
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Shui "for the success of the impersonation. The reward impersonation value is 1 point, whether it is to enter the mall for redemption or not. ”
"The system has detected that the host'Xu Que 'is weak and difficult to survive under the difficulty of this world. A gift package is specially rewarded for beginners. Do you want to check the gift package? ”
At the same time as the prompt sounded, a light screen window popped up in front of him, displaying several pieces of information data.
Xu Que first took a deep breath, and then burst out laughing uncontrollably. What kind of pretentious face-slapping system is this? It is tailor-made for me to help me break through the sky against the sky system. So, we have to play with this.
"Whore thief, death is imminent, what's so funny about you? " ”
Suddenly, a coquettish rebuke pulled Xu Que back from the ecstasy.
The woman did not know when she had stood more than ten meters in front of him, pointing at him with a flying sword in her hand, but the water spirit's big eyes stared at him suspiciously and suspiciously.
"Come, come... You want to do it with me." smh don't even try i'm one step closer. ”
"Ding, congratulations on the successful installation of the host'Xu Que '. The reward installation value is 1 point. ”
Sure enough, Xu Que's ear that only oneself can hear the system prompt sound sounded again, he could not help laughing again and laughing again. "By the way, it seems there is also a gift bag. ”
Suddenly, the picture of the light curtain window in front of him changed, and a square gift box appeared. The gift box was opened, and several streams of light jumped out and flashed away.
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Shui "for obtaining the primary experience Dan. Taking it can earn 10000 experience points. ”
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Que 'for obtaining two elementary magical escape talismans, which can be instantly moved to any place within a radius of five kilometers after use." ”
"Congratulations to the host'Xu Que 'for obtaining the initial" Archaic Five Elements Art " ( Note: ") . The first chapter can only be cultivated until the foundation building period, and can be exchanged in the mall later) . ”
"Ding, it is detected that the host'Xu Que 'has incomplete spiritual roots and does not meet the conditions for cultivation. The system will complete all spiritual roots for you." ”
Immediately, Xu Que felt like a current was running through his body, and his scalp instantly went numb.
But what followed was a sense of comfort. The pores all over his body were completely opened, greedily absorbing spiritual energy from all directions.
Boom!
Soon, he felt that his body had undergone earth-shaking changes, becoming closer to nature, as if he could integrate into everything and control everything.
But he knew very well how familiar this feeling was. Back then, when the Heavenly Fire Spirit Root had not been taken away by the princess, he had such a cordial feeling for the flame. Now, the system not only repairs his Heavenly Fire Spirit Root, but also complements it. Spirit root with other attributes. Spirit root.
Gold, wood, water, fire and earth, all five kinds of spiritual roots are all at once, and each one is the best "heaven" level
Oh, my God, this is going against the sky.
Thinking of this, Xu Que finally couldn't help but raise his arms and shout. "The system in hand, the world I have, what bullshit fire Yuan princess emperor, when I Xu lack upgrade return, I will trample all of you under my feet, trampling on crumbs." ”
"The bold prostitute thief, since he claims to be the emperor's son-in-law of the Huoyuan Kingdom, dares to speak wildly and attempt to kill the king in vain." "The woman next to me is a little silly, is this son-in-law lost heart crazy? "
"Ding, congratulations to the host'Xu Que 'for successfully pretending to be a bully, gaining 1 point of pretending value." ”
Only then did Xu Que recover. The corner of his mouth twitched slightly. Damn it, he was looking forward to the future by paying attention to his clothes. He almost forgot about the trouble he was having right now. He had to find a way to run before he could do it.
"By the way, Experience Pill." ”
He suddenly remembered that there was also a beginner-level experience pill in the novice gift pack.
Without the slightest hesitation, he hurriedly opened a package with his mind operating system interface, and three items appeared in it.
"Use, use." "Xu Que stared at two of the objects and shouted in his heart."
"Ding, congratulations to the host'Xu Que 'for successfully cultivating the'Five Elements of Primordial Art'." ”
"Ding, the host'Xu Que 'took the primary experience Dan and obtained 10, 000 experience values." ”
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Shui "for upgrading. The current realm is the first level of Qi Refining Stage. ”
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Shui "for upgrading. The current realm is the third level of Qi Refining Stage. ”
"Congratulations to the host" Xu Shui "for upgrading. The current realm is the tenth floor of the Qi Refining stage. ”
In just a few breaths, Xu Que changed from a mortal with unbound chicken power to an immortal cultivator, and sprinted directly to the tenth floor of the Qi Refining Stage, just one step away from the Foundation Establishment Stage.
Moreover, his current strength is even stronger than the tenth floor of the normal gas refining period.
The reason is that he possesses five Heavenly Spirit Roots, which is equivalent to a person possessing five times the strength of an ordinary person.
Even under these five different phasic attributes of Reiki, the power that erupts is far more than five times as simple as that.
"I really have nothing to say this time. I am not invincible. Who is invincible? ”
Xu Que couldn't help but get excited inside. But at this moment, the woman opposite waved a stream of light across the sky, and the sharp sword blade rushed over like a poisonous snake in the blink of an eye.
"Damn it, fairy, I just asked you, a little beauty, to come forward and give my emperor's son-in-law a good look. Who asked you to use the sword to make you out." You are the one who sneaked on me. ”
Xu Que was startled when he saw the flying sword coming, and immediately opened his mouth and scolded.
Can be scolded and scolded, but the movements under his feet were not ambiguous at all. He slid back with the trend, and a wisp of water essence spiritual energy condensed from his fingertips. He flicked lightly on the oncoming sword blade.
"When." ”
With a crisp trill, the sharp sword was bounced out by him.
"This... How is that possible? ”
The woman was stunned for a moment. Those in the sect who could crack this sword so lightly, excluding those uncles with unfathomable cultivation, at least those senior brothers and sisters in the sixth floor of the foundation building period could do it.
"I was puzzled. I said that what happened just now was a misunderstanding. You are still entangled. You actually want to kill me. Don't think I won't hit you because you look like a fairy, but I didn't see it clearly just now anyway. This time, I will look at you with a straight face. ”
Xu Que angrily scolded, at the foot of Yu step out, Tuyuan Reiki immediately into the earth, the speed suddenly doubled, in the blink of an eye appeared in front of the woman appeared in front of the eyes.
Immediately after, a wisp of water aura gushed out of the palm and surrounded the four directions. Before the woman could react, she was imprisoned on the spot and was imprisoned.
"Adultery... Thief, what do you want? " "The woman was shocked, feeling that the fire elemental aura in her body was comprehensively suppressed."
"Hey, hey, there." Since you call me a whore Then I can’ t take the blame for nothing. ”
Xu Que had a cheap smile on his face, raised his eyebrows, and stretched out his hand directly to the woman's skirt.
Chapter 1 If there is an afterlife, dance with you all over the world.
Nine heavens, sea of clouds, wind and thunder platform, a line of sky.
Here, is the Nine Heavens Continent, the last three days, a Jedi, wind and thunder platform, a Jedi, wind and thunder platform. You can catch the wind and thunder on the Internet and get in and out of the first line of heaven.
But at this moment, on the wind and thunder platform, there is a bloody wind and miserable fog.
"Chu Yang, hand over the Nine Tribulations Sword, " Chu Yang. Please don’ t die. ”
"Chu Yang, the Nine Tribulations Sword is such a waste in your hands. For many years, you have made no progress. It is simply a treacherous heavenly thing.". Let's still go out.
Loud shouts came from all directions.
The look in his eyes was still like a rock, calm and calm. - The body is still as straight as a javelin.
Just like the sword in his hand, it is full of meaning that it would rather bend than bend than bend. Even though he has been fatally injured.
At his feet, within a radius of hundreds of feet, countless limbs and broken bodies were dripping with blood.
Looking at the group of masters who were only shouting but not rushing over, Chu Yang showed a sarcastic smile on his face, arrogant and disdainful.
Such a person, such a mindset, no matter how high the cultivation base is, no matter how many people there are, no matter how many people there are. Even if I can kill me ten thousand times, I don’ t deserve to be my enemy.
How could the Nine Tribulations Sword in one's hands leak out? I clearly investigated before and after three years to determine that there is a part of the sword body of the ninth sword in the wind and thunder platform in the last three days, and it took a lot of hard work to finally find the opportunity to risk nine deaths to come to the last three days, but why after I came here, I encountered such a loud and powerful ambush.
Today, he entered the last three days, and it was only the fifth day. Today's game, pure death. I have always been known for my secretive whereabouts, and who knows my plan.
He rushed more than a dozen times in a row, and every time, he was blocked by someone to come back. And the places I chose are all part of the dead end.
Extreme love, extreme sword. He extinguished his emotions and entered the sword, entered the martial arts with the sword, sought the way of heaven with the martial arts, and at the cost of lifelong loneliness, he killed everywhere as a treasure raft to save the world. Unfortunately, after all, he still couldn't practice the Nine Tribulations Sword and the Nine Heavenly Divine Skills.
Is it your own choice to make the wrong choice? Or this path is simply wrong.
Ruthless swordsman Ruthless swordsman, if a swordsman has feelings, what kind of swordsman is he? Sword Dao Martial Dao Heavenly Dao is ultimately merciless... But now, when life and death are at stake, why is it so shaken?
Nine Tribulations Sword, Nine Tribulations Sword, what is your secret?
Looking around greedily staring at the eyes of the Nine Tribulations Sword, Chu Yang smiled bitterly in his heart. You only know that if you get these nine swords, you will be invincible in the world, but you know how much I have paid for these nine swords.
There's nothing left!
Blood was flowing, and Chu Yang clearly sensed that his life was rapidly passing. He pursued martial arts all his life, entering love, breaking love, falling out of love, and then ruthlessly destroying love. At the moment when he was on the verge of death, he thought that his only regret should be that he did not reach the highest realm he pursued in his lifetime, but what he did not expect was that, at this moment, a figure popped up in his mind, which he thought he had long forgotten about. The figure he had long forgotten should have been forgotten.
Mo Qingwu, the woman Chu Yang fell in love with and broke her love.
"Turns out, I'm not really heartbroken... "Chu Yang mouth showed a self-deprecating smile, muttered to himself.
A trace of remorse quietly spread through his heart, like smoke, and instantly swept through his entire soul.
Qingwu. I don't know if I go to Huangquan this time and may meet you.
"Let's go together." Just chop him up. As for the Nine Tribulations Sword, let's discuss it slowly and slowly. "A man shouted loudly, " he said. "If not, wait for him to reply, it will be our turn to spend a lot of money on our feet. "All the people around made a promise, and immediately raised their swords and gathered around Chu Yang.
"Life is not light dance, a dance life bitter." In this life, I dance for the king, and I dance for a lifetime of suffering. ”
This is a small poem written by Mo Qingwu on the night of the betrothal. I still remember that Mo Qingwu had tears in her eyes at that time, and her eyes were sad and resentful. She had known that she was practicing with her love, but she still threw herself into her arms like a moth to a flame, and let herself burn to her heart's content.
After hearing the news himself, he rushed there immediately, but in the end, he was one step too late. Although he later killed all the people in the family who hurt Mo Qingwu, even the nine clans of chickens and dogs did not stay, the beauty could not be revived after all, but the beauty could not be revived after all.
The peerless beauty, on her deathbed, lay softly in her arms and said to herself that she was talking to herself. "Chu Yang, if there is an afterlife... If I can still meet you, I hope you can be good... Look at me. I look better than a sword. ”
Qingwu, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, how can there be tears in the corners of your eyes?
Two drops of clear tears, but his heart, smashed to pieces at that moment. From then on, the heart was dusty and sealed.
Life and death follow each other to the sky.
This is the first talent in the world snow tears cold feeling Mo light dance to Chu Yang deep feeling, specially made a poem, specially made a poem.
And now, Qingwu, you are in Jiuxiao, but I am still in this world... But I can live and die with you right away... life after life and life.
Chu Yang thought in a trance that the corner of his mouth, which had always been cold, hung a gentle and mournful smile.
Dance, wait for me.
Light dance, you know, if there is an afterlife, I would rather not practice what kendo, rather than what peak, rather than revenge, and also want to be with you together. What in this world is worthy of your satisfied smile.
No. Not bitter... Qingwu, you are bitter, but you don't feel bitter. Now... I am bitter.
More and more swords were added, blood flew out little by little, and the pain focused from all over the body little by little, finally interrupting the singing and dancing in his mind little by little.
Chu Yang's furious roar was heard. Standing up suddenly, his long black hair flew up fiercely.
Chu Yang felt a pain in his heart and looked down. The jade pendant hanging from his neck was crushed in front of his eyes with a snap. In a blink of an eye, the canthus was about to crack.
This is the only souvenir Qingwu left for himself.
"Kill." "Chu Yang suddenly raised his head, and the killing machine in his eyes surged furiously. With a wild shout, the Nine Tribulations Sword in his hand suddenly glowed with thousands of sword lights, and it was like the Nine Heavens Lightning suddenly connected into a girdle of light around his waist.
Bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang bang!
Everyone hurriedly retreated, looking in horror at the neat circle of half weapons under Chu Yang's feet, cold sweat streaming down his vest. Unexpectedly, the power of the Nine Tribulations Sword to strike is as terrifying as S.
Chu Yang looked around and suddenly asked softly. "You guys want the Nine Tribulations Sword. ”
Without waiting for anyone to answer, he laughed coldly and said slowly. "Ok" sed star. I’ ll show you the Nine Tribulations Sword. ”
He suddenly jumped up. He had already suffered numerous fatal injuries and jumped up.
"Nine Tribulations Sword, a little cold light ten thousand mane." ”
As the arc shot out, thousands of cold rays rushed out.
Nine Heavens Sword Technique. A sword.
Jiuzhongtian is the name of this continent. All the swordsmanship in history has never dared to be named after these three words, but this Nine Tribulations Sword Technique directly uses the name "Nine Heavens", which is the name "Nine Heavens".
Throughout the ages, this is the only set of things.
Although Chu Yang could not exert the true power of the Nine Tribulations Sword Technique, he had comprehended these swords for a long time. The power of these swords, although not as great as imagined, is also far beyond the secular swordsmanship.
Dozens of masters around, knowing that this sword was no small matter, all took out the ability to press the bottom of the box and tried their best to resist this attack. Everyone's body was shaking, feeling the weapons in their hands, and they could hardly hold them steadily.
"Nine Tribulations Sword, why not slaughter the whole world? " ”
The first move is not finished, the second move has come in a murderous manner. The surging light was like the rising tide of the sea, and boundless killing opportunities shot out overwhelmingly.
Screams sounded. More than a dozen masters who were enough to dominate one side tried their best to resist at the same time, but they were still splashed with blood. They retreated in embarrassment and retreated in embarrassment.
At this moment, everyone had an illusion. Now Chu Yang, absolutely not hurt. Absolutely complete state.
Unbeknownst to them, they interrupted Chu Yang's memories, interrupted Mo Qingwu's singing and dancing, and made Chu Yang completely furious, fully exerting all the potential of his body. This is the power of life, the rage of the soul.
"Nine Tribulations Sword, a gathering of wind and clouds is the emperor." ”
Chu Yang Huoran opened his eyes and roared in a low voice. "Why? " WTF IS GOING ON ”
In the distance, in three directions, three lights rose at the same time and transformed into three golden shadows in the air. Panic and dazzling, with unbearable madness.
He was just a Martial Venerable. Although he was only one level away from the king level, this level was tantamount to the difference between heaven and earth.
Three kings. What a big handwriting.
"But these three days are not a place where you, a venomous sword warrior, can go wild." "One person said gently." "It's a pity that I can't fight you fairly. It's a pity that I can't fight you fairly. ”
As they spoke, the other two appeared together. Three people, all in wide robes and big sleeves, their clothes fluttered, and they came from the wind. The posture is natural and the face is calm.
Chu Yang's eyes have been somewhat blurred. "You three kings... You also want the Nine Tribulations Sword. ”
"I want you to die." "The three of them smiled at the same time, with a dignified demeanor. "But taking over the Nine Tribulations Sword by the way is also considered an unexpected harvest. Great harvest! ”
Chu Yang smiled coldly and proudly, straightened his back, and said proudly. "It's a pity that you don't understand the Nine Tribulations Sword. You will never be able to reach. "His eyes became resolute, resolute."
He is now powerless to fight anymore.
This was the only sword he could use his full power. When he first saw the sword formula, he knew that this sword could be used by himself. But such a sword, but need to use their own life to stimulate with their own life.
It is the Nine Tribulations Sword Soul that kills and destroys everything on its own.
The three kings almost didn't even have time to parry, and before they even had time to scream, they were wiped out in smoke. Even the golden shadow of their royal power still flashes in the air, but their lives have been classified as nothingness.
Chu Yang sighed. He was in mid-air, his eyes casually curled, but he found a character who he thought should never appear here. In the distance, a white-clothed man stared at this side dumbfounded, his face full of disbelief.
"Sky plane." "Chu Yang eyes have been, finally understand understand, finally understand." Why was he ambushed for such a covert action, and why all his attacks were accurately intercepted?
It turned out to be him, Divine Plate Ghost Calculator Mo Tianji. No wonder I was so defeated.
Chu Yang's body slowly fell from the air and slowly fell down. It fell like withered leaves in late autumn and fell into the dust. With a faint but warm smile on his face, he mumbled. "Qingwu, if there is an afterlife, dance with you all over the world." ”
Since death is inevitable, embrace death with the greatest enthusiasm and strongest longing. Because there, I have my own lover.
Chapter 2
Meng Qi's secret joy was interrupted, complacency turned to shame, and Zhende and other small novice looked over with surprise and contempt, quite a primary school students to draw a clear line with the bad classmates, only Zhenhui "Fang Aqi" stared blankly at the front of the golden Buddha, a pair of gods traveling outside the sky look, a look of God traveling outside the sky.
Subconsciously, Meng Qi half turned his head and looked at Xuanzang next to him. He would not see any clues.
For him, being ashamed and frustrated is a small matter, exposing the fact that he is reincarnated with a corpse is the biggest problem in heaven.
Xuanzang's face was still bitter and his eyes were dejected. After feeling Meng Qi's eyes, he shook his head lightly and shook his head. "Namo Amitabha Buddha, everything is subject to the decision of Junior Brother Xuanku." "He didn't hint, he just said it directly.
Uh, he thought I saw him pleading with him... Meng Qi quietly breathed a sigh of relief in his heart, knowing that he had passed this hurdle. Unless the parents who abandoned this body, the horse-faced uncle, etc. were found, he should not be seen through. If it were another ten or eight years, then no one would doubt it. The memories of childhood are easy to forget.
Compared to this, breaking into the handyman academy is just a small matter.
Crooked Meng Qi tried to make his expression as dull as Zhenhui, so as not to be seen through by Xuanzang that he was not so depressed and sad.
After the wide-faced and big-eared Xuanku inquired about the remaining children one by one, together with Garmengqi and Zhen Hui, a total of six people entered the miscellaneous service Institute, while the rest belonged to the martial arts monastery. The rest belonged to the martial arts monastery.
The ring ruler of his right hand tapped gently on the palm of his left palm. "Follow me to the sundry yard to shave, receive monk robes, Buddhist scriptures and other things, in the future, good hard work, never have the opportunity to enter the Bodhi, Dharma two hospitals to practice high and deep Buddhist scriptures, martial arts, and the opportunity to practice martial arts." ”
There are also Dharma here.
Meng Qi was stunned for a moment, but Xuan Ku didn't give him time to think. He walked straight through the children and walked outside the hall.
Surrounded by strangers, Meng Qi didn't dare to ask more questions. He followed closely behind the two yellow-robed monks, Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang, and turned into a nearby courtyard.
"You don't count as a formal entry, you just need to worship the Buddha, shave your head and leave your name." "Xuan Ku pointed to the futon road in the small Buddha hall."
Yes, Martial Uncle Xuanku. "The children all responded with Zhende, and then one by one they knelt on the futon and kowtowed to the golden Buddha statue above them."
When all the children had worshipped the Buddha, Xuanku put his hands together and solemnly saluted the Buddha statue, chanting "Namo Amitabha Buddha". Then, he walked up to a child and stroked his right hand on the top of his head.
The child's long black hair changed rapidly, turning yellow at a speed visible to Meng Qi's naked eyes, and drifting on the ground like fallen leaves. In less than two breaths, the child became a real little novice monk.
"The troubles are gone, and the world of mortals is far away." "Xuanku said solemnly, and his mellow voice echoed in the pure Buddhist hall."
"What kind of martial arts is this? Amazing. ”
Meng Qi was stunned and excited. Will he have a chance to learn such martial arts in the future?
Mysteriously went to the children one by one, removed their hair, and always said the same words in their mouths.
When it was Meng Qi's turn, he lowered his head, silently recited the name of Buddha and Taoist, and mourned the hair that was about to say goodbye to him.
The thick and wide palm stroked the top of Meng Qi's head, and the withered hair fell in front of his eyes, which made him sad and almost unable to restrain himself. He loved the world of mortals and never thought of becoming a monk.
"The troubles are gone, and the world of mortals is far away." ”
Xuan Ku's voice was like a chime bell ringing suddenly, shaking Meng Qi's whole body and clearing his mind.
But after the mysterious and bitter departure and the clarity disappeared, Meng Qi's faith was still firm, and he must return to the secular world in the future.
After worshipping the Buddha, shaving, and leaving a name on the monk's plate, Xuanku asked several gray-clothed monks to take the group of children to the backyard to get their own things-two sets of gray monk's robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, "Shaolin Precepts", "Morning Lesson" Twelve Little Curses" and so on.
"When you have learned the words in the 'Lecture Institute', you can recite the precepts of this temple and the morning class incantations. Before that, I will briefly talk about the main precepts of this temple. First, you must not deceive your teachers and destroy your ancestors. Second, you must not allow or steal martial arts. Third, you must not kill animals. Fourth, you must not drink alcohol. Fifth, you must not eat meat or drink alcohol. Sixth, you must not break the color precepts... Xuanku repeated the main precepts that need to be observed several times. At the end, he solemnly said solemnly. "Those who violate them will be scolded lightly, and those who violate them will abolish martial arts and be expelled from this temple." ”
He only mentioned two of the punishments, the lightest and heaviest, and the rest were punishments for coolies, copying scriptures, caning, facing the wall and so on.
After explaining these things, he and Xuanzang left the "sundry yard" with these young monks.
"In this temple, those who wear gray robes are ordinary monks, those who wear yellow robes are deacons of each courtyard, and those who wear yellow robes and red robes are abbots, heads and elders of each courtyard... Along the way, Xuanku instilled "common sense in the temple" into the little novices without any relaxation. It was not until Zhende and others entered the "martial monastery" that he became silent again, that he became silent again.
The group walked more and more, inside and outside the yellow wall, all the trees were covered in greenery, and it was rare to see the Buddha Hall. After a while, Meng Qi saw a mottled and old courtyard.
"Oh, junior apprentice-brother Xuanku, senior apprentice-brother Xuanzang, you came so early." "A fat monk at the door greeted him with a smile. He was also dressed in yellow, but the collar was slanted open and his stomach was shy.
Xuan Ku frowned and meticulously folded his hands together. "Namo Amitabha, Senior Brother Xuanxin, how can you be so lazy? " ”
The fat monk Xuanxin had long been familiar with Xuan Ku's temper, and he was not angry at all. "Oh, you are too attached to the Foreign Minister, this is for our disciples in the House of Miscellaneous Services." "He was unwilling to entangle with Xuan Ku on this issue, and directly pointed at Meng Qi and other humanitarians."
"Senior Brother Xuanxin, please arrange it." "Xuanku answered solemnly."
At this time, Xuanzang, who had been making saw-mouthed gourds, suddenly opened his mouth. "Zhenying, is Zhenguan still in the miscellaneous service yard? " ”
"Still, still." "Fat monk Xuanxin said suspiciously." "Brother Xuanzang, you ask them what to do." Do you intend to accept them as disciples? ”
Xuanzang shook his head and sighed. "My martial arts have been destroyed, so it is inconvenient to mislead people, how dare I accept apprentices? " Younger Martial Brother Xuanxin, bother you to let them share a room with Zhenying and Zhenguan. ”
He was referring to Meng Qi and Zhen Hui.
Meng Qi's heart beat violently. This was Xuanzang's first time arranging his own affairs. Could it be that the two monks Zhenying and Zhenguan have something special that can help him.
"Haha, Elder Martial Brother Xuanzang, how dare I bear the word 'trouble' about what you ordered? Elder Martial Brother, how dare I bear 'trouble'? such a small matter, why do you need to be like that? "Xuan Xin agreed to come down."
Xuanku glanced sideways at Xuanzang and didn't say much. Instead, he looked at Meng Qi, Zhenhui and other young monks and monks with a straight face. "I arranged for you to be in the miscellaneous service, because you have problems. If you can solve it yourself and polish your mind, you may not have the opportunity to enter the martial arts monastery, the Dharma temple, or even the Bodhi monastery in the future." ”
"But if you continue to cheat, be lazy and playful, be impetuous, and suffer unbearably, I will not hide it. I will definitely report it to the Discipline Academy and punish you accordingly." ”
He spoke out his thoughts without any concealment, to show his frankness and lack of selfishness, which made Xuanxin beside him blush slightly with his old face.
Yes, Martial Uncle Xuanku. "Meng Qi and other young novice monks answered in unison."
After watching Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang leave, Xuan Xin twisted his lower body, causing pieces of fat to shake up and down, shaking. "I'm finally gone. I'm most afraid of seeing this iron-faced ghost." ”
This monk... Meng Qi pretended not to squint and followed Xuanxin, who was swaying here and there, into the meditation room.
"Zhenying, Zhenguan, this is your junior apprentice-brother's true determination and true wisdom." "Xuan Xin pointed to Meng Qi and Zhenhui, then turned around and took the other little novices to another meditation room."
Inside the meditation room, there is a whole shop, which can accommodate seven or eight people to sleep, and nothing else.
Above the bunk, two gray-clothed monks were lying and sitting, both in their twenties. The person lying down had a dull expression and was speechless. The person sitting had furrowed eyebrows and a cold tone. "Just put the luggage on the bottom of the shop, if you want to drink water, go to the water tank in the courtyard to get it. "I don't know what to call senior brother." ”
Meng Qi glanced at the wooden Zhenhui and decided to open his mouth to establish a good "roommate relationship" by himself.
The person sitting there was cold and cold. "Zhen Guan is really good. ”
After answering, he stopped talking, and even turned his head away from Meng Qi and Zhenhui, so that Meng Qi could not play the topic of bringing the relationship closer together.
As for Zhenying, he closed his eyes and continued to fall asleep.
Who are these people?
Meng Qi secretly slandered in his belly, but on the surface, he smiled and smiled at Zhenhui. "Junior apprentice-brother Zhenhui, I am really sure. In the future, you called me brother and you did it." ”
"Yes, senior brother." "Zhenhui exclaimed without any embarrassment at all."
It's still this dull little guy that's good ah.
Meng Qi secretly sighed and decided to play the role of senior apprentice-brother and help Zhenhui well. "Little brother, eh, I'll call you little brother. Come on, let's change into monk clothes first. " ”
Although there were people in the house, Meng Qi, who was often shirtless in the dormitory when he was in college, did not feel uncomfortable. He quickly took off his clothes and changed into monk clothes.
While quietly thanking the monk for his simple clothes and not making a fool of himself, he checked the things on his body that he hadn't had time to examine before.
The robes of this body are finely woven and soft in texture. Even if Meng Qi doesn't know the goods, he can tell that they are of great value. At the same time, "he" has a transparent jade pendant hanging from his waist and a small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red rope around his neck, which is close to his chest, cool and refreshing, so uncomfortable.
Meng Qi carefully played with the thumb-sized jade Buddha, and saw that "it" was full of compassion and lifelike, obviously the carving is extraordinary, at the same time, "it" feel delicate, both warm and cool feeling people cool.
"According to Uncle Ma Lian, what unknown old monk sent this jade Buddha to." But since the Marquis did not take it away, it is estimated that it is not extraordinary, or it is better to wear it close to your body. ”
Meng Qi hung the jade Buddha pendant on his chest again and hid it close to his body. Then he packed up the jade pendant, clothes, etc. and put them under the bunk he had chosen.
At this time, has been sleeping really should suddenly turn over and sit up, quickly put on shoes to go out, see Meng Qi one Leng, do not understand what happened, do not understand what happened.
"It's dinner time." "Zhen Guan said coldly. He also got off the bunk and walked outside the door.
Who are these two people?
Meng Qi cursed secretly again, then turned to Zhenhui Road. "Little Junior Brother, it's okay. It’ s dinner time. ”
"Ok" sed star. "As soon as Zhenhui finished speaking, the little figure rushed to the door like a rabbit, as if it was already hungry and impatient."
"... "Meng Qi was embarrassed. Only he is more normal here.
Zhenhui suddenly stopped at the door and looked back at Meng Qi, her face full of doubts. "Brother, aren't you going? ”
You have a little conscience and know how to wait for me.
Meng Qi thought to himself, and then replied half-jokingly. "I'm not as hungry as you are yet. ”
Look at you one or two, like starving ghosts reincarnating. \Q>
As soon as he turned, he began to run.
Hey! After moving a few times, he shouted loudly. "Hey, younger brother, wait for me." ”
Suddenly, a burst of sadness hit his heart, other people's is a little sister, why do I only have a little brother, and can foresee the future will not have a little sister.
Heavy rain poured down, and a beautiful-looking woman, aged twenty-seven or eight, with a little boy aged five or six, knelt in front of the iron gate of a luxurious villa.
The woman's name is Zhao Meiling, and she comes from a remote mountain village. Six years ago, she was admitted to university with dreams and hopes, but she did not expect to meet a man who changed everything for her. This man is the famous young master of Beitang City... Li Zhe Zhe. Li Zhe was a famous young man in Beitang City... Li Zhe Zhe.
At that time, it was available. Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe in the same school, an accident, she was Li Zhe fancy, then Li Zhe launched a crazy pursuit of Zhao Meiling, almost a hundred tricks, unscrupulous means, unscrupulous.
And Zhao Meiling is just a simple and simple girl who just came to the city, that will be the opponent of such a master of love, not only the body, but also the heart are completely handed over to him, but then Li Zhe tired of playing with her, then ruthlessly abandoned her.
Later, Zhao Meiling learned that she was pregnant, and she wanted to give birth to the child, so she did not hesitate to fall out with her family.
After the child was born, Zhao Meiling originally wanted to bring him up alone, but five years later, because her body was too tired and she had a terminal illness, she had no more years to live. She finally decided to send the child to the Li family. She wanted the child to feel the father's love and have a better life, so she could rest assured after death.
But this was coldly rejected by the Li family, completely denying that the child belonged to their Li family. Zhao Meiling could only kneel in front of the iron gate with the child, begging bitterly in front of the iron gate.
At this time, the iron door slowly opened, and several people came out with umbrellas. The man in charge was somewhat similar to the little boy. He was the little boy's father, Li Zhe.
"Give it. Stinking woman, this sum of money is enough for you to live a good life. "Li Zhe frowned and reached out to hand Zhao Meiling a check."
Zhao Meiling shook her head and looked up at Li Zhe, saying, "Zhe You must keep Fu Er, he is your son. ”
Li Zhe refused, and then said coldly, "You don't want the money or not." You don't want the money. ”
Hearing this, Zhao Meiling was already in tears and shook her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe snorted coldly, threw the check in his hand at Zhao Meiling, and was about to turn around and leave.
Zhao Meiling, kneeling on the ground, hugged Li Zhe's thigh and begged bitterly, "Zhe ”
"Snap." ”
Before Zhao Meiling finished speaking, Li Zhe slapped her heavily in the face and said, "Let go of it." You stinking woman” .
Seeing his mother being beaten, the little boy next to him hurriedly ran over to hug Li Zhe's thigh and shouted childishly, "Dad said, "Dad. “ Don’ t hit mom” .
In fact, since the little boy was born, he didn't know who his father was, and his mother never said it again. It wasn't until this time that Zhao Meiling took out Li Zhe's photo and showed it to the little boy that the little boy knew he had a father. He was so happy that he almost jumped up and started.
But now, he did not understand why his father did not want his mother, but also beat his mother.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy hugging his thigh with disgust and kicked the little boy out with one foot, "Who is your father, dead ~ wild ~ seed! " He is dead ~ wild ~ seed. ”
The little boy was kicked and flew out, fell to the ground, curled up, covering his stomach with pain on his face, the pain was far beyond what a five-year-old boy could bear, and tears rolled out of his eyes.
Zhao Meiling was also shocked, and quickly let go of Li Zhe, ran over to pick up the little boy, and asked nervously, "Fu'er, are you okay? " Fu'er, are you okay? ”
The little boy looked at his mother worried, pursed his mouth, held back his tears, shook his little head and shook his little head.
Li Zhe didn't even look at the mother and son. He walked into the iron gate. A man with gray hair like a housekeeper next to him picked up the check and handed it to Zhao Meiling. He sympathetically persuaded, "you should accept it." " ”
Zhao Meiling shook her head, hugged the little boy, and slowly disappeared into the rain curtain.
The housekeeper looked at the back of the mother and son, sighed deeply, turned and walked into the house, and slowly closed the iron door.
Four years later, it will be four years. Before Zhao Meiling died, she called the nine-year-old boy, who had grown up a lot, to the bedside, gently rubbed his head, smiled weakly and said, "Fu Er, you should study hard in the future, so that you can have a good job in the future, and don't resent the Li family, and don't resent your father. Promise me, please, promise me, will I? ”
The little boy held back his tears and nodded seriously.
Seeing the little boy nod seriously and agree, Zhao Meiling had a peaceful smile on her face, and slowly closed her eyes forever.
At two o'clock in the middle of the night, a bright moon hung high in the sky, shining brightly on the earth, making it not dark around.
"Boom." ”
Suddenly there was a deafening sound in the sky. Zhao Fu was startled and looked up at the sky. He saw that the whole sky seemed to be burning and turning into a huge sea of fire. Countless colored lights were emitted, dragging his long tail. Something like a meteor fell from the sky.
"Bang." ”
A loud noise, a meteor emitting colorful light fell in front of Zhao Fu, the dazzling light let Zhao Fu block with his hand, and then the strong light dispersed, a finger long, two fingers thick crystal stone quietly floating in the air two meters above the ground. Two meters high air from the ground.
Zhao Fu walked forward curiously and grabbed the crystal stone. Floating in mid-air, the crystal stone was unresponsive and was grasped by Zhao Fu.
At this time, people who were originally sleeping were also awakened by a series of loud noises. They opened the door or opened the window, looked at the countless crystals floating in mid-air, and began to rush out of the house frantically to snatch the crystals. Zhao Fu did not stay in place, and hurriedly returned to his home.
In a single rental room, Zhao Fu carefully looked at the crystal stone. If you rely on sales, there is no gemstone comparable to this crystal stone. If the quantity is rare, then the value of the city is not at all, but the number of falling from the sky is too much, at least tens of billions of dollars. Therefore, this crystal stone may not be worth money at all.
"Detect that the host is a primary intelligence and begin soul binding... "
Ding. The soul was successfully bound and began to travel to the apocalyptic world.
After this sound, Zhao Fu's eyes darkened and he fainted on the ground. Hong Dali, male, 22 years old, orphan, died after bravely saving two children who were about to be hit by a car. Unfortunately, he died. After research by relevant departments, it was decided to posthumously honor Hong Dali as a hero and an outstanding university student in the province. ”
"No, no, no, I don't want to go to the Hong family to get engaged with you." "Tang Muxin buried her head in the pillow and desperately kicked her white and tender legs." "Hong Dali is a famous waste in the city. He has lost all his Hong family's face, and his long illness is crooked. He is a standard prodigal. I don't want to find such a person to be my fiancee. ”
Tang Muxin, the only daughter of Tang Ruisi, chairman of Tang's Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is multi-talented, Bo Gu Tong does not say today, she also looks like a flower with a moonlike appearance, a sweet lady, a combination of the aura of heaven and earth, and especially a good dish. The standard Shangde Hall has a large bed in the kitchen, and I don't know how many boys' dream lovers in school are. I don't know how many boys' dream lovers in school are.
But today, she heard her father say that he would take him to the famous Hong Dali family of the defeated family to get married. How can she stand it? "If it weren't for his parents spoiling her, a single seedling in a thousand hectares of land, just like him, he would have been driven out of the Hong family and destroyed himself. How could there be such a chance to defeat the family all day long? ”
After listening to her daughter's words, Tang Ruisi, sitting at the head of the bed, showed a wry smile on his face and was helpless. "Xinxin, I can't help it either, " he said. ”
Your marriage to Hong Dali was decided by your grandfather himself back then. Although he was a bit of a black sheep, it wasn't a big problem, was it?
Tang Ruisi was wearing a blue-gray vest with a spotless white sweatshirt, a simple bow tie at the collar, light stubble on his lips, a bronze pipe in his hand, and short black hair combed back meticulously, shiny, the whole person's image is quite good, but the original bright eyes are now full of helplessness and unwillingness, but now full of helplessness and unwillingness.
Speaking of which, if he wasn't really cornered, how could he be willing to give up his own daughter if he weren't really pushed. After all, that Hong Dali can be called a wonderful flower in the world. The only thing he likes to do or can do is two words. A prodigal family.
One of his most famous phrases is to say that. "I must be a prodigal. Don't waste my parents' talent to make money? "? ”
This sentence can be called the entire Tianjing City no one knows no one knows the joke, many parents educate their children will say this. "If you dare to learn from the prodigal son of Hong Dali, see if I don't break your legs." ”
Therefore, Tang Muxin will have such a big reaction, it is indeed reasonable.
"That's true... Tang Ruisi frowned and thought about it. Suddenly, his eyes lit up and he said. "Xinxin, how can you look at it like this? " Xinxin? Let's get engaged first, and when Dad's company returns to normal, then we'll find an excuse to return it. This time, our research funds exceeded the budget. Once the funding keeps up, as long as the research of this project is successful, it will definitely be a major event in the world. When we recover our breath and find a way to retire, his family should not say anything more. ”
Tang Muxin sobbed and sobbed. "It's easy to get engaged but difficult to get married. His family is one of the top 500 companies in the world. How can it be so easy? ”
I have to say that Tang Muxin is a very smart girl.
If her house collapses, her fate will definitely not be so good at that time. That's how the world works. The law of the jungle eats the jungle. When you are strong, no one may dare to touch you, but when your true family path falls, there will definitely be no less people who come to the bottom of the well.
For example, the Liu family's eldest young master who had been obsessed with her at school had been obsessed with her.
So Tang Muxin cried for a while, and finally knew that there was really no other way except this method. She could only climb up reluctantly and reluctantly. "Then, let's try it first. Wuwu, Dad, in the future, you must remember to retire. I don't want to marry that prodigal son. ”
"Well, okay, for the sake of my family Xinxin, Dad will definitely try to circle around as much as possible." "Tang Ruisi sighed and patted Tang Muxin on the shoulder. "Xinxin, let's go." ”
Hong Dali sat on the bed, his eyes blank, and his mind was in a mess.
The surrounding environment is very strange, and there is a considerable problem with the memory in his mind. Now he can only barely recall the harsh brake sound. The rest is some messy memories that do not belong to him at all.
"Didn't I die? here, where is it? " "Looking at his pale and slender hands, Hong Dali thought to himself and said. "This is not my body, nor is this where I usually live." So, where is this place? ”
He looked around for a while, thinking about it. "The most urgent thing is to first clarify the current situation. ”
"One, am I dead or alive now. 2. Where is this place and who am I? Three, what should I do next? ”
"Then let's look at the first point first." Hong Dali pinched a small piece of oil on the back of his left hand and rubbed it in pain. "It hurts, so I should be alive." He carefully touched his face, neck, ears, and top of his head. "This body is obviously not my previous body, but it is still within the category of human beings." ”
"Then the second question is, what is this place? who am I? " "Hong Dali looked around again. The reinforced concrete house structure, the snow-white walls, all kinds of modern household appliances, and even a computer with a 30-inch LCD monitor in the corner of the room. "It's modern society. It's just that I've never seen the stars posted on the walls around me. I've never heard of all kinds of toy models. In this way, the world should be the legendary parallel space. ”
There was no one around. Hong Dali carefully stood up and took a deep breath. "This body is really weak, like a thin bamboo pole, I really don't know when it will suddenly die suddenly ah." ”
Turning on the computer, Hong Dali casually opened a few URLs, and the displayed content was very different from that on Earth, but at least it made him understand a few things. "One, the world or the characters of this country, or Chinese characters. Second, it is indeed a parallel space. Many things are different from the earth, but they are not much different.
No ID. "Thinking about it, but quickly released." "Oh, look at the age of this body should not be very high, about 17 or 18 years old, the ID card may be done, but it is more likely that it has not been issued, after all, the world is different from the earth, some nuances are also considered normal, some nuances are also normal." ”
"The Defeatist system has been successfully bound. The current level is up. First level. ”
When the system sound was introduced here, a villain suddenly appeared in Hong Dali's mind. It seemed that it should be him.
"Host's name." Hong Dali was strong. ”
Ability to have sex. 32 Notice The index of normal people is 100 for each other. ”
Hong Dali's eyes were dumbfounded. "Big loser system." It's this thing is really fake.
Fortunately, there is no way out of heaven. Hong Dali is eager to commit suicide, and the metallic sound of the system comes again. "Explanation". The host can obtain one attribute point for each 100, 000 yuan ( RMB) of the prodigal family, that is, you can get an attribute point.
When all the attributes of the host reach the normal level, the Big Loser system will be upgraded, and new items and props will be added at that time. Please look forward to it. ”
"You can get attribute points." "At this time, there is really nothing better than improving one's attributes. Hong Dali listened to the eyebrows and eyes smile, " You can really get attribute points through prodigal family, so that you become like normal people." You can really gain attribute points through prodigal family, so that you become like normal people. ”
Although the sound of the system is still so cold, it sounds almost like singing in my ears at this time. "that's fine." ”
Hong Dali was so excited that he almost didn't jump up. "I'm going to splurge. I want to be prodigal. ”
"Next, please host the first task." First time prodigal. Task requirements. At least 100, 000 yuan before midnight today is lost.
"The current amount of losers is the amount. 0. ”
"Damn it, it's already eight o'clock in the evening. There are only four hours left, no, I have to go out, I am. I want to be prodigal. ”
Just thinking of this, suddenly the door of the room was gently pushed open, and a maid in her forties bowed slightly to Hong Dali, whispering softly. "Master Dali, Grandpa and Madam let you go, please come with me." ”
"Buy me a game cabin." Jiang Fei asked his father in anticipation.
Xiaofei, you are in high school now, and you can't be addicted to games like before. ”
"Mom, " she said. This game is different. This is a masterpiece carefully crafted by Shengshi Company for thirteen years, known as the second world of mankind. ”
The game called "Dawn" mentioned by Jiang Fei is indeed another innovation in human history. It is not only a model of virtual reality games, the degree of simulation is close to 100%, but also through a brand new technology, players can experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night. Through this technology, the human body enjoys eight hours of high-quality sleep physiologically, but mentally can experience a completely different magical life for 24 hours.
"This game is one that the country is promoting." Not a lie, this game not only does not affect learning, but also gives people better rest. ”
Jiang Fei is still insisting on it.
"I said for the last time, no. If you don’ t go back to your room to do your homework within 20 seconds, then next month’ s allowance will be cut by 50% next month. "Dad said with a straight face."
"Old stubborn. ”
Jiang Fei muttered in a low voice, but he also knew that this matter had not been discussed. The conditions in his home were good. Dad was definitely not reluctant to buy this game cabin. However, Dad's brain was rigid, and he definitely did not believe that playing games would not affect learning. "Brother Fei, how about you? " Dawn is officially opening tonight and you're ready for the game pod. ”
As soon as the bell rang and the teacher left, a little fat man behind Jiang Fei grabbed his shoulder and asked,
Just please, I can’ t play with you this time. Jiang Fei gave a wry smile.
The brothers are all pointing at you, ah! ”
The little fat man Zhao Feng said anxiously, this little fat man is one of Jiang Fei's few friends at school. Jiang Fei's Class 19 of Senior High School is the key class of the school. However, Jiang Fei's grades are medium, his grades are not high or low, and he is not very good at interpersonal communication. Therefore, he can definitely be called a standard transparent person.
"My father doesn't agree, so what can I do? " "Jiang Fei rolled his eyes. He had nothing to say to this only friend.
"Why don't the brothers chip in and buy you a piece." "Zhao Feng said, because the conditions are similar to Jiang Fei, they are the kind of guys who are not excellent in all aspects, so the relationship between these two transparent people who are not concerned by teachers and classmates is very good.
Jiang Fei comforted himself.
"I hope it is. ”
Zhao Feng nodded.
Jiang Fei liked to play games since he was a child, especially this kind of realistic game. As a boy, the one who didn't want to fight the sword and be chivalrous. When the eldest husband carries a three-foot sword, he is a masterpiece. This is every boy's dream, but in peacetime, it is also a society with highly developed science and technology. Not to mention that there is no war, even if there is war, it is also by pressing the button, so if you want to enjoy the blood of battle, you can only go to experience it in a virtual game to experience it. In the virtual game, you can only experience it in the virtual game.
But this time, Jiang Fei is hopeless. Since entering high school, Jiang Fei has been restricted from playing by his father. All the game equipment at home has been sealed, and online games are not to be talked about.
Finally, after school was over, Jiang Fei walked home listlessly. Although it was only about six o'clock in the evening at this time, it was getting dark very early because it was already winter.
Thinking that today is the opening day of Dawn, Jiang Fei angrily locked himself in his room. At about ten o'clock or so, Jiang Fei also finished his homework. He lay on his back on his bed and looked at the clock on the wall, which was getting closer to ten o'clock. He felt some uncomfortable.
The opening time of Dawn is ten o'clock tonight, and then it runs for eight hours a day from ten o'clock to six o'clock in the morning of the next day, which not only does not delay the normal life of players, but also allows players to fully experience 24 hours of game time. "Hey, hey." It’ s not like I have a stake in such a great game. ”
Jiang Fei muttered while subconsciously rubbing the ring on his index finger with his hand.
"What the hell is this? ”
Jiang Fei's mouth was wide open. Looking at the ring in his hand that was emitting a faint shimmering light, he was too frightened to speak.
"Buzz." ”
A white light flashed. Jiang Fei's eyes flashed. When his vision regained clarity again, it was no longer his room in front of him.
"Ding." Welcome to the world of Dawn. Novice Assistant No. 34784 is at your service. ”
A crisp female voice entered Jiang Fei's ears.
"Dawn" This is the login interface for Dawn. ”
"To be precise, this is the character creation interface. "The novice assistant replied.
Jiang Fei is still a little hard to imagine, he doesn't have a game cabin at all, how can he enter the game?
Maybe this is his dream. Maybe I was too tired to finish my homework, so I fell asleep in bed, including the mysterious ring just now. I'm afraid it's all part of my dream. I think about it every day and dream at night. Maybe I want to play this game too much. Chapter 1
"Liar." A big liar. ”
An angry shout, followed by the sound of feet stepping on the bluestone ground to escape.
Zhang Xuan stretched out his hands helplessly. "I'm not a liar, I'm a teacher at the academy... I just want you to be my student. Also, even if I am a liar, why add the word 'big' ”
After muttering, remembering what the political and religious director had said, Zhang Xuan rubbed his eyebrows and rubbed them. "The seventeenth is the seventeenth." If I don’ t even get a single student picking up today, I can pack up and go home tomorrow to get them. ”
Zhang Xuanben is not a person in this world, but an administrator of an ordinary university library on Earth. He only remembers the raging fire, and then... There was no more, and I woke up to this world again.
Similar to what is described in the novel, martial arts are respected, and strength is king.
I thought I could get through a loser, but I got divorced, and then slapped in the face and counterattacked, singing all the way... It seems that I thought too much. When I got here, I found that it was not a student, but... Teacher...
The saddest teacher in the entire academy.
Others' classrooms were overcrowded and crowded, making it difficult to sit down, but there was no one in his class. He finally pulled in a few of them. In the end, he even scolded "liars" several times, turned around and fled.
The reason is that the guy who is worn by his own soul has the lowest strength among teachers, and his vision is extremely poor, he can't see anything, the key is... He also taught wrongly. There was a case of going crazy.
This is the same as the dead in the hospital, fame is greatly damaged, spurned, even the new students, but also one by one to stay away from, afraid of falling into his hands, be taught half dead do not live.
There are no students, but also criticized, last year's teacher evaluation, the whole college last, and even got the only zero score in history.
Under depression, he used alcohol to drown his sorrows, and as a result, he hung up as he wished, taking the opportunity to cross over himself.
At the beginning of the new semester, the college issued an ultimatum that if he could not enroll another student in his class this year, he would be directly dismissed as a teacher.
Seventeen new students passed by his classroom today. As a result, as soon as they heard the name, they all ran away without exception, like a little girl who met a strange uncle and ran as fast as she could. How fast did she run?
"It seems that we must find a way to fool one of them to do so." ”
I was thinking about how to open my mouth to pull people, when I saw a girl with a dull face reveal her head from the doorway.
"Excuse me, is this Teacher Lu Xun's classroom? " ”
The voice is sweet and lovely, and the appearance is clear and lovely.
Teacher Lu Xun, the star teacher of the college, the classroom is full every time, and countless people come here admiringly.
"She's the one." "Seeing someone throw himself into the net, Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up."
Recall the various pretending routines I have seen in my previous life, sit quietly in my seat and pose like an outsider. "You want to worship him as your teacher." ”
The girl nodded again and again like a sparrow, and her dark eyes were full of worship. "I heard that Mr. Lu Xun is the most powerful teacher in Hongtian College. The students he teaches are all of extraordinary strength. Everyone is proud to be able to join his class. ”
"No matter how well he speaks, if he doesn't agree with your theory of cultivation, not only will he not make progress, but if he doesn't get it right, he will retreat. The teacher's reputation is not obvious, and your theory is consistent, but also rapid progress, repair for a big increase. ”
"That's right... I heard my brother say something similar, too. "The girl was stunned for a moment, and her beautiful eyes were a little confused. "But, I don't know what kind of class I'm suitable for. ”
Seeing her take the bait, Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up and he hesitated for a moment. Marx, Enkos and other sages appeared in his mind one after another, pretending to be embarrassed. "Meeting is fate. In this way, I am also a teacher of this college. I can help you look at your roots, talents, and temperament for free. By the way, I can recommend a suitable teacher for you. "Then it bothers you, sir." ”
Unexpectedly, the teacher she met casually was so righteous, and the girl nodded excitedly.
"Show me your cultivation first so I can see. ”
Zhang Xuan's eyes were half open and half closed, as if he didn't care at all.
"Yes. ”
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
After a moment of effort, the fist wind roared in the room, and a vigorous wave of energy scurried around the girl like a dragon. The whole person's breath was condensed but not scattered, and the prestige was not obvious. It represented that she had an excellent foundation.
"Well, I can see that you usually practice hard, have a solid foundation, and have excellent talent. You are a rare genius. After finishing a set of punches, Zhang Xuan nodded in satisfaction.
He learned this from a fortune teller on Earth. His words are all panacea, and the range is very wide. People can't hear the mistakes, but secretly call them accurate.
"Teacher, I have been injured in my leg. The doctor said that it is basically equivalent to invalidation... The girl interrupted his eloquence. There was some confusion in her eyes.
"Injured... Zhang Xuan blushed, but his skin was thick, and others could not see it. He continued to talk nonsense. "Do you think I don't see it? I know when you used your power just now, I know. The reason why I said that is because... Neither break nor stand. ”
Anyway, they are all fooling. If they can talk nonsense, they will talk nonsense. First fool a disciple over and then say it.
"Opportunity". whats the canon one?! "The girl's eyes lit up."
After her leg was injured, she always felt inferior to others and had a hidden sense of inferiority. She didn't expect that there might be a blessing in disguise.
"This opportunity can make you soar into the sky and become the number one freshman is not too much, after all, your talent is very good, is the peerless genius, but... "Zhang Xuanhaikou repeatedly, almost did not take out a" Tathagata Palm ".
Hearing that she could become the first freshman and praised her as a genius, the girl couldn't help showing heat on her face and hurriedly asked, quickly asking. "But what? ”
"But... Zhang Xuan sighed, a pair of good talent is about to be buried sigh, a sigh of good talent is about to be buried. "There are not many teachers in the whole college who can see this opportunity."
"No students are admitted. "The girl had a lot of hope, but when she heard this, her eyes dimmed a little, and then she thought of something and suddenly jumped up. "They don't accept students, that teacher you... Do not accept them or not. ”
"Of course I still accept it, but, as you can see, I am indifferent to fame and wealth, and I don't have that much time either." ”
Puff...
Before she could finish speaking, the girl fell to the ground in obeisance. "I know Mr. Gao Jie, please accept me as an apprentice." I will definitely practice well and not lose face as a teacher. ”
"Students promise not to disturb the teacher unless they have to, and they will never disturb the teacher. "Seeing that he was a little reluctant, the girl nodded hurriedly, with a sincere face."
"I don't have many students, so I may not be able to compete with other teachers in terms of resources, and I will be criticized by others... "Zhang Xuan continued."
"Is that so... I heard that refining resources is very important... "The girl hesitated for a moment.
Teachers receive resources in the college, which is linked to many conditions such as the grades and number of professors and students. If there are not enough resources, it will be difficult to improve the practice.
"Ahem, I said that on purpose to test you. Since you are firm in your heart and sincerely recognize me as a teacher, I am also reluctant to accept you." It will be difficult for me to accept you. Seeing her hesitation, Zhang Xuan interrupted immediately and hurriedly said. "Let's verify your identity." ”
"This... So soon." ”
Unexpectedly, the teacher's face changed like flipping through a book, so fast that the girl was slightly stunned. She took the token representing her identity handed over by Zhang Xuan and was considering whether to verify it or not. She saw that Teacher Zhang, who was extremely calm before, had already pulled her palm and took out a sharp knife to gently stroke. A drop of blood fell on the jade card.
Buzz.
The light flickered.
The girl was in a daze.
Didn't the teacher just say that he should think about it and be indifferent to fame and wealth? Why are you moving so fast, and... The knives are ready.
"From now on, you are my student. "Blood recognition, Zhang Xuan breathed a sigh of relief, and once again returned to the appearance of a tall man." "What's your name? ”
"My name is Wang Ying, " replied the teacher. ”
Knowing that it could not be changed, the girl said no more and nodded with a cute face.
"Well, take your ID card and go collect your bedding and books. By the way, find your own place to live." Formal class tomorrow, just come here and find me. ”
Zhang Xuan waved his hand.
"Yes. "Wang Ying nodded and turned away.
"Successfully fooled the last one. ”
Seeing her become his student, Zhang Xuan breathed a sigh of relief and smiled slightly.
It's really not easy. If I hadn't seen a lot of pretending skills on the Internet, I'm afraid it would have been difficult to succeed today.
With a student, you can avoid the bad luck of being expelled. Under Zhang Xuan's relaxed mood, he suddenly felt that the whole person's spirit was much smoother in an instant. The obsession of the predecessor hovering in his mind was also slowly disappearing.
"Don't worry, since I have crossed over into you, I will live well for you." ”
Before that, Zhang Xuan died because he could not recruit students, there are many unwilling, at this moment, with students, the last insistence also disappeared without a trace, until this moment, Zhang Xuan is a complete master of this body, until the moment, Zhang Xuan is a complete master of this body.
Boom!
Thoroughly controlling his body, Zhang Xuan was about to fool a few more students next when he felt a shock in his mind, and a Huang Zhong Dalu's voice rang out.
Boom!
All kinds of mysterious language shocked him a little dizzy, and then a huge palace appeared in his mind, with five big characters shining on it.
Tiandao Library.
Pushing the door and walking in, there are countless bookshelves, all kinds of books are endless, and there is no end in sight.
"The library." Nima, I was a librarian in my last life, will not come to this world, or the same, right? ”
Other people's big gift packages, either grandpa or system, are all kinds of good things forced to explode, but they are a library. Zhang Xuan only felt that his eyes were dark, and he almost fainted.
The library is a library. Dry birds. Could it be that in future fights, others throw swords and I throw books.
"Look at all the books. ”
Feeling helpless in his heart, Zhang Xuan stretched out his hand and grabbed at the books on the bookshelf, hoping to see what the library was all about. However, upon grasping it, he realized that the palm of his hand passed directly through the bookshelf and grabbed an empty hand.
"You are playing with me." Give a library, but can not get any books, can not read, in the end what to do. ”
Zhang Xuan was speechless, wanting to cry without tears.
Chapter 1
Hey! 纹 that I have.
Zhao Yu lifted her sleeves and looked at her two tender white arms in surprise. Before, his arms were tattooed with two teeth and claws, domineering Azure Dragon.
How... All gone.
Zhao Yu looked up and found herself sitting in a brightly lit office with small office partitions in front, back, left, and right sides for office use.
At this moment, the phone has been ringing non-stop, paper documents are flying everywhere, more than a dozen office workers are shuttling quickly in the hall, all are a pair of anxious appearance.
At this time, a middle-aged man in a brown jacket came quickly and greeted the crowd, "Team Leader Qu Ping is now telling you the case of the rape case of the electric baton. We are going to take action tonight. Everyone pay attention to it. ”
Someone quickly pulled over a whiteboard, which was covered with words and pasted with several photos.
Hearing the greeting, many staff members hurriedly gathered around, pulled up a chair casually, and sat in front of the whiteboard to listen carefully.
Zhao Yu did not move, still sitting in his seat.
At this moment, he was still in great shock. He touched his right ear and it was actually intact. Before, his right ear was split in half by a gangster in a fight.
Zhao Yu wanted to find a mirror to look at his face, but suddenly saw the photo on the desk. In the picture, there is a police uniform, a handsome young man, actually looks like himself.
Grandma is a bear. In shock, unfamiliar memories flooded his mind like the Yellow River, instantly pouring into his mind. Only then did Zhao Yu gradually realize that... He encountered the legendary - crossing the line.
Zhao Yu clearly remembered that he was originally a gold medal fighter of the Qinglong Gang, a ruffian king who fought desperately. Although his real name is Zhao Yu, people in Jianghu prefer to call him Zhao Tianbaba.
Grandma is a bear.
Zhao Yu was shocked again. He finally remembered that before this, he had already been executed by drug injection.
But, thinking about it... Why did you come here and come here?
Could it be... I really crossed over?
And it's still seamlessly connected, there's no need for reincarnation at all.
With the influx of new memories, he was surprised to find that this was a parallel world similar to the previous one, and his current identity was an agent of the crime squad mobile team, and he was actually a policeman.
The hall where he is now is not elsewhere, but the office of the police station.
Zhao Yu could not believe his eyes, this huge contrast is really unimaginable. A senior ruffian turned into a major crimes agent, this... Where does this make sense?
He subconsciously touched his head. In the past, because he had been chopped several times on his head, his hair was always uneven, so he simply left a big bald head, like a ferocious god. But now he, actually with a head of elegant black hair, is completely a handsome young man's appearance.
"Dear colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been three cases of rape with electric batons in our city... At this moment, a female detective with short hair and big eyes is telling everyone the case for everyone.
Zhao Yu quickly found the detective's information from his memory. She was the leader of Group B of the Serious Crimes Unit. Despite her young age, she had a steady style and a high rate of solving cases. She was a celebrity in front of the leader. Generally speaking, there are any major cases that require the cooperation of the whole team, which will be hosted by her.
"The victims were all beautifully dressed young women with poor lifestyle issues. "Team Leader Qu Ping introduced, "The location of the incident is mostly near weathering places such as bars and cabarets, and the time of the crime is also after midnight. ”
"According to the victim's confession, the perpetrator first followed the victim into an unmanned alleyway, then stunned him with an electric baton, and then carried out forcible rape." After committing the crime, the perpetrator will also pee on the victim * pee* ”
Hearing the word "pee * pee", the scene was quiet.
Zhao Yu took a look. This person was Liu Changhu, the deputy captain of the mobile team of the serious crime team. During Zhao Yu's internship, this person sent Zhao Yu to many tribes and asked him to deliver letters and pour tea every day, just like the envoy summoned others.
In this world, Zhao Yu is not a ruffian king, but a big boy with a weak personality. He has just finished his internship and turned into a formal police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but also many senior colleagues, would make fun of him and arrange some jobs for him that should not belong to him.
The current Zhao Yu is not a soft persimmon, how can he stand being yelled at? As soon as he patted the table, he stood up and got up.
His sudden rise startled Liu Changhu, and even Team Leader Qu Ping had to pause for a moment.
Who knows, just when everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a female voice like a silver bell suddenly grabbed the front of Zhao Yu. I saw a girl with a ponytail, a slightly fat body, and big glasses. She appeared in front of everyone.
The girl is a newly assigned intern clerk in the Serious Crimes Unit, whose name is Libeni. This girl is a nymphomaniac, only contact less than a month, on the death of Zhao Yu on the look of Zhao Yu alive.
Although Zhao Yu has a weak personality and is often bullied, he looks like a talented person. He is 1.78 meters tall, looks like a tree, is young and handsome, and has a certain lethality to the opposite sex. He really has a certain lethality to the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing her sweetheart being yelled at, Li Beini hurried forward to relieve herself. "Captain Liu, I'll come, come I'll do it." I’ m still in my internship, and naturally I’ m doing these tasks. ”
With that, Li Beini gave Zhao Yu a knowing smile and ran to the tea room in the hall to make coffee.
Zhao Yu also had a hard time attacking, so he could only sit down again and continue to ponder his own crossing problem. Although traveling, his memory is very clear, because just a few minutes ago he was lying on the execution couch, just a few minutes ago. In his previous life, he was sentenced to death for murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in his heart that he had been framed and had not killed anyone at all. The person who was killed was the boss of a certain real estate group. Zhao Yu just beat him according to the instructions of his superiors, and it was impossible for him to die.
Besides, even if beaten to death, it is manslaughter and should not be convicted of murder. So, his death penalty is all a conspiracy by someone else.
Thinking of this, Zhao Yu couldn't help but be filled with anger. His fists clenched loudly. If you can find the person who framed you in the future, you must make them pay twice as much as possible.
By this time, Li Beini had already made the coffee and shared a cup with each of her colleagues present. The little girl's face has always been filled with enthusiasm. Every time she sends out a cup, she will kindly encourage words such as "hard work" and "come on", which is quite pleasing to colleagues.
"Officer Zhao, there are two packets of sugar in this cup." Tonight is destined to last until dawn, you have to hang in there, ah! ”
Without waiting for Zhao Yu to react, Li Beini happily put the plate to go.
At this time, Team Leader Qu Ping had finished speaking about the case, and Team Leader Jin Zhenbang, the leader of the serious crime team, spoke instead. Captain Jin is over 50 years old and has white temples. He is an unsmiling and serious old man.
Captain Jin said loudly, "There have been three cases of electric baton cases, and another one will be classified as a serial incident." Not only the top, we can't wear this big hat either.
So, everyone cheer up and try to solve this case in the shortest possible time. "This way... Group A sent people to the crime scene to investigate. Since the perpetrator followed the victim, he must have appeared in the bar and singing hall where the victim was before. Call out all the surveillance there. Be sure to find this person.
"Yes. ”
"Group B, you are mainly responsible for evidence comparison." "Captain Jin ordered, " the perpetrator has no criminal record, and the blood line cannot go through. However, the criminal's urine is an important clue. Although the police can't find a match, you can go to the hospital or medical examination center to check and compare. As long as this person has done a medical examination or has been hospitalized, he will be able to find out. ”
"Yes. ”
"In addition, the electric baton used by the criminal, the mobile phone signal that appeared at the scene, and the only victim who has seen the appearance of the criminal cannot be ignored. All of these clues must be sent to follow up. ”
"Yes. ”
"All right, let's arrange an action plan for each group. If there's no problem, let's start as soon as possible." "Captain Jin said, closed his folder, and was about to turn around and leave.
"Wait a minute, I... I have a question." ”
Everyone looked back and found that the person speaking was none other than Zhao Yu.
Captain Jin was also stunned and asked busily. "What's the matter, Zhao Yu? "? Wtf are you yanks on ”
Zhao Yu pointed to her forehead and said confidently, "I'm not feeling well. Let's go home first. Play by yourselves." ”
Chapter 1
In the 21st century, the Office of the President of Donghai Senior Private Hospital was located in Donghai City.
With a bang, a thick case was slammed on the table. President Lin was livid and furious. "Han Yunxi, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Lingyun Group. He owns 40 ( percent) shares of our hospital. You must prioritize detoxification for him." You must prioritize detoxification for him. ”
In the face of the dean's towering anger, Han Yunxi put his hands in the pockets of his white coat, very calm, very calm. "Dean Lin, I'm sorry, Mr. Li has chronic snake venom. I'm not allowed to jump in line here unless it's an emergency. ”
She is pure and beautiful, with a pair of big eyes and a pair of small pear vortices. At a young age, she is famous in the field of traditional Chinese medicine for her amazing acupuncture talent. She is a rare expert in detoxification, whether it is dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins or human endotoxins. These are her strengths.
"You know, this is Lingyun. "The dean was so angry that he clapped the case."
"Enough, don't tell me that everyone is equal before doctors, only men and women are the difference between men and women." Han Yunxi, I tell you, arrange detoxification immediately, otherwise, from today onwards, get out of the medical profession and get out of it. ”
I thought Han Yunxi would be afraid, but she was still calm and calm, and her attitude was serious. "Dean Lin, in front of me, there is no distinction between men and women. There are only two kinds of people. The one I want to save is the one I don't want to save. Mr. Li, I don't want to save. Please ask Gao Ming for another person. ”
After she finished speaking, she smiled politely, turned around and left. Her seemingly thin body was elegant and calm. There was a kind of pride that could not be ignored in the tranquility and beauty. However, when Xuan Han Yunxi opened the door, Dean Lin was furious.
"Han Yunxi, you dare to speak to me like that, you stop for me." You stop for me. ”
As she said that, she casually smashed the case clip on the table at the back of her head. Han Yunxi was stunned and felt a sense of dampness and heat slowly flowing down from the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, Tianning Kingdom.
Han Yunxi woke up in a daze from the sedan chair and heard a festival around him. The sound of gongs and drums rose and fell one after another, while a black thing was in front of him.
What’ s going on?
Han Yunxi ripped off the thing covering his head and took a breath. This... Isn't this Hippa? Subconsciously, he looked up and bowed his head, and found that he was wearing a phoenix crown and Xiapei, just like a bride who was getting married. Drunk.
The sedan chair jolted, giving Han Yunxi a headache, and at this time, strange memories flooded into his mind one after another. Undoubtedly, she crossed over, and as soon as she crossed over, she was going to get married.
The original owner was the legitimate daughter of the Han family of Tianning medical family, also known as Han Yunxi. Because of her biological mother's medical skills, she saved the Empress at that time, that is, the Empress now. She was accused of marrying the Seventh Prince at that time, that is, the current King of Qin, Long Feiye. At that time, it was also a good story, and the Han family's status soared as a result.
But no one knew that Han Yunxi killed her mother as soon as she was born, and she also grew up to be an ugly waste girl who did not understand medical skills. Therefore, marriage was delayed again and again and became a taboo for the King of Qin. However, a few days ago, the King of Qin annoyed the emperor. The emperor ordered her to marry before the end of the month. She chose a day to get married before the end of the month.
Qin Wang Long Feiye teenagers sealed the king, is the only remaining prince in the battle for the throne, young only in his early twenties, in terms of seniority is now the only royal uncle, can be described as the first person in high power of the Tianning country.
Prince Qin's mansion is in the south of the city, the Han family is in the north of the city, the sedan chair has to pass through the city from north to south, the Qin king married, even if he did not show up but relied on the crowd of thousands of people, the whole city sensation, the whole city sensation.
Just as Han Yunxi was sorting out these memory information, the joy came to an abrupt end, only to hear Xi Po shout, "It's not good, it's not good, it's not good, the big thing is not good, it's not good, the big thing is not good, the big thing is not good, the big thing is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good, the big deal is not good." ”
Chapter 1
"Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu, get up." It's almost midnight, get up and eat some dumplings. ”
Feng Yu felt that his voice was a little strange, but he felt very friendly. He vaguely agreed, opened his eyes, but saw a young face that only existed in his memory.
"Sister. ”
"Wake up, hurry up and wash your face." Tell you not to drink. You have to drink. You fell asleep without watching the Spring Festival Gala. "Feng Danying said with a smile.
Spring Festival Gala. It’ s New Year’ s Eve.
Feng Yu looked left and right in confusion. There was a hut of less than six square meters, a single bed, patched bedding, an old wooden table, and a 20-watt incandescent lamp above his head, emitting a dim yellow light. The walls were still pasted with old newspapers, which were important national events that he could no longer remember clearly.
Isn't this the old house on his family's farm when he was a child, but this house has long been demolished with the construction of small towns, and how my sister became so young?
Feng Yu raised his hand and realized that it was definitely not a prank, because his hands became smaller and his arms became thinner.
He jumped out of bed and stood by the door frame with the mark he made with a knife every New Year's Day, the highest line, 1988, 166 cm.
It is 1988 and is now. He hasn’ t graduated from junior high school yet.
He pinched himself so hard that he almost cried out in pain. Wasn't it a dream?
Feng Yu opened the door and came out. Her mother was cooking dumplings in a large pot in the kitchen. He lives in a cottage, with the kitchen just outside and the living room on the other side of the kitchen, which is called the main house on the farm.
"Up, I won't drink in the future. "Zhang Muhua lovingly looked at his son."
Feng Yu looked at his mother, who was still full of black hair, and his eyes were moist
"Mom, you have worked hard. ”
"This kid, what are you talking about? Hurry up and wash your face. Go inside and watch TV for a while. The dumplings will be ready soon. "when Zhang Muhua heard that, he worked hard, and his heart was very relieved. His son was growing up, and his son was growing up.
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips trembled. When he was just able to make money in the future, his father was found to have a terminal brain tumor and died in less than three months without even spending a penny of the money he earned.
For a long time, Feng Yu felt very uncomfortable in his heart because he wanted to raise his son but did not wait for his relatives.
"Dad. Feng Xingtai turned to look at his son. "Wake up, my head is still dizzy. Watch TV, the ethnic dance party, can be festive. ”
"Dad, I want to have a drink with you later." Seeing the anger on his father's face, Feng Yu quickly explained, "Beer is fine." ”
I haven't had a few drinks with my dad in my life. Feng Yu now has a strong desire to drink with his dad again.
"I don't have a long memory yet. OK, I'll drink a little later. I'll see if you can get up tomorrow to pay New Year's greetings. Danying, go get two bottles of beer. ”
Feng Danying shook her head helplessly and turned to get beer and cups.
There is also a single bed in the main room with bedding on it. Feng Danying went to school and lived in school. When she came back from vacation, she lived in the back room with her mother. This bed was Feng Xingtai's sleep. But three years ago, Feng Yu was still sleeping.
There is a three-door vertical wardrobe on the west wall of the living room, and there are two suitcases on top of it. On a solid wood table, there is a 14-inch black-and-white TV, in which the Spring Festival Gala is playing.
There is a folding round table in the middle of the living room, which is already full of dishes and chopsticks and chopsticks. There are eight dishes in total, but all of them are leftovers from the evening. There are chicken, fish and elbows. All eight dishes are meat dishes. There is no vegetarian dish.
Feng Yu didn't watch TV, but walked to the front of the wardrobe and looked carefully in the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall at the door, February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve, New Year's Eve.
He can now be sure that he is reborn.
Mother quickly cooked the dumplings. Feng Yu and Feng Danying both went to the kitchen to help bring the dumplings up. After all four of them sat down, Feng Xingtai picked up chopsticks and picked them up.
Xiaoyu, you're still drinking. "Zhang Muhua glared at Feng Yu."
"Mom, New Year's Eve, let me drink a little more." ”
Feng Xingtai also helped to say a few words, Zhang Muhua shook his head, let them go. Feng Yu also diligently poured a glass of beer for his mother and sister. The family must drink a glass of beer.
Dad, Mom, Sister, Happy New Year, Cheers! ”
Feng Yu took a casual bite of these leftovers on the table and felt that they were particularly delicious. This year, there are no hormone additives for future generations, etc. Fish, rabbits, etc. are wild, chickens and pigs are home-raised. The two men ate these dishes, on the dumplings, one person drank a bottle of beer, and no longer Feng Xingtai did not let any more Feng Xingtai did not let.
After eating, Feng Yu washed up and went back to his cabin to lie down. While lying on the bed, he tossed and turned, and couldn't help but think of his life before he was reborn.
Feng Yu was originally a middle-aged man in his forties. After resigning from a securities company, Feng Yu made his own investment life.
He had a wife and no children. His father died of illness at an early age. His mother lived with him.
He remembered that it was the spring of 2015. In order to take his wife abroad to treat infertility, he wanted to make more money, so he borrowed a large sum of money from all the savings of his family, including the mortgage of his house and car, and invested it all in the stock market. According to his prediction, this is a bull market. Fools can make money.
At first it was very good, and his investment soon doubled. So he boldly used high leverage in an investment company and wanted to make more profits. If he doubles it again, he will do nothing for the rest of his life, and he will be able to eat and drink without worry.
When the stock market rose to 5000 points, like many people, he was greedy and thought that it could continue to rise. At first, the stock market did rise a little, but the stock market soon ushered in a plunge, because he used high leverage and had no additional funds. Instead, he lost a lot of money. After paying back the borrowed money, he became destitute. His wife didn't know that the house and car had been mortgaged. He didn't know how to go home and face his family.
He went bankrupt. He drank a lot that day. Then he accidentally fell on the road under the gaze of many people and was hit by a big truck.
This should not be considered suicide. The accident insurance he bought should be able to compensate millions, enough to redeem the house and car, and leave a sum of money to his mother and wife.
He remembered looking at the speeding truck and thinking that if God could give him a chance to do it all over again, he would not die so cowardly, and he would let his family live a comfortable life.
But unexpectedly, God actually gave him a chance to do it all over again.
Since God asked him to start all over again, the regrets of his previous life will never happen again in this life. He wants to be a rich man, and he wants to be a legend in the investment world.
"Xiaoyu, stop shouting and go to bed quickly. " ”
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted. At the same time blame the husband, how to let the son drink at night, this is nonsense all talk nonsense.
Hearing his mother's complaining voice, Feng Yu smiled, turned over, and fell asleep sweetly. Chapter 1
Monday, May 20, 2019, May 20, 2019.
Spring ends with the summer solstice to the end of the year.
In this season, the temperature difference between day and night in Jiangnan area has changed greatly. He also wears underpants during the day to heat up like a dog. In the evening, I had to curl up in the quilt and freeze into a cold bird.
Jiangnan University Town.
Song Shuhang stayed alone in the dormitory, and the computer desk was pulled to the bedside, making it convenient for him to watch movies in various positions.
Song Shuhang did not have a hobby of skipping classes-it was sultry in the middle of the night last night. In his sleep, he used a trick of 'Shuanglong going to sea' to kick off the quilt and fly off the quilt.
In the second half of the night, the temperature dropped sharply. Song Shuhang, who only had a pair of underpants all over his body, was suddenly forced. In his sleep, he groped hard on the bed with his hands, searching for it, but he couldn't touch the quilt. In the end, it only shrank into the shape of mantis shrimp, shivering under the lustful power of the midnight cold wind.
By the time the sun rose, Song Shuhang had become a member of the seasonal cold army.
His roommate has asked for leave for today's class for him.
Then he took cold medicine and slept until now.
The high fever has subsided, and the body is still a little weak. In such a state, it is impossible to go to class at all. So, he can only stay alone in the dormitory and watch movies boringly.
On the screen, the progress bar of the movie is slowly advancing. But the content of the film, Song Shuhang did not see into the bottom at all, but did not see the content of the film.
"Has the medicinal effect passed yet? I'm so sleepy. "He yawned, feeling his eyelids a little heavy."
‘ Didididididi ~’ At this time, the chat software in the lower right corner of the computer jumped.
This is a reminder that someone has added him as a friend, or joined a group.
"Who added me? "Song Shuhang murmured. He reached out and tapped on the lower right corner of the computer touch screen. The prompt message popped up.".
[True Monarch Huangshan ( ******) requests to add you as a friend and friend. *adds an additional message* Nvm
True Monarch Huangshan. Who is this strange nickname?
"Is it a classmate in the class? "Song Shuhang secret way, the mind can not help but think of the class that clearly has been in college but is still in the youth fantasy period of the guy is still in the fantasy period of youth, the mind can not help but think of the class that clearly has been in college but is in the fantasy period of youth. If it was them, there would be such a strange nickname...
Thinking of this, he clicked 'agree' with it.
Immediately afterwards, another system message popped up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun invites you to join the group 'Jiuzhou No.1 Group'. Do you agree or not?
Song Shuhang continued to press agree.
‘ Shushan High Pressure’ agreed to join the ‘ Jiuzhou No. 1 Group’ .
[You have agreed to join the group and say hello to your friends. There is also a system smiley face attached.
Chat tools are becoming more and more user-friendly these days.
After a series of prompts popped up, Song Shuhang agreed to close the prompts and group chat window - he is now sleepy, how can he have the energy to care what group he added to the group he added.
Anyway, his group setting has always been'no prompt message, only show the number ', the group chat will not pop up to disturb him, only show the number of chats after the group, only show the number of chats after the group.
When he is sober, he can look through the chat records and know what group he joined. The chat records of the members of the group will not be lost.
The progress bar of the film is still tenaciously moving forward, but Song Shuhang's consciousness is becoming more and more blurred.
In the Jiuzhou No. 1 group, after seeing a newcomer join, a diving member of the group appeared. Northern River scattered people. "Did True Monarch Huangshan add a new Taoist friend to come in? "? It’ s been over a year now with no new people, right? ”
Another ID is 'Su Clan's Seven' and quickly replies. "There are new friends." Which district of Huaxia is Daoyou. Where is the road number? It has been repaired for several products. ”
This series of questions, always feel that there is something wrong with the place.
"Is it a fairy or not? " If yes, report your measurements and take a picture. ”
"Brother Sanlang, are you really a goldfish? "? ” Beihe Sanren sighed. "Don't die again, in case Huangshan Zhenjun adds another senior in how to do it." ”
Sanlang is good at everything, affectionate, righteous, and willing to help others, so he has a good relationship - that is, he usually likes to mouth off, and does a good job of doing things.
On the other hand, this guy's low luck value is very frightening. Every time he can't help but die, he always offends the elder. These idle egg pain of the big predecessors are worried about no fun, naturally very happy toss up the crazy knife three waves this sent to the door of the fun.
"Kneel down and beg not to mention the words' senior ', there is a shadow in our heart." "Three Waves Mad Saber sent a row of 'tearful' expressions.
Four years ago, his broken mouth offended a beautiful 'elder' and was tossed miserably... The elder tossed him for a whole year and four months. You heard it right, it's a whole year and four months. His eyes were moist at the thought of those inhuman years
As soon as Sanlang finished speaking, the group popped up one after another with bad smiles - undisguised, straightforward schadenfreude expressions in the group.
There were eight people in the group showing their online status, and six of them popped up a row of smiling faces in a row.
"You gloating guys, we remember each and every one of you. Don't let us meet you, otherwise we must let you taste the experience of our 72-way fast knife." "Three Waves Mad Saber said bitterly." He is very confident in his fast knife, and the six guys who just smirked are not his opponents in a single fight.
Kuangdao Sanlang just finished speaking.
His cultivation base is profound, and he has reached the stage of the fifth-rank Linghuang, and he is only two steps away from the sixth-rank Lingjun, but he can't beat Ah Qi, but he can't beat Ah Qi.
His 72-way swordsmanship was fast and ruthless, and his body was as fast as lightning, but he couldn't beat Ah Qi.
He was known as a crazy knife, and when he was crazy, he was even afraid of himself, but he just couldn't beat Ah Qi.
When the people in the group saw that the three waves had withered, there was another string of unscrupulous smiling faces.
"... "This time, Mad Sabre Three Waves could only issue a series of colons depressingly."
The people in the group made a lot of noise for a long time, but they didn't see the newcomer making a sound, and they were a little confused.
"The new fellow daoist is silent. "Northern River Loose Cultivator asked out loud, " he said.
Unfortunately, because of the efficacy of cold medicine, Song Shuhang has once again entered a half-asleep state.
At this time, Su Clan's Seven happily sent out another piece of news. "I took a look, and the new fellow daoist is called 'Shushan is under great pressure' by the new daoist. Have you ever heard of a master called this number? This Taoist name sounds a bit like a Confucian walker.
In retrospect, the practitioners of Confucianism were even better than Buddhists. Not only were their mouths skillful, but their fists were also hard enough. Moreover, when you are in high spirits, you will also recite poems with bravado to help yourself, which is doubly refreshing. I love hitting them the most. ”
"Ah Qi, I said, your expectations for new fellow daoists are always whether to fight well or not, and whether you play well or not? " "Wild knife three waves sent a tearful expression on his face."
"Uh, I'm sorry." "Su Clan's Seven was a little embarrassed."
Beihe Sanren laughed badly. "I won't be another 'senior' who can't use chat tools. ”
When he said this, everyone felt that the scene was very visual.
Yes, almost four years ago, there seemed to be a senior who went out of seclusion after more than a hundred years of seclusion. He also managed to get on the chat software. He was joined by Huangshan Zhenjun and joined the group. But because I can't type, I don't speak because I don't.
Then, a guy named Mad Blade and Three Waves was very happy to blossom in front of this senior, and asked this senior to report measurements, send photos, and voice chat.
And then... Within a few days, Kuangdao Sanlang saw this senior with his own eyes. That was a very beautiful senior, as dazzling and beautiful as the bright moon in the night sky.
Then, this beautiful senior tossed Frenzied Saber Sanlang for a whole year and four months before leaving contentedly.
At this time, an ID named 'pharmacist' spoke.
Inexplicably short message, no beginning and no end, no end.
Fortunately, the people in the group had long been accustomed to the pharmacist's brief chat habits - he was asking the group owner where True Monarch Huangshan was.
Speaking briefly is not the pharmacist character noble and arrogant, but because he typed with two fingers Zen plus handwriting, the speed of the thief slow It is easy to make mistakes when there are many words, and it is extremely painful to delete and write. So pharmacists are used to speaking as short as possible.
After he added people, he immediately got off the line. I heard that his precious big demon dog ran away from home again in anger. Huangshan Zhenjun went after him again. ” Beihe Sanren replied.
"... "The apothecary."
"Then we can only chat after the new Taoist friends learn to use chat tools. ”
They are all preconceived and believe that the new joiners are also people of the same kind.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang woke up slightly and came to his senses.
"Remember just now someone added me to the group, it seems to be called Jiuzhou No.1 group to come here." He murmured in a low voice, casually clicked on the chat tool in the lower right corner, and pulled out the chat window of the Jiuzhou No. 1 group.
What kind of group is it?
Soon, a chat from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang probably visited once.
This seat is the seat. Hunting down the big demon dog.
All kinds of special vocabulary in Xianxia.
The way people in the group chat and talk is also very interesting - half ancient, half white and not white. It gives the feeling that modern people try to communicate in ancient Chinese, but because of the poor foundation of ancient Chinese, the way of communication is very awkward.
"Chi~~" Song Shuhang laughed out loud.
Looks like this is a group built by fairy lovers.
Oh no, this is definitely not an ordinary group of Xianxia fans.
Everyone in the group has given themselves a dao name, and the place where they live should be called Dongfu. The pet dogs lost by the group owner should be described as the big demon dogs in the family who ran away from home and left home. Others claim that they have not beaten Confucian practitioners in hundreds of years, that is to say, that person claims to have lived for hundreds of years.
Just looking at these chat records makes me feel ashamed and ashamed.
"This kind of obsession has already reached the level of the second-grade disease, and it is the second-grade disease of Xianxia with Chinese characteristics." "Song Shuhang nodded secretly."
It seems that this is a concentration camp for patients with the second disease in Xianxia.
This was his first impression of the 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group' and its members.
But why did you add him to the group?
He looked at the information of the group leader, True Monarch Huangshan. He was not his classmate, and he certainly did not know him.
A thin blue line smoothly extends from under the nib. The pale blue lines on the palm-sized card continued to increase, and gradually, a complicated and mysterious pattern continued to become more perfect with the sliding of the pen tip.
Suddenly the nib weighed heavily, changing the light spirit just now, and then suddenly a sharp side hook, the pen hook like a blade. The pattern on the card suddenly lit up, then quickly dimmed, and returned to normal.
After completing this card, his face was still as focused as ever. He had only completed fifteen cards now, and there was still a gap of ten from today's task. He is now making a one-star energy card, which is one of the most widely used and consumed cards as the lowest level energy card.
Just then, the room suddenly went dark.
The meter shows the number 100. Unexpectedly, the energy ran out. It seems that today's task will add another one. Back at the table, Chen Muxun threw himself into his work, relying on this most paper-grade card for all his livelihood.
Chen Mu's room was very small, less than forty square meters, and there was a half-used work desk in it. In addition to the cleanliness of the work desk, there are mountains of sundries piled up everywhere else in the room. These sundries are also varied, piles of old books, scattered various raw materials.
In this simple place, Chen Mu lived for three years. This is a relief room specially provided by the federal government. A small room like this only needs to pay 150 Odi every month to stay. For poor people like Chen Mu, there is really no cheaper place than here.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen Mu finally finished the day's work-twenty-five energy cards. He carefully counted the number of cards, twice in a row, to make sure that the number was not wrong before he carefully put the energy card into the card bag in his clothes.
As soon as he entered, the shopkeeper noticed and greeted him, greeting him. "Ah Mu is coming. ”
He gave an answer to the shopkeeper. Uncle Hua, the owner of the shop, is an old man in his fifties, and the years have left traces on him that cannot be concealed. Fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, and a pair of reading glasses.
Chen Mu carefully took out the card bag from his arms, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed them to the shopkeeper in front of the shopkeeper. "Twenty-five copies." ”
Uncle Hua took the card from Chen Mu's hand and put it on the shelf without looking at it. He smiled and said, "I'm not looking at it. "It's a good thing you send cards every day, otherwise I would be in short supply here." ”
Chen Mu smiled, but did not answer. He knew that Uncle Hua's words were mostly meant as a joke. The one-star energy card is the cheapest energy card, but it is also one of the most consumed cards, not to mention that it is located near the East Wei Academy, where can only sell 25 energy cards a day?
Uncle Hua also knew Chen Mu's temper and did not bullshit. He asked directly and asked directly. "Does Ah Mu need cash or money transfer? "? ”
Chen Mu answered simply, and after saying that, he handed a light green card that he had already prepared to Uncle Hua in front of him. After finishing the settlement, Chen Muchao said goodbye to Uncle Hua and wanted to turn around and leave.
Uncle Hua suddenly stopped Chen Mu. "Ah Mu, wait a minute." ”
Chen Mu paused and turned to look at Uncle Hua in surprise. "Is there anything else? Uncle Hua. ”
Uncle Hua took out a piece of goose-yellow paper from the drawer and looked at Chen Mu with a smile. "I almost forgot something." This is a attendance certificate for the card maker training course, which was sent by the dealer when it was purchased yesterday. ”
Looking at Uncle Hua with a kind face, Chen Mu couldn't help but be touched for a moment in his heart. He knew how much the old man in front of him had helped him over the years. If it hadn't been for him, Chen Mu believed that the current life would have been out of reach for him.
Three years ago, he had just learned to make energy cards and sold them everywhere, but few people asked, and no merchants were willing to buy them. The amount of one-star energy cards needed is very large, and merchants are more willing to purchase in large quantities at a time. And Chen Mu can only make thirty most a day. For merchants, this is only a small number that cannot even be counted as a fraction.
Fortunately, he met Uncle Hua. Uncle Hua agreed to buy his energy cards, but the purchase price for each card is 103 Odi, which is two Odi lower than the wholesale price of energy cards on the market. Nonetheless, Chen Mu was still extremely grateful to Uncle Hua.
Although the price of 103 Audi was lower than the batch price of 105, Chen Mu felt that he was surrounded by great joy. I sold all my energy cards, bought the cheapest food, and the rest of my money was all spent on ingredients for energy cards.
Since then, Chen Mu's life has finally stabilized.
Twenty-five energy cards per day, he didn't have a day off.
After this, it has been three years. In these three years, he only made one kind of card - a one-star energy card. In addition to making energy cards, he spends all his time researching how to reduce costs.
Finally, in the third year, the cost of the energy card was controlled by him at 95 Odis, and he could make a profit of 8 Odis per energy card, and his daily income was stable at 200 Odis, which was three years ago. He completely dared not imagine the number.
Returning to his senses, Chen Mu smiled at Uncle Hua with a smile. "Thank you, Uncle Hua." "take that attendance card and carefully put it into the card bag in your arms."
They often advertised with incomparably gorgeous advertisements. For example, on this attendance card, they said something like "Dongwei Academy recognizes academic qualifications" and "Dongwei Academy's senior card maker authoritative lecture". In fact, what is inside Chen Mu is clear and clear? The only relationship between the organization hosting this training course and Dongwei University is that this organization has to pay Dongwei University a fee every time as a price for them to maintain this nominal "joint organization".
Chen Mu is still going to listen to what is said in the training class. Card making is one of the most difficult learning, and over the years, he has not given up self-study, but with little success. It wasn't until last year that he understood what was going on.
For a teenager without the slightest foundation, it is naturally more difficult to teach himself Card Creation, which is famous for being difficult and obscure. However, he did not have the slightest doubt about his IQ. He could learn to make one-star energy cards within a week only by memory. At that time, the card maker praised his talent.
Since then, he put aside this temporarily too high goal for him, and began to turn to the most basic theoretical study. No matter how tired he is at work every day, he always takes time to learn these boring knowledge.
After saying goodbye to Uncle Hua, Chen Mu walked south along an alley and headed south. It's Saturday and he still has a job.
After crossing two streets and walking for about twenty minutes, he came to a used card collection station.
He is also the owner of this acquisition station. Every Saturday and Sunday night, Chen Mu would come here to work for three hours as a part-time worker.
Chen Mu nodded slightly to Xiao Hei, but his face was still somewhat dull.
Xiao Hei has long been accustomed to Chen Mu's face. When Chen Mu came here to ask for a part-time job, Xiao Hei originally refused. Since his father, the purchase station has been managed by himself. When it comes to him, he has also been managing it himself.
But when Chen Mu said he didn't want wages, Xiao Hei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Mu was still paid. Generally, Chen Mu would choose a few used cards to take away as his wages.
Sometimes Chen Mu would pick out a few unused energy cards from these waste piles, and Xiao Hei calculated that every month, the cost he saved on them was a large sum. It's just that for the silent Chen Mu, he couldn't help but give birth to a bit of curiosity. How did this guy know that there was still energy left in these cards?
But since then, every time he sees Chen Mu, he always smiles and smiles.
Chen Mu squatted down and began to sort through piles of used cards. There are many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, quasi-object cards, and even some rare plant cards and animal cards. However, the cards here were all useless without exception. All Chen Mu had to do was to categorize these cards into categories.
The work went on quickly, and it was obvious that he was very familiar with the work.
Chen Mu flipped his wrist and threw a card at Xiao Hei. "Well, this card can still be used for a while." "there is at least half of the energy in this two-star energy card. Chen Mu couldn't understand why the original owner of this card was so wasteful." The capacity of a two-star energy card is 1, 000, that is to say, there is almost 500 energy in it.
Little Black looked at the two-star energy card in his hand, and his eyebrows smiled and smiled. The fart ran to the energy meter and inserted the card. When he saw the "523" number on it, Xiao Hei laughed and almost squeezed the five officials into a group.
Three years of production career, let him have his own understanding of this most common and low-level card. There is not only one way to make one-star energy cards. Chen Mu has already collected twelve different structures from this one-star energy cards.
These one-star energy cards with different structures gave Chen Mu a lot of inspiration. It was because he borrowed some skills from these cards that he succeeded in reducing the cost of making one-star energy cards to 95 Odi. But such luck doesn't happen every day. So far, he has only collected twelve of them.
But luck seems to be good today.
Looking at the one-star energy card in his hand, from the surface texture, he is a kind of one-star energy card that Chen Mu has never encountered another new structure before.
He put the energy card aside and continued to dig through it. There are too many one-star energy cards, but Chen Mu was not tired of checking them one by one. His degree was extremely fast, almost as long as his hand gently stroked from these one-star energy cards, he could know if it was what he wanted or not.
All of this came from his familiarity with the one-star energy card. This familiarity was left over from three years of uninterrupted production. He didn't need to look at it. He could judge whether this card was a one-star energy card or not, and whether it was a structure he had seen before. He was so familiar with them that he knew every detail of them.
The fingers skimming over the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
Lin Che got up from the bed in a daze.
Her head was drowsy as if it were not her own. The luxurious bed sheet touched by the palm of her hand was not the old one she used to wash. The lamp above her head was not the half-broken energy-saving lamp style she was used to seeing. She was in pain as if she had just been torn by something. She raised her wrist, and the blue and purple marks on it were clear and obvious.
She covered her mouth and didn't want to let herself cry out. She lifted the quilt and saw herself naked inside. The screams almost rushed out of her voice.
Lin Che's nimble eyes dripped around twice in the fundus, decisively lifted the quilt, got out of bed, packed up the messy clothes, put them on casually, and ran out without looking back.
"Ah... Let go of me, you let go... Lin Che struggled with both hands and feet.
The man's big hand grabbed her neck and dragged her back to the bed without any effort.
His deep eyes seemed to carry an innate arrogance. On his frosty cheeks, the wings of his nose stood high on his fair face, and his skin was like white jade. She, a woman who asked herself that her skin was good, felt envious and jealous.
She asked herself that she had seen a lot of men, but those men who were called male gods suddenly became eclipsed in front of him.
It was this man who spent half the night tossing her half to death yesterday.
"Who sent you? you actually drugged me." You do the thing so that you can get out of here intact. He looked at the stunned woman, and anger flashed in his deep eyes.
This strange woman, the skin is better than snow, the small face is pleasant, a pair of smart big eyes, eyelashes flutter, like a frightened deer, and not willing to show weak eyes to force him to look at him.
Gu Jingze fixed his eyes on her, and saw Lin Che's eyes turn quickly with his brain again.
But she's got the wrong person.
The person in front of me, although handsome makes people feel dizzy, but obviously not that super first-line star Gu Jingyu, is not that super first-line star Gu Jingyu.
This time, she was rudely grabbed by his arm again. When she fell to the ground, she even rolled around in embarrassment before settling down again.
"You're mistaken, the one that's severely damaged right now is me." "She fell on the buttocks pain, hand pain, the pain below is even more can not be ignored, a annoyed, she directly shouted out, " I want to be obsessed with others, and you have nothing to do with half a dime, you think you are worth my medicine ah, this aunt is not a casual hand, you also my medicine money back to my medicine money, you also my medicine money back to the money for my medicine money, but also my medicine money back to the money for my medicine money, she directly shouted out, "I want to be obsessed with others, and you have nothing to do with half a dime, you think that you are worth the money, ah, you also not a casual hand, you also my medicine money back to the money for my medicine money, you also my medicine money back to the money for my medicine money, you also my medicine money back to the money for ”
Lost the wrong person.
Gu Jingze's cheeks tightened, his eyebrows twisted into Sichuan characters, his black eyes like a dormant beast, staring at this disheveled woman, her white half shoulders exposed to the outside, the bluish purple and red marks on it, clear eye-piercing, on the white and tender skin like plum blossoms on the white and tender skin like plum blossoms.
Those images of the night flashed in his mind again, and his lower abdomen suddenly became hot, and he felt the obvious heat again, surging in his body.
Looked away from her face.
This damn woman dared to drug him, and the effect was still so strong.
His momentary openness allowed Lin Che to finally get the opportunity to jump out of bed desperately. She pushed the man away with all her might.
Not daring to turn her head back, she hurriedly ran out and ran.
Hearing him hiss, she exclaimed, "What are you looking at? Look at yourself and see for yourself. ”
"You... Gu Jingze was just about to turn around and grab her, but he felt unbearable for a while, and the lower part was already uncontrollably high once again.
"Damn it. "He cursed loudly, clenched his fists to suppress the damn * * *.
A series of voices came from outside.
Qin Hao looked back, his mouth unable to close in astonishment.
What the hell was that just now? Why did a disheveled woman come out of Mr.'s room?
He raised his sharp eyes, black eyes flashing, let Qin Hao hurriedly put all the doubts that should not be swallowed into the stomach, all swallowed into the stomach.
Gu Jingze kept washing his body in the bathroom until his skin was washed pink before he scolded in the mirror. "****** * * * * * * * * * * * * scolded the mirror. ”
Gu Jingze one Leng, this time, the mother unexpectedly came over, a thought also know will not be a good thing will not be a good thing.
When the bathroom door was pulled open, the beautiful lady standing outside was looking at the mess all over the bed in surprise.
Those beds that were too late to clean were clearly telling everyone in front of them what had happened last night.
Gu Jingze dark eyes gloomy, one hand pulled over the bathrobe put on the honey-colored shoulder, "I know what you want to ask, but, mother, I am very busy today, I am very busy today." ”
How could Mu Wanqing not ask? The excitement on her face was hard to hide. Looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed to the bed and said, "Jingze, I already know. You had sex with a girl." ”
Gu Jingze pushed open the door and said coldly to Mu Wanqing, "Don't worry about this, okay? " " ”
"How can I not care? Jingze, you have to marry her. You have to take responsibility for other girls. You have to take responsibility for other girls. ”
"Mother, I won't marry her. I'm not crazy. She's just a strange woman. I don't even know her name. ”
"Mother. "Gu Jingze stood there, looking even more upset at the thought of that woman."
"Are you still thinking about that Mo Huiling? I tell you, it's impossible for you to be with her. You've been with her for so many years, but you still can't touch her. You're just destined not to be together. "Mu Wanqing said unceremoniously."
"Mother, that's enough. "Gu Jingze wanted to interrupt Mu Wanqing."
But Mu Wanqing was very excited, "Jingze, you know your illness, you can't touch a woman at all, the family is almost ready for artificial insemination to let you get a child, but you touched a woman today, that she is the most suitable object for you." however, you touched a woman today, which means that she is the most suitable object for you. ”
Qingcheng, a famous Taoist mountain, has had countless strange people in and out of it since ancient times. The so-called hidden dragons and snakes in the grass are just like this.
Countless myths and legends, countless legends, like a thick cloud, cast a mysterious veil on Qingcheng.
The morning light was slightly exposed, and on the slate path in the mountains, groups of Qingyi Taoists, holding three long incense plants, quietly and quickly marched on the path, toward a towering, mirror smooth stone wall in the back mountain.
The mountain road is steep and the dew is slippery, but these Taoists are faster than galloping horses, bringing up green shadows. Some people jump up from time to time, Ling Feng flies across a hundred meters, the morning wind blowing, clothes flying, that fluttering momentum, just like the immortal in the mortal world.
In the mountains, peaks and pavilions of Qingcheng Mountain, there are Taoist people constantly walking out and gathering in front of this nameless stone wall.
Among them, there are also a large group of small Taoist priests holding various flags and magic tools, carrying incense burners and walking around the Nine Palaces formation. The cigarette flew straight into the sky, and the dense air wrapped around it, turning into a cloud covering the top of the group's heads.
At the forefront of many Taoists, just below the stone wall, a group of Taoists dressed in gold-rimmed purple robes embroidered eight diagrams with silver thread on their chest and chest. The edges of the sleeves of the robes were more cloudy and marquetry, and there were gorgeous and incomparable Taoists all around, holding dust in their hands and standing there with expressionless faces there.
The group of Taoists waited quietly for a while. When a red light suddenly jumped up in the east, and the misty red light instantly tore apart the heaven and earth and sprinkled all over the place, many Taoists bowed down together and piously knelt down and kowtowed to the stone wall.
Thousands of Daoists recited incantations at the same time, and the sound of the 'buzzing buzzing buzzing' incantation was entangled into a small, thrilling sound that spread far away. Gradually, a strange force rose from the sound of the spell, and a bright colorful glow shot out from the heads of many Taoists, shining on the smooth and smooth stone wall.
Those Taoists in gold-rimmed purple robes bowed to the ground at the same time, murmuring a prayer in their mouths.
After half an hour, a ray of white light finally shot out from the top of the stone wall, and soon the whole stone wall released a clear white light.
The haze rose into the sky, and there were countless clouds and smoke entangled in the stone wall. Vaguely, several hazy figures around the golden light appeared in the clouds and smoke. The figure became clearer and clearer. In the end, three men and two women dressed in white Taoist robes, their faces were blocked by golden light, and Taoists appeared in front of everyone.
The woman in the middle looked down at the many Taoists kneeling in front of the stone wall. Suddenly, a pair of scrolls were added to her hand and she threw them out casually.
With a flash of white light on the stone wall, the scroll made of purple jade and gold thread slowly floated out and landed on the hands of the purple-robed old Taoist who led many Taoists to worship in front of him. The woman who threw out the scroll said a few words in a nifty voice, turned around and waited for her companions to leave.
Several purple-robed old Taoists suddenly shouted. "The Patriarch is merciful and merciful, " he said. ”
The sound of "dong dong" kept ringing, and all the Taoists kowtowed heavily to the five men and women, knocking their foreheads so loudly that the mountains and stones rang.
The woman who threw out the scroll shouted coldly, and immediately all the Taoists fell to their knees stiffly, not daring to make any more movements.
On the contrary, the other woman beside the woman laughed a few low smiles, and threw a few things out of her backhand.
As soon as the light of the stone wall darkened, the five Taoists disappeared without a trace.
Several things shining with strange light slowly fell from the air. They were a sword, a bead, a small cauldron, five talismans, and nine medicine bottles.
Swords, beads, and tripods are tiny in size like children's playthings, but each one is wrapped in dazzling haze, which is obviously extraordinary.
The five talismans were even more golden light entangled, and the purple energy was forcing people. If there was no pressure, waves of pressure poured out from the talismans one after another. Those Taoists who were slightly closer were unstable, and they were pushed back by this force.
The nine medicine bottles are densely engraved with talismans and seals of various colors. The old Taoist who had just taken the scroll opened one of the medicine bottles in front of many Taoists. A quiet medicine box suddenly sprayed out. Thousands of Taoists in front of the stone wall took a deep breath at the same time, and they felt that the seven orifices were smooth. The meridians all over his body seemed to have been washed by clean water. The whole body was lit up, and the whole body was lit up.
The mere smell of a wisp of medicine was better than the hard work of these Taoists for three months. The purple-robed old man hurriedly stuffed the medicine bottle tightly and sealed it firmly and firmly. Just the fragrance of the elixir has such a magical effect, you can imagine what kind of treasure the elixir in this medicine bottle is.
Several purple-robed old Taoists gathered together and muttered in a low voice for a while. They packed up the sword, bead, tripod, talisman and medicine bottle respectively, and then unfolded the scroll in front of all the Taoists.
The first half of the scroll is the Taixu Qi Sutra, a scripture for practicing Qi and nourishing the mind. And the second half of the scroll made the purple robes pale and shouted in panic. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Taoists swarmed out of Qingcheng Mountain.
The potential power of Qingcheng Mountain in the secular world has been fully launched, setting off invisible waves.
Chapter 1
In the scorching heat of July, the Asphalt Road exudes a pungent smell of paint under the scorching sun, and it looks like it is about to melt.
The air above the road is directly distorted and skewed by the evaporating air.
Under such a poisonous sun, there are almost no pedestrians on the street, even fewer cars coming and going. Everyone is looking for a shady place to escape the summer, or enjoys happiness in an air-conditioned room.
A woman in a washed white shirt and gray suit pants hurriedly walked straight towards the Second People's Hospital.
The hair was tightly glued to the woman's face because of sweat, and the woman's cheeks had an abnormal flush, which was obviously damaged by the sun.
The white shirt was wet by the sweat on her body, and it felt uncomfortable to stick to her body, but Qiao Nan had no time to take care of it, and grabbed the bag with 100, 000 yuan in it tightly.
This is the money she managed to raise by selling all the valuable things around her. Her sister needs 200, 000 yuan for surgery, and there is still 100, 000 yuan left to find a way out.
Walking straight to the ward, Qiao Nan's hand touched the door guard and heard the conversation between the mother and daughter in the ward.
"Mom, it's all Qiao Nan's fault. If it weren't for her, the army wouldn't have divorced me." "This is the voice of Qiao Nan's sister Qiao Zijin."
"Don't cry, mom has already taught Qiao Nan a lesson for you." "Mother Ding Jiayi touched her eldest daughter's head sadly.
Standing outside, Qiao Nan felt that Chen Jun would leave with her sister not because her sister was caught cheating on her, but what does this have to do with her?
Thinking of Chen Jun, Qiao Nan's eyes darkened for a while.
Chen Jun was originally Qiao Nan's boyfriend, but Qiao Zijin was pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child. Ding Jiayi scolded Qiao Nan severely, saying that Qiao Nan was a heartless little beast who robbed her of her boyfriend and forced her own sister to have an abortion.
In the end, Qiao Nan had to quit, accomplishing Chen Jun and his own sister.
"Mom, Dajun divorced me. The child is not with me yet. I have this disease again. What should I do? Mom, I don’ t want to die. I haven’ t been filial to you yet. I really don’ t want to die. ”
In the ward, Qiao Zijin hugged Ding Jiayi and cried hard. She was still so young and had a lot of good days. She really didn't want to die.
Hearing that her eldest daughter had such a serious illness and wanted to be filial to herself in the future, Ding Jiayi was moved and couldn't do anything about it.
Ding Jiayi coaxed Qiao Zijin on the back. "No, Mom will definitely not let you get hurt. Mom has gone to raise money for you because of that dead girl Qiao Nan. "
Not long after Qiao Zijin divorced Chen Jun, she suffered from kidney failure and had to have a kidney transplant immediately.
But in this marriage relationship, Qiao Zijin cheated on the wrong party. In addition, Chen Jun worked for the government. Qiao Zijin was cleared out of the house. Now that he is sick, he doesn't even have the money to see a doctor and take medicine.
Qiao Nan, who had long known that her mother was biased, couldn't help but feel pain in her already numb heart after hearing this conversation.
She was already 40 years old. After she broke up with Chen Jun that year, she never had a relationship again. It wasn't that she didn't want to talk about it, it was that her mother wouldn't let her talk about it.
Over the years, most of the money she earned was given to her mother. Her mother used the money she earned to buy her sister a suite of 150 square meters, but she could only live in a rental house with only a few dozen square meters.
She paid for the food and even the water and electricity bills at her parents' house. Every time her sister returned to her mother's house, although she had some things in her hand when she came, she carried more when she went back.
I am unmarried at this age, and I am joked that no one wants leftover women. Qiao Nan is not unaware that her mother does not want her to get married, but just wants her salary.
But this is her own mother. Every time she goes on a blind date and falls in love, her mother will make a fuss and seek life. She can't help it.
His hard work over the years, finally only in exchange for "dead girl" three words, especially Qiao Zijin also put the responsibility for his derailment and divorce on his own body, Qiao Nan grabbed the 100, 000 yuan in his hand, suddenly did not want to give Qiao Zijin.
Before Qiao Nan left, the conversation that Qiao Nan heard next made Qiao Nan feel cold and desperate.
In case Qiao Nan raised 200, 000 yuan, but can not find * * what to do* what to do. In fact, the doctor said that if a relative would donate a kidney to me, the degree of matching would be higher and rejection reaction would not occur easily. ”
Leaning on Ding Jiayi's arms, Qiao Zijin said pitifully and pitifully. "If I really have relatives, maybe I can save a little money to see a doctor." ”
**How can it be so easy to find? Some people can't wait for such an opportunity until they die.
Knowing this, Qiao Zijin knew that money was not enough for her to survive. She had to think of other ways.
"No, don't Mom go for a blood test." "Ding Jiayi asked hesitantly, " she said.
Qiao Zijin shook her head repeatedly, her mother is this age, the kidney is certainly not better than her where to go, since all of them, she must want a good one, she must want a good one. "Mom, you are the mother who gave birth to me and raised me, I can't bear you to use a knife, my father must not be able to do so either." ”
"Then... Ding Jiayi thought about it and her eyes lit up. "Wait a minute for the dead girl to come. I'll let her go for a blood test. She's your own sister. She's definitely a match." ”
"Good is good, but will Qiao Nan refuse, after all, this is a kidney." Qiao Zijin's eyes were full of calculating light.
In order to survive, just in case, she would never let Qiao Nan have the possibility of refusal.
"Miss Qiao, come and see your sister. Why don't you go in? "Qiao Zijin and Ding Jiayi chatted aside, and the nurse's voice came from outside the door.
Qiao Zijin's face changed greatly. "Mom... "The conversation she had with her mother just now was all heard by {Qiao Nan that dead girl.
Without saying a word, Ding Jiayi got up and chased after Qiao Nan. Sure enough, she saw Qiao Nan's back, and then shouted Qiao Nan's name.
When Qiao Nan heard Ding Jiayi's shouts, she refused to turn back or stop. Tears kept falling, but her heart was broken.
For her mother and her sister, she doesn't even have a home of her own, but her mother and her sister, calculating her money is not enough, and now they still want her kidney.
Ding Jiayi didn't understand Qiao Zijin's words, but Qiao Nan understood. The more this happened, the more Qiao Nan hated it. Even if she really owed the Qiao family, it should be enough.
Qiao Nan had a headache and wanted to tell her mother that it was dangerous on the street. A car rushed towards her.
"Squeak", "bang", two loud explosions, Qiao Nan's whole body was so painful that he could not speak, but he barely opened his eyes to see how her mother was doing.
Ding Jiayi was indeed frightened. Seeing her little daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over and murmured, then murmured and said a word. "Qiao Nan, it's good that you die. At least you can help your sister if you die. Zijin has a kidney and money. ”
The youngest daughter was killed, and the person who hit the youngest daughter must lose money.
Hearing Ding Jiayi's words, Qiao Nan stared at Ding Jiayi stubbornly. Without waiting for the ambulance to arrive, she couldn't help but be pissed off by Ding Jiayi.
Chapter 1
The most painful thing in the world is that one moment you fantasize about heaven, and the next moment you find yourself in hell.
Mo Wen is such a person. Two months ago, he was still sitting in the classroom, fantasizing about being admitted to Xinyi's key university. At this time, he was doing small labor on the construction site exposed to the scorching sun.
Remembering his tragic experience, Mo Wen spat fiercely on the ground and raised his hand to haphazardly wipe the sweat that kept running down his face. I just finished moving a truckload of bricks, and I am already sweating at this time.
Mo Wen, a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy with an ordinary face, dark skin, a lean figure, and a pair of somewhat calm eyes. Perhaps the children of poor families are in charge of the family early, and at a young age, he makes people look like some young adults.
Put the cement truck carrying bricks in his hand to the side of the road, and Mo Wen found a shady place to sit down. At this time, the foreman was not there, but it was a good time to be lazy secretly. In the boring and busy construction site, it is very happy to be lazy for a while.
He sat on a concrete slab with a golden knife, his eyes constantly patrolling the road, and soon his eyes lit up. A graceful figure walked out from the opposite side of the road and immediately attracted his attention.
Although the distance is far away, the other person's appearance cannot be seen, but the figure is absolutely attractive, especially the walking posture is very elegant, like a professionally trained model.
Don't look at just women walking, there is a lot of knowledge in it. And Mo Wen stayed on the construction site all day, opposite is the road and sidewalk.
He seemed to remember something. From the clothes on his chest, he pulled out a blue metal disk, only the size of a coin, tied by a small blue iron chain, like a strange necklace.
This object was also something that Mo Wen accidentally found when he demolished an ancient house a few days ago. At that time, he found an ancient green brick in one of the walls. The green brick was pitted and broken. It is estimated that it was a century-old ancient brick.
If it is other centuries-old antiques, I am afraid it can still be worth a little money, but a green brick, even if it is an antique, I am afraid it is not worth anything at all.
At that time, Mo Wen casually threw the green brick on the ground, but he didn't want the green brick to break and a metal ornament fell out of it. It was the strange necklace in Mo Wen's hand.
There was something strange about the cyan metal disk, which was divided into eight areas and carved with all sorts of strange runes.
Mo Wen was not familiar with antiquities, but he could tell that the thing in his hand should be a miniature version of the gossip tray. Ordinary people would hang the gossip tray at home to seek good fortune and avoid evil. As a magic weapon, he would worship it as a magic weapon.
Although he is not superstitious and does not believe in the ability of the Eight Diagrams Plate to seek good fortune and avoid evil, he also knows that this ancient Eight Diagrams Plate should be valuable and may still be an antique. If it is sold to an antique dealer, it is likely to become rich overnight.
Mo Wen's eyes were full of longing. Stroking the gossip necklace was like stroking his lover. Once he became a rich man, those big beauties who used to only dare to peep from afar and swallow their saliva secretly were not allowed to be picked by him.
"Something happened." Something happened. ”
"Something happened." Call an ambulance. ”
A noisy scream never sounded far away. Immediately after, many people ran there. The scream also interrupted Mo Wen's dream.
He looked over there suspiciously, hesitated for a moment, stood up, and ran to the place where the crowd gathered.
With a glance, the situation in front of him made him jump. A middle-aged man in his late fifties, dressed in rags, lay twitching on the ground, pale, breathing heavily, holding his chest tightly in his hands, as if in pain.
From his eyes, filled with deep fear, he seemed to feel death.
Many workers came, but no one dared to come forward. A group of workers with little culture obviously did not know what had happened and did not dare to act rashly.
"Acute myocardial infarction. ”
Mo Wen's face changed slightly, looking somewhat unsightly at the twitching old Zhang on the ground. He recognized Lao Zhang's illness at a glance, because someone in the village had a sudden acute myocardial infarction and died in just a few minutes. He witnessed the whole process with his own eyes.
His village is very remote, and there are basically no professional doctors in the village. Usually, he has a disease or something that is simply treated with the local prescription handed down from his ancestors. There is no targeted treatment at all.
His mother was weak and sickly, and there was no doctor in the village. His biggest dream was to enter the most famous medical university in China. In the future, he would become a doctor to treat his mother and the villagers.
It was a pity that he failed in the college entrance examination. Originally, with his score, he could be admitted to the medical department of Huaxia University, and he could get the qualification of free admission, but he was replaced by a powerful son of the family. Obviously, the score was lower than him, but he was pushed down by squeezing him down.
Although his grades allowed him to enroll in other good schools, the high tuition fees were something he couldn't afford at all. In order not to burden his mother, he had to give up his studies and start working part-time to earn money.
The construction site belongs to the development zone on the edge of the city, which is far from the city. It takes 25 minutes for an ambulance to arrive at the nearest hospital. Can see the patient's appearance, can not last 25 minutes or two things said. Hold on for 25 minutes. It was nothing short of a miracle.
He knows this person and lives in the same shed with him. His name is Zhang Honest. Usually everyone calls him Lao Zhang. He is an honest and honest person. Because he has no skills, he can only do the lowest level of small workers on the construction site like him.
It is said that he also has a son who goes to college, and he works so hard to earn money for his son to go to college.
Mo Wen looked hesitantly at Lao Zhang, a worker on the ground. His dream is to become a doctor. He has a certain understanding of some simple and common diseases and pathologies. For acute myocardial infarction, he knows that there are several first aid measures that can alleviate the condition.
But these days, who dares to save people casually? It is naturally a good thing to be able to save, but if you can't save someone, the patient will have three strengths and two weaknesses, and I am afraid that the responsibility will be held on his head.
However, society is so realistic. Perhaps simply taking some emergency measures to alleviate the condition and prolong the time of death can save a person's life. But Mo Wen, like the others around him, did not dare to rush forward to help.
Taking a deep breath, he was slightly silent for a while, and finally sighed and stepped toward the sick old Zhang. He is not a bad person, but Lao Zhang has a good relationship with him. They are poor rural people who come out to work and deeply understand each other's difficulties. Lao Zhang is the pillar of the whole family. Watching Lao Zhang die, his conscience can not do it.
"Don't touch him, I'm a doctor. ”
A graceful figure ran from a distance, all the way through the messy construction site, trotted to the site of the incident.
Mo Wen was stunned for a moment, and subconsciously stopped. A fragrant breeze struck, and there was a wonderful figure in front of him.
It was a girl with a beautiful face and a tall figure, only half a head shorter than Mo Wen. She struck a beige floral skirt, and the skirt fell on the bend of her legs, revealing a pair of slender and fair calves. Running all the way, the dress fluttered, Chu Chu moved.
Mo Wen couldn't help but be stunned. He squatted on the construction site every day to peek at the young girls passing by, but this was the first time he had seen such a beautiful girl. A natural and beautiful face was constantly echoing in his mind. No makeup, but it's amazing.
He found that the girl in the white dress was the woman he had secretly lusted over across the road before. Now I know that people not only have a good figure, but also have a surprisingly beautiful face.
The girl ignored Mo Wen and squatted down directly to check on Lao Zhang's condition. Soon, her beautiful face changed. It seemed that the situation was somewhat serious.
Mo Wen also knew that the patient was in shock at this time, and the situation was not optimistic.
"Can you help me? ”
The girl raised her head and glanced anxiously at Mo Wen. At this time, Mo Wen was the closest to the patient. Naturally, she found him for the first time.
"Yes, okay. ”
Mo Wen was stunned for a moment. He didn't expect the girl to ask him for help, but he quickly reacted and hurried to the girl's side.
Can you help me straighten him out and lift his legs slightly? "The girl carefully gave Lao Zhang external chest compression surgery, while Mo asked asked."
Mo Wen already knew some ways to relieve myocardial infarction, and soon did what the girl said. He knew that the method the girl said was correct. Lifting the patient's legs was to prevent hypoxia in the brain of the patient in shock. Now, without equipment such as oxygen tanks, doing so was the best solution.
He suddenly found that his chest was a little hot, and it was getting hotter and hotter, as if there was a red-hot iron sticking to his chest. His face changed slightly, and he subconsciously touched his chest and found that it was the gossip tray excavated from the blue ancient brick.
Anlin stood at the top of the tall building, facing the noisy wind.
The wind howled, the feeling of weightlessness of falling sharply, even though he had no love for life, he was still frightened and screamed. "Help.   ”
The fear of imminent death enveloped his whole body, making every part of his body tremble.
At this moment, Anlin's whole body was suddenly wrapped in a mysterious white light mass.
A terrifying feeling of overweight also came at this moment, and he felt like he was on a roller coaster, rushing to the bottom, then circling an arc and flying into the sky.
Anlin's screams continued. After his body flew into the sky, he landed on the roof again.
That kind of extremely intense overweight and weightlessness, as well as the feeling of alternating life and death, made Anlin feel dizzy for a while, and then vomited up indisputably.
"Hey, young man, are you feeling better? "At this moment, an ethereal voice came to Anlin's ears."
He looked up and found an old man looking at him lovingly.
The old man's beard and hair were all white, with immortal wind and bones, and his whole body was haunted by golden immortal qi. He looked holy and flawless.
Seeing this scene, Anlin's whole body shook, and countless plots came to mind.
Various plots began to emerge in Anlin's mind, and the beginning of all the dreams was the scene in front of him.
Puff...
Anlin kowtowed heavily, tears filling his eyes. "Immortal, thank you for saving me. ”
The old man, who was called an immortal by Anlin, stroked his white beard and smiled, saying with a slight smile. "Young man, you are in your prime, why do you choose to commit suicide? "? ”
My mother died young and my father was addicted to gambling. "After my father lost the house, he owed millions of gambling debts and was unable to repay them, and then ran away alone. ”
"A few million ah." Also does I have to remove something? ”
"Then I was forced to drop out of school and work as a coolie for my creditors. ”
Anlin poured out snot and tears, only feeling that life was a gloomy place. What's the difference between a life of paying off debts and a salted fish? It's better to reincarnate as soon as possible.
After listening to Anlin's experience, the immortal also had a sympathetic look in his eyes, and he slowly opened his mouth. "Young man, your life is really bitter... In this way, you and I are destined to meet, and I think you have excellent qualifications, it is better to let this fairy send you a set of 'systems', let you change your life, let you change your life, right? ”
Anlin trembled when he heard the words. He thought that he was lucky to be able to marry the immortal, but he did not expect the immortal to be so generous. He actually sent the system as soon as he met him.
"Woohoo, Grandpa Immortal, you are really very kind to me." Dhei ggriid dhat dh Snn wz dh strawngr v dh tu. ”
The immortal smiled lovingly, his palm turned to the sky, and then a pure white ball of light appeared in his palm.
"Young man, come here and hold this ball of light in the palm of your hand." "The immortal said to Anlin.
Hearing this, An Lin was so excited that he couldn't wait to hold the ball of light.
The ball of light in his hand emitted a trace of warmth, and the light revealed in the ball was extremely soft.
"Start system migration." "The immortal said slowly.
As soon as the fairy's words fell, the light on the white ball of light flourished.
Just then, the immortal said to Anlin. "Young man, swear quickly, swear to accept this God of War system, and never give up in your life." ”
Ares system.
What a domineering name?
But how does this vow feel like a marriage declaration?
Before he had time to think about it, An Lin hurriedly said. "I swear to accept the God of War system and never give up in my life." ”
As soon as Anlin's oath was finished, the ball of light whoosh, crashed directly into his body and merged with him.
Immediately afterwards, a voice sounded in his mind. "Detecting the host as a Heavenly Netherworld Dao constitution, meeting the qualifications, the system began to merge." The system began to merge. ”
Anlin was so excited that she wanted to cry.
Originally thought that his life is gray, but did not expect the peak circuit to turn around, unexpectedly ushered in the life of the open hanging system at this moment.
The immortal was also excited, and so excited that he was already crying.
Immortal Grandpa, what's wrong with you? It's okay. Seeing the old man's strange behavior, Anlin asked curiously and asked curiously.
The immortal came back to his senses and wiped away his tears, knowing that he had lost his temper.
"Young man, after you get the system, you have to work hard. "The immortal language focuses on the long way."
"Well, I'm sorry." I will. "An Lin nodded heavily."
So, do you want to go to school to cultivate immortals? "The fairy then asked, " she said.
To the school to cultivate immortals. Only a fool would refuse.
"Yes, I really want to cultivate immortals." ”
Anlin almost didn't think about it, so he opened his mouth and answered. The immortal smiled with relief, took out a piece of golden paper and handed it to Anlin, then said, "This is my recommendation letter. You have it, so you can go to the United University of Immortal Cultivation to study and officially embark on the path of immortal cultivation." ”
An Lin was startled, and dared to love Long Aotian's path to immortal cultivation. The immortals paved the way for themselves.
He solemnly accepted the recommendation letter from the immortal to himself and looked at the immortal with gratitude on his face.
Anlin was very curious about the immortal who gave him a new life.
"Name... Let's not talk about it. "The immortal stroked the top of Anlin's head with a sympathetic look on his face."
"I have to go now, young man, good-bye." ”
The immortal bid farewell to Anlin, and then flew away in the clouds and fog.
"Immortal, walk slowly, fairy." "Anlin thanked the immortal who flew to the sky and said goodbye."
From the sky came the laughter of immortals, which was extremely pleasant and wanton, as if pouring out the injustice of a lifetime of grievances.
Why is this immortal so happy? Why does he feel happier than me?
Anlin looked puzzled.
At this moment, a female voice rang out in Anlin's consciousness. "Hello. ”
This female voice is beautiful, like the sound of nature, hear Anlin body a clever spirit.
This is the voice of the system.
Anlin was surprised and uncertain.
At this moment, an interface appeared in Anlin's mind.
The interface is gray and white, and only a few words are displayed on it. The functions of the Ares system will be activated after entering the Taichu Continent.
What the hell is the Primordial Continent?
Anlin thought of the letter of recommendation given by the immortal, and he spread out the golden paper in his hand expectantly.
Then, he found that there was nothing in the golden paper, only a slightly dented handprint.
Anlin was a little confused, but he still took advantage of the situation and put his hand on the paper, which coincided with the handprint.
Suddenly, the golden light of the paper flourished, and Anlin only had time to "eh" in surprise, and was completely swallowed by the golden light.
Anlin only felt a whirl, and his vision changed from pitch black to bright again.
Then he found that his body appeared high in the sky again and began to land freely.
Anlin once again experienced the feeling of jumping off a building. No matter how many times he came, he wanted to shed tears.
Anlin raised his head with some difficulty, and then saw a scene that he would never forget.
Two white-patterned dragon gate pillars as high as 100 feet stood between the sky. The plaque was engraved with mysterious fonts that he could not understand.
Behind the gate, there are thousands of palaces with no end in sight.
Colorful clouds float around the palace, and all kinds of spirit beasts soar between heaven and earth, creating a grand and magnificent atmosphere of the immortal family.
Anlin stood frozen in place with a shocked look on his face.
It turns out that there is really a fairyland in this world.
Anlin tried to calm down and calm himself down.
After a while, he saw a woman in a Taoist robe coming and hurried up to say hello.
"Hello, Sister Fairy. "Anlin waved to the woman."
When the beautiful woman saw Anlin waving to her, she walked over and saw her.
Seeing this, Anlin asked a little excitedly. "This beautiful fairy sister, may I ask where this place is? I'm new here and I don't know much about this place. ”
Hearing Anlin's words, the woman looked a little strange, then said and said, "Gee Li Gu Lu." ”
"Ah, what did you say? "Anlin was somewhat puzzled."
The woman showed the same expression as Anlin and opened her mouth. "Gulu gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp gulp." ”
Anlin was confused at this moment, and a terrible conjecture appeared in his mind.
"Sister Fairy, you can't speak Mandarin, " she said. "Anlin's eyes were a little moist."
"Gollum, " he said. "The beautiful woman put her hands on her hips and was a little angry.
It's over, the language barrier.
What the fuck is she talking about? I don't understand at all..
Nani. Finally, Anlin cried.
"Roar." ”
"Roar." ”
"Roar." ”
On one platform, hundreds of people screamed and cheered, surrounded by dozens of cars, most of them supercars.
The most eye-catching place is the two cars that are about to start running.
One is the most expensive bright red Ferrari 488, worth more than four million yuan, and the one next to it is the cheapest Ford Mustang, worth half a million yuan. The two cars together form a sharp contrast.
This was a showdown between Liu Feng, a newly promoted young man in Shangjing, and Zhang Han, one of the top four young men, and Zhang Han.
Beside the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han leaned against the car door silently. His clothes were sloppy and his hair was very long. When he bowed his head, his bangs covered his eyes. People could not see his closed eyes. From the lower half of his leaked knife-carved cheeks, he could vaguely see the unique handsomeness of Zhang Dashao back then, but now his temperament has become full of decadence.
And Liu Feng, in the crowd on the right, was like the stars holding the moon. His expression seemed to say that the world was under his feet.
"Let's go and see Zhang Dashao, who used to be high above, right? " ”
Liu Feng waved his hand and led the way with a sneer at the corner of his mouth.
"Zhang Dashao and Shao." ”
"Sleeping? Zhang Dashao, who used to be arrogant, is now down and out like this. Tsk tsk, it's time to start the game, why pretend to be indifferent? ”
"He looks like a poor beggar to me now. I think he is a poor beggar. ”
"No, I don't think he's even as good as a beggar. Maybe he lives on pig food. ”
On the side of the Ford Mustang stood a fat bespectacled man with a little girl of three or four years old beside his leg.
The little girl was long and pink, wearing a white dress, and her delicate little face was like a cute princess in a fairy tale. Except for her messy hair, everything else was perfect, but at this time, the little girl's big clear eyes contained tears of grievance. Listening to everyone's scolding of Zhang Han, she seemed to be about to cry. She seemed to be about to cry.
If you put it in normal times, it is estimated that the cute appearance of the little girl will attract a lot of attention, but now, this is Liu Feng a person's performance time.
A burst of ridicule and abuse finally made Zhang Han have a reaction.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes, there was a blankness in his eyes. When he saw the behavior of the people in front of him, his eyes were full of contempt for the world.
"You and other ants also dare to bark in front of me." ”
Such an inexplicable sentence suddenly burst out of Zhang Han's mouth.
The audience was silent, but the next moment, there was a burst of ironic laughter.
"Zhang Han, I think you are crazy, right? ”
"I'm afraid I haven't become a fool. ”
Everyone mocked again, but when Zhang Han saw the picture in front of him, he was stunned.
"Isn't this when I raced with Liu Feng at Wolf Mountain in 2009? ”
"Why am I here? ”
"Am I not crossing the Heavenly Tribulation? ”
"Could it be that? "     I’ m back in town. ”
"I was reborn by the Heavenly Tribulation's Nine Heavenly Thunder. "Zhang Han's eyes flashed a tremor."
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight major families in Beijing. Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at that time, so Zhang Hantian was not afraid of anything. However, when his family was traveling by plane, they were hit by a plane halfway through, and their parents and sister were killed. Zhang Ming, the second uncle, was the head of the family, but he could not stop the loneliness of the Zhang family, but he could not stop the loneliness of the Zhang family.
Zhang Han was hit hard at that time, thinking that his family was murdered, and began to privately investigate Zhang Ming, who had always hated his father, but was discovered by him. In addition, Zhang Han had offended many people before, and was eventually driven out of the Zhang family.
It has been five years now, Zhang Han refused to leave, has been trying to find out the matter, the days are very hard but also always insist, until this Wolf Walking Mountain incident, until the Wolf Walking Mountain incident.
I remember when I was racing on this Wolf Mountain, I was seriously injured in an accident and lost my arms. After struggling for five years, I finally jumped off a cliff and survived. I didn't expect to accidentally enter the cultivation world. When he began to come into contact with Immortal Cultivation, Zhang Han awakened his innate supernatural power - Wen Bao Nose, and his nose could smell the breath of treasures within a certain range.
With this divine power, in 500 years, Zhang Han stubbornly piled up his cultivation with various treasures to the extreme.
"Why not five years ago ah! ”
Zhang Han's expression raised a trace of loneliness.
Not being filial piety has always been the biggest regret in Zhang Han's heart. Before his relatives left, he was young and frivolous and ignorant, which caused a lot of trouble to his father and said a lot of words that made his mother sad. No matter how regretful he was, he could not recover it.
Filial piety comes first. Although Zhang Han was rebellious at the beginning, his love for his parents in his heart was no less than that of others.
The tree wants to be quiet but the wind does not stop, the son wants to raise but does not wait for relatives to wait.
"Zhang Han." ”
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's contemplation. He looked up and saw Liu Feng looking at him coldly.
"You drove me out of the capital five years ago."
Today, five years later, my Los Angeles car king Liu Feng has made a strong comeback, but you, Zhang Han, are not as good as pigs and dogs. Remember, today I Liu Feng will let you Zhang Han sideways out of the capital. ”
"Oh, so good." "Zhang Han refused in surprise." "Then I won't compare. ”
"Zhang Han." ”
Liu Feng shook the keys of the Ferrari in his hand and said goodbye. "As long as you win me, this car is yours." ""Then my hospitality will be hard to refuse." ”
Zhang Hanmei said with an open smile.
"Hehe, you know." ”
Liu Feng sneered and raised his hand to command the people in his body. "Put up the screen." ”
The words fell. Behind the crowd, several TV screens were set up. At the same time, remote-controlled planes were raised all over Wolverine Mountain. Opening the screens, the cameras on the remote-controlled planes were transmitted back one by one, reflecting the entire track of Wolverine Mountain.
"Get ready to start." ”
Liu Feng nodded to the fat man with glasses on the back of the Ford Mustang and sat in the Ferrari.
“爹 哋( Daddy), Come on( 加油), Beat the bad guys.”
"How can a cute little girl call someone her father casually? " ”
Zhang Han shook his head in amusement.
"Brother Han, you can definitely win." ”
The fat man clenched his fist at Zhang Han and made a look of encouragement.
May I borrow your auspicious words? Your car will bring me good luck. ”
Zhang Han glanced at him indifferently and sat sideways in the Mustang.
"get ready." ”
The engines of both cars roared angrily at the same time.
Inside the Ferrari, Liu Feng hung a smug smile on the corner of his mouth.
The fat man at the back let out a meaningful smile.
The lovely princess at his feet was full of fear and worry. Her eyes were filled with tears. Chu Chu was pitiful.
Zhang Han in the Mustang carriage had a sneer on his lips at the corners of his mouth.
"Colluding to hurt me. ”
"Unfortunately, I'm not who I was back then, " he said. "Even if there is no cultivation now, how can the ants and other ants be able to provoke? " " ”
Chapter 1
Rust Lake.
Federal No. 23 Special Waste Disposal Site.
It is also known as the "Magic Tomb".
With the continuous development of cultivation civilization, magic weapons that used to be high above and driven only by cultivators have entered thousands of households and become an essential tool for ordinary people to travel, study and work at home.
While bringing convenience to life, it also produces a large number of scrapped magic weapons and metal waste.
Most of these garbage magic weapons have a lot of residual spiritual power, which is easy to cause radiation pollution. The talisman formations used to build the magic weapons are extremely unstable, and there is even a risk of explosion. If left unchecked, it will cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the Federation, a number of "special waste disposal sites" are always set up to deal with scrapped magic weapons.
The 23rd special waste disposal site is located in the southern suburb of "Fugo City", an important training town in the Federation.
Under the dim yellow sky, a swamp polluted into purple gave off a strong stench. The peaks composed of metal fragments were like hundreds of dinosaurs showing their backs from the swamp. The peaks were filled with fragmented flying swords. Next to the flying swords sat rusty crystal puppets. The hollow eye sockets had already extinguished the spiritual fire. Only the small insects that fed on the spiritual energy were left to lean out of their heads. Look carefully at this dangerous "magic weapon cemetery".
"Boom." ”
Countless metal components, such as Tiannu scattered flowers, scattered and splashed in all directions, and triggered a series of collapses of several surrounding garbage mountains, raising smoke and dust in the sky, like demons dancing, covering the entire sky and space.
This seems to be a forbidden area for life, and only insignificant cockroaches and worms regard it as a paradise.
Li Yao crouched behind a mountain of garbage and licked his cracked lips. His khaki trench coat was covered with dust, which made him blend in with the environment.
Glancing at the rising explosion cloud not far away, the teenager's clear eyes did not reveal any emotion, and the waves were not interesting.
It was only when dirt and metal fragments splashed onto the mountain of garbage where he was hiding that he shrank slightly into the depths of the garbage heap and put on goggles big enough to cover half of his face.
"Coming." ”
At 3:52:38 pm, the daily garbage dumping time is also a carnival time for "garbage bugs" like Li Yao.
The Lingzi watch worn on his left wrist was a hunting model launched by the cultivation sect "Flying Spirit Sect" three years ago. It took him two months to repair it after he picked it up in the garbage mountain.
In addition to timing, it also has a very powerful function, which can record vibrations of special frequencies and notify the owner when a specific vibration is heard nearby.
This function was originally used to remind hunters that there may be powerful monsters nearby.
After Li Yao's modification, it became a reminder to him that the garbage ship was about to appear.
Moments later, with an insignificant hum, more than a dozen black spots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time, the smoke and dust that covered the sky and the sun from the explosion had not yet dissipated, and more than a dozen small black spots were mixed among them, and it was impossible to distinguish them clearly.
Li Yao shrugged the tip of his nose and touched a rune on the side of the goggle with his fingers. "Shua, " the surface of the goggle was red with blood.
Under the scanning of the red light, the garbage ship hidden behind the smoke and dust was outlined as a round figure, clearly and completely.
The hunting function of the Lingzi watch also firmly locks in the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
"Junk boat 1327, that's you." ”
From birth to the age of ten, Li Yao stayed in the tomb of the magic weapon for ten years, knowing every inch of land and every garbage ship in the sky. This "1327 garbage ship" was specially responsible for collecting garbage from the "Upper East Side" of Fugo City.
The Upper East Side is the most luxurious and wealthy area in the city, where many practitioners live, and their discarded magic weapons are also the most valuable and valuable.
Many magic weapons are even intact, just because they are slightly outdated or have launched a new generation of products, they are discarded by practitioners and rich people indifferently.
To Li Yao, this is not a garbage ship, it is simply a treasure ship full of gold mines.
"Whoosh." ”
Li Yao's feet, like bullets, galloped between the garbage mountains, rushed to the smoke, rushed to the "garbage ship No. 1327", and rushed to the "garbage ship No. 1327".
Surrounded by crumbling garbage mountains and at the foot of the poisonous swamp with bubbling bubbles, Li Yao is like the most dexterous monkey in the mountains and forests. From time to time, he borrows his strength from a prominent part of the garbage mountain. Every time he pedals, he can pop up dozens of meters away. The action moves the clouds and flows, which is pleasing to the eye.
"Li Yao, you bastard, grab food with me again." ”
At this moment, more than a dozen figures sprang out from behind several garbage mountains, similar to Li Yao's costume, but he did not wear his advanced blood-red goggles and spirit watch.
These people were all clutching shovels and iron bars in their hands, and they were coming in ferociously.
Like Li Yao, they are all garbage bugs who rely on the "No. 23 Special Garbage Disposal Plant" to make a living.
Where there is interest, there is struggle. Shiploads of abandoned magic weapons may be just garbage for high-ranking cultivators, but for these poor people at the bottom, they are the hope of survival. Li Yao is the best garbage bug in the tomb of magic weapons. Naturally, it is also a thorn in the side of most garbage bugs. The thorn in the flesh is a thorn in the flesh.
Li Yao didn't care, he smiled, his waist suddenly exerted force, his body twisted strangely, turned ninety degrees without warning, dodged a fat boy with angry eyebrows in front of him, and took advantage of the momentum to step on the fat face hard. Taking advantage of this foot, the whole person swept out another thirty or forty meters.
"Fat Dragon, everyone comes out to eat mixed meals. It's faster than anyone else. You should lose weight. ”
A huge red mark on the obese teenager's face, his nose almost sinking into the fat, screaming angrily, commanding his men to chase after him, and the group quickly entered the smoke and dust area.
There has just been an explosion here, extremely unstable, dozens of garbage mountains will collapse at any time, even the vicious fat dragon and a group of teenagers can not help but slow down when they enter this place, watching Li Yao gallop like lightning.
The fat dragon couldn't help but spat.
Before the words fell, another explosion occurred inside a garbage mountain not far from Li Yao, and tens of thousands of tons of metal components and broken magic weapons rushed down like a flash flood.
"So clever." ”
But a scream came from the smoke. "Xiao Hei, help." ”
A black light deeper than the night sky shot out, in the metal flood "dripping" turned around, and then rushed into the air, but it was a rusty, sword blade gap, black flying sword, this flying sword has a huge handguard like black wings, Li Yao is like a drowning man grasping at the straw, very awkwardly lie on the flying sword, black light around the body, rushed to the sky, rushed to the sky, this flying sword has a huge handguard like black wings, Li Yao is like a drowning man grasping at the straw, very awkwardly lie on the flying sword, around the black light, rushed to the sky, rushed to the sky.
In the sky, more than a dozen garbage ships have revealed their huge shapes. Each garbage ship is hundreds of meters long. Its round shape is like the legendary turtle supporting the earth. The "turtle shell" is densely engraved with tens of thousands of runes, flashing with bright lights and colorful colors, helping these big guys weighing tens of thousands of tons resist the attack of gravity.
"Crash." ”
The hatches on the belly of the "big turtles" opened, pouring out an overwhelming amount of metal components and broken magic weapons, and smashed into the ground fiercely.
For a time, the entire spiritual power between heaven and earth was stirred up crazily, setting off a stormy wave.
Even the garbage boats weighing tens of thousands of tons swayed left and right in the wave of spiritual power, bumping violently, and had to desperately separate to reduce interference.
Feilong and others dare not approach easily, lest they be affected.
Li Yao still rode a black flying sword and rushed left and right in the wave of spiritual power. Although he looked extremely embarrassed, he was as flexible as a loach.
Of course, he did not dare to confront the stormy waves head-on, but with more than ten years of survival experience, he tried to find a relatively calm and safe area between the spiritual tides, just to get as close as possible to the landing point of the garbage magic weapon.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage boat roared like a giant beast, turned around, and returned lazily. The smoke and dust gradually dissipated.
Fat Dragon finally climbed into the center of the garbage dumping, and saw Li Yao sitting comfortably on a brand-new garbage mountain, looking at him with a smile.
"Damn it. ”
Fat Dragon's face was shaking, but his heart was quite tangled.
Li Yao's choice of this garbage mountain is quite ingenious. It is not the largest garbage mountain, nor does it look like the one with the most abundant materials.
There are also dozens of garbage mountains scattered around, containing priceless garbage magic weapons.
If you continue to entangle with Li Yao here, maybe you will be benefited by other garbage bugs.
Other garbage bugs have appeared vaguely around, and cheers have been heard on many garbage mountains. It is because someone has found something valuable.
Feilong heard that Li Yao, this brat, was still a student of the famous "Second High School Affiliated to Chixiao School" in Fuge City.
The Scarlet Firmament Faction was a well-known sect in the southern part of the Federation. It was powerful and had many experts.
Although Li Yao may not have learned any true biography, he is not something that can be dealt with with three punches and two feet. Otherwise, he would not have been alone in the tomb of the magic weapon for more than ten years, still alive and kicking, and even earned the nickname "vulture" from the nickname "vulture".
But just like that, where did his face go?
His nose is still embedded in the flesh. The heart is tangled, a strong wind swept by, fat dragon subconsciously reached out to copy, start cold, but it is a fist-sized scrapped crystal brain, but a scrapped crystal brain.
Li Yao smiled and squinted. "Fat Dragon, everyone is out to make a living. Isn't it that they robbed you of a'Starlight 'crystal brain last time, and didn't kill your father. As for how immortal you are? Here, I just found a 'Snapdragon 17' crystal brain refined by 'Qinglongmen'. It is the most advanced model and can calculate more than 5, 000 thoughts per second. Although it is burnt out, I estimate it can also be sold for three or four thousand yuan. Just as I honor you, Big Brother Fat Dragon, how can we even do from now on? ”
"You... Fat Dragon didn't expect Li Yao to come out like this. He was stunned and scratched the fat on his face in disbelief.
"Hey, look over there, 'Wolf Gang' people are coming soon, they are not like me, a lone traveler, will definitely eat up dozens of garbage mountains, even a screw will not leave you." You won't leave a screw behind. "Li Yao pointed to the west, pointing to the west."
"Good boy, you have a set." Let’ s go, sweep the goods. ”
A group of garbage bugs scattered in all directions, rushing towards the garbage mountains in all directions.
Li Yao let out a long sigh of relief, sat down in the garbage dump, beads of sweat rolling down his forehead, and a smiling face instantly cried.
"Fatty, the ‘ Snapdragon‘ -class crystal brain I found was cheap for nothing. ”
Can you wait? Is my 'vulture Li Yao' item so easy to take?
One day I want you to eat my spit out to me, take my back to me, plus interest, according to usury, let you know why everyone calls me ‘ a vulture who wants money but not life’ . ”
"No, we must speed up. The ‘ Wolves' are more unreasonable than the Fat Dragon, but they are more unreasonable than the Fat Dragon. ”
"Mom, how many times have I told you that I'm going to save people, not commit suicide, " Mom. ”
"Don't lie to mom. You don't even know how to shave a dog. You still save people. Besides, there was no one in the river at all. ”
Wang Yao was speechless. Today, when he came down from the mountain and saw someone falling into the river by the village, he hurriedly jumped down to save people. After jumping down, he remembered that he didn't know how to water at all. More ironically, the person who fell into the water was not a person, but an inflatable doll. It was very realistic.
"There are actually people in the village who are so fashionable to use this thing."  ”
This was his last thought before he lost consciousness. When he woke up again, he was lying on his Kang next to his parents, frowning and tightening his brows.
Less than a day later, the whole village knew that the stupid contracted the mountain, planting herbs college students can not think, jump the river to commit suicide. "Today's children, ah, have not experienced setbacks, can not stand the blow, can not stand the blow." ”
"That child probably went to school. Nowadays, famous college students still go home to farm. ”
"That's right. ”
"We don't plant this medicine anymore." ”
The father, who had been squatting on the side smoking a cigarette bag, popped out this sentence angrily. The villagers have a good face. When Lao Wang heard this rumor, he was in a panic. Moreover, if he planted it again, it would be fine to lose some money. Maybe even his son would lose some money.
"That's right, listen to mom this time, stop planting herbs, and go to the city another day to ask your sister to help find a decent job for you. Your third uncle Changmao's child just graduated from an unknown school and found a job in the city. Now they all bought a house there and bought a house there. Now they bought a house there and bought a house there. "Wang Yao's mother also helped out on the side."
After hearing this, Wang Yao stopped arguing with his parents and had to nod in agreement.
He was originally a student who graduated from a famous university. After graduation, he returned to the mountain village with enthusiasm and started his own business. He contracted a barren mountain in the village. He wanted to plant herbs and get rich at home. As a result, when he really started to do it, he realized that the planting of herbs was far from as simple as he thought. It was impossible to rely solely on enthusiasm, and many things were not available in books, so he could only rely on practice and experience.
In the first year, the herbs he planted suffered from insect disease and lost all their money. In the second year, the herbs bloomed and grew leaves but did not grow roots. This is the third year.
But after he felt more comfortable, he went to Nanshan Mountain again. This is a barren mountain. Maybe because of the soil quality, there are not many crops, but there are more than a dozen large chestnut trees and jujube trees. There is a large gentle slope on the mountain, where there are a few acres of medicinal fields that he painstakingly cultivated. For this reason, he also paid someone to build a hut on the mountain, connected with electricity, and specially took care of these acres of medicinal fields. Despite ups and downs, in spring, summer, autumn and winter, he devoted three years of painstaking efforts. He really couldn't bear to give up. He really couldn't bear to give up when he said he wanted to give up. He really couldn't bear to build a hut on the mountain, connected with electricity, and specially took
Looking at the herbs that were growing well, he reached out and touched them.
Stop trying for a year.
"The herb is detected, the trigger condition is met, and whether the system is activated or not is activated." ”
A cold mechanical voice suddenly sounded.
"What sound, who?  ”
All around, there are mountains, water and woods, but no one.
"Hiss, could it be that he's hallucinating. ”
"Activate the system." ”
The sound of the machine sounded again, and it seemed to be close at hand.
"There is a ghost." ”
Wang Yao was full of excitement.
Pharmacist system.
As soon as he said these words, a light curtain appeared in front of him, like a character panel in Wang Youzhong's eyes.
Hallucinations, must be hallucinations.
He shook his head vigorously, and the light curtain that appeared out of thin air disappeared without seeing it.
Woof woof woof, just at this moment, a local dog rushed down from the mountain and came to him, sticking out its tongue and wagging its tail, looking very happy.
Three delicacies, where have you been? ”
This is Wang Yao's local dog, who has accompanied him on this mountain for three years. One person and one dog entered the hut on the mountain. Wang Yao went to bed and felt a little dizzy.
"What was that thing just now? ”
He read that Tong's name again, and as a result, the light curtain appeared again, as if it were a projection.
"here we go again." ”
After several experiments, Wang Yao determined that this thing was not an illusion, but something that was real and could not be explained by science. There are character attributes, skills, and packages, just like online games.
Career level. Rookie ( In fact, you are not even a bird, at most an egg.
Physique 1, strength 0. 9. Spirit 0. 85, 0 Agility. 9, will 1 1. The average level of a normal adult male is 1 () .
And dat is da storee of me bein' gud gurl. He was completely blindfolded.
Great, he's growing herbs right now, and that's what's missing is this one. Wang Yao, who had regained his composure, jumped up excitedly and startled the "three delicacies" beside him.
There's also a skill panel for that work. Wang Yao thought about it but didn't look at it.
"Why can't I open it? "He asked subconsciously, " he asked.
"Herbs can't be planted well. If you want to do something else, shovel shit. Let's go and shovel shit. ”
As if hearing his question, such a line of words popped up on the panel.
Like shit, what the fuck is going on? Who designed it, come out, I promise I won’ t kill you. "what is that? " ”
Wang You clicked in the package column and found a sign like a kettle.
The ancient spring pot contains ancient spring water, one bucket a day, and one bucket a day.
How do you use it? Can you reach out and take it?
As soon as Wang Yao thought about it, there was one more thing in his hand. It was a wooden kettle. It was antique. Holding it in his hand, it still had some weight. With a gentle shake, there was water in it.
"There's really water." Ancient spring water. ”
He found a bucket from the room and poured out the water from the kettle. It was a small pot, but the water kept coming out. It was not until the whole bucket was filled that it stopped coming out.
Amazing.
Wang Yao stared blankly at the water in the bucket. It was very clean and pure. He reached out and took a bite and sent it into his mouth. It was very sweet and sweet.
Good drink.
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank it. He drank three bowls before stopping. After drinking the water, he felt much more comfortable. The fatigue on his body was eliminated.
Woof woof woof, the three freshmen on the side circled around the bucket.
"Come on, have a drink too." ”
Wang Yao also put a bowl in the basin where he drank water. The dog quickly drank up, then barked again, wagging its tail. Obviously, this was not enough to drink.
"Okay, let you drink enough." ”
This person and dog drank half a bucket of water. If they hadn't panicked, they would have drunk up the bucket of water.
Wang Yao had never drunk such sweet water in his life.
Chapter 1 I Want to Lose Weight.
On a hot summer day, the Chiyun Rainforest, located in the eastern part of the Federation, is filled with clouds and mist, like a layer of gauze. The towering ancient trees crisscross each other. In the luxuriant crown of the trees, sometimes a few birds soar into the air, hissing and soaring in the sky between the sky.
In the sky, the sun, which seems to exist forever, is no longer what people remember. Instead, many years ago, it was pierced directly by an indescribable bronze ancient sword, revealing a small half of the sword tip.
This ancient sword seems to have experienced thousands of years, from the starry sky, revealing endless vicissitudes of life, but also a strong pressure, forming a halo, enveloping the sky, as if it can suppress the earth, let all living beings worship.
From a distance, this scene of Jianyang Rainforest looks like a picture scroll. It was not until the buzzing sound came from the distance that it was broken. A big red hot air balloon boat is slowly flying over the rainforest.
The cabin of the hot air balloon was large enough to accommodate hundreds of people. Many young men and women could be seen on the deck in groups, sometimes with laughter and laughter.
They are students from Phoenix City who have been admitted to one of the four major federal monasteries, the ethereal monastery. They are taking this airship belonging to the ethereal monastery and crossing thousands of miles to study at the ethereal monastery.
Perhaps it is the expectation of studying, the journey is not boring for these young men and women, between men and women, there are some hazy attraction, making this journey of ten thousand miles, do not have some fun, do not have some fun.
Because of the long distance, the airship is equipped with restaurants, spiritual rooms, medical rooms and other areas.
At this moment, there were many students in the airship's restaurant, and at one of the tables sat a little fat man with a belly.
This little fat man was about seventeen or eighteen years old, dressed in a wide blue robe, and his round face was barely beautiful. He was patting his stomach and making a popping sound while looking at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him regretfully.
"This meal will add another three pounds. Why can't I hold back? If I want to become the president of the Federation, I can't die young. ”
When the little fat man was sad and remorseful, he burped and burped. This little fat man is called Wang Baole, and he is also a student who was admitted to the ethereal Taoist Academy this time. His dream in this life is to become an official and become the president of the Federation as his lifelong pursuit. The reason why he has such a great ideal is inseparable from his childhood experience.
In his memory, when he was young, his father often patted his head earnestly and sighed with emotion.
"Bao Le, it's better to be an official. You have to remember that although money can solve everything, you will still be bullied. If you want not to be bullied, you can only be an official and become a superior person. ”
At the beginning, Wang Baole did not understand, until he was in primary school, because he did not hand in his homework on time, he was scolded by the monitor, after he sent two pieces of candy, and then he was named by the monitor, reported to the teacher, all this, in his young mind, left an indelible mark, left an indelible mark, in the soul of his young heart, left an indelible mark, in the soul of his young heart, left an indelible mark.
So from that moment on, he wanted to be a monitor, not to bully others, but to avoid being bullied by others.
But as he grew up, he found that there were still many people who could bully the monitor, so he felt that becoming the biggest official, that is, the president of the Federation, really no one dared to bully himself. The reason why he sharpened his head and was admitted to the Ethereal Dao Academy is also because all the high-ranking officials of the Federation graduated from the four major Dao academies.
It's just that his life is not very good, and the family blood is very strange. He still remembers that night a year ago, his emaciated father was in the family ancestral hall and gave him a look at the genealogy.
That was the first time Wang Baole saw the genealogy. He clearly saw that all the ancestors from generation to generation, who weighed more than 200 pounds, all died young and could not live to 35.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream... Before he could become the president of the Federation, he was reunited with those fat grandfathers and reunited with them.
The following year, for him, weight loss has risen to a certain height, but even after the Federation entered the Era of Spirituality, with the richness of aura, with the revival of ancient martial arts, there are various ways to lose weight, but Wang Baole tried almost all, and there is still a steady progress in weight.
The emergence of memories made Wang Baole grit his teeth and make up his mind to lose weight tomorrow.
After making such a decision, Wang Baole immediately felt a lot less pressure. While picking his teeth, he hummed a little song and looked up at the blue sky outside the window in the distance. His mind also began to come alive.
"I don't know if he likes the gift for Dr. Lu, but it's an antique that I brought out from home. That old guy should like it." ”
Wang Baole comforted himself, thinking that as long as he got close to Dr. Lu, he would have a small backer in the Taoist temple in the future, as well as a small backer.
"Teacher's power is limited, but I will also give some gifts in the future, but Dr. Lu is old and must have a lot of connections. I should have taken the right step. ”
Thinking of this, Wang Baole was so happy that he only felt that he was one step closer to the position of federal president.
He is very confident that he can become the president of the Federation. This confidence mainly comes from all the autobiographies of high-ranking officials that he has studied since childhood, and even summed up a few tricks to become an official killer.
At this moment, he was physically and mentally happy. Looking at the blue sky outside the window, Wang Baole felt particularly beautiful.
But soon, his eyes suddenly widened and he noticed that in the distant sky, there was a black cloud condensation, diffuse as if to cover the sky, and there was thunder and lightning inside it, flashing a series of electric lights, slowly approaching. This scene also attracted the attention of many students, and there were exclamations of surprise.
Wang Baole was also taken aback. After the Federation stepped into the Spirit Era, the emergence of Reiki led to a lot of amazing weather between heaven and earth. It was difficult for flying objects to be safe, which led to the birth of the hot air balloon airship driven by spirit stones.
With the constant exclamation, the rumbling thunder suddenly came, the loud noise shocked the sky, you can see the distant thunder magnetic black cloud grows rapidly, the lightning has spread, like a big black net, flashing in the sky, dazzling and shocking, let a person's heartbeat can't help but speed up, the original moving airship, at the moment also slowly slowed down slowly, at the moment, but also slowly slowed down slowly.
Just when everyone was restless, the door of the restaurant was pushed open, as if the wind was howling, and an old man in a white Taoist robe walked in. The old man's face was wrinkled, but his face was righteous. Especially his eyes were shining brightly, and his body was dispersed in all directions. As soon as he arrived, his majestic voice spread throughout the restaurant.
"Everyone, report to the Spirit Cultivation Room immediately, put on your Magnet Spirit Clothes, and after half a stick of incense, we will enter the Thunder Magnetic Zone." ”
As soon as the words came out, all the students in the restaurant were in awe and quickly stood up.
Wang Baole's eyes lit up. The old man in front of him was Dr. Lu, who had given him gifts before. At this moment, looking at the other party's dragon striding like a tiger, Wang Baole felt more and more that his previous investment was correct. He secretly said that this old guy must be very human, and he is even better at chess. He is a good chess player.
When he was pleased with himself, the old doctor glanced and saw Wang Baole. He snorted and walked over. He took out half a black mask from his arms and threw it on Wang Baole.
"At a young age, don't put your mind on some messy places. You haven't even entered the monastery yet. You have learned to give gifts. The old man is also a well-informed person. You should keep this mask yourself. "The old doctor looked solemn, with a clean and upright appearance, as if he hated iron and rebuked in general, as if he hated it.
Wang Baole took the mask and thumped in his heart. He saw that the old doctor was angry and a little anxious. He was about to explain, but he suddenly thought of the killer tactics he summarized in the autobiographies of those high-ranking officials. One of them was in front of his superiors. Brazenly admit mistakes for the first time, often can make big things smaller.
So he took a deep breath, quickly put on a repentant look, and admitted his mistake.
"The teacher was right, I was wrong." ”
The old doctor was a little surprised. The words he was going to reprimand were so readily acknowledged by the other party that he couldn't continue.
Seeing the old doctor's expression, Wang Baole breathed a sigh of relief and some complacency, secretly saying that this autobiography of a high-ranking official is indeed useful.
The old doctor snorted, raised his head and swept all the students in the entire restaurant, pointing to the crowd with his right hand.
"And you, you are all future students of my ethereal Taoist Academy. Look at what you look like these days. You must always remember that our martial artists should first stand up, then speak, and then act. ”
The old doctor was deeply disgusted, and these words echoed in the restaurant, making everyone bow their heads and feel a little ashamed when they heard it, while Wang Baole's eyes suddenly lit up, feeling that it was time to express himself.
So he quickly took out a small book from his arms and recorded it on it. From time to time, he looked up at the old doctor, showing a listening expression, and sometimes nodded seriously, as if he wanted to remember every word the other party said. This trick is also the killer trick he summed up in the autobiography of a high-ranking official.
When other students saw this scene, they looked at Wang Baole like a god.
After seeing it, the old doctor also stayed for a moment. An unprecedented strange feeling could not help but come to his mind. It was really the first time he had met such a strange person. After a few more glances, he gradually sneered, but gradually sneered.
"Little guy, my flattery is not so easy to shoot, you have to thank this thunderstorm, otherwise, I can train for three days and three nights in one breath, I see if you can write it all down in a small book. " ”
As soon as the old doctor's words came out, the momentum was suddenly different. A strong aura emanated from him, as if it turned into coercion, enveloping the entire restaurant. All the students were stunned. They only felt that this battle was still a foot taller than the old doctor.
Wang Baole blinked, touched the recording jade slip in his pocket, weighed it for a long time, and looked at the approaching thunder magnetic storm, or gave up the idea of taking it out. He felt that in front of his boss, he was not ashamed to be cowardly.
Seeing everyone's expressions, the old doctor was proud and said a few words impassionedly.
"Remember, you should put your mind on cultivation. In the future, you should not be greedy or unrighteous, and you should not always think about finding a female companion. You should know that there is a knife on the head of the color word. These days, you are so rude. ”
At this point, suddenly, a delicate voice floated out from the old doctor's sound transmission bracelet.
"Doctor Grandpa, where are you? They don't know how to wear this magnetic suit. Come and help me quickly. ”
This voice was charming. The old doctor listened, shook his body involuntarily, barely coughing, and stared at everyone seriously. Only then did he turn around and leave anxiously. At the same time, he spoke excitedly at the opening of the spiritual bracelet. "Oh, come here, baby, don't worry, I will come and help you this time." ”
The reversal of this scene was too fast and the contrast was too great. Everyone was dumbfounded. Even Wang Baole was stunned for a moment. After a long time, he took a deep breath. With everyone's uncontrollable uproar, Wang Baole gritted his teeth and cursed a few words.
"This old pervert, what he said before is bullshit." There are only so many female students, we are not enough points, he is so old, but also to compete with us for resources, not by virtue of the size of an official or an official. ”
The more Wang Baole thought about it, the angrier he became. As he discussed with his classmates around him, he became more determined in his heart to his dream of becoming an official.
As the sound of the alarm intensified, everyone ended their discussion and went to the spiritual room one by one angrily.
The spiritual room is located in the core area of the airship. As the name suggests, it is a place for these students to practice. At the same time, it is also the most tightly protected place for the airship in the process of passing through the special area.
At this moment, in this spiritual cultivation room, as everyone gathered, under the arrangement of the teacher accompanying the ship from the ethereal Taoist Academy, everyone sat in several rows and put on the special magnetic spiritual clothing for airships issued by the ethereal Taoist Academy.
Just after putting on the magnetic spirit suit, Wang Baole was immersed in his resentment against Dr. Lu. He looked up at random and looked around. His already depressed mood was suddenly worse because of a distant glance. He unconsciously frowned, showing a look of disgust. He showed a look of disgust.
Where he looked, sat a girl with slender legs, very attractive, but now she was also frowning, showing a look of disgust. Obviously, in their mutual eyes, the other party was familiar and extremely disgusted.
"Obscure." ”
Both of them muttered in their hearts, quickly avoiding their eyes, as if even looking at each other, they felt hot eyes.
"You can meet this tablet Du Min anywhere. I'm so bored to death." "What's the big deal? Isn't it just a broken squad leader? When I get to the Taoist Academy, with my official killer's mace, I can also mix a half-job. ”
Soon, after everyone was dressed and the teachers accompanying the ship checked one by one, they explained some precautions and sternly warned everyone that after the airship entered the thunder magnetic zone, there was danger, and there must be a life-and-death crisis.
After seeing everyone's expressions change, these teachers with the ship left in awe. The door of the spiritual room was also sealed directly, and the lights gradually dimmed.
At this moment in the spiritual cultivation room, although there is still a low voice conversation, but as time passes, the tension becomes more and more intense, and gradually no one speaks, falling into complete silence.
In the silence that seemed to hear his heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still in anger, could not help but get nervous. Until after half a stick of incense, the whole airship shook violently and entered the thunder magnetic area.
Seen from the outside, the entire thunder magnetic black cloud is majestic and incomparable, like a big mouth. Compared with it, it is a very small hot air balloon airship, which swallows it directly.
This kind of weather, seems to contain the power of destruction, can sweep everything, perhaps only in the sky, that round of shocking sword sun, can ignore all, as if looking down on the world thirty-seven years is not enough, and it will take longer.
This year is the thirty-seventh year of Lingyuan.
In 3029 AD, the rapid development of earth science and technology, no national boundaries, the realization of the unification of the earth, into the federal era, it is also at this time, a big sword flying from the stars, through the sun, the world sensation, the world sensation.
The hilt of this great sword, perhaps because it was originally broken, broke a large number of fragments in this violent vibration, scattered all over the starry sky, some of which fell all over the earth.
With the arrival of the bronze sword and the falling of fragments, a seemingly endless new energy source appeared on the earth, which seemed to permeate the world, and was later named... Reiki.
Reiki is like air, some places are rich, some places are thin, and because those scattered fragments were obtained by the Federation and various forces, I found various exercises related to cultivation as well as weapon refining, alchemy, and spirit stone refining on it. The words on it are full of ancient meanings, causing people to come into contact with ancient texts and become a trend.
The emergence of Reiki also quickly eliminated the original energy and changed people's lives. It not only formed a spiritual network, but also changed the process of the earth's civilization, enabling the entire earth to open up a cultivation civilization.
Since then, ancient martial arts have risen, the world has undergone great changes, and the era of immortal cultivation for the whole people has begun, thus opening up the era of immortal cultivation for the whole people.
According to history, the Lingyuan Period.
At this moment, in the thunder magnetic black cloud, the slow-moving red hot air balloon airship, with countless lightning bolts around it, constantly bombarded. Fortunately, there is a soft light curtain to diffuse and protect the airship, making the airship extremely stable.
As for the spiritual room in the core area of the cabin, at this moment, all the students, including Wang Baole, had unconsciously fallen asleep, as if there was a strange force guiding them into a dream.
