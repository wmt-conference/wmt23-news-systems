If we find that the contents of this manual page are outdated and causing obvious confusion and complaints, we stop publishing it. There is no alternative to updating the man manual at the same time as updating the Info file, because other maintenance of Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this. The GNU project considers the man manual obsolete and should use its time elsewhere.

DESCRIPTION The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.
The source filename identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the sui generis name controls the default setting.
gcc considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a c-file, and sets up a c-form link.
g++ considers preprocessed files (.i) to be c++ files and sets up c++-style concatenation.
The source file's post-level name indicates the language type and the post-processing.
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.C C++ source programs; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
. CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i Preprocessed c-file; compilation, assembly
.ii Preprocessed c++ files; compile, assembly
.s Assembly language source programs; assembly
Assembly language source programs; preprocessing, assembly
.h preprocessor files; files that do not normally appear on the command line with other postnames are passed to the Linker. Typically these include.
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E option is used (or a compilation error prevents the complete process), linking is always the last step.
During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable filenames (including specified .o H files and .a library files) are passed to the connector options in the order they appear on the command line.
The options must be given separately : de ' is completely different from `-d -r '.
Most ` -=E :and `-W' options have two opposite formats : -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno- name).
Only formats that are not the default option are listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in the sections that follow.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Specify the language of the file to be entered as language (instead of the default choice derived from the filename).
This option is applied to all subsequent input files, until the next `-x' option, .language, is encountered.
Turns off any explicit specification of the language, and therefore processes subsequent files based on the filename descendant RE AS E ` -x' option).
If only part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking) is to be manipulated, the ` -x' option (or Ah after the filename) can be used to tell geo where to start, and the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' options can be used to tell geo where to end. Note that some combinations of options (e.g., `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compiles or assembles the source file, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC labels the file with ` .ec' after the source filename by replacing it with ` .o'. GCC ignores any unrecognized input text after the -ec option -S F anything.
The objective of the document is to provide a clearer picture of the situation in the country.
Stop after compilation, no assembly.
Work with pipes instead of temporary files between different stages of the compilation process, because the assembler of those systems can not read data from pipes, GNU's assembler does not have this problem, the assembler is able to accept the C "dialect": support for ANSI-compliant C programs.
This turns off certain keywords in GNU Cc that are not ANSI Cc-compatible features, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, which are welcome and rarely used, and the main function, which returns an int value, even though it is disabled for use in all the standard libraries available in the hosted environment. Typical examples are almost all programs except the kernel. The corresponding f£reestanding environment has no standard libraries, and the entry point to a program is not necessarily main, the most obvious example being the operating system kernel. (For more information, see the recent information on the gcc website).
Function declarations without arguments, e.g. `int foo ();', are handled in the C style - i.e. without specifying the number or type of arguments. (C++ only) .
Normally, such a function foo means that the argument is empty in C++.
The list of sections from which to delete attempts to support some aspects of the traditional C compiler.
See the NU c manual for details, which we've removed so that people won't HERI when the content becomes obsolete.
Except for one thing: for c++ programs (not C), the ` -traditional' option has the added effect of allowing this to be assigned a value.
He has the same effect as the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
In particular, the preprocessor is mentioned above, but not the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows `$' characters in identifiers (C++ only) .
You can specify the `"-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disable the `$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the `$' character by default on some target systems, but not all.)
-fenum-int-equiv Allows implicit conversion of ant types to enumeration types (MEF c++) .
Normally GNU C++ allows conversions from enum to int, but not vice versa.
-fexternal--templates Produces smaller code for template declarations (c++ only) by generating a copy of each template function only in the place where they are defined.
To use this option successfully, you must mark `#pragma implementatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.
When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates ', the template instantiation is all external. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be accomplished with a typedef, which references each instance needed.
In contrast, if compiled with the default option ` -fno-exteznal-templates', all template instances are explicitly built-in.
All member functions (except constructors and the mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of their class.
This does not mean that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler is able to determine that a virtual function can be called directly; then it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch Allows type mismatches between the second and third arguments of a conditional expression.
The value of such an expression is Void.-fthis--is-variable allows assignment of a value to this (only for c++).
Merging a user-defined free storage management mechanism into c++ makes the assignable `this' obsolete.
Thus, by default, assigning a value to this inside a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this work with the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char Defines a char as an unsigned type, like an unsigned char.
Each machine has its own default char type. It can be either an unsigned char or a signed char.
Ideally, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz when relying on the signed nature of the data.
But many programs have been written to use just a simple char, and expect it to be signed (or unsigned, depending on the target machine for which the program is written).
This option, and its inverse, makes the program work with the corresponding default values.
The type of a char should always be explicitly defined as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If the ` signed' or `unsigned' modifiers are not explicitly declared, these options are used to define either a signed bitfield or an unsigned bitfield.
By default, bitfields are signed because the basic integer types they inherit from, such as int, are signed; however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bitfields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in a writable segment, and does not treat them as such.
This is for compatibility with some older programs, where changing string constants is a very bad idea, and the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
Impact of New Crown Pneumonia on Drug Markets
The impact could be similar to the economic crisis of 2008
The global epidemic of new coronavirus pneumonia has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has overwhelmed and nearly collapsed health-care services, and the restrictions imposed by Governments have caused serious disruptions in the global economy.
For the drug market, the impact of this epidemic is unclear and difficult to predict, but it has the potential to be far-reaching.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs because restrictions on movement also limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers who are unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and availability may change and the ability of Governments to respond may be hampered.
The transformation brought about by the new Crown Pneumonia is unprecedented, but there are still some lessons to be learned from previous crises.
After the economic crisis of 2008, some drug users began to look for cheaper synthetic substances and the pattern of use shifted to injecting drugs.
At the same time, Governments have cut drug-related budgets.
Interventions such as prevention of drug use and related risk behaviours and drug treatment services may be hit hard if Governments respond to the current economic downturn in the same way.
In addition, interception operations and international cooperation may be prioritized less, making it easier for traffickers to act.
A number of countries where large quantities of drugs are smuggled on commercial flights are expected to be the most directly affected by drug trafficking.
Synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine are carried by couriers in carry-on backpacks or concealed in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. The use of commercial air travel for the supply of drugs may be completely disrupted by the restrictions imposed on passenger air transportation almost everywhere.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, there may be an increase in the use of the dark web and the mailing of goods for trafficking purposes.
In the long run, the recession and related closures may disrupt the drug market.
As a result of rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in a harmful way, develop drug use disorders and turn to illicit drug-related activities, whether production or transportation.
Drug-trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation by providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to swell their ranks.
These shifts are likely to take root quickly and become a new reality for many communities as government response capacity diminishes.
Expansion and Complexity
market growth
Population growth patterns partially explain market expansion
Drug abuse has been on the rise around the world, both in terms of overall figures and as a percentage of the world's population.
In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8 per cent of the global population aged 15-64, while in 2018, there were an estimated 269 million drug users, accounting for 5.3 per cent of that population.
During the past two decades, drug abuse in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This reflects, to some extent, the differences in overall population growth over the period, which varied from 7 per cent in developed countries to 28 per cent in developing countries, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
During the period 2000-2018, the population in this age group in developing countries increased by 16 per cent, while the population in this age group in developed countries decreased by 10 per cent.
1 Urbanization as a driver of current and future drug markets
In both developed and developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban areas, with more than half of the world's population now living in urban areas, compared with 34 per cent in 1960.
Urbanization is likely to be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, especially in developing countries where the trend towards urbanization is more pronounced.
Increased wealth is associated with increased drug use, but it is the poorest people who bear the greatest burden of disease and, worldwide, drug use is more prevalent in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are even more strongly associated with wealthier parts of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the wealthier segments of society.
However, the rate of transition to drug use disorders is higher among people of lower socio-economic status.
Data from a small number of countries suggest that there is a link between harmful patterns of drug use and morbidity and low incomes.
These patterns appear to be less common in more affluent segments of society.
The economic constraints caused by the global NCRP crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked in the past to increased drug use, and the epidemic has forced tens of millions of people out of work globally.
CKP may lead to further expansion of the drug market The CKP pandemic may lead to more farmers increasing or engaging in illicit crop cultivation, either because of a reduced capacity of State authorities to control it or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illicit activities in the context of the economic crisis.
Restrictions related to NCRP have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, and trafficking by sea may have increased as a result, with the risk of interception at sea being low and greater than that of smuggling by air or land.
There have been recent reports of cocaine consignments being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of substances not under international control has stabilized, but new and potentially harmful opioids are on the rise and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also increasing rapidly.
The domestic markets of Member States are characterized by approximately 500 new active substances per year.
Most of these are now stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and, to a lesser extent, opioids.
While the overall quantity of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportion has changed.
Opioids accounted for only 2 per cent of the total number of new psychoactive substances identified in 2014, but by 2018 that figure had risen to 9 per cent.
Many of the new opioid psychoactive substances are analogues of fentanyl, whose efficacy and harm have been demonstrated, leading to overdose deaths in North America and, to a lesser extent, in other regions.
In North America, fentanyl is used either as an adulterant in heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine) or to manufacture counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
There is some evidence that new psychoactive substance stimulants are also being injected in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many of the syringes were tainted with new psychoactive substances with a euphoric effect.
2 Use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly established in vulnerable groups
There is almost never a large market for a single type of new psychoactive substance.
However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most of them identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
Controls on precursor chemicals have forced drug makers to innovate Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamines, methamphetamines and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and producers are constantly looking for alternatives, not only for less regulated substances, but also for chemicals specifically designed to circumvent controls, so-called "designer precursors".
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of NCP are likely to put a further squeeze on drug producers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: in March 2020, a reported shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia contributed to an increase in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market is changing rapidly.
Replacement of opiates by synthetic drugs in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opioid market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by the authorities of the Russian Federation declined by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use decreased significantly.
Yet the doping market seems to be thriving by the day.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including mephedrone and a-pyrrolidinopentanone, are now readily available on the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities have reported a sharp rise in the number of recently seized clandestine laboratories manufacturing a wide range of illicit drugs, more than doubling in two years to 152 laboratories in 2018.
Growth of methamphetamine markets in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystallized methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern in addition to "fenetylline" and tramadol.
These findings were further confirmed by a 2015 study in which drug users reported that marijuana was more difficult to obtain than "fenetylline" or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine laboratories, and the Board has expressed concern about the large-scale importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors in methamphetamine laboratories.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine manufacture appears to have begun in 2014.
Since then, seizures of methamphetamine have been steadily increasing.
However, seizures in the first half of 2019 amounted to one ^657 kilograms - a significant jump compared to the previous year.
Significant seizures of methamphetamine thought to have originated in Afghanistan have been made in other countries, also indicating that production in that country is rising rapidly.
Policy changes and trends
Most jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of cannabis have shown a trend of increased cannabis use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most of those jurisdictions, cannabis use has increased since legalization, although the same trend has been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized the non-medical use of cannabis.
In Colorado and Washington, two of the first states in the U.S. to pass legislation, non-medical use of marijuana by adults has increased, especially in the past month and on a daily or near-daily basis, and has exceeded the national average since 2012.
All indicators show an increase in cannabis use in Uruguay since 2011, with use almost doubling in the last month.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the regular and frequent use of marijuana.
Short-term data from Canada also suggests that the expansion of the legal market from 2018 to 2019 was accompanied by an increase in usage.
However, 40% of marijuana users still rely on illegal sources to obtain certain products in 2019.
Marijuana Legalization Behind Plummeting Global Cannabis Herb Seizures?
In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years, driven by declining seizures in North America, which have fallen by 84 per cent over the past 10 years.
In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world almost doubled over the same period. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing cannabis markets have played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect The effectiveness of regulation of new psychoactive substances in the country remains difficult to assess.
A number of countries with different regulatory regimes for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of new psychoactive substance use.
In other countries, the adoption of domestic legislation has led to a decrease in the use of new psychoactive substances.
Vulnerable groups face harm from licit and illicit drug markets Pharmaceutical opioids for pain management and palliative care are mainly available in high-income countries Analgesics are unevenly distributed across regions.
In 2018, more than 90% of all medicinal opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
These countries are home to about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries account for 88 per cent of the global population but consume less than 10 per cent of pharmaceutical opioids.
Barriers to accessing pharmaceutical opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems and prescribing practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing a drug use disorder In 2018 about 35.6 million people suffered from a drug use disorder.
Poverty, limited education and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use disorders and exacerbate their consequences. This is confirmed by researchers in high-income countries, where individuals' unfavourable socio-economic trajectories, not only their situation at a given point in time, are also associated with the risk of drug use disorders.
Drug use disorders can also deepen socio-economic disadvantage, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty and homelessness, thus contributing to a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be linked to stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and migrants, sexually diverse groups, persons displaced by armed conflict or disaster and persons in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use disorders or experience problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) indicator, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the impact of harmful drug use on the wider society has increased over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, the number of global disability-adjusted life years attributable to drug use increased by 17 per cent.
The increase in DALYs associated with hepatocellular carcinoma due to untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, was particularly high - up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to establish all the causal links between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
The limited data available globally suggests that intoxication may be an important factor in homicide.
But alcohol seems to play a bigger role in violence than drugs.
While drug use may lead to offending, in some cases the link can be partially attributed to multiple mediating factors, such as socio-economic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family circumstances and peer influence.
The links between drug trafficking and violence are manifold.
Large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, are likely to be committed without violence if stable criminal structures are in place.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends less on the volume of trafficking than on certain changes that create an unstable balance of power between organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of the illicit market, the death or imprisonment of high-profile offenders, and law enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
Latest trends
Addiction Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, opioids most harmful
An estimated 192 million people used marijuana in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.
In comparison, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the harms associated with opioids have been overlooked because of the low number of users.
Such substances were responsible for 66 percent of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, and 50 percent of the 21 million years of life believed to have been lost to disability or premature death due to drug use.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids exacerbates public health crisis
In West, Central and North Africa, it is tramadol that fuels the opioid crisis; in North America, it is fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economies, demographics or general patterns of drug use, but both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis, which is fuelled by substances that are readily available and cheap to produce.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to a 20-year increase in opioid overdose deaths.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the U.S. involved fentanyl.
Canada reported similar results, only in lower numbers.
Fentanyl causes overdose deaths in part because of the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illicit drug market.
In West, Central and North Africa, the market for non-medical Tramadol has grown significantly.
An increasing number of patients with Tramadol Use Disorder are being treated in the region.
In 2017, global interceptions of tramadol increased significantly, peaking at more than 125 tons.
In 2018, however, global seizures fell to 32 tons after India passed a new law regulating tramadol.
Contributing to the crises in both places were the simplicity of manufacture and the low cost of production, in addition to the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
Exacerbating the crisis in both places is the fact that these substances are available on both the pharmaceutical and illicit markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their abuse.
Doping is on the rise
The area of stimulants is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasing in use in their major markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018, as cocaine is quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
Approximately 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most indicators available, methamphetamine use has been expanding in both regions for 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other so that the use of one drug rises when the use of the other falls, and sometimes increasing and decreasing at the same time to meet demand in the same market.
New Crown Pneumonia Puts Injecting Drug Users at Increased Risk
It is estimated that about 11.3 million people injected drugs in 2018 and that about 10 percent of global HIV infections are caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million injecting drug users are infected with HIV, and 5.5 million people have hepatitis C.
In 2017, there were about 585,000 deaths due to drug use, half of which were due to liver disease caused by hepatitis C, which remains largely untreated in injecting drug users.
5 Shortages of opioids resulting from the NCRP restrictions may lead users to substitute more readily available substances, such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful uses may occur.

EU summit argues over refugee policy, EU official: reception process bottlenecks at every step - CNN.com
EU summit squabbles over refugee policy, EU official: bottlenecks at every step of reception process
[Global Times in Belgium Special Correspondent Niu Ruifei] According to AFP on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce a stricter policy on illegal immigration as a way to make it easier to deport illegal immigrants.
The move by the EU is reportedly a response to growing concerns about illegal immigration in Europe, which today is centered on the small number of illegal immigrants who can ultimately be repatriated.
According to the summit document, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilize substantial EU funds" to strengthen the external borders with infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU is at loggerheads with member states over issues such as payment for the fence.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly said that EU funds will not cover the costs involved.
But diplomatic officials from some member states say that if the EU were to share the portion of the installation of cameras, watchtowers and other infrastructure along the external borders, it would free up national budgets for countries to speed up the construction process.
According to Europe's Euractiv website, EU officials have acknowledged that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, and that the EU's refugee reception system is in a near "permanent crisis" as limited reception capacity and overburdened migration authorities in member states are unable to prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications across the EU. permanent crisis".
The European Commission estimates that the EU's Schengen states received more than 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half from the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also agreed on the "principle" that EU countries can return illegal immigrants to their home countries on the basis of a court decision in another member state.
In addition, EU leaders agreed to "increase the use of the concept of the security state," which would open the way for the EU to develop a common list, according to the report.

U.S. escalates "chip war", hitting global semiconductor industry - CNN.com
Recently, the U.S. "chip war" against China has escalated - first, the Netherlands, Japan and the two countries in the U.S. pressure, agreed to start the control of China's semiconductor manufacturing equipment exports; after the foreign media reports, the U.S. government is considering cutting off all links between U.S. suppliers and Huawei Between all the links between the U.S. suppliers and Huawei, prohibit U.S. suppliers to Huawei to provide any products; Biden government is also ready to publish an executive order to limit the U.S. investment in the sensitive Chinese science and technology industry ......2023 soon after the start of the year, the U.S. in the containment of China's semiconductor-related industries on the development of the evil moves constantly.
In recent years, the United States to combat China's "core" development of the action has never stopped, while the precise suppression of China's semiconductor production and supply chain, while building a "de-Chinaization" of the semiconductor industry chain alliance, seeks to advanced semiconductor industry on the complete "Get rid of" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is to draw South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or with South Korea, Japan and China Taiwan to establish a chip "four-party alliance", or by the U.S., Japan, India and Australia, "four-sided mechanism" "Indo-Pacific economic framework" and other mechanisms to establish the semiconductor industry chain "small circle", the United States through the introduction of politicization, camp, weaponized means of the semiconductor industry, in an attempt to build a U.S.-led closed production and supply chain cycle, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing, to maintain its position in the global chip manufacturing The United States, by introducing politicization, camping and weaponization into the semiconductor industry, attempts to build a closed production and supply chain cycle dominated by the United States, so as to make up for its shortcomings in the field of chip manufacturing and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, the U.S. "core tactics" against China with great fanfare, but also "hurt the enemy a thousand and lose eight hundred".
Recently, the well-known U.S. chip manufacturing equipment supplier, Panarin Group, announced that the group will fire 1,300 full-time employees and plans to fire 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters due to the latest round of the ban on the export of chip manufacturing equipment to China.
Global lithography giant Asmax Holdings of the Netherlands recently warned that a ban on exporting semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to higher semiconductor prices.
U.S. media analysis, in the U.S. government on China's chip and semiconductor industries such as the implementation of brute force suppression, many U.S. companies are deeply hurt, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer fabrication equipment manufacturers, chip makers themselves, and so on.
The United States so-called suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry, but the global semiconductor industry chain, supply chain dragged down.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has long formed a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain.
According to professional estimates, based on the specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products need to cross the borders of various countries more than 70 times, the whole process reaches 100 days.
Despite the strong foundation of the U.S. semiconductor industry, it is weak in manufacturing capacity, especially in advanced process technology, and is heavily dependent on East Asia.
Even if the United States is trying to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to the United States-led "small circle" regional development, but the global semiconductor industry related to the regional distribution and interdependence of the situation is difficult to be changed.
The United States strongly "remodeling" "de-Chinaization" of the semiconductor industry chain, hitting the global semiconductor industry.
Chip is the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the joint participation of countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, the successive introduction of the "Innovation and Competition Act," "U.S. Competition Act of 2022," "Chip and Science Act," the use of scientific and technological hegemony, consolidate the country's leading edge in technology; allies, "Enwei and give" to induce Intel, TSMC, Samsung, and other chip manufacturers to set up factories in the U.S., and strive to ensure U.S. global leadership in the field of chips. Ensure the global leadership of the United States in the field of chips.
In the short term, the U.S. did create trouble and reap real benefits for the development of China's chip industry and related industries.
But in the long run, the United States hysterical suppression, forcing China's chip industry to continue to breakthrough, so that they have lost the huge Chinese market, and ultimately will greatly weaken the U.S. science and technology enterprises' willingness to innovate and innovation ability, damage the global chip industry development.

The first batch of personal pension financial products are on sale, and the shortest can be held for only 360 days - CNN.com
First personal pension financial products go on sale
7 products from 7 institutions to choose from Minimum holding time of 360 days only
Personal pension financial products have finally gone live.
On February 10, China Wealth Management released the list of the first batch of personal pension financial products, and seven personal pension financial products from ICBC Wealth Management, Agricultural Bank of China Wealth Management and China Post Wealth Management were officially put on sale.

The benchmarks are 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, 5.25% - 5.75%.
The remaining new product is "Postbank Wealth Tiyi-Hong Jin Minimum Holding Days 1,095 No. 1", which is also a fixed-income product, with the fund-raising process starting on February 10th and ending on February 19th, and with a risk rating of Level II.
Of the two surviving products, one is the "Agribank Concentric - Lingdang" 360-day technological innovation RMB financial product of Agribank Wealth Management, which is of mixed nature and has a risk level of Grade 3.
The other surviving product is "Postbank Wealth Tiyi-Hong Jin Minimum Holding 365 Days No. 1", fixed-income type, which was launched on December 30 last year and formally operated on January 4 this year, with a cumulative net value of 1.0011 on February 8, the product has been in the market for a long time and is expected to be launched in the near future.
According to the Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Individual Pensions, the financial products in which funds in individual pension accounts can be invested include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance and public funds.
The first batch of personal pension financial products are put on sale, marking the fact that personal pension investors can formally purchase financial products through their personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the CBIRC formulated the Interim Measures for the Administration of Personal Pension Businesses of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies.
The Measures provide that participants may purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension financial products, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public fund products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation issued a notice specifying that the personal pension system was launched in Beijing and Tianjin, as well as 36 pioneer cities and regions such as Shijiazhuang and Xiong'an New Area in Hebei and Jincheng City in Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, there were 19.54 million individual pension participants, 6.13 million contributors, and total contributions of $14.2 billion.
Previously, the banks participating in the pilot program only had three types of products on their shelves: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products and personal pension public funds.
Now, after the personal pension financial products are also gathered, how should investors choose?
Experts from the R&D department of CBI's financial products said that compared to other personal pension products, both the pilot stage pension financial products and personal pension financial products are characterized by three aspects.
The first is robustness, with a more robust risk management mechanism, more robust investment strategies and philosophies, and the implementation of independent third-party custodianship by a non-parent bank.
Second, long-term, the pilot phase of the pension financial products are five years and above, the next step in the issuance of personal pension financial products, the shortest holding period is in principle one year, encouraged to hold more than three years.
The third is universality, the product purchase threshold is low, the starting point is generally 1 yuan, some as low as 0.01 yuan, the product's custodian fee, management fee and other rates are more favorable.
Professionals pointed out that investors should choose according to the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of longer term, higher interest rate and high security, which are suitable for people with weak risk-tolerance ability; personal pension insurance products emphasize on protection, which are more suitable for people who can't bear the investment risk and can accept the stable income; and personal pension financial products and public fund products don't guarantee the capital or the income, which have a certain investment risk, but the expected income is higher, which is suitable for people who have a certain degree of financial knowledge and higher risk-tolerance ability. They have certain investment risks but higher expected returns, and are suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and higher risk-bearing ability.

Fitness industry should get rid of crisis of confidence - CNN.com
Another large gym "mine"?
Recently, the issue of the rights of members of the well-known fitness organization Zhongjian Fitness has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores did not operate normally, and then the rumors about the organization's closure and running away caused panic among members, leading to the intervention of public security and human resources departments.
In the end, the storm subsided only when the relevant person in charge of the organization responded by promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members.
Some stores of individual fitness organizations have operational problems and are temporarily closed, consumers could have calmly waited for the problem to be solved, why is the first reaction of many members "something bad"?
Behind the health club members' rights fiasco is a deep-seated crisis of trust in the industry.
Domestic traditional gyms generally take the prepaid model, "earn money that users do not come" is the underlying logic of its development.
Through the pre-sale of membership cards to obtain cash flow, and constantly open new stores, it seems to be able to cycle back and forth, but in fact, cribbing, can not form a stable profit model.
Negative information about the industry, such as gyms running away, has been coming out frequently, dealing a strong blow to consumer confidence.
In terms of market prospects, the gym is certainly considered a good business with "money".
The fitness track has had its ups and downs, but has always received capital attention.
A number of data show that the culture and sports consumption and other areas of heat is rising, the market continues to pick up.
Specifically to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of the standard of living of the population, the concept of healthy living is deeply rooted in people's hearts, the development of the fitness industry has great potential.
The more the situation is improving, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, individual organizations are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, just out of the crisis, and then blow the horn to open up new territories, the financing funds a brain into the construction of new stores.

Taiwan's "Central University" Department of Economics Professor Wu Daren analysis, the export recession may cause export manufacturing manufacturers cash flow problems, the risk of debt defaults rise.
At the same time, fewer orders led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impacted spending power.

As Taiwan's economy is supported by exports, the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year's due to the impact of the export slump.

The other is from the external ecological point of view, to realize the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the external environment of value synergy and co-creation.
"In the future, the e-commerce industry also needs more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to form a prediction of the stability of future development; in addition, it will provide merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, and realize the synergy of the value of the enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, so that we can create a healthy content ecosystem together.

Xinhua News Agency, a Beijing-based news agency
"Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires comprehensive consideration, systematic planning and overall advancement, and the correct handling of a series of major relationships between top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, correctness and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and self-improvement, and opening up to the outside world.

Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society and ecological civilization, and is related to all aspects of the governance of the Party, the State, the military, internal affairs, diplomacy and national defense, so it is necessary to do a good job of systematic planning, but also the courage to reform and innovation, and to continuously realize the overall advancement.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to gain a deep insight into the general trend of world development, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, and explore in depth the laws of economic and social development, so that the planning and policy system formulated reflects the times, grasps the regularities, and is rich in creativity, and achieves a combination of near and far, up and down, and harmonization of content.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking, and there are still many uncharted territories that need to be boldly explored in practice, and the undertaking should be promoted through reform and innovation, and should never be carved up or guarded.
Strategic issues are fundamental to a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to enhance the foresight of the strategy, to foresee the future and lead the future with a scientific strategy; to enhance the overall situation of the strategy, focusing on solving the major problems that have a bearing on the success or failure of the Party and the country's cause, and affecting the whole body in one hair; to enhance the stability of the strategy, and to adhere to the strategy for a long period of time, to grasp it to the end, and to achieve good results once the strategy has been formed.
We should scientifically grasp the dialectical and unified relationship between strategy and tactics, organically combine the principle of strategy and the flexibility of tactics, be flexible, adaptive and decisive, and seize the strategic initiative by adapting to local conditions, moving in response to the situation and acting in accordance with the situation.
The Chinese nation is a nation of righteousness and innovation.
In order to handle the relationship between keeping the right and innovation well, it is necessary not only to keep the origin, root and soul of Chinese-style modernization, and unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, so as to ensure that Chinese-style modernization is in the right direction, but also to place innovation in a prominent position in the overall situation of the country's development, conform to the requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively recognize and respond to changes, and vigorously promote reform and innovation, and constantly shape new dynamics and new advantages for development to fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society. We should promote reform and innovation, continuously shape new momentum and new advantages for development, and fully stimulate the creative energies of society as a whole.
Efficiency is an important foundation for fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
As we promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only create greater efficiency than capitalism, but also safeguard social equity more effectively, and better achieve a balance, promotion and unity between efficiency and equity.
To deal with the relationship between efficiency and fairness, to continuously realize that development is for the people, development relies on the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the people, so that the fruits of modernization will benefit all the people in a greater and fairer way.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to deal with the relationship between vitality and order, so that society can be vibrant yet stable and orderly at the same time.
It is necessary to integrate the two major issues of development and security, implement the overall concept of national security, improve the national security system, enhance the capacity to safeguard national security, and firmly safeguard the security of State power, the security of the system, the security of ideology and the security of key areas.
While giving more consideration to security factors in development, enhancing the strength of national security through development, and applying the fruits of development to strengthen the foundation of national security, it is also adept at creating a security environment conducive to economic and social development, continuously stimulating development vitality, and realizing the benign interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we should not only insist on following our own path, but also expand our global vision, insist on opening up to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must insist on independence, self-reliance and self-improvement, on placing the development of the country and the nation at the base of our own strength, and on keeping the destiny of our country's development and progress firmly in our own hands.
It is necessary to continuously expand high-level opening up to the outside world, deeply participate in the global industrial division of labor and cooperation, make good use of two kinds of domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, and share the opportunities for development and create a better future in a mutually beneficial and win-win situation.
If you follow the path, you will be able to go far.
Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core and the scientific guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, let us grasp the laws, act conscientiously and unrelentingly, give full play to our positivity, initiative and creativity, correctly handle a series of major relationships, and strive to be active on the new journey of comprehensively constructing a socialist modernized country, and constantly open up a new realm of Chinese-style modernization.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese) The Biden administration this Friday (Feb. 10) blacklisted six Chinese entities associated with a suspected spy balloon program.
The U.S. Department of Commerce said the five Chinese companies and a research institute help modernize China's military, particularly its aerospace programs, including blimps and aircraft.
Blacklisted companies have difficulty obtaining U.S. technology exports.
The list is known as the "entity list," and companies on it are unable to purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they receive a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Air & Space Technology Co., Ltd, China Electronics Technology Group Forty-eighth Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd, Eagle Gate Aeronautical Science & Technology Group Co., Ltd, Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aeronautical Science & Technology Co., Ltd and Shanxi Eagle Gate Aeronautical Science & Technology Group Co.
This comes after the White House said it was considering broader measures to "expose and address" China's larger surveillance activities that threaten U.S. national security.
The balloon incident triggered further tensions between the U.S. and China, and U.S. Secretary of State Abraham Blinken canceled his visit to China.
In response to the shooting down of the balloon by the United States on 4 February, the Chinese Government lodged solemn representations with the United States Embassy in Beijing, criticizing the United States for seriously impacting on and undermining the efforts and processes of both sides to stabilize China-United States relations.
From the available evidence of wreckage and information on the Chinese military's procurement platform, the United States Government concluded that the balloon's manufacturer had a "direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and was an approved supplier to the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a news conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position on the accidental incident of a Chinese unmanned civilian blimp that mistakenly entered U.S. airspace due to force majeure.
According to the Foreign Ministry's website, she added that the relevant resolution in the U.S. Congress was pure political maneuvering and speculation.
China is strongly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce, said: "Today's action demonstrates a concerted effort to identify and stop China's use of spy balloons, which violate the airspace of the U.S. and more than 40 countries.
"
Reuters reported that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aeronautical Science and Technology Co. said she was unaware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. and has not yet commented on this information.

(Deutsche Welle) Days after the earthquake hit parts of Turkey and Syria, hopes of finding survivors are fading, but searchers were overwhelmed by the rescue of a family of five on Saturday.
The family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the hard-hit town of Nourdai in Gaziantep province, the Associated Press reported.
Searchers first pulled the mother and daughter from a pile of rubble and then found the father, but he insisted that his son and another daughter be saved first.
When they were all rescued, the crowd erupted in cheers.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaraş, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were also successfully rescued in harsh and bitterly cold weather conditions.
"What day is it now?
"- The teenager who was trapped under the rubble for 129 hours asked the searchers who rescued him after he was brought back to the surface.

Miraculously successful rescue cases have brought a ray of hope to an already hopeless search and rescue effort, but at the same time, the number of victims continues to rise.
Monday's quake has now killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, according to official statistics, with the death toll in neighboring Syria estimated at more than 3,500 people.
Although experts say people can survive for up to a week or more after being trapped in the rubble, hopes of finding more survivors have become increasingly remote.
Rescuers are still probing for signs of life beneath the rubble with the help of thermal imaging cameras.
At the same time, the focus of rescue efforts began to shift to helping survivors who were in dire need of help.
U.N. official: Disaster 'not seen in a century' in region
Martin Griffiths, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, told a press conference in Turkey that the quake was the region's "worst catastrophe in a century".
He also praised Turkey's post-disaster response as "extraordinary".
He also told Reuters that he hoped relief would be delivered to areas controlled by both the Syrian government and the opposition, but also said the matter was "unclear".
The United Nations has pledged an additional $25 million in relief contributions to the earthquake-affected population in Syria.
Earlier this week, the United Nations had announced $25 million for disaster relief in Turkey and Syria.

The Singapore government is taking a number of measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced the allocation of nearly S$500 million to stimulate tourism recovery.
The Tourism Board has announced that it will plan to allocate S$110 million from this budget over the next two years to launch more business and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In an effort to make health and wellness one of Singapore's tourism highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board released a call for expressions of interest on November 23, 2022 to develop a health and wellness attraction on Singapore's southern coast.

Health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism product in the next few years, said Tan Kian Leng, Director General of the Singapore Tourism Board (STB).
The new crown epidemic has raised public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the MGTO has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists over the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) organized the inaugural Health and Wellness Festival, which offered more than 130 various health activities and experiences to the public.
Singapore will continue to offer new travel experiences for visitors.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World at Marina Bay Gardens, Sentosa Central Beach Bazaar, the new Explore New Frontiers gallery at the ArtScience Museum and the new amphitheater at the Night Safari, MGTO will support the development and revitalization of projects such as the Bird of Prey Park at Maneka Wildlife World to make Singapore an attractive international destination. as an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will develop industry standards for the sustainable development of the Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE) tourism industry in 2023, and focus on improving two major areas, namely waste disposal and carbon emissions, to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the airline industry.
Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, Changi Airport has seen a strong recovery in passenger traffic, with the airport already receiving as many as 150,000 passengers per day and about 1 million per week, equivalent to about 75% of the pre-New Guan epidemic level, and the number of airline employees on board has returned to about 90% of the pre-epidemic level.

The rapid recovery of tourism has also driven the pace of recovery in the accommodation, transportation, food and beverage and shopping sectors.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Singapore Tourism Board (STB) Assistant Director for International Division, Ko Sook Tan, said a survey conducted by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore is ranked among the top three in the world in terms of safety index, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is popular among Chinese tourists.
Prior to the New Crown outbreak, about 3.6 million people from China traveled to Singapore annually for vacations.
Chinese tourist arrivals are expected to recover this year to 30% to 60% of their 2019 levels as China relaxes its border policies.
Ke Shudan pointed out that the MGTO will then pay close attention to further signals released by China's outbound travel policy in response to the changing needs of tourists.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) will be actively preparing to receive Chinese tourists in response to new trends emerging in outbound travel from China.
Looking ahead to 2023, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) is confident that the tourism industry will recover at a faster-than-expected pace, as long as the global economy does not experience a significant recession that affects public revenues and there are no new outbreaks of large-scale fatal epidemics, among other things.
Kim Jong-un's father and daughter interacted closely and his wife was left out.
(Composite 11) The DPRK held a military parade on the evening of the 8th, the 75th anniversary of the founding of the army, and leader Kim Jong-un's daughter, Kim Jong-ae, not only attended, but also stood on the podium with her father.
North Korea's official media released a video on the 9th, Kim Jung-ae snuggled up next to her father, several times warm eyes, whispering, she gently cupped her dad's cheeks with both hands, and even touched her father's chest, the father-daughter interaction screen broadcast to the whole country.
However, First Lady Lee Seol-ju could only step aside.
Comprehensive South Korea's "Chosun News" and other reports, Kim Jong-un, Lee Seol-ju and his wife attended a dinner with their daughter Kim Jong-ae in the official photo, Kim Jong-ae is not only rare to sit in the middle of the parents in the C seat, in the evening of the next day the 75th anniversary of the Military Day military parade ceremony, she and Kim Jong-un on the podium together.
North Korea's official media, the Korean Central Television, later released a movie of the parade, exposing more images of father-daughter bonding.
Kim Jong-un looked at his daughter several times from the podium, the smiles on their faces never faded, and they whispered in each other's ears, with Kim's main love at one point cupping both of her dad's cheeks with both hands, to which Kim Jong-un responded with a big smile.
Other official media footage also showed Kim Jong-ae continuously touching her father's face with her hand while sitting on a sofa chair indoors with Kim Jong-un, and touching her hand on Kim Jong-un's chest while walking arm-in-arm with him.
And First Lady Lee Seol-ju could only walk behind or sit on the sidelines the whole time, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that the main love of Kim since last year's test-firing Mars 17 missile on November 18 for the first time in the public face, three months since the exposure rate is getting higher and higher, so far it is the fifth degree of official occasions.
The official media of the DPRK mentioned Kim Jong-ae with extremely high honorifics such as "dearest son" and "honored son", and also broadcast a clip of Kim Jong-ae repeatedly shouting that she would swear to uphold the Paektu lineage as she watched the parade marching from the stands.
These signs make outsiders wonder whether Kim Jong-ae has been designated as the successor of the Kim regime, and the Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong-un has put his middle-school-aged daughter in the position of successor", but there are also views that such a judgment is still too early, and in the case that Kim Jong-un has a son at his knee, it is still possible that he has a son at his side. Possibilities.
Chongyang Q & A ︱ how to see the U.S. non-farm payrolls data in January greatly exceeded expectations and future trends - Economic Observer - Professional financial news website
Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, how do you think the U.S. January nonfarm payrolls data greatly exceeded expectations and the future trend?
A: On February 3, the U.S. Department of Labor released January 2023 nonfarm payrolls data, adding 517,000 nonfarm payrolls, sharply higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; hourly wages grew at a rate of 4.4% year-on-year, and at a slightly slower rate of 0.3% year-on-year.
From an aggregate perspective, this data has many one-time and technical factors of disturbance, such as the strike return of faculty and staff, the survey statistical caliber of the revision, the quarterly adjustment factor update, the follow-up may be revised (refer to the January 2022 new nonfarm payrolls from 504,000 downward revision to 364,000), nonfarm payrolls or not as strong as the data reflected.
Structurally, the impact of layoffs in high-tech firms is still present but accounts for a relatively low percentage; new employment in high-touch service industries such as leisure and hospitality, education and health care has picked up sharply, and the data suggests that a labor gap in the service sector still exists.
Combined with the rebound in services PMI, job openings and labor gap data, which also greatly exceeded expectations, and the strength in consumer credit data, we judge that the U.S. services sector is in for a quick fix after the extreme weather and holiday season.
In our view, it will be difficult to improve the supply-demand tension in the U.S. job market without going through a recession.
There is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the U.S. labor market, and the labor force participation rate has been slow to move upward, especially for 25-54 year olds, who are already near their pre-epidemic highs.
On top of that, the strength of consumer demand will contribute to a further lag in the impact of austerity on the job market, thanks to the excess savings of US residents and the strength of consumer credit.
Continued tight supply and demand in the U.S. job market will be the undercurrent of the U.S. economy in 2023.
Overlaying this with recurring inflation expectations as we now approach the end of the rate hike, we are not optimistic about a sustained decline in payroll growth.
Prior to the release of this data, the U.S. stock, bond and currency markets were overly optimistic in their expectations for the Fed's path of interest rate hikes.
As inflation data continue to improve, the Fed in shortening the pace of interest rate hikes at the same time also continue to maintain the fragile balance of market inflation expectations, but the market is blind to the Fed's hawkish statement, not only expected to stop hiking early, but also expected to end the year two rate cuts.
With labor market supply and demand tight and the impact of austerity unclear, we believe that the Fed's year-end guidance for rate hikes is relatively reasonable, and that the adjustment of extreme market expectations and trading congestion may hurt the market somewhat.
Nevertheless, the stubbornness of the payroll growth rate is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation, with the M2 data turned negative year-on-year as well as the gradual turnaround of the leading indicators of the various CPI sub-items, the U.S. CPI data since October has turned to a rapid decline in the stage of the payroll growth rate of the stubborn will only be the formation of the bottom of the future inflation data, the current market expectations are difficult to falsify the market in the next phase of the publication of the inflation data or enter a new round of games. A new round of games.

Because everyone will go to consider, I spent so much money, I have to go to send someone to manage it, right, this is usually do a behavior ", however, Zheng Yonggang is different, fir acquisition of the successful day, Zheng Yonggang to the fir gold photoelectricity announced in public, fir as the fir gold's major shareholders, the decision to implement the one-enterprise, two systems, in addition to Zheng Yonggang as chairman of the board of directors, fir enterprises are not sent to the fir gold, the people.

U.S., Japan, and Philippines agree on defense against Communist China.
ASIA - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos, Jr. visited Japan for talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) encroachment in the South and East China Seas, and the Philippine-Japanese leaders issued a joint statement after the meeting saying they would oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy by signing a trilateral defense agreement with the United States for substantive defense exchanges.
According to the Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes to use the meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish a policy for the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos Jr. visited China earlier this year in January and secured agreements worth $20 billion.
But after that, China-Philippines relations not only didn't improve, but slipped instead.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to U.S. forces to secure the South China Sea.
One of the newly added bases is 300 kilometers from Taiwan and the closest location to China.
In the event of a crisis in Taiwan, U.S. forces could launch operations from bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that now Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia and even the Philippines have formed an axis with the United States to build a "counter-communist arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
KMT Vice Chairman Xia Liyan's visit to China conveys Song Tao's message: green camps are welcome to visit China under the 1992 Consensus.
Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT), Mr. Li-Yen Hsia, met with Mr. Song Tao, Director of the State Council of Taiwan Affairs and Mr. Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency (CNA) last night, Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT's official organization, positively commented on Song Tao's comment to Xia Liyan that China welcomes green campers to visit the mainland as long as they agree with the "1992 Consensus" and oppose Taiwan independence.
The KMT side evaluated it as something new.
There was no mention of the claim in the news on the day Xia met Song Tao earlier.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has clarified for days that it rejects the "1992 Consensus".
According to the Central News Agency (CNA) today, Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT), Mr. Hsia Liyan, led a delegation on a visit to China, and during his stay in Beijing, he met separately with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), and Song Tao, the new Director of the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office (STAO), along with Beijing Municipal Party Secretary Yin Li.
Xia Liyan and Song Tao talked about the political foundation of the Communist Party of China (CPC) being the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence, while Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT's National Politics Foundation, said during the meeting that the KMT's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus". The KMT's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was a different feeling from the previous meetings he had participated in.
In recent video talks with mainland academics, as well as in this one, we did not hear any Taiwan-related scholars talk about armed reunification and the "anti-secession law", but instead about the resumption of exchanges and dialogues.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are in danger of war, and the Chinese mainland hopes to be able to convey the intention of improving relations through the KMT.
Because there is no mutual trust between the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party, the other side is still willing to do a good job with the Taiwanese, which means that they do not want cross-strait relations to go bad.
According to Zhao Chunshan also said, Wang Huning also personally instructed to Song Tao said "they (Taiwan farmers and fishermen) put forward the request, you must implement", if it is not possible to solve the overall problem, but also to take a case-by-case approach.
The report did not mention whether the KMT member's visit to the mainland mentioned to his face the daily disturbance of Taiwan by Chinese military planes and ships, the agricultural and fishery issues in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the interview with the Central News Agency (CNA) reporter asked questions about such issues.
French trade unions mobilize again in march against government's retirement reform proposal
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions again launched a national mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on people to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action of this social wave against the government's draft pension system reform.
And how many people respond to the rally call could affect the union group's next course of action.
This is the fourth time in a month that France's eight largest trade union groups have come together to launch a national mobilization, and the first time this protest has scheduled a rally for a Saturday.
Given that for most French people Saturday is a public holiday, they don't have to choose between taking part in demonstrations and protests or going on strike with wage deductions, union groups are therefore hoping that today's rallies will attract more people.
Neither the unions of the bus system Metro nor the public railroads called for a strike of their employees today, and the bus system should be able to function normally, with people able to ride to rallies, while people can depart for their vacations as normal in areas where schools have begun their winter breaks.
Trade union groups are hoping for more than a million people to attend the rally today, while police are expecting a possible national turnout of between 600,000 and 800,000, with between 90,000 and 120,000 people likely to gather in the Paris metropolitan area.
Since the beginning of this protest against the government's pension reform program, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in the march has gradually decreased, although polls show that most French people do not support the measure to postpone the mandatory retirement age from the current 62 to 64.
The first strike demonstrations on January 31st rallied between 1.27 and 2.5 million people across the country.
And the crowds at this Tuesday's (Feb. 7) demonstration have shrunk to between 757,000 and two million nationwide.
This pension reform proposal is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition parties, especially those led by the radical left, have submitted numerous amendment proposals, so that the review process is moving forward very slowly.
And the debate between the court and the opposition is getting more and more heated and sharp.
A lawmaker from the radical left-wing party France Indomitable recently triggered a protest from the ruling party by transmitting on social media an image of himself with his foot in a balloon bearing the head of the labor minister.
The Speaker of the National Assembly eventually announced a 15-day ban on the member's participation in parliamentary activities as a punishment for such behavior.
Despite the fact that this reform program has triggered the largest social upheaval in France in the last 20 years or so, the government has so far not made any major concessions, although it has tweaked the draft slightly.
The unions are already preparing to launch another action next Thursday, the 16th, and they are also planning to organize demonstrations on March 7th, when the draft reform is sent to the Senate for discussion.
China's encouraging higher fertility rates by promoting sperm donation at colleges and universities with high quality standards.
The Human Sperm Bank of China's Yunnan Province issued a publicity campaign on the 9th, soliciting sperm donations from people with college degrees or above or school students, who will receive a RMB 4,500 subsidy for 8 to 12 successful donations.
According to Taiwan media reports today, the message rushed to the microblogging hot search on the same day, and triggered Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing and many other provinces and cities to follow up the initiative.
China is encouraging college students to donate sperm, according to a Liberty Times op-ed.
Colleges and universities around the world to donate sperm which Beijing donates sperm to the highest threshold, in addition to academic qualifications, but also requires a height of 170 centimeters or more, decent features, no obvious hair loss, myopia can not be higher than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Human Sperm Bank noted that sperm donors receive a full set of male medical checkups worth 1,000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never had done before and which are significant in understanding their fertility status."
Sperm donors are required to be at least 165 centimeters tall, have a college degree or above, or be enrolled in a college, and be free of color blindness, color deficiency, genetic diseases such as Hepatitis B, and infectious diseases.
The report quoted China's Tianmu News as saying that the Shaanxi Human Sperm Bank had printed a propaganda poster saying "Paid sperm donation, unlimited honor", calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to forward the message to "let love pass on".
The price tag in Shaanxi Province is higher than that in Yunnan, with qualified individuals receiving RMB 300 in cash each time, and a subsidy of RMB 5,000 for those who have completed a certain number of sperm donations.
And the highest known price tag is in Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of RMB 5,150.
East Germany's last communist chancellor died today
The successor of the Communist Party of East Germany reported in a statement from the party, "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95.
As a result, our party has lost an important leader.
"
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall that had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, Modrow had said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At that time, communist leaders were forced to step down as protesters across East Germany demanded democracy and freedom.
When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union, he called for change in Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe as well.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The results of the election resulted in his ceasing to be Prime Minister.
Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political change and unification that occurred in October 1990.3 The government's efforts to reform the country's political system have been a major challenge to the country's economy.
He has also been criticized for trying to reinvent rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modrow was convicted of electoral fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but did not go to prison.
It has been claimed that these allegations are politically motivated.
Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament from 1990 to 1994 and was a Member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modrow saw himself as a reformer and wanted to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want the old GDR to return, but said that the GDR's achievements should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and trained as a machinist.
During World War II, he served as a platoon leader in a youth fire department and near the end of the conflict became a member of the Nazi militia, the Volkssturm, which recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final struggles of the war.
At the age of 17, Modrow was captured by Soviet forces and taken as a prisoner of war to the Soviet Union, where he took anti-fascist courses and became a staunch communist.
In 1949, the year of the founding of East Germany, he returned to his home country and found work as a machinist and continued his studies in social sciences and economics, earning a Ph.
Modrow was a staff member of the Free German Youth Movement, to which almost all young people in East Germany belonged, and rose through the ruling Social Unity Party (SED) to become chairman of the regional party in Dresden between 1973 and 1989.
He also served in the East German Parliament for more than 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran marks anniversary of revolution Hackers supporting protests hack president's televised speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ebrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The President's live televised address was interrupted on the Internet for about a minute when a group of anti-Iranian government hackers appeared on the screen with the logo "Edalat Ali (Justice Ali)".
A voice also appeared shouting "Death to the Islamic Republic".
Hackers interrupt state TV coverage as Iran marks anniversary of revolution, Reuters reported today.
As Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, Raisi's hardline government faces its boldest challenge yet from young protesters demanding their ouster, but Raisi is still calling on the "deluded youth" to repent so they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
Nationwide protests swept through Iran still after the death of Mahsa Amini, 22, in September in the custody of the country's morality police.
The deadly crackdown by Iranian security forces on the protests is one of the strongest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced since the 1979 revolution that toppled the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
As part of an amnesty marking the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities released jailed dissidents Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelha on Friday, who were on hunger strike.
Earlier Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a general amnesty that included a number of prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
As of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors, according to human rights organization HRANA.
Reports indicate that 70 Government security personnel were also killed.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been calling for a vote at Saturday's rally to show opposition to the protests as well as support for the government.
On the night of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution on Friday night, official media displayed fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebrations, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar"!
(God is the greatest!)" .
However, many people at the rally could also be heard shouting "Death to the dictator"!
" and "Death of the Islamic Republic" in a video posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in states across the country.
In Tehran, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were displayed as part of the official celebrations.
President Leahy's speeches were often interrupted by slogans of "Death to America" - a signature slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel".
Adelkhah, who has been jailed since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months, Reuters said.
She was sentenced in 2020 to five years in prison on national security charges.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she returned to prison.
Adelkhah denied the allegations.
And Messami's release comes a week after supporters warned that he was at risk of death because of his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the mandatory wearing of the hijab.
The French Foreign Ministry responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday by calling for her freedom to be restored, "including the possibility of allowing her to return to France if she so wishes".

Balloon incident rubbing America the wrong way even more?
Increased restrictions on technology exports to China
The U.S. is poised to further tighten technology exports to China in the wake of the ballooning incident, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
Current and former security officials said the ballooning incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and would garner more political support for stronger U.S. technology protections.
The United States says the balloon carries antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communications.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior CIA official who now works at the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank.
"It certainly adds fuel to the fire and supports the views of the hardliners against China".
We will also consider a broader range of actions to expose and respond to China's larger surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security as well as to our allies and partners," White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday.
"U.S. officials say they have notified more than 30 governments about the aforementioned balloon incident and that international coordination is critical to countering the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the Biden administration's actions, the new U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee on U.S.-Communist Strategic Competition with China could also pressure the United States to take tougher measures to slow down China's development.
She said members of Congress will feel increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which in turn could force the White House to adopt tougher policies.
Many advocates of stricter export controls are also pushing to expand them to include industries such as artificial intelligence, according to the Wall Street Journal.
The U.S. government has also been working on a foreign investment review program to look at U.S. investments abroad for potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House could face calls to roll out the program more quickly.
Earthquake relief in Turkey and Syria continues around the clock
Since the powerful earthquake in Turkey's bordering Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night in the rubble of thousands of quake-damaged buildings to free survivors buried under the rubble.
In the freezing temperatures, they often appealed for silence as they tried desperately to hear any sounds of life from the crumbling piles of concrete.
Two more women have been rescued after surviving days in the earthquake rubble, Reuters reported today.
However, the death toll from the earthquake climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey was 20,665 and in Syria more than 3,500.
Monday's 7.8-magnitude quake, which continued with several powerful aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, was the seventh deadliest natural disaster of the century, surpassing Japan's 2011 quake and tsunami, and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by an earthquake in neighboring Iran in 2003.
A similarly powerful earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999 killed more than 17,000 people.
Rescuers in Turkey rescued two women from the rubble of collapsed buildings after they were trapped for 122 hours following the region's deadliest earthquake in 20 years, authorities said Saturday.
Another injured 55-year-old man, identified as Masallah Cicek, was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, Turkey's largest city in the southeast.
Rescuers often appealed for silence in the freezing temperatures as they tried desperately to hear any sounds of life from the crumbling piles of concrete.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouch under a concrete slab and whisper "Inshallah" - "God bless" - as they carefully reach into the rubble to save a 10-day-old baby. -- they carefully reached into the rubble and rescued a 10-day-old newborn.
His eyes widened as baby Yagiz Ulas, wrapped in a warm blanket, was carried to the field hospital.
Video images show first responders also took his mother, who was dazed and pale but lucid on a stretcher.
Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the last 24 hours and that 31,000 rescuers had been mobilized in the affected areas.
He said about 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million people had been rendered homeless by the quake and were huddled in makeshift shelters.
As many people lacked food in the cold winter conditions, there was growing public skepticism about the response of the leaders of both countries to the relief effort.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has traveled with his wife Asma to a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly for the first time since the earthquake, according to official Syrian media.
Earlier, the World Food Program said it was running out of stockpiles in rebel-held northwestern Syria as the state of war complicated relief efforts.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adıyaman province, where he admitted that the government's response had not been as fast as expected.
Opponents have seized on the issue to attack Erdogan, who is up for re-election in a May 14 vote that could be delayed by the disaster.
Anger over delays in delivering aid and launching relief efforts could affect the election, Reuters said.
Even before the earthquake, the vote was seen as Erdogan's toughest challenge in his two decades in power.
Erdoğan called for unity and condemned what he called "negative campaigns for political gain."
Turkey's main opposition leader, Kemal Kilidaroglu, criticized the government's response.
Critics say, "The earthquake was big, but worse than the earthquake was the lack of coordination, lack of planning and incompetence.

The University of Brunei is the largest center of higher education and scientific research in Brunei and ranks third in the list of universities in the region.
Brunei University is one of the symbols of Vietnam-Brunei cooperation in education and training.

Vietnam News Agency
Hanoi - The official visit of Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh and his wife to Singapore and Brunei by the Vietnamese Government has been a complete success with comprehensive, practical and concrete results, reports a special correspondent of the Viet Nam News Agency (VNA).

What exactly was the "object" shot down over Alaska?
Confusion and speculation abound
The U.S. military once again used the F-22, America's most advanced stealth jet fighter, to shoot down an as-yet-unidentified object flying over the U.S. state of Alaska on Friday (Feb. 10) afternoon.
The location of the shoot down was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This is the second time in less than a week that the U.S. military has shot down an airborne object.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed over the U.S. coast near South Carolina after drifting through U.S. airspace for several days.
The Pentagon said the second downed object, which first entered U.S. airspace on Thursday night, was tracked by the U.S. military as it moved over northeastern Alaska, flying at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet) and was about the size of a small car, much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that was shot down earlier.
The Pentagon also believes that there is no indication that the object is manipulable.
John Kirby, coordinator of strategic communications for the White House's National Security Council, said Friday that while the exact appearance of the object flying at high altitude was unclear, it "poses a legitimate threat to the safety of civil aircraft."
Kirby said the object was different from the spy balloon found in the U.S. in that it did not have a "payload" hanging from it.
"We call it an 'object' is the best description we can make at this point", Kirby said.
President Biden took advice from the Pentagon before ordering the object shot down, and he made that decision "very carefully," Kirby added.
The official U.S. description of the object can be roughly summarized as being the size of a small car, with no joystick, no suspension, and flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But this information does not yet answer basic questions, such as what exactly this object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is on.
Much of the current analysis and speculation online suggests that this could be another Chinese balloon.
It may have come from China as did the spy balloon that invaded U.S. airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America on some kind of mission in a different location.
Others have linked the Alaska "object" to "unidentified flying objects" (UFOs).
The Newsweek story quotes former U.S. Rep. Peter Meijer (R-N.Y.) as tweeting Friday, "I really hope this 'UFO' is also a spy balloon and not a legitimate UFO" .
"The irony of conflating an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth starting an interstellar conflict," Major said.
Major sent this tweet shortly after Kirby confirmed that this object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said Major was not the only one who suspected the object was a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tennessee) criticized the administration's cover-up last month, calling on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release its report on the "unidentified flying object".
Amazon's customer service attitude is unbelievable to me
I'm guessing very few people are reading this, but I'll chime in a little bit.
This shirt was a zippered hoodie when we purchased it and ended up being a short sleeve for me.
Immediately after receiving the dress, I contacted Amazon customer service, who confirmed at the time that the dress was still in stock, and I asked for an exchange, and the customer service said to go and sort it out, and then immediately saw that the item name had changed to Short Sleeves, and that the original link to the one I'd bought was off the shelves.
Then customer service notified either keep the item for a certain amount of compensation or return it.
Is this how Amazon handles it?
It's really unbelievable that the wrong clothing shipment wasn't my problem per se, and as a consumer I asked for the item I was supposed to get and didn't make any very exaggerated claims, and Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.
This is my first long review and I hope it's not my last.
Sleeves that boggle the mind
Said to be cowhide, also really hard, but look closely, there are many small cracks in the local, confused whether it is real leather, in addition to the sleeves of this dress is really incomprehensible, usually the sleeves of the jacket to be longer than the hem, but usually only 1-2 cm, this dress is long enough 5 cm, the arm naturally down should be in the palm of the hand in the position of the tiger's mouth, but the sleeve of this dress over the fingers! The sleeves of this dress are over the fingers.
It's easy to buy clothes and easy to return them.
But I really don't know when I'll have to return the money.
The dress is well made and I only had to return it because the fit was on the small side, but after returning it, over a week has passed so far and I haven't received a refund?
And to have the purchaser contact the less-than-honest All Peak Express on their own was the worst purchase since purchasing an item from Amazon!
But the store is still good, actively cooperate with the courier to urge the timely refund, but this all peak courier is really work is done quite outrageous, dragging half a month or so before the refund, this kind of partner is to drag the leg of Amazon, poor work efficiency, no sense of service!
More suitable for young people
99 seconds.
The sweaters are well made, colorful, and feel good, soft/thin, and don't smell like kerosene.
Unfortunately the fit is of a skinny type, more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist 2 feet 5, stretch the maximum size of 4 feet, 1.79/80 kilograms wearing waist a little tight.
There doesn't seem to be any elastic around the waist, and it's kinda hard to add slack to the waistline.
Plus, it's uncomfortable to wear close to your body.
Good. The colors aren't very bright.
Just bought it and it's gone up over two hundred dollars, what's going on.
The first time Amazon used the cooperation of the daily bad courier, the first delivery was not at home, and then took the initiative and the courier about the delivery time twice, that courier did not deliver, and then returned it to me directly, this damn courier has no integrity at all, strongly recommend not to use that daily bad courier again.
This time there was another bodysuit returned to me as well, and the price went up over a hundred dollars for another shot.
Amazon's own should not have items like this
The product was purchased on special for a good price and reading the reviews it is a great product.
I was dumbfounded when I actually received the product, the item had extensive surface wear and multiple other areas of wear and tear, it was either substandard or old, pictures later.
I requested a return and the manufacturer's guy saw the pictures and said it was due to shipping, which is not nonsense.
How is it possible for merchandise to wear out on the inside?
There are only two possibilities, either the item is inferior and old, or I intentionally damaged the item and took it back.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the goods, but in terms of my credit history of shopping on Amazon, I think that such goods should not appear in the Amazon self-provisioned goods, customers choose Amazon self-provisioned is the trust, CUSTOMER WIN, WE WIN, the victory of the customer is the victory of the manufacturer, I hope that we will work together to improve, thank you.
I've been using this product for less than a year and I'm getting two E2s.
I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016 the right two groups of receivers often appear red E2, should be a problem with the transmitter module, which is not consistent with the Amazon website that the transmitter module can last for 7 years, and can not find after-sales service on the Amazon website, now I do not know what to do?
It's okay.
First purchase was bad.
Doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn and the label on the body was torn.
And it's always a white screen.
It's better after the change.
The exchange was pretty quick, a little blurry at night, not a very wide viewing angle, but enough for normal home use.
The downside is that it doesn't have a card, I bought it myself, and the fact that I've bought cell phones from Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened, not this time, there is also a sticker like stamp to put on the warranty card when you buy the phone, not this time.
I don't know if it's confusing if things are cheaper or not.
Waiting for a reply from the supplier
Packaging without any identification, directly to the supplier called to say, answering no identification is genuine, such as doubt available edges mailed to Johnson & Johnson inspection, but also left the license plate number and phone number, promised to send a text message notification to enter my information into the Johnson & Johnson official website warranty card, and now also did not receive a text message ah?
Received the oil in the morning and changed it in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's own goods are still very reassuring.
The oil change guy said the oil was clear and really good .
As it is the second purchase.
So it's still very reassuring.
Fast shipping, no nitpicking with the packaging, and the engine sound has dropped significantly with this oil.
The price/performance ratio is good, and it's hard to find synthetic oil under two hundred.
Support Star Crown, support the winning brand, effective protection for your car.
Amazon Japan's customer service issues have resulted in serious damage to buyers (8c caterpillars shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
Acknowledged the mistake, but kept passing the buck, always emphasizing that the goods were third party and could not bind the third party.
Order No. 503-4265464-1830254.
I initially purchased the page size options for 7c, 8, 9c, at that time I think this is a trap, call Nichia Chinese customer service, clearly informed that 8 is 8c, but wait for the goods back to China only to find out that only 8cm, I think this is completely deliberately set up traps to pit Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales), and now check the page is no longer available for this option.
Chinese customer service: I'm sorry to have caused you loss, we give you two ways to go:
1, you return it and the buyer pays all shipping costs.
2, if you don't return it, we'll reimburse you 1,000 yen.
(I'll do the math. Shoes are over 4000 yen, which works out to 200rmb. Option 1, I don't have any shoes, and the loss is in the 200rmb range.
Option 2, I have shoes, finally compensated me 2000 yen, the final loss in 150rmb Customer service: we have recorded it, we will deal with it seriously, the next day back to an email, said I do not accept the Chinese customer service mediation, and that's the end of it.
When I brought up the fact that the page for purchases is for confusing options like 7c, 8, 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me out by saying that the common Japanese codes don't come with a c like that, something like 140, but have you guys ever fucking looked at other caterpillar pages?
All of them have a mix of US code, and Japanese code labels.
Besides, why did you put your 8cm in the middle of the 7c and 9c, what's the point of putting it there when it's clearly the smallest size.
Chinese Customer Service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know you want to ship back to your country, so we won't claim for your shipping cost.
This logic I do not understand again, I am Japanese, I also want Chinese customer service, living in Japan, China does not need Chinese customer service, go to Japan tourists, do not have that effort to play the international long-distance, then the question comes, what people need to play the Amazon overseas purchase of Chinese phone, nothing like me, such as the Japanese Taoist.
Amazon Chinese customer service is not just convenient for those of us who are seafood?
Not very happy with this purchase
This is the second time to buy Pampers diapers from Amazon, once bought a box of them when the baby was 2 months old, and chose diapers with imported European paper, the first purchase experience is still relatively satisfactory, the baby uses one diaper all night long, and it does satisfy for 12 hours without changing the diaper.
But this time to buy L-size diapers, a box inside 2 packages of separate packaging, open the paper is relatively loose, with the import of Pampers has a clear difference, to the baby used, it is not bad, there is no leakage of urine and there is no sign of rashes and so on.
But when it came to the second pack of diapers, the baby immediately developed a rash on his inner thighs after he started using them, and it hasn't faded yet.
Doubt the 2 packs inside 1 box, the quality is still different ah.
I should not continue to buy in the future!
Want to emphasize the protection of parcels in transit
This is one of the worst packaged shipments I've seen in all my online shopping, with absolutely no protection, cushioning foam, wrapped cushioning layer material, etc., whatsoever.
Just a crushed and deformed box.
And inside the soft plastic box packaging, the card box are pressed open pressed to deformation.
I hope it's authentic Quality is guaranteed, in the future is not much dare Amazon to buy things.
I'd rather be half as expensive domestically and have a little more security.
And the issue with the merchandise product packaging, as I read the reviews someone commented on in 2016, and now 19 years later, it's still the same.
It shows that Amazon simply does not pay attention to the service feedback piece, and the domestic Jingdong, Tmall, etc. is too far away.
Nice, but a little bit of a bummer
The color of the whole cup is my favorite, orange, and even though my family has a baby boy, I still think the orange with the yellow is very bright.
It's a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it was meant to be used to take out of the house, so it's acceptable.
Took it home last night and tried it out, after the cap is pushed off, the distance between the straw and the cap is too close, because the straw is positioned positively vertical, so my son always has to drink with the bump on top of the cap in his mouth, and wondered if this area could be improved.
It seems like other brands of sippy cups make their straws angled for a good reason, and with kids' stuff, it's really all about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and large capacity
Love that it's lightweight and has a large opening, it's the two separate divider pockets that are a bit redundant for me, I feel like I don't know what to put in them.
After I bought it, I realized that there was another one of a very similar brand on Buy American Overseas for just under two hundred dollars.
Fake. Extraordinarily fake.
I'm also convinced that Amazon sells fake products.
Customer service said I can't return it because I used it, how do I know it's fake if I didn't use it.
Because of trust, so sad, after all, it is a wipe face supplies, really go to the physical store to buy it, recognized more expensive.
I didn't read the comments because it was a second, I've submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, let's defend our rights together.
It's broken?
Counterfeit?
In short tragedy.
With the second piece of the time to choose the pores detailed, but a strange smell when you open, thought it was normal, because I have not used this, and then stick to the face of the whole can not stand it, a very punchy flavor, indescribable, smoked to the immediate cough out, the eyes are also very painful, tears, and immediately take off to wash your face.
I don't believe it but I opened another piece of the same type, it doesn't smell as bad and I'm putting it on now.
In retrospect it kind of smells like a bad perm in a hair salon.
It's unimaginable, is it hard to believe that Amazon's own skincare products will have to be avoided from now on?
It's a crooked business.
At the time of purchase, the activity page is said to be full of 99 yuan to give "three body full set", received the goods do not have this gift, call customer service said to give them to see the screenshots of the activities at that time, the problem is who buy things also save the screenshots of the web page ah, you have done the activities, but also need to customers to help you to provide ah, all buyers next time to be! Keep an eye out, save the evidence.
feeling after using
The first time to buy things in Amazon, respectively, feel a few points, first of all to say after the use of the feelings of the goods it, the first is indeed painless, there is no stimulation of the flavor of the stuff, overall very good, static waiting for 8 minutes or so a wipe off, just there will be a small amount of sweat slag on top, not a close look is not visible, so that the overall is good, as for the aftermath of all just to use a time but also to continue to observe, and continue to use to know! The actual hairs are not as well known as the ones that are not.
Anyway, I think this stuff is really good.
Second from ordering on the 27th and receiving the item on the 12th, a total of 15 days or half a month, and great service from the Amazon delivery guy.
Third, don't trust Amazon for any Black Friday, order on Friday, wait 2 days and it's close to 12 bucks cheaper, which means I bought it as 170+ (plus shipping and stuff), there's a kind of feel-good kind of thing that raises the price if you have an event.
Customer service said something about price fluctuations, I have been following the price for more than 10 days and that's it, the fluctuations are not big.
Affordable price, Japanese origin, with Chinese label, with pellets, absolutely repurchase!
Paste with particles in the body, the sense of freshness is just right, after using the teeth smooth, on a second-hand East than a too strong, where it is said to be imported things, but a lot of things do not have Chinese labels, I do not know where to wholesale from.
From now on, never go back to used east as long as Amazon has it.
Give a suggestion, how can you not get a tan on Amazon's app sometimes, hopefully some improvements will be made to the app and it will do better and better!
Excellence has gotten worse and worse over the years and there is no quality of service to speak of!
Garbage excellence does not take into account the needs of the customer When placing an order special delivery time 19:00-22:00.
Because of the presence of elderly people who are bedridden and inconvenient after surgery, it is only possible to collect mail conveniently at night.
It turned out to be a surprise that it was delivered right to my door at 12 noon without a prior phone call.
If the delivery time is whatever your courier wants it to be, why pretend to make a time for the customer to choose?
If there's no way to guarantee service with your own logistics, then simply don't do e-commerce!
Getting an old man with 3 wounds out of bed to open the door to receive a delivery and having to pay for it with change!
Obviously there is a contact number on the order!
From the beginning to the end no one came to the phone to get in touch to give an explanation!
The so-called complaint customer service of Joyo.com is just a bunch of outsiders pretending to be there, perfuming your complaint and then giving you a so-called reply.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I've had this problem before with similar delivery times not being right and put up with it, but this time I couldn't stand it, it was too much!
New book bought pre-sale arrived surprisingly front and back cover is reversed, this look obvious quality problems on this look closed eyes to send the book to the customer?
Leave a bad review and no one will contact you.
Excellence has gotten worse and worse over the years and there is no quality of service to speak of!
Wouldn't spend another dime on excellence.
The quality of the pictures is just unacceptable
With a title like "Ancient Atlas", this book is unacceptable in its choice of images, layout and printing, some of which are even mosaicked and blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, and even if it is illustrated in small format, it should stand up to the ocean of medieval and ancient documentary material left behind by our ancestors in the catalog!
(Besides, many of the images are available as clear original files from relevant industry sources.) What's the difference between piecing together a book with such images and using no images at all?
! I feel sorry for such a spirit of governance.
The text is not evaluated, and each party has its own way of distinguishing it.
2 stars overall.
The second year of high school when I read this book at the time just hold a boring look at the mindset of play, feel that the book should not be addicted to it, after all, the starting point of the net article in the past or not very attractive to me.
And then... Just fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is relatively easy and pleasant, the first part of the Ye Xiu is still in the online game, even if the guilds hooked up with each other, also because often by the Ye Shen dog blood, make it not heavy at all.
As for the part where it comes to the contest, it's written with a little bit of heartache of the changing times of old and new (maybe I'm just sentimental).
Reading the whole thing took me a lot of study time sophomore year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
Full-time on the characters and emotional lines of the depiction of people very amazing, some characters just occasionally brought, but also will leave a deep impact, like more focus on the description of the role of Ye Xiu Huang Shaotian Su Mu orange have a large number of fans, and not in the center of the writing of the role of the role of, for example, Jiang Botao Chu Yunxiu, and so on is also very find people to like, in an e-sports cool article surprisingly let people can not find a let a person hate to the extreme characters, this is full-time in the Characterization success.
And in the relationship line, full-time also does not have the general net article is criticized by the harem beautiful thirty million either beautiful or corrupt fault, the full text of all the people's feelings, all have a common place is that they love the glory of the game, and most of them want to hallow the victory.
Little measurements are there yet there is no great intrigue and everyone seems so innocent and sweet.
That's probably why there aren't any obnoxious characters full time.
The full-time IP is big and attributed to that.
Netflix as a cultural phenomenon aside, Full Time is not a bad read.
More or less he really does provide some heat and a little touch.
Full-time to be anime-ized this April.
Actually want to buy all this set of books for a long time, in the way of forever wallet is not thick enough are not ruthless down, and then want to buy it found, tb on the simply rampant fakes, in fact, full-time recently came out of another version of the cover picture bar I myself is quite like, but still intend to buy the old version of the first, so just look on amazon, a one-time to buy a set down.
Next, a brief word about the shipment.
● The plastic cover of the fourth book is missing, but the book is new.
● The seventeenth plastic cover was in but was opened and the texture of the book felt strangely hard without the others.
● Book 23 is in the same condition as book 17, but also harder than book 17, but very old.
● Individual books have different publishers as if 23rd and 17th are the same publisher, unlike the others.
● Overall it was quite satisfying, 24 books in a very large box.
Lonely Little Lion
When I got the book, I thought it was going to be as simple as The Lost Corner, but it turns out there's a lot more text oops!
It took three times to read the book to the kids, a little lion who shoots guns and loves Juicy Fudge.
When I saw the lion eat the hunter this plot, the heart slightly uncomfortable, modern urban people for being eaten by animals such an arrangement is a bit unacceptable.
By the end of the scene, the young lion, who has succeeded in human society, loses himself; he is no longer fully lion or fully human.
In the end, there was only the back of the lion cub, wondering where he had gone.
It is possible that years from now, the image of this lion cub will remain in the memory of a grown-up child, and will be recalled at an unspecified time one day, perhaps touching or inspiring her.
A great portfolio for the money
1, before I did not know TASCHEN, recently bought a lot of their books, the reason is too strong, both in the selection and the production itself.
There have been three editions of this work, the largest being close to 50 centimeters long by 34 centimeters wide, like that Michelangelo complete work; the middle edition is roughly 36 centimeters long by 23 centimeters wide; and this is the smallest, and comes with a book box for the two-volume book edition.
Personally, I think it is acceptable, first, the price is cheap, and more than 700 pages are divided into two books, as a paperback is also better to flip; secondly, is different from the complete works of Michelangelo that book, paintings accounted for the main body, da Vinci this black and white manuscripts accounted for most of the limited budget, non-art professional readers, this edition as the appreciation of the paintings and manuscripts of the best price is the cost-effective.
2, the narration of the painting part is great, with composition analysis, draft analysis and historical background (such as the Last Supper), but I don't know if it's the printing or the book size, some of the shaded parts of the county are too deep to see the details, which is a bit of a pity.
3. In contrast to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer.
The former is already a genius, and the latter's wide-ranging involvement and achievements are not enough to be described as genius.
If before only looking at the paintings could only half experience Da Vinci, after reading the manuscript there is no language at all.
Garbage, whoever buys it regrets it!
Never give bad reviews, this is truly garbage, bought a waste of money God, give a reason!
1. The timekeeping is not accurate, suddenly becomes January 1, the time is zeroed.
2. Inferior quality belts, are not silicone, with wrist allergy blisters.
3. Often can not connect to the phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. Sleep detection is not displayed and the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Other.
Logistics is too slow
It showed that it arrived on October 16th, but it turned out to be received on the 21st... bad review!
The delivery was terrible, buying on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfied
Before at first I was worried about the packaging of the camera, this time it was fine, there is an inflatable bag inside, the camera three codes are consistent, also can be registered on the official website, the number of shutter count 0, the rest will have to wait for the test of time .
Shipping speed is quite fast, here to spit on the courier boy, valuable items on the concierge, go fast, I have no way to open the box in front of him to test, on this point is really speechless.
The merchant did what was best for the customer before shipping :)
The merchant was more responsible and called specifically to ask about the size of the screen of the camera used, so he really looked out for the customer.
Shipping was fast too.
Adamantium film fits and works pretty well on it too.
Battery not fully charged
The machine is really good, I would like to ask how to charge the first time from the charge is not enough ah, the charging indicator has been red
I can't find an official Amazon feedback channel at the moment, so I can only give feedback in the product reviews
1. purchased the book through the pre-order route using $31 on March 29th, indicating that it would be pushed to devices on March 31st, at which point the book could not be previewed on the official Amazon site (because it had not yet been released);
2. the book that was pushed to devices on March 31st was blank, with only stay tuned, and the price of the electronic version of the book was reduced to $18 on Amazon;
3. Repeated attempts over the past two days to delete the downloaded blank book from the device and synchronize it again have failed to obtain an electronic version of The Nature of Business that contains the actual content, but I see that the book can already be previewed on the Amazon website.
I have a few thoughts so far
1. the price is not really the most important issue, the key is how to replace the blank books on kindle with books with actual content now, instead of downloading them forever with "stay tuned".
2. Pre-ordered books should not be purchased in the future, after all, in case of jumping the gun, the procedure of downloading another book with empty content looks very complicated;
3. I hope that Amazon will give a normal channel to give feedback on such issues, so that when there are doubts about the download of e-books, or the use of the e-books, there is a place to give feedback (work orders, online customer service can be, you can refer to the official Microsoft Store how to do)
Not really recommended reading
I read it a long time ago, and I happened to see it and write something about it from memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of pieces of life about love.
The tone of the book is extremely plain, the kind of plain as plain as plain water, the wordplay goes to the extreme of simplicity, and the plot is as silent and bland as a street on a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small period of time in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally collected together under the title What We Talk About When We Talk About Love.
I think this collection of stories, and its title, is like a kind of performance art, the author wants to express that love is more than just the sadness and joy on the stage, the urban legend of the sea and the rocks, and not just you and me like glue, love is more than the above nor should it be represented by the above, love is also a life as plain as water, boring day by day, there is also the life of the unpreparedness, the reality of the escape, the future of the The future is uncertain.
As you read this book your mind may go back to the bickering couple next to you, the tasteless marriages of people you know, and less-than-ideal relationships.
This is exactly why I don't recommend reading it; aesthetically, the writing and plot of this book are tasteless, and unless your life is amazing or sweet as living in a candy castle, you'll have to read it with the feeling that you've seen it all and are bored.
And in terms of depth of thought, the everyday episodes don't brighten or expand one's thoughts or horizons (unlike Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera in this regard), nor do the brief segments explore any questions, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?
The breakdown of the protagonist's marriage stems from those reasons?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much sense to read it or not.
The author's ideas are expressed more through technique and genre than storyline, and is the reason why this book is a poorer reading experience.
Suitable for cursory reading, not for detailed reading.
The book is logical, but not fleshed out enough.
It explains a lot of the what and why of sales theory, but is very weak on how to do it, just pointing out the direction but not giving specific practices.
Also, the book feels like a patchwork.
Examples are both domestic and foreign; well-known entrepreneurs or salesmen and unknowns.
I don't know if the story was compiled for the sake of examples, but it would have been more convincing to cite some of the author's own cases.
Change around on the title of customer or client.
The headline is still a customer, but in the text it becomes a client.
The eBook also has typos, missing punctuation, and incorrect numbering.
In short, this book is a good choice as a theoretical introduction, but not so much for those who are already engaged in sales and want to improve their sales level.
A quick introductory book on internet finance
This book is very shallow, and can be said to be only an introductory lesson to help you quickly understand the whole picture of Internet finance, but to go deeper, you still have to follow the charts and dig deeper on your own.
And into the book time earlier, then Alipay WeChat borrow subsidies to cultivate user habits of the content has not been mentioned, today's share of third-party payments is afraid that the book is not so small as the proportion of it.
Nowadays, so many people just take a cell phone with them when they go out to eat, and merchants are abandoning the use of UnionPay because the bank flow is too high.
Still, I am very grateful to the author for writing this primer, and I can see that the author has at least many years of experience in financial observation, and is very familiar with the history of financial development both at home and abroad, which is why he has been able to write such an easy-to-understand content.
It's easy to write tall and empty, the hard part is writing in a way that is easy to understand.
Appreciate you and want you to know it even more!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether he or she is sufficiently valued and appreciated at work.
According to Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory, after a person's basic survival needs have been satisfied, the most urgent is the fulfillment of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed and appreciated.
Indeed, for most of the people in the country, "love you in the heart of the mouth is difficult to open", even with love, gratitude and appreciation is silently put in the heart will not say out.
In this book, the author describes five languages of appreciation: words of affirmation, moments of care, acts of service, gifts of gratification, and physical touch.
I think the important thing is not that you know what the five languages of appreciation really are, but that you can use them from the heart at all times to appreciate and be grateful for those around you, whether they are family, friends or coworkers.
In fact, the closer we are to each other, the more we need to appreciate and be thankful for our lives.
By learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thank you to the translators for bringing us wonderful ideas and worlds from abroad.
Due to the Chinese and Western cultural background and other reasons, there will be more or less differences between the languages, if you have the opportunity to see the author's original version I believe it will gain more.
Thanks again to the authors and translators and editors for their hard work!
Suspected shoddy goods, ask Amazon for strict scrutiny
Super poor quality, loose packaging, no weight, not even as good as roadside stall products, no grams, no bar code, ten bags of packaging is also loose, not at all the characteristics of qualified products; is the worst shopping experience on Amazon, has applied for a return; completely belongs to the quality of the problem; suggest that businessmen shine their eyes and refuse inferior goods; add: bought another heart to heart, supermarket 23 yuan / 10 rolls, added a few comparative photos, further verified the product's shoddy, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid financial losses and further mood upset!
Once again, I expect Amazon to be meticulous and tighten up the source of their merchandise.
Sloppy product, falls short of expectations
Pros:
1. Big brands at cheap prices.
Pro 2: The motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they work OK, but they are not what I expected.
Drawbacks:
1. Charging no indicator light, this most basic your power instructions are saved, it is estimated that the purchase of 300 yuan product customers, in the eyes of Panasonic PANASONIC, but also alms, no respect.
2. Strong odor When charging, even if only charging 10 minutes, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.
Tried it in the office for 1 day and got this plastic smell all over the house.
Compared to my previous Philips PHILIPS in the same price range, although it has an extra blade, this Panasonic product, the quality is really sorry for the consumer.
small package
Received the courier a look at the above written electric version know and fell into the pit, than the supermarket to buy a good deal smaller, should be M, with the introduction of goods above the picture packaging is not the same, the so-called new version of it.
Three stars is to blame for being sloppy and not reading the item specs, I have no problem with you selling a size M e-commerce version, what do you mean the item is not the right size?
The e-commerce set is deep, so I'd better go to the supermarket to buy it sometime.
That's it.
I don't like the taste.
The kid hates the taste of toothpaste and says spicy every time, so maybe another word would be more apt, and that's all that's in the kid's vocabulary for now.
I bought it during an event and it was cheap, so I'm sorry to give a bad review, 4 stars, but I won't buy it again.
It's the real thing. It's well packaged.
The packaging was complete with an inflatable bag added to it, and it didn't look like just a bare product as reviewed online.
There is a plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle like described in the picture, and the delivery was fast, came the next day after I took the picture.
It's authentic, just out of stock, not sure when it will be back on the shelves.
A bad shopping experience
Black Friday when the order, the results of waiting for a long time are not received, the back of a query, the package has long been signed for, asked around the colleagues said did not help to sign for it, hurry to contact the courier company, but said that the sender can only initiate the query, contacted Amazon customer service, and waited for more than ten days, and finally figure out is the courier was mistakenly thrown to someone else, and then a few times turnover to finally pick up the courier, the outer packaging has been torn down, the commodity is also a kind of complete, I do not know whether it has been used, in short, quite bad!
Incorrect Matching Picture
I thought I was able to receive headphones like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to receive headphones like Figure 2, and the inconsistency of the figure and object is not even, what is the point of the headphones having different sound sizes on the left and right?
Even though the names are the same, I hope you can pay careful attention to it, and I also ask the person in charge of Amazon to replace the correct matching image in time, thank you very much.
The operating system is mediocre
Used for a period of time, the overall picture is okay, do not feel any difference, it is the system let people look at the tangled, boot time is obviously a little slow, can not make a good setup, and then with the software is no need to comment on, the response speed that is more general, and colleagues compared to the home that is not an order of magnitude.
Read the reviews say very user-friendly design, I did not find where user-friendly, remote control this commonly used up and down, right and left, back button design location is really not complimentary.
So what, just use it as a TV, plus a TV box or something.
The price drop is too much.
The price drop is so great, over a hundred into now 99!
I've accumulated a lot of unreviewed orders at Amazon, so I've standardized on a copied paragraph as the review content.
If I were to rate it with this paragraph, it would mean that this product is at least an 85 or higher.
And for the worse products, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste the reviews so that other consumers would use them as a reference when purchasing and the business would improve the quality of the item as a result.
Low price for a good cable, this is enough without audiophiles!
Such a cheap line, but it should be up to the hdmi certification standards, personal comparison kill domestic Akihabara these shit (the price is twice as expensive), the line body is thick, but also relatively soft, 7 meters of transmission without noise, the future of low-priced line recognized by the Bess!
The stuff is okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really way worse than other sites
After placing an order, I found that I had placed a wrong order, but I couldn't cancel it anymore, and the webpage contacted online customer service and kept displaying an incorrect link, so I couldn't get in touch with them.
The delivery guy called me when it arrived, I said I didn't want it, and when I tried to cancel the order which didn't work, the dispatcher took it back and said he'd sign me up on it first and asked me to request a return.
Only when requesting a return was I told that food items cannot be returned once signed for, no way to call Amazon customer service, same story, signed for cannot be returned.
I used to buy items that can't be returned on policy in both Jingdong and Suning, including milk, diapers, etc., and contacted customer service to return them, and the diapers from Jingdong smelled too much after opening them contacted customer service to return them as usual to you Amazon can't.
Rules are dead, people are alive. Contact your customer service, how did it go?
Telling me that I either have to take it myself or have the delivery person buy it themselves, and it's not easy enough for the delivery person, so who am I to make them pay for something they didn't purchase themselves?
Okay, I won't return it, I'll take it for myself, but I have to rate your service 1 out of 10
I urge you not to spend your money in vain
First of all, full of expectations to buy, think all music brand should not be poor to where it received after looking at the packaging feel okay, the head is not bad, but there is a box is basically soft, the appearance is not visible to see, to feel, to eat in the mouth completely tasteless, tasteless and tasteless, bite open to the flesh of the circle is a dark yellow is the bad kind of good and bad to participate in the sale of the ability to eat less than one-third of the persuasion! Do not buy, not cheap, the quality is too bad!
I learned from my mistakes and will never buy fruit from an e-commerce company again!
Where is the product security marking
Bottle bottom corner of the depression of the great, should have experienced a strong impact in order to lead to, from the outside of the bag to see, feel the degree of ravaging people heartbreaking, after all, is the food packaging is too simple, and still belong to the international purchase, and did not see what obvious anti-counterfeiting logo signs, open the bottle is very easy, the key is to cover a layer of honey directly from the inside out of there, there is an opening is almost no adhesion! The key is that the layer of honey inside the cap comes out directly from the inside, and there is almost no adhesion to the opening.
Being born in China I'm a bit confused.
It should be authentic, right?
Also when I took the picture it suggested that it would arrive in the twenties, this was received on the 14th, my first time buying overseas here, just writing down my doubts, maybe this is all normal?
Pick-up service could be improved
I bought a total of 5 pickup coupons, in the extraction, the first appointment to extract 3, the results only sent over 2, after much communication only to confirm that it is a missed, promised to need to make up; the second appointment, just in time for the rest day, the website and WeChat have no prompts need to make an appointment on a working day, causing unnecessary panic, suggesting that the future to improve.
Nice shopping.
Good reviews on the stuff!
Still more believe in Amazon self-supporting things, now overseas purchase later is very convenient, buy back from abroad logistics time than the domestic is only a few days more, I have to say that Amazon overseas purchase to the domestic customs clearance is still very strong, than to go forwarding to a lot of fast, so now a lot of things are in the overseas purchase to buy.
I hope the quality and price of domestic goods can be better, a lot of things are domestically produced, but go out and turn around and buy them back cheaper than at home, I hope to improve.
garbage
When you see such a package, ask everyone: do you think it's roadside trash?
A plastic fragile package is sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag, is this responsible packaging?
I see such packaging is packed like garbage, buy this product, the packaging and its rudimentary, without any measures to prevent breakage, just a simple plastic bag packaging, after arriving, the package is completely deformed, the contents of the items are also broken.
If I just ran into one of these, I'd admit it, bought a few that were like this, went to Amazon customer service, who then said I could return them, but the shipping was padded, and then the shipping was returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I try to ask, I use cash to pay for shipping, you give me back the gift card, which is to buy your own gift card on my own straight ah, but also their own products mailed to the German warehouse, this is not to buy a product to suffer ah!
And I have been talking to customer service, such a problem is whose responsibility, customer service but half a sentence does not say that their responsibility, even half a sentence of responsibility are not afraid to take responsibility, such after-sales service and what guarantee? In a word: admit it! But I guess I have this evaluation, Amazon will not give the opportunity to publish, directly back to delete!
Quality is good 5 stars, logistics is terrible
1, the quality is very good, the seconds, the price is moderate, value for money.
2, Sturdy, enough material, solid welds, good finish, very good color.
3, logistics is hard, the order was placed on the 3rd and arrived on the 11th.
4, if Amazon hadn't labeled the estimated arrival time as Feb. 7th, I might have been happy with that.
5, but labeling the expected arrival time is equivalent to giving the user a promise, and it is difficult for the user when the promise cannot be fulfilled.
6, If you are not sure of giving a commitment, do not make one.
7, I actually care a lot about the promises made by merchants.
8, so, I scored it low.
The gold thread will lose its color
The effects are still there, but whether they are noticeable or not depends on the individual or the psychology of the person.
One thing that is not so good is the gold thread, originally designed to look good, but in fact, this gold thread will lose its color, put it on the car, if you hold it a few times, there will be some gold dust on your hands, and on the car.
I hope the product can be improved.
This square, there is no decorative effect, do not engage in the gold line up, fall down in the car dirty car also trouble.
Everything is in good condition, speed is fine, in 2 packages and different packaging!
8 days of speed quite fast, but is 2 pieces divided into 2 packages, packaging is not the same, obviously a shock too much, thick cardboard paste, sealed layer of plastic, the outer packaging is also convenient to dismantle, a domestic courier box like, put a few cushioning airbags even if the matter, feel a little perfunctory.
Yalan mattress is really good
34CM mattress is not generally thick, do not want the bed directly sleep mattress can be.
The quality is very good, both the front and the back, are quite soft, sleep is very comfortable, lying on it quickly fall asleep.
The mattress was received because the courier violent transportation there are two places some stains, Yalan customer service is very responsible, very efficient contact to solve the problem.
It's not a self-serve item, shame on Amazon
The page is clearly labeled self-supporting, in fact, by the supplier delivery, after-sales by the supplier is responsible for, out of the problem of their own contact the supplier.
Want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has been passed to the supplier, can not be canceled; want to return the goods, successfully applied for a return in Amazon, sorry, no one cares about you, you need to contact the supplier to return the goods by yourself.
What kind of self-serve merchandise is this nifty.
The goods are not Amazon delivery, after-sales Amazon does not undertake, customer service even said "I help you contact the supplier", but also claimed to be self-supporting, too shameless, naked shameless, naked fraud on consumers!
Depressing experience
The previous cartridge I purchased online from someone else had good filtration and was just as limescale free after the 28 days were over for another day or two.
As has always been in the Amazon acquisition of things of quality can be, this time I thought to buy this side, the first time to buy a cartridge in Amazon, do not feel very good, not only early in the beginning of limescale, and the cartridge has been used up to the 28th day, there will be a suspension of small black carbon powder, I really do not know whether to continue to use it, or just thrown away good, very depressing ~!
It's not as good as it looks.
And I used to use the plug board comparison, the external workmanship is general, how the interior has not been dismantled to see, but I hope that, as described by the store, from the ease of use, whether each individual unit is energized lack of display
The package is broken, waiting for time to test the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is badly damaged, the box inside seems to be new, but the instructions don't seem to be new, only renovated in September, stocking up, hopefully it won't be a bad one by then, please explain to Amazon why several customers have mentioned broken packaging and you guys are at peace with it, thank you!
Overall good, a few minor issues
The first time to buy a water filter, read a few evaluation articles, feel LAICA cost-effective and choose this, received the goods according to the instructions to install the cartridge, try it out, feel good overall, but in the pouring of water, as if the original water will be from the mouth of the place and the treated water mix (the original water compartment sealing is not too tight).
When you use it, be sure to wait until all the water has been strained before pouring it out!
Incomplete picture
The picture did not shoot out the side details, side details and the main body of the style is not consistent, there is a big difference, this is one; this bead is produced in Thailand, no indication of origin, this is two; no indication of the texture, this is three; I bought in the United Kingdom, clearly each item has its own box, there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo above the bead, where can I judge to be I can't tell if they are fake or not.
Be careful what you buy, especially if you buy something out of Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service sucks.
Ordered two days ago, received it today and realized it was down 40 bucks, spent a lot of time finding customer service who said they couldn't make up the difference and that they could repurchase and return it.
This kind of customer experience and service is really 10,000 times worse than Sompo and Somdong.
It's okay, worth getting as a newbie
Character passes through, and extreme diamond has no comparison, before I saw the mall that price, less said several hundred, I am the first time to play diamond, okay.
Nice stuff.
Things are really good, sent to his girlfriend, just at noon I'm not in the courier plus some unpleasant, the logistics company directly put the mail hosting treasure and did not send the verification of the pickup text message to me, causing me to run two trips.
But baby is really good.
worth buying
The little monkey is adorable, the Amazon deal is so great, and the Chow Sang Sang website ships directly to me, so I ordered the night before and received it this afternoon, so fast.
The postal courier was also very responsible.

Confessions of a customer
1 When you receive such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to rush, we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then in the middle you contact a customer service agent who will tell you that the issue will be handled by a commissioner who will inform you of the outcome.
You can never initiate contact with this commissioner, nor do you know her work number, nor do you have a direct line contact number, that is, you can't contact her, only she contacts you.
3 Tragically after waiting almost 3 days for this commissioner to contact me, I left my cell phone for a while and did not receive a call from this commissioner.
I waited 2 hours for that commissioner to call, during which time I reached out to Amazon customer service and emailed customer service for her to call me back.
4 Nearly 3 days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon is going to do about me receiving this defective coffee maker!
5 There is no problem with Amazon USA items, overseas shopping as a way of shopping is good, but the service can be far worse than to the USA.
6 For me I can only continue to wait...
unevenness of the floor
Because of the review said very good, all of the expectations of this pot, when I got it, I also like, very lightweight, but when you open the pot found the problem, the bottom of the pot is not flat, the center protrudes, the perimeter of the concave, the oil ran to the periphery of the specially purchased open pot of fat frying a lot of oil can not cover the central area, paste, open the pot can not be opened, so the construction of the estimate can not be normal cooking.
I don't know if I was unlucky and just happened to get a pan with an uneven bottom, but fortunately Amazon offers a one month return, so I decisively returned it.
I retired the pan with a clean brush and worked half a day for nothing.
Good product design needs to be matched with a manufacturing process to realize it
This is a product with a very simple design style.
Cubic in shape, the designer treated the top with a slightly curved surface.
It was supposed to be very smooth lines.
Unfortunately the end result was not able to be realized.
This is because there are two components at the top, the control panel at the front and the water box top at the back.
The curvature of the top cover and the curvature of the control panel actually don't line up, and there's a height difference of up to about 2mm after putting them together.
It looks like a very small gap though.
But it arguably destroys the whole sense of design.
Kind of heartbreaking for that product designer.
It seems that the product managers at Midea are not yet capable of building a product of this caliber.
(For the after-sales lady's feedback of course can not ask too much, but when I heard the after-sales said that all individuals of this product are like this, not only I bought this one has a problem, her disbelief and as a matter of fact emotions make me understand that the United States can not ask too much) 2019-7-7 water pump failure of the water out of the small amount of water, has been the second time to repair the first time two weeks after the first repair is broken again.
It's a great deal after the deal, Amazon's fake deals are sad
Purchased for baby's first week of life and is super insulated.
The outside of the pot can not feel a trace of heat, that is, not afraid of scalding people can also effectively protect the temperature does not spread.
After a night the air conditioned room still manages to stay very warm.
Amazon said that the anniversary activities 320 big discount, and then found that everyone 249,289,299 have, instantly have a sense of being cheated, but went to the supermarket to compare still more cost-effective than the same price of a variety of miscellaneous brands, and in the future out of the car can be carried with the car.
Vitamix Vitamix 6300
I have been watching for a long time, and when I saw USAA 6300 on sale and Central Asia Overseas Purchase for the same price, I rushed to do it.
Ordered on September 2nd, expected arrival was the 21st, and it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days ahead of schedule, which is really fast!
The box is not big, directly with the original packaging of Vitamix, Amazon is not afraid of falling across the ocean and breaking it!
The machine looks pretty new and has all the accessories, but the cups wobble so much on the base that I'm afraid the cups will fly right out of the machine when I turn it on!
Asked a friend with a 5200 and from his description it didn't seem as loose as the one I have.
The recipes that come with it are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I can't find the Chinese version online, which is a pain in the ass!
Received the goods and rushed to buy a transformer, I guess 3 days to arrive, then toss it!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
Not a big number at all!
The second Totes, 1. this one does not have an umbrella cover 2. the umbrella handle material is general 3. clearly written Large, in fact, it is a convenient umbrella for one person, two people use is probably bad enough.
Instead, the one I previously bought at USAA was able to be used by three people without stress.
I don't feel so good.
First of all, the case is not very sturdy, with the addition of a press on the deformation, second is the back of the design of the flat to prevent the box surface of the ABS scratch and does not work, again, the inside of the case is a piece of cloth wrapped, the trolley bar protrudes out of the place.... Wait, all kinds of dissatisfaction, and finally the zipper is a little unsmooth.
PS: The wheels do feel pretty good!
acceptable
Pros: this duffel bag is more sophisticated and looks durable.
Cons: The QR code on the card can't be scanned (what the heck), the 15.6" laptop won't fit (can it be a little longer?), and this duffel bag zippers up but doesn't have a lock for the buyer, which isn't serviceable.
Overall okay, don't know if it's real leather or not
The overall feel is ok, I can't comment blindly without recognizing if it's real leather or not.
It can hold A4 format documents, it has held 80 pages thick, but too thick and too hard boxy objects (that can't be deformed) are not expected to fit.
The bag is soft and the inside inner pocket separation is more user friendly, still quite good.
Just the one I got has a small grit on the bottom, I don't know if it's just my bad taste or?
Too lazy to toss back and forth for a replacement, bear with me.
Overall a four star, still worth it.
ForRoyal has taken the world by storm Camera Strap SLR Strap
This strap is designed to be more scientific, hanging double shoulder, practical, and the chest is a soft material to fix and protect the camera, unlike other fast shooters with screws to fix the bottom of the injured camera, and remove the photography is also very convenient.
garbage aftermarket
I bought the instrument a month and a half ago, missing a part, notified Amazon and gave me the after sales number, after many communications, the part has not been received yet, what kind of efficiency is this!
I guess there are problems afterward repair more trouble, expect good after-sales friends or detour, too much trouble!
Minor flaws, good tone.
The headstock is defective and missing a corner, it feels defective and there are no freebies, but it's good enough for the price and the instrument sounds good.
It's okay. First face sheet.
I've been using it for a long time, and it's generally good, except for the bass not coming out.
It's just that the workmanship isn't as perfect as I thought it would be.
The first time I bought it, there was something wrong with the thing, all the lights were blinking and it didn't work.
Asked to exchange the goods, the result of the goods to Shanghai are three days, and still not delivered.
Calls to delivery were not answered.
The courier company said they only had that contact information.
Amazon can't find a place to complain.
Didn't ask for it, delayed delivery somehow delayed delivery at my request-such a text message came through.
Later on, it says something about transit problems.
Extremely poor shopping experience anyway, starting to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
Probably won't get it today.
Labels are too sticky and not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, but the printout is not waterproof, and the surface is not laminated; and the label adhesion is very poor, for cable labels at all, very easy to fall off, buy for organizing the cable friends need to pay attention to it.
The pen is ok, but the package is too skimpy, just a cardboard box with no protection whatsoever, and the box that holds the pen is stuck on with a big piece of clear adhesive, and the adhesive is all over the box when you tear it off.
This is how you treat a six hundred dollar item, very disappointing purchase.
No problem with the pen though.
I hope to improve more on the packaging in the future!
The quality is excellent, but for writing, it's not as good as 925-25.
Let's start by praising Daily Express, air parts, super fast and great service!
Have been using 925-25, very good, just received the 925-85, the quality of the pen is not to say, the style is also very beautiful, the reason why I gave four stars because the pen is a little heavy, not suitable for fast writing, the cap to adjust the length of the lead core a little wobbly, personal opinion: the 925-25 to be smoother than the 85.
That's how you become a die-hard Amazon fan.
Bought it at a super discounted price and it turns out the kid doesn't like the point and click pen.
It was unpacked, tried to request a return, and was actually picked up free of charge.
It's awesome.
Not advocating returns, but such a service is the only one of its kind in China.
Hopefully it won't be abused.
For future books, all shifted positions to buy here.
The headphones are off-key, and there's a murmur
These headphones are real garbage, I don't know if it's just my ears or if this headset really isn't what it used to be.
I purchased a blue one two years ago in a certain easy, the sound quality is not bad no noise bass is also good, with more than two years with bad intend to buy another (urbeats ), after all, the feeling is not bad.
Looked again out for a purple one that was pretty nice, but ended up buying this one and opening it up today only to feel that something was wrong, one side was loud and the other small.
At first I thought it was because of the sound effect of the song did not think much, but then listened to half a day I realized that this problem is very serious, not only partial sound, bass effect is not as good as my previous one sounds, there is a little noise, is it only I bought this purple have this phenomenon? Or is it just the purple color that I bought? Or is it just the manufacturing process of headphones that is not working?
Quite a poor review, very disappointing.
I must return it tomorrow during the day.
PS Nice face value.
This AV amplifier has a complicated setup, rough exterior workmanship and high heat generation.
The sound will have to be reviewed after a while!
Just got the German version of the DN1080 on August 14th. at first glance the outer workmanship is so poor.
1. front panel, knobs are plastic.
2. Rear panel audio input jacks, speaker output terminals are poor, randomly find a 1000-2000 CD amplifier all-in-one machine is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is rather thin, my transformer side is also concave, had to open the box to recover by hand, the top cover and the front panel combined loosely.
4. The whole machine's center of gravity is skewed towards the transformer end, making it awkward to move.
It feels like a SONY entry model machine, with that workmanship, out of Malaysia.
It feels like Sony is going to be a lot better than Pony to put it in China for OEM.
5. Machine heat, watch a movie with two channels for about 2 hours on the top cover with a hand to 40-50 ℃, I do not know if the transformer is too large heat.
Nowadays, with more switching power supplies, this stupidly large transformer is estimated to be 4KG.
Sony should have used an active cooling silent fan inside the machine, out of the box all you see is large aluminum plate heatsinks on the tubes.

I haven't opened it.
Batteries are in use.
Would love to dissect it and see what's in its belly.
Then I thought, it would be a shame to spend so much money in case I was disappointed when I took it apart, and in case I was happy with it when I took it apart, it would be hard to put it back together again, and I wouldn't feel good about using it.
Never mind, let's say Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed description of the power level, the average person will look at it and get weak in the heart.
I'm ok with that, I've worked in a cell phone factory for a long time, and I'm kind of a half battery engineer except I don't understand the circuits, so I can hold my own.
be pleased beyond one's expectations
I really didn't have a clue before I bought it until I opened the package and it felt right!
Finally when I touched the headphone cable, it felt particularly flexible, the quality is too good, I can't wait to plug it into my phone and open qq music.
I was stunned that the sound quality was even surround 3D!
I've asked at brick and mortar communication stores and it's about the same 30 or so, but it's by no means a Pinsent brand, it's a miscellaneous one, so I'd say this Pinsent, although it's 27 bucks, is definitely worth owning for the price!
Worst online shopping experience
After the order was placed on September 28th, the system showed that it had been shipped, but as a result, I waited until October 12th and still did not receive the goods.
Checking the status of the Amazon order, the seller did not provide a courier number to find out where the order is.
So emailed the seller to ask if he could provide a courier number, and after two days there has been no reply.
I had no choice but to call Amazon customer service, who told me the seller's cell phone number, and I called the store again to ask for it, and after a couple of times, the call went through, and I was told that the delivery was lost, and that I could re-send me another one right away.
Although I was particularly angry, I didn't say much to the seller as long as it was sent to me immediately since I needed the computer in a hurry.
As a result, I called the next day and asked if it had shipped.
The seller said not yet, and that it would not be sent until this afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon to ask, and the seller said he would definitely send it and ship it after 5 or 6 p.m., but when I called at 7 p.m., the phone was unanswered.
I called again the third morning and asked if the shipment had been sent.
Can I have the order number now?
The seller said it didn't ship and told me to order it from someone else if I was in a hurry and that it would ship this afternoon if it could wait.
There's no way around it, it's another long wait to order from another house.
Just have to ask the seller to hurry up and ship.
Finally after numerous follow up phone calls I received my computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, because I bought it for someone else, I'll add a comment later.
I just bought it half a year ago and didn't use it a few times, now it's already making bad contact, asking if I can give it a fix?
I haven't used it much a couple times since I bought it because I have a desktop.
I've used it a couple of times in my travel bag.
Recently, I noticed that when I turn it on, it doesn't charge, and I need to hold the charger and cord connection from side to side a couple of times with my hand to get it to charge.
Suspect poor contact at the connector, not sure if I can give it a fix now?
Strongly recommend that Amazon discontinue EMS !
Five stars for the item, one for the logistics, and three for the average.
I don't understand why Amazon wants to send EMS, which is recognized as unreliable in the industry, well, computers are at least valuables!
The order after purchase showed that delivery was expected on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four or five days to send from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
The morning of the 22nd check logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, ready to happily receive the goods, as a result, the evening in the case of not receiving any phone calls, text messages, a check of logistics, surprisingly, at noon on the signing of the receipt, but also shows the person signing the receipt!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
It's almost skeptical, okay!
It took a final run to the collection point to get the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier boy to the two single number reversed, well in the pieces are not lost even if.
I highly recommend Amazon not to use EMS anymore, and I will definitely not buy from Amazon in the future if they use EMS for delivery.
It's not bad.
First of all say a just bought a few days to find the price drop, poor evaluation, this is not bad, cost-effective, cpu and graphics card is enough to cope with mainstream online games and a considerable portion of the large single machine, the heat dissipation is very good, but the screen is a little bit of light leakage (ips screen of the common disease), the sound quality is not very good, the hard disk is not good (recommend that you spend some money to add a solid state), yesterday, took the after-sales testing of the hardware, there is no problem, comes with the Win8.1 is not very good, it is recommended to upgrade to 10, the seller shipped very quickly, the various inquiries answered very quickly, received the computer the next day the invoice arrived, it is good, but unfortunately what gifts are not.
(By the way buy keyboard film must not go to a treasure a store called E cool digital center to buy, slow delivery poor quality, product problems do not refund or exchange, the boss is also full of swear words, special exposure)
The stuff is great, the platform bureaucrats remain
Hard disk quality is very good, the price is absolutely high, cheaper than buying in Hong Kong, not urgent and can tolerate the logistics of the words absolutely recommended to buy.
But it has to be said that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains the same, no improvement from a few years ago when I swore I'd never use it, you can never find out the actual logistics status, the information will always be delivered a few weeks later, you can never complain, it's that bureaucratic!
It's been a few days since the shipment was received and the logistics information is still that you will receive the shipment in 10 or so days!
Logistics is not a concern
Delivered in this condition, not only the packaging is flattened, the electrical packaging is also open, and I do not know whether there is no transfer of packages.
FYI
Haven't tried it yet, always trust Philips, hope the battery life is longer than other brands.
Googled it and it's probably a common problem with water ingress and there's no warranty.
Depression!
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and continue to use it, I wonder how long it will last?
Buying someone else's disassembled
More than three hundred machines to more than one hundred tax is indeed higher, see now more than six hundred heart balance more.
Received when the sealing tape state looked very wrong, like dismantled, rushed to take a picture first, sure enough a tear on the open, open the cardboard inside there is damage, worried that it is someone else's return, has not yet come to the anniversary of the rush to give the husband to try out first, the results of the machine a bit of electricity, fortunately, the head of the knife inside there is no scruff, or not all the way back how to return it ah!
Whether it's good or not or whether there will be any short-term problems is unknown, and as the previous comment suggests, it's really not a good idea to send something out when it's out of stock!
Upper-middle level of experience
Almost top electric, there are many cleaning modes, but few people will change different modes of brushing every day, right?
Used it for 6 months with no problems, brushed it every day and flushed it almost 1+ weeks.
Brush head accessories are just as cheap to buy on Amazon.
App is a bit hard to use, other than changing the colors and all that, it seems like the compatibility issues are due to the overseas version?
I hope to learn from the Dhamma.
Great value for money
It has been used 3-4 times.
1. Packaging is in good condition.
2, very simple to use and easy to clean.
3. Totally DIY haircut and save money.
IMO, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes.
The last time I bought two packages, it was actually two different versions, originally the word on the bottom left corner of the package was green, but it turned out that one package wasn't, it was a white word, and as a result, the cat had diarrhea when she ate it.
Whether the Amazon source is a fake, or the shipment was dropped by an employee, I can't say for sure.
I will buy it again and if it's still a fake, I'm going to go after the people involved with you.
It's the horizontal bar!
The Amazon picture shows a slash, but it turns out to be sent to me with a horizontal bar, isn't that a scam?
The effect is okay.
Cats like to eat, that's the point.
And it does work.
Tight, narrow, hoops the feet and rubs the instep.
Not recommended.
1.UN is the most comfortable line of clarks, unfortunately this one is so bad.
ADDITIONAL: I compared the previous UN series insoles today (shoes thrown away pads kept), the material is a lot worse than before, not as flexible, not as breathable, just fake soft.
2. I don't have a high instep, and the pinch is about 3 centimeters forward of the highest part of the instep.
3. Purchased three pairs of clarks overseas and only one pair fit.
Scared me so much I deleted all my favorites of its music.
Back to try rockport, no can only go to ecco brick and mortar.
Substandard and poor quality control
First of all, it's worth recognizing that Prime Overseas Ups is very powerful, the order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.
The color of the shoes looks much better than the picture and the leather feels good.
Shoe size is slightly larger, 25 foot length 10.5 wide shot 7.5W, slightly loose on the foot, but usually like to wear a little loose, pad a pair of insoles just right.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not complimentary, one sole rubber is broken, the other vamp has all kinds of scuff marks and a pinhole, the vamp and the sole of the joint strip misalignment, obvious substandard!
Kind of regret it!
Got it for 280 bucks doing an event, that's a pretty good price for Asics, and of course there are even lower prices reading the reviews.
Now for the shoes, the pros: the shoes are very light, they are quite comfortable to run in and they fit better, they are not flimsy.
The value is great but the drawbacks are obvious: I usually wear a 40 shoe, and this time I bought a 40.5, and I got in the front of the shoe about 1 thumb away, but that doesn't really matter much.
The shoes are "narrow" and feel tight even though there is still room in the front.
One more thing, the shoes may not breathe very well, and my feet feel hot in them now.
instep (on the back of the leg)
First of all the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard kind, running shoes uk7.5,eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, Amazon love step also bought a few pairs, never appeared to be out of place, but this pair of I refer to the reviews, to buy a big one uk7, on the foot because of the big one size length is obviously long, but because of the insole is too thick, or press the back of the foot pressure of the awesome, coupled with the hiking shoes are very hard, resulting in a very difficult to get on the foot.
This is not recommended if you don't have particularly skinny kind of feet.
If you must buy them, a new insole would solve the problem, but the original insoles look so premium that it's a shame not to use them.
A very perfect purchase!
Very satisfied, very much like, Amazon overseas shopping are genuine undoubtedly, the quality is also very good, inexpensive, buy the peace of mind, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and amiable, dealing with the problem of patience and efficiency, the perfect solution to the worries, supporting the courier delivery to the door is very convenient and stable, delivery masters are very much for the sake of the customer, each time will remind the timely pickup from the courier cabinet, thank you to Amazon to provide customers with such a comfortable shopping experience! Thanks to Amazon to provide customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
Anyway, our family loves shopping at Amazon Overseas!
Definitely bad reviews!
Really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Still be careful about buying electronics on Amazon in the future.
It's been a long time coming, but I'm still here to spit it out.
I bought it in winter seconds for less than 200 and left it at home for months without using it.
When I want to use it in the spring, I found that I can't connect it with the bracelet, and the manuals of the two devices said that they support each other, and then I found out that it should be the problem of the heart rate belt, because I found other devices or I can't connect it.
Called Amazon and was told to contact the agent who told me to send the device to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After almost half a month, the item was sent back in its original packaging, even the delivery box was the same one I used when I sent it there!
There was no response or return receipt or test report!
You could at least tell if it's good or bad!
Called to ask about it and said that sending it back this way means the unit is fine and is good.
But how come I still can't connect, the agency replied: that's not their business.
Count me out, I'm too lazy to get tossed around by you guys for a 200 dollar item.
Seriously out of stock.
Very freighted.
The headband material is great.
Much better than nike.
Breathability is also good.
It's just that cap in the front.
Very fine.
Is it to be amusing?
No shade from the sun at all.
Not returning because it functions well as a headband.
Wearing it upwards doesn't block out the sun though.
But not like other headband styles.
Keep it.
Good quality item, lack of contractual spirit on Amazon's part, great delivery guy.
I require Saturday and Sunday delivery!
Amazon's rules don't allow for Saturday, Sunday deliveries.
It caused me, to drive 200 kilometers from out of town to come back and pick it up!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery man was very positive and enthusiastic.
Give credit where credit is due!
Merchandise, tried it briefly, not bad.
But I hadn't bought similar items before and couldn't compare prices!
Size Logistics
Workmanship can be, that is, logistics is too slow, the previous shoes and everything is DHL, this Apex is really... Domestic bought a lot of UA, the price is not low, feel engaged than NIKE ADIDAS grade?
It's really all the same alright, so seafood.
Size: I am 176CM, 68KG, my shoulders are wide general clothes are 180, buy M, hem slightly longer, other wear just right, I see that there are recommended S code, figure so slim? Or like tight? I think the hoodie or loose some good.
Just the right size.
Chest 99, height 184, weight 84 kilograms, purchased before consulting the customer service was told that you should buy xxl, and then read the reviews decisively into the L, after receiving the goods found that the size is just right, almost pitched.
Double 11 is quite a bit more expensive than Black Friday.
The quality of the dress is very good.
Z affordable merchandise issues are troublesome!
Ordered on the 18th, only received the goods on the 25th, Guangzhou to Beijing snail speed!
Bought the Z affordable item, the description advised of scratches, but upon receipt found 4 screws & nuts missing!
The child is not willing to return the product, thinking that the problem is not big, but accessories such small parts, the child's grandfather ran a few nearby hardware stores did not buy!
Grandpa glued it on at the end!
Looks like you can't buy Z affordable items in the future!
Poor quality toy processing
Most of the bolt holes don't line up and it's a struggle to get the bolts on, so you can see the poor quality of the machining, and I don't know how long you can play with it, because it's something that was promised to a child, and I won't return it.
The other reviews say the installation was no trouble, is this the only one I bought that had problems?
Very average.
Is it just my bad luck?
The packaging is old; the workmanship is mediocre; there's only one type of music and it's only 8 seconds long and then it repeats itself over and over again; and the action is just shaking your head and going straight ahead, with no variation whatsoever.
Not worth the price.
I'm in a hurry, so I won't return it.
Good quality toys, spit on the packaging
I got a delivery yesterday, bought from Amazon, labeled as EMS shipping, and ended up with a Tmall delivery, how many turns did that take? Amazon and Tmall are still on good terms?
And then say the packaging, is wrapped in plastic wrap a few layers, there is not even a packaging plastic bubble wrap inside, open a look, all the parts are placed in the empty box, fortunately, the quality of the toys is good, no broken parts, is too small than expected, because not with batteries, hand push often derailed, feel the track is too large on both sides of the gap, the design is not reasonable.
Good quality, fun
It's fun, the component precision is very high, exquisite workmanship, the quality is almost the same as Lego, and the price is very favorable when doing activities.
It was fun to put together, I did the assembly and my 5 year old son played with it, it was fine.
He played with it and laughed in amazement ~ he will probably continue to buy this brand of toys in the future.

Produces crappy products, sells crappy products, results in crappy service, bought six watches for my kids, one of them has an incomplete digital display of the fastest, and all six are inconsistent with the time, ranging from a dozen or so hours apart.
I contacted the manufacturer and asked them if they checked the time when the watch was put into storage. They replied that "yes", since there is, then why the time difference is so much, it must be the watch is not accurate, simply put, is the water goods products, not I say hard to hear, look, very obvious quality problems (digital display is not complete) are out to sell, is not a piece of junk goods.
I contacted the seller and the seller said a whole bunch of reasons and complained that I shouldn't have bought them in the first place. With such a product, such a seller, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.
All in all I would recommend not to buy from this seller, it's crap if you do.
Amazon Shipping Issues
Upon receiving the shipment and inspecting it, I found:
1. The table packaging is badly worn.
2. The table instructions have heavy use folds.
3, the table does not go, table lamp charging also no hair use, can not adjust the time.
4, respectively, contact Amazon customer service, can only be mailed to the United States at their own expense, after the postage.
5, 2 out of 5 because the customer service was pretty good.
I can only say it's okay.
The time is not very accurate, about a second faster each day, and after only a few months of use it's already more than two minutes faster.
I've used a Citizen before, and I feel like a year or two wouldn't be a few seconds off.

Weaknesses: the mirror surface is easy to scratch and get dust.
Cost-effective: the general price in China is between 220-300, overseas purchase to more than 180 (with about 1 week).
Very satisfied with the watch
Definitely genuine, go to the counter inspection of goods, the appearance of the table is very beautiful, fine workmanship, materials enough, coupled with the imported mechanical movement, so there is a certain weight, is that those three or four hundred so-called mechanical table can not be compared to, this is the real deal.
The watch's timekeeping is very accurate, the error is completely within the acceptable range, the table's packaging has a jewelry identification certificate, the dial's 12 words there are real diamonds, this is very suitable for their own wear, as a gift to send out is also very dignified.
Bentley watches are really nice.
Worst shopping experience ever!
September 23rd night wife's phone fell, on a whim immediately came to Amazon to order a 8p, in stock but not self-supporting and did not increase the price (heart secretly happy), because not self-supporting shipping is slow, the system shows that the latest expected receipt of goods to September 27th.
Wife did not have a cell phone to use hard to die, the next morning at 6:00 am called me to think of ways, and then on the Jingdong to see the 256G in stock can be delivered on the same day, only to immediately order another one.
The new one was purchased with the idea of canceling the Amazon order right away.
As the order was placed in the middle of the night, there is no possibility of early morning to collect the courier, more than 7 o'clock to call customer service to request the cancellation of the order, customer service replied that it has been canceled please wait for the SMS notification.
Well, I'll wait patiently, to the noon on the phone to see, the order is still in the state is still in the undelivered, immediately contact customer service request to quickly cancel the order, customer service reply has been operated OK.
By 3:00 pm on the phone to see the order is still there, there is no way to only contact customer service again to clearly inform the third call has been made, please cancel the order and notify the seller to be sure not to ship!
Customer service contacted the seller on the spot at my request and told me that the seller was unfamiliar with the system and to wait until he was familiar with the system before operating to cancel the order.
But I was clearly told that the seller already knew about it and would never ship it please don't worry.
When I looked at the order display again on Monday, I was surprised that it had already been shipped.
Unable to contact the seller directly, I had to call customer service again.
The back end of the processing is simply speechless, basically, I say a step, customer service only then operate a little.
The order is still in a delivery refusal status so far and is being prepared for delivery again!

Another point worth noting is that I have seen user reviews online saying that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, and that smaller storage capacities are not recognized, so I hope you will pay attention to this.
It feels okay to use it, I guess, the picture is acceptable, but the sound audio quality is very poor, and the machine has a certain degree of heat, and it feels a bit unacceptable to have this degree of heat if it's on all the time.
To summarize, this product has many shortcomings and I hope you will be careful when buying it.

In an August 2021 article published by Billboard magazine, it was noted that the group's fans exploited chart loopholes "through honorable means" to boost singles such as < Butter > in the U.S., helping the song reach the top of the Hot 100 singles chart for several weeks in a row; while the chart performance of the Hot 100 singles chart is usually depend on streaming and airplay, < Butter >'s chart performance was largely driven by sales (much of which came from Bulletproof's online store, which allows fans to purchase multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) and fan-led crowdfunding campaigns (including the use of fundraising from the global fanbase to make U.S.-sales-only purchases on services such as PayPal) ; However, an article in the Korea Times refuted claims of chart manipulation, arguing that similar promotional measures have been taken by the fan bases of other artists, such as Justin Jr. and Ariana Grande, and that these measures are neither illegal nor unethical, and that the fans who participate in these measures are simply "intelligent consumers who set global trends".
It is virtually certain that the last common ancestor had genes and a genetic code, and that its genes were most likely composed of DNA, which is why the last common ancestor appeared after the RNA world; in its DNA condition, its DNA code used the same four nucleotides that are used today, that is, adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T); its DNA was maintained in a double-helix structure by a template-dependent enzyme, DNA polymerases. This template-dependent enzyme maintains the double helix structure, and the DNA polymerase may be a group D polymerase; the structural integrity of the DNA depends on a class of enzymes, including DNA topoisomerases, to maintain and repair the DNA structure; in addition, if the basis of its genetic coding is DNA, this coding will be expressed through the intermediary of a single-stranded RNA, and the RNa will be generated through a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The RNa is generated by DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and the RNa is encoded using nucleic acids similar to DNA, but with the thymine of DNA replaced by uracil; in addition, the organism has a variety of histone folding proteins.

The achievement system also requires the character to reach an adventure level of 10 or more to be available, in November 2008, the latest data piece The Shadow Odyssey (TSO) officially launched, the achievement system is divided into three kinds of achievement system, career exclusive system, branching career system and TSO career system, which the Shadow Odyssey new TSO career achievement system, which is divided into the basic career line (mage, priest, scout), sub-professional branch line (warrior, knight, monk, witch doctor, priest, druid, poet, scout). Roughly divided into the basic career line, the four major professional branch line (fighter, mage, priest, scout), sub-professional branch line (warrior, knight, martial arts monk, witch doctor, priest, druid, poet, roamer, thief, warlock, summoner, illusionist), professional exclusive branch line (exclusive to each profession), each branch line must be full of points to continue to the next branch line points, which in addition to the basic career line In addition to the basic career line no special moves, the other branches have special moves, all need the branch line point full 10 points to point moves, the last career exclusive branch line has 2 moves, after pointing each will give the player the title.
Even if this amendment comes into effect, the number of general holidays overlapping with Saturdays could theoretically still be up to 5 days per year, but this situation only occurred in 1999 (in that year, the first, second and third days of the Lunar New Year and the day following the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival did not overlap with Sundays, so there was no overlapping with Saturdays, but the number of overlapping general holidays with Saturdays could still be as many as 5, which were the day following the Good Friday, the Labor Day, the Birthday of the Lord Buddha, the day following the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival, and Christmas Day). For the 36-year period from 2011 to 2046, the maximum number of general holidays overlapping with Saturdays is 4 days per year, with an average of 2.78 days, as shown in the table below (the number of general holidays for 2024 and beyond has not yet been announced, and the calculation is based on the assumption that there will be no further amendment to the General Holidays Ordinance until 2046; due to the implementation of the "one country, two systems" principle since the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on 1 July 1997, the 50-year unchanged period will expire in 2046, and the number of holidays overlapping with Saturdays will remain unchanged in 2046, as shown in the table below, Since the 50-year period of no change will expire on July 1, 2047, and the laws and systems to be implemented in Hong Kong thereafter are still unknown, no calculation will be made for 2047 and beyond).
The paradox states that there is no finite additive measure defined on the sphere whose value is equal for all mutually congruent subsets (Hausdorff also proved that there is no countably additive measure that can be defined on all subsets), and that the structure of the group consisting of rotations of the sphere plays a key role here - a claim that does not hold in the plane or on a line segment; in fact, Barnach later proved that it is possible to define an area that makes all mutually congruent subsets have equal measure for all bounded subsets of the Euclidean plane (this holds as well for lengths on the real number line); however, this only has finite additivity; and this only has finite additivity. In fact, Banach later showed that for all bounded subsets in the Euclidean plane, it is possible to define an area such that all mutually congruent subsets have equal measure (this holds for lengths on the real number line as well); however, this is only finitely additive, and therefore not a measure in the full sense of the word, but it is a measure in the sense of the property "such that all mutually congruent subsets have equal measure", and it is a measure in the sense of the property "such that all mutually congruent subsets have equal measure". For the property "such that all subsets are equal to each other have equal measure", this measure is equal to the Lebègue measure, which means that two equi-decomposable open sets in the plane or in the real numbers have the same area.
After the exploration, New Sam found three jammers and recorded their location coordinates, when he returned to the base, Old Sam happened to find the secret room where the clones were placed, the secret room was located in the ground next to the sleeper box, because he would only go back to this place, so it had not been discovered, the two Sams then went into the secret room to check it out and found that there were hundreds of Sams in it, each of them was placed in the freezer and had not yet been awakened, at the same time as New Sam continued to explore the secret room, Old Sam took the video phone out and destroyed one of the jammers and contacted Sam's family on Earth.

Some may argue that saying "corporal punishment leads to more delinquent behavior in children" is a reversal of cause and effect, and that the true cause and effect should be "more delinquent behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment"; however, research has shown that the relationship between corporal punishment and delinquent behavior is indeed "However, research shows that the relationship between corporal punishment and delinquent behavior is indeed "corporal punishment leads to more delinquent behavior in children" rather than "more delinquent behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment", and this is supported by the post hoc analysis. Furthermore, even after controlling for variables such as parents' social status, which may influence children's behaviour, the statement that "corporal punishment leads to more bad behaviour" is still true, i.e. corporal punishment itself does lead to more bad behaviour and its negative effects cannot be explained by any other possible cause; and It has also been suggested that caring and supervisory educational strategies are effective in reducing the incidence of bullying, and that ostracism, permissiveness, and corporal punishment are positively correlated with the incidence of bullying.

In 1818 Sir Raffles was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the British colony of Bencoolen. He was convinced that Britain had to find a strategic location that could outperform the then dominant Netherlands, at a time when the trade routes linking China, Great Britain, and India required a stronghold, especially for trade with China. Raffles was challenged to establish a new port within the Dutch sphere of influence, but at the time none of the British ports were suitable as trading centers, they were all too far from the Strait of Malacca, and when a large ship wanted to pass through to trade with Indochina, it had to enter through the adjacent Indian Ocean, or else through the more distant Sunda Strait. The Sunda Strait, however, is too far away from the main trading centers, and the other points have to return to the original problem of being too close to Holland, or have other problems.

The Dakivali family originally intended to take care of Malakal Falakal Falakal alone, but she cried incessantly (some say she was born mute), refused to drink milk or let the women of the family bathe her, and it was only when the family brought in the Manigai, a member of another group, that she would drink milk, and she did not cry when the Tu 'uligit family helped with bathing or changing her diapers, so the two families helped with her daily life, while the Dakivali family provided food and brought the girl home at night (some say both families' ancestors were transformed by Satan Yale with divine power in order to take care of her).

According to the current official timeline, the oldest work is Sword of Heaven and the most recent is Tears of the Kingdom (although Nintendo has yet to include this and Breath of the Wilderness in the aforementioned three timelines), but most of the series' storylines have been retrospectively revised and updated in different works in order to meet the need for the expansion of the worldview and the timeline of the game's production. The Temple of Time mentioned in 1998's Ocarina of Time, for example, is located in the temple's time portal, which is capable of traveling through time, and it was not until the 2011 release of Sword of Heaven that the origins of the temple and the time portal were explained in the plot of the game, and the two productions were released 13 years apart; this kind of flashbacks through the storyline effectively analyzes and expands and strengthens Sarda's worldview over and over again.

As the dragons gradually discovered the true identities of the Eight Demon Gods and the potential dangers of relying too much on their spells, the dragons began to develop the "Absolute Color Incarnation Talisman", which was made of a long strip of material completely different from the ordinary incarnation talisman, and the super power hidden inside could be said to be the ultimate power to restrain the ancient demons, but after the research and development was completed, the dragons' ambitions to invade the whole world created terrible monsters - the Multi-Genetic Bodies, the Beasts - but also out of control and turned back to the elven world. However, after the research and development was completed, the terrifying monsters created by the Dragon Clan's ambition to invade the whole world - the multi-genetic body, the Manticore - also went out of control, and backfired on the Elven Realm.

Since then, the civilization on earth and the elf world built into the moon have gradually lost their connection.

Most digital libraries provide a window that allows access to resources that are typically deep in the Web (or little or no resources on the Web), and these deep Web resources are often not found by people using search engines, so some digital libraries create special pages or outlets that allow most search engines to find all of their resources. Many digital libraries often utilize the Open Access (OAI-PMH) protocol to make their backfiles available to other digital libraries in order to gain access to their backfiles, and many search engines such as Google Scholar, Google, Yahoo! Google Scholar, Google, Yahoo! and Scirus can also utilize OAI-PMH to find out the information hidden in the Internet, so through this agreement, both search engines and digital libraries can benefit from this agreement, and can also make each other's correlation closer, and achieve the purpose of strengthening the characteristics of their own websites.

People have different views on whether the retention or abolition of the death penalty can be decided by public opinion; in practice, there have been governments that have left the retention or abolition of the death penalty to public opinion. California, USA, held a referendum on the death penalty in 2012, and the content of the referendum was whether or not the public supported the passage of Proposition 34, which, in simple terms, was "California abolishes the death penalty", so once the result of the referendum for the passage of Proposition 34, then California will abolish the death penalty, but if the result of the referendum for the failure to pass Proposition 34, then California will retain the death penalty; and although the party in favor of the passage of Proposition 34, the expenditure on publicity in the area of funding, is opposed to the bill more than six times, the final result of the referendum The result was that 52% of the voters were against passing the bill, while 48% were in favor of passing it, so the bill did not pass and California continued to retain the death penalty.
Meanwhile, on August 18, 87 units of the Polish 1st Armored Division, commanded by Ralph Maciek, to the east of the Canadians, captured Hill 262 (Mont-Ormel in French, The Mace in English) to prevent any counterattacks by the besieged Germans from the east, where they were also able to observe from a high vantage point the road from Chambord to Vimouchette, which was by now the only road out of the encirclement, and to attack the scattered Germans.

When the applied energy is injected into a energy level system by electric field, photon, chemical, etc. and absorbed by it, it will cause the electrons to jump from the low energy level to the high energy level. When the photons produced by spontaneous radiation meet the electrons that jumped up to the high energy level due to the applied energy, the electrons in the high energy level will be induced to move to the low energy level and release photons (the so-called stimulated radiation), and all of the optical properties of stimulated radiation are the same as those of original spontaneous radiation, including frequency, phase, and direction of advance. All the optical properties of the stimulated radiation and the original spontaneous radiation, including: frequency, phase, direction of travel, etc. will be the same, these stimulated radiation of photons encountered by other due to the addition of energy and jumped up to the high energy level of the electron, and then produce more of the same photons, and finally the intensity of the light more and more (i.e., the energy of the light has been amplified), and with the general difference between light is that all the photons have the same frequency, phase (isotonicity), the direction of travel.

On the eve of World War II, German firearms engineers conducted research on assault rifles, and concluded that the existing 8mm Mauser rifle rounds, although the range of more than 800 meters, but the long range is difficult to play in actual combat, the scope is not a popular equipment, most of the soldiers' marksmanship is not up to the level of snipers, and the high rate of fire can be used to suppress the enemy in melee, but the existing rifle rounds are too heavily weighted in the range, although powerful, but recoil is also too great. However, the existing rifle cartridges were too range-oriented, and although they were powerful, they had too much recoil, making it difficult to hold them stably if they were to be used in full-automatic fire, and the hitting rate in burst fire was so low as to be impractical. Therefore, there was the idea of reducing the charge of the existing 8mm Mauser cartridges, and the idea of shortening the length of the cartridges not only to reduce the recoil, but also to reduce the weight. This shortened version was introduced in 1938, with a diameter of 7.92mm and a length of about half that of the previous Mauser cartridge.
There are also dances for special occasions, such as the "Victory Dance," which is danced to celebrate victory in a war and to praise achievements, the "Friendship Dance," which is danced to socialize with neighbors and friends, the "Ghost Dance," which is danced to call on the spirits of the ancestors to fight together with the spirits of the dead warriors, which is danced to pray for or give thanks for a good harvest, or the "Boo Dance," which is danced to pray for the expulsion of diseases or white people. There was also the "Ghost Dance" which called upon the spirits of ancestors and dead soldiers to fight together after contact and war with the white man, the "Corn Dance" which was danced when praying for or thanking for a good harvest, and the "The Booger Dance" which was danced when praying for the expulsion of disease or the white man. "The Booger was a Cherokee demon, and the Booger Dance was usually performed indoors, with some of the invitees wearing snake masks symbolizing the Booger (the horns of the demon were added after contact with the white man) and using aliases to indicate that they (the Boogers) were not meant to harm mankind, but rather to dance, and peacefully inviting the Boogers to leave at the end of the dance.
Litter bucket toilets first began to spread in the Denver, Colorado, school district, which has had a number of school shootings, and when an emergency such as a shooting occurs at a school, police ask teachers and students to take shelter in their classrooms until the police have cleared the campus to make sure it's safe to come out, and the head of security for Jefferson County Public Schools, John McDonald, said the idea was proposed several years ago when a school in the area was on lockdown for several hours after a shooting threat, so much so that students needing to use the toilet had to settle for using trash bags and garbage cans, and that the district began outfitting classrooms with kitty litter-based portable toilets after the April 2019 shooting threat, and that Diana Wilson, a spokeswoman for the district's public schools, said the majority of Teachers are supportive of the decision, and the kitty litter bucket toilets have been added to Denver's list of teacher rations, along with items such as pop-up tents and first aid kits.
After the demise of Balariyuru, the location of the tribe became a place for the Haocha tribe to grow miscellaneous grains, and the remains of the ancient city can still be seen today, but the whereabouts of the remnants are not known at all; on the other hand, the Karihi tribe, although regaining its independence and rebuilding its home, also perished under a landslide and a great flood caused by a heavy rainfall, and only some people in the present-day Wutai Tribe (located in the Wutai Township Only in the present Wutai Tribe (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township), there are some people who claim to be the descendants of Karihi; in addition, because of leading the Tribe to win the war, the descendants of the Bo Leng, Dalapa Zhoujia (Dalapathan, also known as Druluane and phonetically translated as "Lu Ruan"), is also known as the "head of the military achievements.

The initial cluster of infections caused by cabin crew in late December 2021 was of the Omicron variant, and the viral gene sequencing showed that they were both of the earlier Omicron variant strain BA.1, whereas the cluster of infections caused by quarantine hotels in early January 2022 was of the Omicron variant strain BA.2, which is an Omicron variant but has 10 different mutations in the spine proteins. Although they are both Omicron variant viruses, they have 10 different mutations in the spiking proteins. Preliminary studies in the United Kingdom and Denmark have shown that subtype BA.2 is more infectious than subtype BA.1, and that subtype BA.2 leads to a higher rate of breakthrough infections in two- and three-dose vaccinated individuals, but that those who are vaccinated may have a reduced chance of transmitting it to other individuals, whereas there have already been 12 people infected in the first generation of transmission in the quarantine hotel cluster, showing that the Omicron variant strain is the most infectious strain of Omicron variant virus in the world. The first generation of transmission in the quarantined hotel group has already reached 12 people, suggesting that the Omicron variant strain BA.2 subtype is more infectious than previous strains found in Hong Kong and is more difficult to stop from spreading widely.

During the later years of his Anastasius' reign, he realized that his days were numbered, and he had three living relatives, but Anastasius didn't know who would be the most suitable heir, so he summoned the three relatives to a room with three couches, and one of them had a letter hidden underneath it, and the one who chose the right couch would be eligible to be the heir, however, two of the relatives were sitting on the same couch, and the However, two of the relatives sat on the same couch, while the other sat on another couch, but the couch with the envelope was not chosen, so Anastasius had another idea at this time, whoever was the next person to walk in, would be the heir, and the person who walked in was Justin, the captain of his guards, and although Anastasius did not expect Justin to be the heir, he was satisfied with the result, and Justin became the emperor as a result.
The Japanese Navy had been ordered to blockade Hong Kong waters, the British torpedo boat fleet sailed to the waters east of the Blue Pool Channel, it was found by the Japanese fir-class destroyer and Hong-type torpedo boat Magpie, due to the gap between the two sides of the firepower is very far, Chen Ce then instructed the torpedo boat fleet lined up to meet the Japanese ship at high speed, pretending to be about to launch a torpedo attack on the Japanese ship, in fact, at that time, in order to lighten the load of the torpedo boat and to try to carry a lot of points, and to avoid the danger of explosion when the torpedo was hit by gunfire, so they were not carrying torpedoes. In fact, the torpedo boats at that time in order to reduce the weight and try to carry more people, and in order to avoid the danger of explosion after the torpedo was hit by the gunfire, so they did not carry torpedoes, but the Japanese ship saw the torpedo boat fleet to come to the raging, they will be fooled and to take evasive maneuvers, the torpedo boat fleet therefore get rid of the Japanese ship interception, the fleet passed through the Fruit Island Islands, and then turned to the Dapeng Bay, and finally Chen Ce, and so on more than 70 people in Dapeng Peninsula, Nan'ao landing, and then the British and Chinese personnel will be quickly all the torpedo boats chiseled and sunk, to avoid the landing place was After that, the Chinese and British quickly sunk all the torpedo boats to avoid the disembarkation site being discovered and followed by the Japanese, and then fled to Huizhou, Guangdong Province by land.
Buddhism rejects some of the Brahminical views, for example, in the Sutra of the Buddha, the bodhisattva questions why the god Brahma allows suffering and evil to run rampant, similar to the problem of evil, and some Buddhists have also denied the existence of the god Brahmacharya on the level of rationale, so Buddhism does not believe that the meaning of life comes from the king of the sky, the king of the Mahavamsa, who is still trapped in the cycle of reincarnation, and also denies that the Mahavamsa is the original source of all things, thinking that the Mahavamsa is only one of the five appearances of Nirvana. The Buddha is only one of the five Nirvana, so some Hindu theologians later accused Buddhism of promoting nihilism, but Buddhism refuted this claim, believing that the root of all things is "emptiness," and that it is emptiness that allows all things to appear and change, and that meaning is constantly born with karmic origins and extinguished by karmic extinctions, and that therefore everything in the world is not meaningless, but rather meaningless because of the absence of meaning. Therefore, everything in the world is not meaningless, but rather meaning cannot exist forever due to impermanence.

The Camel was developed from the Puppy fighter of the same company, with a larger, heavier and more powerful air-cooled Star engine, the Camel's power was increased from the Puppy's 80 hp to 130 hp, and the machine gun in the nose was increased from one to two, of course, it was also fitted with a synchronized firing system copied from the German, and in order to prevent the machine gun from jamming due to the cold at high altitude a fairing was added, which was originally called the "Big Dog", but due to the shape of the fairing, it was renamed the "Camel". Originally, the plane was called "Big Dog", but due to the protruding shape of the fairing, the plane was renamed "Camel", which increased the weight of the nose, but the horizontal tail did not increase in size, which caused the Camel to be unstable with a tendency to nod its head in flight, which was difficult for pilots who were new to flying the Camel. This made the Camel unstable in flight, making it difficult for new pilots to fly, but veteran pilots were able to take advantage of the instability and increase the Camel's agility in air combat.
After more than two decades of great success, the uncharacteristically rapid decline in the national team's performance afterwards was unacceptable to many fans, in part because fans could not accept such a sudden rate of decline in the national team's performance; the Greek national basketball team lost the 1999 and 2001 European Championships and lost their berths to the Sydney Olympics and 2002 World Championships, and the poor performance led to problems in the relationship between the team and the Greek Basketball Federation. The poor results led to problems in the relationship between the team and the Greek Basketball Federation, and eventually the Greek National Basketball Team underwent a major restructuring before the 2003 European Championships, with the hiring of a new coach, Ioannidis, and the promotion of a new batch of young players, which was partially successful, with the Greek team finishing fifth in the 03 European Championships, but the public wasn't quite satisfied, as fifth place was still a long way from success.

The leukemia-inducing system is a complex episodic mechanism, a multi-stage evolutionary process, which is also the key to its carcinogenicity of only 5% of the incidence of cancer, in which the virus first binds to the CD4+ cells and activates the infected cells, the cell membrane expresses the IL-2 receptor, and then by the role of the viral reverse transcriptase to form the viral DNA, and integrated in the host cell chromosome to form a provirus; in the role of the viral tax genes. Under the action of viral tax gene, the genes of IL-2 and its receptor in CD4+ cells start to be abnormally expressed, so that the infected cells proliferate in large numbers, and the host cells with the virus can be transformed into different cell replicas due to the diversity of the integration site of viral DNA, and in the process of cell proliferation, a certain replicated cell DNA mutates and evolves into leukemia cells, which in turn form the replica of leukemia cells.

Zengwen Reservoir is located in the Zengwen Creek Basin with a total length of 138.47 kilometers and a basin area of 1,176 square kilometers, which is the fourth largest river in Taiwan, with an average annual flow of 1.6 billion cubic meters, and an average annual flow of 1.064 billion cubic meters at the dam site location. Early on, the Japanese technician who designed the Chia Nan Canal, Yatta and Yichi, used the upper reaches of the Guantian River, which is a tributary of the Zengwen Creek, to build the Wu-shantou Reservoir and set up a dam at the Dapu Creek.

Although consensus is not the most important thing in a democracy, the Federation Council, which is the upper house of Congress, has had difficulty in forging a significant consensus, and thus has had difficulty in passing any resolutions; instead, bills are more likely to be passed after debates with the chairman or the committees, and legislators themselves are asked not to react to the party's original ideology by imposing it on their deliberations.

In addition, based on the fact that the number of chiefs of the Shekmakan tribe is quite different from that of the Zhimen tribe (when the Zhimen tribe has passed on to the fifteenth or sixteenth generation since Xihasiho, the Shekmakan tribe has passed on to sixty generations since Dugu), some people judge that the Shekmakan tribe adopts a system of inheritance in which "the eldest dies and the youngest takes over, and then passes it on to the next generation of the eldest", which is also very similar to the customs of the Paiwan. This is very similar to the custom of the Paiwan.

Traditional digital modulation and division of labor using frequency division of labor, through different frequency bands to transmit different information, OFDM will be a whole band divided into several sub-carriers (sub-carrier), and let each sub-carrier orthogonal to each other, so that they do not overlap with each other in the frequency spectrum, which can reduce the interference, and its mode of operation in the transmission side of the signal placed in the frequency domain (frequency), through the inverse Fourier transform (IDFT) converted to the time domain (time domain), and through the increase of cyclic prefix (cyclic), and through the increase of cyclic prefix (cyclic). The way it works is that the signal is placed in the frequency domain at the transmitting end, and then converted to the time domain through Inverse Fourier Transformation (IDFT), and then transmitted by adding a cyclic prefix, while at the receiving end, the cyclic prefix is removed from the signal, and then the signal in the time domain is converted back to the frequency domain through Fourier Transformation (DFT) to decode the original transmitted signal.

Early descriptions of Cryptomycetes were that they were parasitic on the surface of host cells, lacked a cell wall, and were morphologically similar to potybacteria, with atypical patterns and intracellular parasitic life histories; however, there are many drawbacks to this classification. However, this characteristic applies to many other eukaryotes and is not exclusive to cryptic fungi. Whether Rhizobium is representative of the genus is also open to discussion, as the life history of cryptic fungi is still poorly understood, and it is not clear whether the majority of species can have both cell-surface and intracellular parasitism, and therefore Rhizobium may not be atypical of the genus in terms of its phenotype and life history.

Since most of the metaphysical novels come from Internet writers, they are published on the Internet at the same time they are written, and they often change their styles during the serialization process in order to adapt to the audience (because they have the possibility of instantly expressing their opinions, so they are more like the audience than the readers), and these changes may make the contents of the novels often inconsistent, but as long as the plot is well arranged and reasonable, they don't have to distinguish between the categories of the works, and they can be categorized as fantasy novels.

This is not reasonable, because a good nib is often a high-grade fountain pen and a certain weight, followed by the need to write hard to press the nib and make the effect of coarse and young, but the ballpoint pen only although the paper on the soft material to write, but also can be done, the ballpoint pen tends to be better for the effect of hard calligraphy, play the space is greater, but the different text writing skills to a certain degree of understanding, the need for the penman to have more observation, the fountain pen calligraphy needs is speed, because of water-based ink nib writing can not write too slowly and stop for too long, this alone is far less lightweight than the pen.

Chapter 1
Hao Ren, as his name suggests, is a good man.
His family lives in a little-known northern city, if Beijing intends to build a twenty ring thirty ring can barely be regarded as the foot of the sky, if the whole world's good man card according to the harmony of counting on his head, barely also be regarded as the world, walking on the road no one recognized, with a top in addition to a little bit of manhood outside of how to look at how to look at the ordinary four square big face for twenty years, life goal is to be a good man, and no other characteristics - this is him. Other than that, he has no character - that's him.
Although the weather in the north is a little cooler, but if you walk on the road in the daytime with a big sun also makes people very irritable, so the city center of the traffic can be seen everywhere in all kinds of vehicles running, but do not see how many pedestrians walking outside, and wearing a white T-shirt, gray pants, the face of an ordinary tall young man is exactly one of the few pedestrians.
Hao Ren felt that this year's students were becoming more and more unprofessional, when he was working outside handing out folders he never stuffed this kind of thing into the hands of a gentleman who could tell at a glance that he was a bachelor, but anyway, this kind of rigid folding fan is still quite appropriate.
"The last two, if it doesn't work, forget it." Hao Ren muttered and looked at the last two job advertisements in his hand, fortunately, these two places are next to each other, he can quickly fix today's "task", and one of them is right in front of the other, is an advertising company from the appearance of the strength of the company can not be seen, but the signboard in front of the person's house is loud and clear ah: the Galaxy Media pan-cultural development and promotion company, the name is the goods that will go down in six months, the main purpose is not to apply, is to see what can come up with such a big strength. Hearing this name is a half a year will fall goods, Hao Ren was rushing to this name, the main purpose is not to apply for a job, just want to see can come up with such a magical name of the company owner will be what kind of strange people.
He was excited to walk several hundred meters to bypass the road guardrail, and then ran to the front of this particularly awesome name of the advertising company in front of the sun, was surprised to find - the company really closed down, the signboard still hangs in front of the door, but the glass door is posted on the notice of closure, the date of the two days ago, and his hand of the recruitment notice is It was four days ago ...... This is really a fast-changing world, this year the company closed down two days before the incident to recruit two new employees to pressure the shock?
Smoothly rubbing the advertising company's recruitment notice into a ball and throwing it into the trash can by the side of the road, Hao Ren looked down at the last copy and rubbed it into a ball and threw it into the same place two seconds later as well, reflecting in the meantime on whether or not he was blind when he sifted through the thing two days ago - the public transportation company is recruiting an office clerk, requiring twenty-five to forty years old, capable of Hard-working computer literate work experience is preferred, gender female.
He clutched the thing and went downtown with gusto, just to see how bright the glass doors of an advertising agency that was busy hiring two days before it went out of business was, literally, eating out of the palm of his hand.
Hao Ren, gender male, hobby female, age twenty-five years old, no ** hobby, the advantage is not picky about food, currently single, not a few friends and relatives, living by himself in the old city south of the old town parents left the old house, and most of the young men, his life goal is to do when twenty-five years old to make more than ten thousand per month, to marry a beautiful daughter-in-law, if you can, it is best to have a car, the parents are no way to filial piety, so at least to live well enough to be considered not a shame to his family, now a series of goals have been completed one-third: he is this year twenty-five years old. Parents are not able to filial piety, so at least to live well enough in order to not be considered a disgrace to the family, and now this series of life goals have been completed one-third: he is twenty-five years old this year.
It's such a sad story.
He came to the city today to look for a job, but in fact, he didn't have any urgent personal need for a source of livelihood: as mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lived in an old house left behind by his parents, and he should be thankful for the family property left behind by the older generation, at least it was quite big - it was a two-storey old-fashioned house, which had already been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment. apartment structure.
For a number of years, Hao Ren has been living by renting a house out, just because the place where he lives is really remote, even remote to the extent that if he wants to wait for the demolition of the old house, I'm afraid that he will have to lay down a few ten-year plans.
In all fairness, with this kind of stable income Hao Ren is not necessary to come out to look for any job, but this person na, idle time too long will be a little bit pretentious, always feel that they should be a little bit of hard work, open up the path of life, plus the more important reason - their own old house is really too remote, remote to the degree of almost out of human civilization, and the old house is too remote, remote to the degree of human civilization. Since the last migrant couple moved out from the rental house, no one has come to rent the house for half a year in a row. Looking at the empty two-storey "apartment" for several months in a row, Hao Ren realized one thing from the bottom of his heart: unless the municipal planning is tilted towards his side, he is afraid that he can only come out to look for a job if he wants to live.
After three days of studying the city planning at home, Hao Ren thought that the possibility of turning the area around his house into a commercial center overnight was really unlikely. Considering that as a big man, he couldn't waste himself on this, he finally decided to look for a job first, at least he had an income to maintain his life.
How to say that back then he was also working to earn tuition fees of hard-working good man, Langlang Kunlun still can not starve to death their own?
But fate does not shift by human will, he this first day outside blindly running basically ...... is only blindly running.
It was useless to think so much, Hao Ren stretched his waist and decided to take a rest under the shade benches in the small park by the roadside, and wait for the hottest hour of noon before finding a small restaurant to fill up his stomach, and then take the car home.
Even though the economy was growing quite fast, this place still managed to maintain a little bit of small place idleness and openness. He found a piece of paper and wiped the bench clean, then lay down with a big smile, covering his face with the folded sheet with the logo of the women's hospital and the pretty girl to shield his face from the sunlight, and just rested without a care in the world.
But just when he had just laid down for what seemed like not even a minute, the sunlight that poured in through the edges of the folded pages had already dimmed, as if someone had come next to him. Hao Ren was slightly surprised to reveal his face, and was shocked to find that the sun was already setting in the west, and a petite and slim female figure was standing next to him, this figure was just enough to block the setting sun that was already sinking, and because he couldn't see the female's appearance against the light, he could only confirm that the other party was a short-haired slim girl through a dim outline.
"Yo, you're awake?"
At this time the strange girl also seemed to finally realize that her position standing against the light made it difficult for people to see her appearance, so she grinned a little and slightly turned her body sideways so that the other party could see her appearance.
A very pretty girl-that was Hao Ren's first impression.
This self-centered girl had a short shawl hair, probably because she liked sports a lot, her skin was slightly wheat-colored, healthy and full of sunshine, her appearance was beautiful and lovely, the most noticeable thing was the pair of big soulful eyes, which were more energetic than any pair of eyes Hao Ren had ever seen, it was as if the whole person's essence was going to come out from these eyes.
And behind her was a large, rather substantial looking suitcase.
Looking at Hao Ren who was a bit dazed, this short-haired pretty girl bloomed a unprecedentedly bright smile (although it seems to be a bit inappropriate to say so, but Hao Ren did think it was a silly smile), that smile was clean and pure, nowadays it seems that you can seldom see in the face of a girl of the same age, the other party in the accompanying small bag vigorously digging and feeling for half a day, and finally touched a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Hao Ren. In front of him, "Excuse me, do you know where this place is?"
Hao Ren slapped his face to wake himself up, not caring about what's going on with this bubbly girl for the moment, but instead looking down at the address on the paper ...... Ewww I go isn't this his own home?
Chapter 1
The shimmering light of the early morning pierced the inky blue dome of the sky, the pale sky, flooded with fish-belly white.
Xian Yu County, Martial Sect Academy, in the forest in the back of the mountain, a slim teenager clad in loose martial arts robes, crouched down with his double plates, his tongue against his teeth, his whole body's strength focused on his left and right fists, blasting and hitting the human thick tree.
The boxing style is smooth and free, the internal energy is contained but not spat out, and there is already some fire in the rigidity and softness.
The young man was named Su Yu, fourteen years old, clean and handsome, with a straight and boyish posture.
Between the black hair lightly raised, a pair of eyes as vast as stars and as deep as the starry sky of the ages displayed a wisdom that did not match his age.
Three hours later, the sun was high in the sky.
Su Yu stopped punching, looked down at his bloodstained fists, and sighed softly, "I'm working twice as hard as other people, but I'm reaping less than half the effect of those with superior qualifications."
"Coming to the other world, I really don't know, is it a blessing or a curse?"
Two months ago, Su Yu took an airplane and was unfortunate enough to be involved in a plane crash, and when he woke up with a start, he realized that he had traveled to a world called the Divine Moon Continent.
Become a student of some martial arts academy in the middle of the continent.
It took two whole months for him to digest the original owner's memories.
The Divine Moon Continent, where martial arts were honored, the weak were the strong, and the cruelty was severe.
Human beings cultivate martial arts and reach the peak of the transcendental realm.
Wudao is divided into nine levels, each of which has, three levels: minor accomplishment, major accomplishment, and peak.
When one transcends the ninth level of martial arts and breaks the shackles, one leaps into a god and becomes a mythological figure, known as the "Holy King of the Earth".
The Human Saint King realm was the ultimate in martial arts, the limit that billions of humans pursued.
Rumor has it that the Holy King on earth, can move mountains, fill in the sea, and ride the clouds, and can do anything.
An Earthly Saint King was enough to change a dynasty's qi for a hundred years, a god-like existence.
However, how hard is it to cultivate in the world?
Su Yu was the supreme genius of Qing Shan Town, under the jurisdiction of Xian Yu County, and at the mere age of fourteen, he had cultivated to the peak of the first level of the martial arts path, and had become a hundred-year wonder in the hearts of everyone in Qing Shan Town.
But, after he was enrolled by Xian Yu County, the overriding Martial Sect Academy, Su Yu realized what a frog in the well he had once been.
The Martial Sect Academy, which searches for all geniuses in Xian Yu County, is included once a year.
He, on the other hand, was merely at the bottom of the list among all the geniuses in the Martial Sect Academy!
The Wu Zong Academy, according to qualifications, divides students into three categories.
Golden Cadets, excellent level geniuses, are often the best in a city, the top geniuses that suppress the rest of the geniuses in the city, and will be given key training by the Martial Sect Academy.
Silver cadets, potential level geniuses, have superior talent in the town, and with a little effort, there might be hope.
Su Yu, is the silver students, he understands very well, in fact, the silver students, is no hope to cultivate to the great success, but give up and pity of the class, food tasteless abandonment, shaped like chicken ribs.
Silver trainees are not favored, the cultivation resources given by the academy are very limited, and the possibility of getting ahead is close to zero.
"Su Yu, quickly return to the academy, the Duke of Qin has summoned you!" An urgent voice, cutting through the quiet music of the mountains and forests, a blue-clothed middle-aged man panted and ran up the mountain, with a few anxious moments on his face.
"Is the Duke of Qin not something you can neglect? Follow me!" The blue-robed middle-aged man was impatient, stepped forward and clasped Su Yu's shoulders, ignoring the fact that he was hurting Su Yu's slim torso, grabbing him and quickly descending down the mountain.
Su Yu gritted his teeth, endured the severe pain in his shoulder, and said nothing in silence.
The middle-aged man in blue was the deacon of the academy, managing the daily student activities, and in the words of the Earth school, the director of instruction.
Half a cup of tea later.
Schoolhouse, a luxurious and elegant, sophisticated as a dream lounge.
Only the core students, the top management of the academy, and the powerful can rest here, other than that, the gold students and silver students are not eligible.
Su Yu is also the first time to come to the luxury lounge, ordinary poor boy to come here, may be nervous. But Su Yu, in his previous life is the business elite, five-star hotels, presidential suites, luxury ball, is a regular guest, calm mind, not surprised.
In the lounge, there were three people, a pair of teenage boys and girls, and a man with a noble temperament and a majestic demeanor.
As his eyes swept over the fourteen year old girl, Su Yu's gaze paused slightly.
It was a woman with a pretty face like an elf, jade face as delicate as a carving, skin as fair as the snow of Yangchun, a delicate figure, wearing immaculate white clothes, as if she were a fox fairy, very beautiful.
Only, the gaze she looked at Su Yu had coldness and a hint of complexity.
On his side was a sixteen year old boy, bright and handsome and noble.
"Hehe, I am the Duke of Qin, I am glad to see you." Duke of Qin, one of the three great dukes of the Maple Forest Empire, at this time, there was no arrogance, instead, he was exceptionally cordial, and with a smile, he invited Su Yu to sit down.
Su Yu coldly shook his head in his heart, not moved in the slightest by the cordiality.
People in high positions are in the limelight of millions of people, so they pay great attention to their own recuperation and their own image.
It is just like politicians on earth, who are obviously at loggerheads, but after meeting, they still shake hands and exchange pleasantries with smiles on their faces, only to stab and undermine under the table.
"I am Qin Feng's father, this time, for his affair with Qing'er." Qin Guo Gong's handsome face, surfaced a warm smile "Things, I have heard Feng'er say, for which, as Feng'er's father, I apologize to you."
Bitterness flashed in the bottom of Su Yu's heart, the bitterness of another Su Yu's residual soul. The young girl in front of him, named Jiang Xueqing, was a genius who came out from Qing Shan Town together with Su Yu, and was enrolled as a student of the Martial Sect Academy at the same time.
The two were childhood sweethearts, two young children, golden children, a match made in heaven.
However, after entering the Wu Zong Academy, Jiang Xueqing, who came from a {small small village and town, was impacted by the huge and prosperous world, and gradually became intoxicated in the world of pomp and circumstance.
With her fox-fairy-like beauty, it was hard to avoid being courted by young powerful people and handsome geniuses.
Initially, she was able to convince herself to stick to her heart and accompany Su Yu through the first school year.
But, gradually, understanding the cruelty of the world, from a naive little girl, she gradually metamorphosed, knowing that Su Yu is difficult to have a future in the future, following her, it is likely to suffer and be reduced to an underling.
Finally, her inner defenses laxed.
Two months ago, he completely cut off relations with Su Yu and became the son of Duke Qin and the companion of Junior Duke Qin Feng.
Jiang Xueqing although abide by the good girl this, never overstepped the male-female relationship, but from then on, the two often accompanied by walking, inseparable, become the envy of everyone's eyes of the divine couple.
Su Yu, on the other hand, was reduced to the laughing stock of the Martial Sect Academy.
Su Yu was devastated and begged Jiang Xueqing many times to come back to his heart, not hesitating to kneel down and beg, losing face, but all were coldly rejected by Jiang Xueqing.
Su Yu could not bear the great sadness in his life and threw himself into the lake, coincidentally, the Earth's Su Yu had a plane crash, and his soul crossed over to him, a sad and pathetic weakling.
The Duke of Qin saw Su Yu fall into reminiscence, he only thought that it was difficult for him to part with his love for Jiang Xueqing, and sighed: "Feng'er is young and unintelligent, I am willing to pay compensation for his faults, what do you want, feel free to mention it, but, as a father, I hope that you will be able to fulfill Feng'er, he is serious about the girl, Xueqing."
Listening to the words of the Duke of Qin that seem to come from the bottom of his heart, Su Yu secretly shook his head in his heart, this trick, fooling ordinary people can still be, useless to him.
You stole my girlfriend, and you want me to make it right? This is not an apology, it's just a case of using power to oppress people!
The Duke of Qin appeared to have a mild attitude, but in reality, it was full of naked insults.
Just ask, if it was the woman of the king of the country, the woman of the emperor, who was favored by his son, would he, the Duke of Qin, dare to ask the king of the country to give up his woman to Qin Feng? He wouldn't dare, because he couldn't afford to mess with the state ruler, he could only mess with a commoner like Su Yu!
Su Yu faintly shook his head and got up to leave, he had no intention of staying with such a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing, even if the Duke of Qin didn't use his power to suppress her, he didn't intend to compete for her.
As for the so-called compensation from the Duke of Qin, although Su Yu lacked cultivation resources, although he was a poor boy, although he had nothing. But, he still had a will to not give in, and had not yet been reduced to the point of being given charity.
Jiang Xueqing understands the character of "Su Yu", stubborn and unconvincing, see him want to leave, only that he still refuses to give up, silver teeth gently bite, lotus step lightly, snow eyes like a cold moon awn: "Su Yu! Please respect my choice!"
"Since it's come to today, I'll make it completely clear, and I hope you'll die." Coldness flashed in Jiang Xueqing's eyes.
"Qin Feng is noble as the young Duke of the State, he will be a pillar of the empire in the future, he can give me glory and wealth, can you, a poor boy from a mountain village, give it to me?"
"Qin Feng is honored as a Gold Cadet, and in the future, he will catch up with the Saint King of the Earth and stand on top of hundreds of millions of people, and he can give me a sense of security, can you, a Silver Cadet, give it to me?"
"Su Yu, accept the reality, I don't deny that at one time you were my attachment, the brightest genius in my heart, but, that was me being too young and innocent, the real world, cruel and real, I had no choice!"
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last trace of attachment in her eyes, gazing at Su Yu's gaze, gradually distant, as if looking at a stranger, gently sighing, "Brother Feng is very nice, you just have to promise not to look for me again in the future, he will try his best to make it up to you, and give you a few Spirit Melting Treasure Pills, to promote your cultivation, with your strength improved, your life in the school will be much better."
After thinking about it, Jiang Xueqing took out a palm-sized statue of a woman carved in crystal from her sleeve.
The crystal was crystal clear, glittering with a gorgeous deep lustre. The most beautiful thing was that the crystal statue of the woman, ethereal and beautiful, as if she were a fox fairy, so beautiful as heaven, so mesmerizing.
The statue's woman-like appearance was lifelike, and it was generally the same as the owner who held it, Jiang Xueqing.
"This is the love gift you gave me, now, give it back to you, we, from now on, we don't owe each other." Jiang Xueqing, mercilessly stuffed the statue in Su Yu's hands, turned around and returned to Qin Feng's side, looking out into the sky, no longer looking at Su Yu, cold and desperate.
"Chi Yao, I treated you like my beloved, why did you kill me?"
Zhang Ruochen roared and tried to lunge forward, causing the gilt-cast bed to "creak" and violently sit up.
Only after realizing that it was just a dream did Zhang Ruochen exhale a long breath and use his sleeve to dry the beads of sweat on his forehead.
No!
It wasn't a dream!
How could everything that happened between him and Princess Chi Yao be a dream?
Zhang Ruochen was the only son of "Emperor Ming", one of the nine great emperors of the Kunlun Realm, and at only sixteen years old, he had cultivated to the Heavenly Extremity Realm's Great Perfection with his heaven-defying physique.
However, just as he was becoming the number one person of the younger generation in the Kunlun Realm, he died at the hands of his childhood sweetheart's fiancée, Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chi Yao is the daughter of one of the nine emperors, the Qing Emperor.
Emperor Ming and Emperor Qing were the best of close friends, and Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao were even fingered to be married, having grown up and cultivated together since childhood.
One was valiant and the other was incredibly beautiful, a golden couple that could have become a good story in the cultivation world. How could Zhang Ruochen not expect that Princess Chi Yao would actually strike out at him?
After dying at the hands of Princess Chi Yao, when Zhang Ruochen woke up again, he realized that he was already eight hundred years later.
The once Princess Chi Yao, who pacified the Nine Emperors' Rebellion, unified the Nine Kingdoms, established the First Central Empire, and became the sovereign of the entire Kunlun Realm - Empress Chi Yao.
Eight hundred years ago, the Nine Emperors that dominated the Kunlun Realm completely became the past and disappeared into the river of history.
The Nine Emperors are dead, and the Empress is in power.
In this era, there was only one emperor, and that was Empress Chi Yao, who ruled the world and was powerful in all directions.
"Why would she want to kill me?
How can her heart be so ruthless, or are all women's hearts so ruthless?" Zhang Ruochen's eyes were sharp, his heart sunk like iron, and he was filled with questions. However, there was no one to help him answer them.
Eight hundred years had passed, and it had long since changed, things were different, except for the Empress Chi Yao, who had an unparalleled level of cultivation, and was still youthful and ageless.
All of those former deceased people had been turned into yellow earth and turned into white bones. Even the mighty Nine Emperors of that year had all disappeared from the earth, leaving behind only a segment of glorious stories that would be recited by future generations for a long time.
"Squeak!"
A palace-suited beautiful woman with a soft body pushed the door in from outside and looked at Zhang Ruochen, who was sitting on the bed couch, with a concerned look, "Dusty, did you have a nightmare again?"
The beautiful woman in front of her was the royal consort of the Yunwu County King and Zhang Ruochen's mother, Consort Lin.
The original owner of this body, being weak and sickly, had died of illness on his bed three days ago.
After Zhang Ruochen was killed by Princess Chi Yao, he woke up again and appeared inside this body, bringing the originally sick and dying teenager back to life.
Even more coincidentally, the original owner of this body was also named Zhang Ruochen. When Zhang Ruochen had just woken up, he had still rejected Concubine Lin.
After all, in Zhang Ruochen's eyes, Lin Fei, was just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Ruochen gradually realized that Concubine Lin really cared about him very much, practically in every way, and when she saw Zhang Ruochen waking up from a nightmare, she even immediately rushed to Zhang Ruochen's room, despite the freezing cold.
In his last life, Zhang Ruochen had never met his birth mother. It was rumored that she passed away when she was born!
Unexpectedly, after being killed by Princess Chi Yao, being reborn inside this body unexpectedly allowed him to have one more mother and feel the warmth of a mother's love. "Perhaps she still doesn't know that her own Dust Child, three days ago, fell ill and died!"
If she was told the truth, she might not be able to withstand the shock of the bad news.
Zhang Ruochen looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes softened and he smiled faintly, "Mother, there's no need to worry about me, it's just a dream."
With a date-red hooded sable fur draped over her thin body, Concubine Lin sat on the edge of Zhang Ruochen's bed, stroked Zhang Ruochen's forehead, and said worriedly, "It's already been three days of nights, and you've always been awakened by nightmares, and you've called out the name of 'Chi Yao' every time. Who exactly is she?"
It was naturally impossible for Concubine Lin to associate the name "Chi Yao" with the empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after Empress Chi Yao unified the Kunlun Realm and established the first centralized empire, she became known as the "Great Wisdom and Great Virtue Empress", and no one dared to mention the word "Chi Yao" at all.
It would be taboo. Zhang Ruochen said, "It's nothing, Mother, you heard wrong!"
Concubine Lin sighed and said, "In the future, don't ever call out the word 'Chi Yao' again, not even in your dreams, that's the empress' name. Calling out the empress's name is a great disrespect, once someone with a heart hears it, they will be executed."
Zhang Ruochen nodded his head and squeezed his fingers tightly, saying rather profoundly, "Definitely not anymore! "
In the future, I will be her nightmare.
Concubine Lin looked at the thin and pale Zhang Ruochen and gently sighed, her heart incomparably sour.
Although born in the county king's family, however, he was weak and sickly since childhood, already sixteen years old, still can only always lie in bed, I'm afraid that this life can only be like this!
Outside, a clutter of footsteps sounded.
"What are you doing?
A delicate looking maid, who wanted to stop the eighth prince who barged in, was gently pushed by the eighth prince and fell more than ten meters away. The Eighth Prince was a martial artist, with a cultivation level of late Yellow Extreme Realm, a palm strike was enough to knock a three hundred pound stone plate ten feet away, let alone just a one hundred and ten pound maid?
A flick of the finger could send her flying.
That one maid screamed miserably and fell heavily to the ground, her left arm broken.
The Eighth Prince was wearing a gold wisp suit with a jade belt wrapped around his waist, his body was robust, his arms were slender, and his pace was steady as he walked into the Jade Sewing Palace, and stared coldly at the maid, "A slave girl dares to get in this prince's way, really looking for death."
Behind the Eighth Prince, followed by six guards wearing Lin Skin armor, with tall bodies and tiger backs, obviously all of them were martial arts cultivators with strong combat power, belonging to the royal palace's forbidden guards.
Concubine Lin heard the commotion outside and after calming Zhang Ruochen down, she closed the door and walked out.
She stared at the Eighth Prince standing outside and frowned slightly, saying, "Your Highness, the Eighth Prince, this is the Jade Gargoyle Palace, even if you're a prince, you can't just trespass!"
Eighth Prince Zhang Ji raised his head to stare at Concubine Lin and said aloud, "By order of the Queen, the bedchamber of Auntie Concubine Lin and Ninth Brother is to be changed to the 'Purple Yee Partial Hall'. In the future, the owner of Yushu Palace will be this prince's birth mother, Concubine Xiao."
Concubine Lin's face changed slightly, she had long anticipated that this day would come, however, she did not expect it to come so quickly.
Concubine Lin smiled miserably and said, ''Is the Queen going to drive us mother and son out of the Yushu Palace so soon? Well!
Mother has said that she wants to move into the Jade Gargoyle Palace tonight. Please move to the side hall now, Consort Lin!"
The eighth prince smiled coldly and said without the slightest bit of politeness, "Concubine Lin, there are many pitiful people in this world, but not everyone deserves pity. Since Ninth Brother is weak and sickly, why is he still living in the world?"
"He's your ninth brother!"
Princess Lin was about to say something else when suddenly, the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruochen's body was so weak that he could barely stand with his hand on the doorpost, staring at the Eight Princes not far away.
His seemingly weak body looked like it contained an unyielding will as he said, "There's no need to beg them, we're moving out now."
"Dusty, why are you out of bed? It's cold outside, don't go back yet." Concubine Lin hurriedly went forward to support Zhang Ruochen, fearing that he would catch wind chill.
Concubine Lin looked at Zhang Ruochen's determined eyes and seemed to be infected by his emotions as well, nodding with tears in her eyes.
Concubine Lin and Sen supported Zhang Ruochen and walked out of the Yu Shou Palace step by step, with the exception of that one servant girl who had her arm broken by the eighth prince's palm push out.
The other servants, all of them did not follow them out of Yushu Palace. Everyone could see that Princess Lin and the Ninth Prince had completely lost their power, and it was difficult for them to gain a foothold in the County King's Palace.
Originally they were the servants of the Yu Shu Palace, and now they naturally and wisely chose to stay in the Yu Shu Palace, and all of them went to curry favor with the eighth prince, the new master.
Ziyi side hall, usually the place where a disgraced princess lives, is very remote, full of fallen leaves, and seems to have been uninhabited for a long time.
The night is deep and the wind is cold.
Sitting on top of the cold stone bench, Zhang Ruochen's thin body was wrapped in a coat, yet he still felt cold.
"This physical body is too weak, only by practicing martial arts can the body gradually become stronger.
Otherwise, even if I am now the son of a county king, I would still only be at the mercy of others." Zhang Ruochen's mind secretly thought.
Eight hundred years had passed, and Zhang Ruochen didn't know where he could go now.
Since the heavens had arranged for him to be reborn inside this body, whether it was for the sake of taking revenge on Empress Chi Yao in the future, or for the sake of that one mother who took care of him without fail, he had to be strong. The humiliation and cold treatment he suffered today was entirely because he was too weak to resist, unable to control his own destiny, and even the place where he was living was forced by others.
If you want to be respected by others and have a warm and cozy place to live, you have to become a martial artist and prove yourself.
In the Kunlun Realm, in order to become a martial artist, one must first open the "Divine Martial Mark".
The so-called "Seal of Divine Martial Arts" is the qualification given by the gods to human beings to cultivate martial arts.
Those who hadn't opened the "Divine Martial Seal" would never be able to cultivate true qi, and couldn't become the strongest person in the world. Zhang Ruochen was already sixteen years old, but he still hadn't opened the Divine Martial Seal.
After the age of sixteen, they will miss the best age to cultivate martial arts, even if they have opened the "Divine Martial Mark", they will not be able to achieve much.
Similarly, they were both the sons of the Yunwu County King, so why was the Eighth Prince superior? Able to drive Zhang Ruochen and Concubine Lin out of Yushu Palace?
It was because, at the age of ten, the Eighth Prince had opened the "Divine Martial Seal", and was now a young martial artist in the late Yellow Extreme Realm.
"As long as I'm allowed to open the 'Divine Martial Seal', I'll be able to cultivate the Nine Heavens Bright Emperor Scripture.
With the subtlety of the Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Scripture, even if I have missed the best age for cultivation, it is still possible for me to catch up with other geniuses and become a martial arts powerhouse again." The Nine Heavens Bright Emperor Scripture was the supreme treasure code cultivated by Emperor Ming, and other than Emperor Ming, only Zhang Ruochen knew the complete cultivation method of the Nine Heavens Bright Emperor Scripture.
"Tomorrow is the Sacrificial Ceremony, so I hope that I can get the approval of the gods to turn the 'Divine Martial Seal' on."
Zhang Ruochen tightened his fists, eager to open the "Divine Martial Seal".
After Concubine Lin tidied and organized the room, she came over to assist Zhang Ruochen, "Duan'er, you should quickly take an early rest! Tomorrow, there is still the Ritual Ceremony to attend."
"Mother don't worry, I will definitely be able to open the 'Divine Martial Seal' tomorrow!" Zhang Ruochen said.
"Uh-huh!
Concubine Lin gave Zhang Ruochen a deep look, her heart sighing softly.
Chapter 1
"Bam", a rusty iron door was opened, and the sound of the door's aftermath was blocked back by the old buildings around it, curling up and down.
A dozen or so breaths later, a young man with a drooping head was dragged out from within the iron door by two jailers by the arm. This young man with a drooping head looked like he was not breathing, and even his arms were so thin that only bones were left. From the bloodstained and tattered clothes on his body, one could tell what kind of destruction and torture this young man had been subjected to.
"Tent," the scrawny man was thrown to the ground by the two jailers, splattering some dust, and then no more movement.
"This kid should be dead, right?" A short, fat jailer asked, staring at the young man who was flopping on the ground and not moving.
Another jailer hmmmed, "He should be dead, who let him not know how to live, how dare he be rude to Miss Jian. Now it's good, not only has the Ning Mansion been destroyed, he himself has been relieved of his duties, he kind of deserves it."
"Old Club, be careful with your words, let's drag him out and deal with him first." The short and fat jailer hastily cautioned.
Hearing the words of this short and fat jailer, the other jailer called Old Club involuntarily shrunk his head, and was about to go and pull up the man on the ground who was no longer breathing, ready to drag him away.
Just at this time, a somewhat soft voice called out from the side, "Two big brothers, I want to take my husband away."
It was only then that the two talking jailers saw that there was a woman standing on the side, dressed in rough linen clothes, which, despite being dressed in rough linen clothes, could still vaguely reveal her unassuming demeanor. The only regret was that her face was already disfigured, hidden by slightly messy hair, making people unwilling to take a second look.
Both of the jailers recognized who this woman was; this was one of the only two surviving members of the Ning family.
Ning Gao was the butler of the Ning Mansion, and when the Ning Mansion was raided, he left Cang Qin to go out on some business, so he escaped. And this woman was the daughter-in-law of the Ning family, and the wife of this skinny man who had just been thrown out of prison, called Ji Luo Fei.
She had escaped because she had stayed at the Cang Qin Two Star Academy. Of course, this was also because Ji Luofei was not very much associated with the Ning Family, the reason why she had married into the Ning Family was because the Ning Family and the Ji Family were family friends, and she and Ning Cheng had been betrothed since they were young. It was just that the Ji Family had fallen in the most inexplicable way, and in the end, only a disfigured Ji Luo Fei was left.
Even so, Ning Cheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still took Ji Luo Fei into his residence. He was prepared to wait for Ning Cheng to truly gather Qi before allowing the two to get married.
"Alright, alright, drag it away, it's ugly to leave it here." The short and fat jailer put away the silver coins and impatiently waved his hand and said.
They were about to dispose of Ning Cheng's corpse, but they could not imagine that someone would come over to dispose of it and give them silver coins, this kind of good thing, of course they would not reject it.
Hearing this, Ji Luo Fei hurriedly carried Ning Cheng on her back, accelerated her speed, and soon disappeared from the prison entrance.
"If this Ji Luofei wasn't disfigured, she would be a beauty." Looking at Ji Luo Fei's back, another jailer tossed the silver coin in his hand and said in a judgmental tone.
"Cut the crap, that Ji Luo Fei is at least a person from the Cang Qin Two Star Academy, even if she's ugly, it's not our turn." The short and fat jailer patted this talking jailer's shoulder and pulled him into the iron door once again.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled an extremely nice fragrance, and the first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a white neck. In the next moment, Ning Xiaocheng reacted that he was being carried by a woman, and that fragrance was coming from the woman who was carrying him.
No, he remembered that after being rejected by Tian Mowan, he was in an extremely bad mood and ended up going the wrong way, walking up to the elevated walkway alone. Then a yellow awn from the sky hit him, and then there was no more.
Does that mean he's not dead? What the hell is going on here?
Ning Xiaocheng had just thought of this when all sorts of information swarmed into his mind, and he was unexpectedly reborn.
What horrified Ning Xiao Cheng was that this body he was reborn in was originally called Ning Cheng. He was appalled because his original name was also Ning Cheng.
It was only because he often had a nightmare that he saw himself coming to an extremely weird place, being backstabbed and put into a prison, and then suffering and dying. Although it was just a dream, Ning Cheng still changed his name to Ning Xiao Cheng.
Little did he realize that after turning around, he was still called Ning Cheng, and was really reborn in that environment of his dream.
Ning Xiao Cheng wanted to raise his hand to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, but the woman carrying him looked back and did not say much.
"I'm sorry, I don't have the strength to walk." Seeing that the woman looked back at herself, Ning Xiaocheng said somewhat apologetically.
"The Ning Family is already gone, you are already lucky to be alive." The woman's tone was calm, as if even if Ning Xiaocheng really died, she still had this calm attitude.
Ning Xiaocheng fell silent, just now he had already organized some bits and pieces of information. He should now be called back to Ning Cheng once again, a sole member of the Ning Family of the Cang Qin Kingdom.
Ning Cheng's parents had gone to the Mango Sea to search for spiritual objects when Ning Cheng was very young, and then had not returned. Ning Cheng had been living with his grandfather, Ning Hongchang, in Cang Le City, the capital of the Cang Qin Kingdom. Although the Ning Mansion was large, there were not many people.
Ning Cheng had certainly become the number one person in the Ning Mansion, and Ning Hongchang even never cared about Ning Cheng. All the bad things that Ning Cheng had done in Cang Le City had been taken on by Ning Hongchang. Cang Le City was filled with princes and nobles, although Ning Hongchang was also a patriarch of the Cang Qin Kingdom, he was still inferior to those princes and nobles.
Finally, one day, Ning Cheng caused a mess that even he could not afford. He even offended the pearl of the Cang Qin Kingdom's Jian Family, Jian Su Jie, not to mention that the Jian Family is not something that the Ning Family can afford to mess with, even the fiancé of Jian Su Jie, Qiu Yingguang, the Ning Family can't afford to mess with either.
Ning Cheng sighed as he thought of this. The result of him not being able to afford to mess with him was of course that he was imprisoned, his grandfather, Ning Hongchang, had exhausted his connections and his family's wealth in order to bail him out, and as a result, instead of him being bailed out, he had taken the entire Ning Family into his hands. This news was still learned by his predecessor from the jailer's mouth, and it could be said that the Ning family was also wiped out because of him.
After Ning Cheng sorted these things out, he sighed once again in his heart, there is no reasoning in this world, whoever has the bigger fist is the reason.
At the same time, he also understood who this person carrying him was, this disfigured woman was his fiancée, called Ji Luo Fei, somewhat similar to a child bride on Earth.
Later on, the Ji Family inexplicably declined, leaving only a disfigured Ji Luo Fei. However, Ning Cheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still received Ji Luo Fei into the Ning Family, and was prepared to help the two of them consummate their marriage once Ning Cheng gathered Qi.
Ning Hongchang indulged Ning Cheng in other things, but in this matter of taking Ji Luofei as his wife, he would never give in. The original Ning Cheng was very dissatisfied with the disfigured Ji Luo Fei, and often either hit or scolded her, but fortunately, Ji Luo Fei went against the grain, and never refuted anything to Ning Cheng. Moreover, Ji Luo Fei was different from Ning Cheng, she had the qualifications to cultivate.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he had also entered the Cang Qin Two Star Academy and was already a cultivator at the third level of Qi Gathering. In the Cang Qin Kingdom, anyone who could cultivate was called a cultivator.
At this moment, Ji Luo Fei had already carried him into an extremely low black stone house. Although the black stone house was low, the area wasn't very small, at least it had everything that should be there. There was even a small courtyard, and there was a deep well inside the courtyard.
Even if it concerned himself, Ning Cheng had to get to the bottom of this matter. Even though he guessed that it was the work of the Jian and Qiu Families, he had to ask for some clarification.
"Why ask me when you did it yourself?" Ji Luo Fei simply replied and put Ning Cheng down.
After saying that, she poured another cup of fresh water and fed it to Ning Cheng, then said, "I'll go and boil water for you to take a bath, just forget about some things, you know it won't do you any good."
Ning Cheng watched Ji Luo Fei go in to boil the water and did not continue to pursue the matter, he understood what Ji Luo Fei meant. With his ability, the more he knew, the faster he would die.
Not knowing if Ji Luo Fei had added something to that cup of water, Ning Cheng felt that after drinking this cup of water, his entire body regained some strength.
Ning Cheng sat on the ancient wooden couch, his mind thought of his current situation for a moment, and then thought of his younger sister, Ning Ruolan. At the same time, he really did not understand why Tian Mowan was treating him like that, according to his understanding of Tian Mowan, Tian Mowan was definitely not that kind of snobbish girl.
Chapter 1
Chu Li driving a boat on the lake, the lake breeze, refreshing refreshing.
The Yiguo Gongfu was a huge lake of ten thousand hectares with ninety-nine islands, and the Hall of Performing Arts he was going to was eighteen miles away from the East Garden.
On top of the boat, he was of medium stature, with a flowing green shirt, his appearance was ordinary but quite heroic, looking at the vast lake, his thoughts drifting away.
It's been nineteen years, two months and three days!
A high-energy physics researcher, a promising academic, a future great scientist, a small mistake in the experiment, exploded and came to this world, reincarnated to be a new person!
"Bang!" The muffled sound broke his contemplation, and turning his head to look, a golden carp jumped incessantly on the boat.
Chu Li shook his head and bent down to throw the carp back into the lake. Straightening up, a tall building came into his eyes.
Hundred-meter-high building, glittering bronze light, thick and solemn, showing the majesty of the State Duke's Mansion.
This tall bronze building is the Hall of Performing Arts!
In front of the Drill Hall was an open practice field, red clay paved with hundreds of people practicing, either practicing swords and knives and fists and palms, or sparring with each other in a lively manner.
Chu Li leaned on the boat and stepped ashore, stepping onto the martial arts practice field, not taking a few steps, suddenly flashed out a handsome young man, with a face like a crown of jade, eyebrows like a sword, and a glowing demeanor.
He was long and tall, a head taller than Chu Li, holding his shoulders and looking down at him, "Chu, what are you doing here? What are you doing here?
Chu Li frowned, "Get out of the way, good dogs don't get in the way!"
The handsome youth laughed, "Is it hard to believe that you want to practice martial arts?"
Chu Li suddenly laughed and continued to walk forward, "Zhuo Fei Yang, if I fall to the ground and scream miserably, believe it or not, you're going to have to eat your words?"
House guards prohibit private fights, not allowed to kill each other, the House guards divided into guards and guards, a military and a civilian, both are especially prohibited private fights, light will be downgraded, heavy will be expelled from the House.
Chu Li was an unranked guard, while Zhuo Fei Yang was an eighth rank guard, it was a big taboo for a guard to make a move on a guard, he fell to the ground and screamed miserably, and Zhuo Fei Yang, even if he was a genius, would have to be heavily punished.
Zhuo Fei Yang frowned with his sword brows, "Surname Chu, okay, shameless enough!" Chu Li continued to walk forward.
Zhuo Feiyang sidestepped and stepped aside, grimacing his handsome face, "Surname Chu, you can only use these small means!"
Chu Li laughed, "To deal with stupid people like you, small means are enough!"
Zhuo Fei Yang glared at him, his fists clenched tighter and tighter as if he was going to swing out the next moment, but Chu Li looked at him lazily with a full flavor of provocation.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly revealed a bright smile and raised his hand forcefully, "Senior Sister Zhao!"
In the distance, a graceful and beautiful girl came curling up, her skin was snowy, her almond eyes and willow eyebrows, her temperament was churlish and gentle as water.
Chu Li's face changed slightly, Zhao Ying, who entered the mansion at the same time as them, was beautiful, kind, and gentle, the kind of woman a man would love when he saw her.
"Senior Brother Chu?" Zhao Ying walked over lightly and said in surprise, "Senior Brother Chu?"
Chu Li sniffed the faint fragrance she brought and smiled, "Senior Sister Zhao, long time no see."
Since he was assigned into the East Garden, he went to the Book Depository most of the time, trying to change his fate with knowledge, and rarely came to the Hall of Performing Arts.
This time, I came to the Martial Arts Hall because I encountered problems in cultivating the Minor Pulse Cleansing Technique and wanted to look at the secret manuals and cultivation notes related to the Minor Pulse Cleansing Technique.
Zhao Ying laughed, "Senior Brother Chu, congratulations, the East Garden is a beautiful job."
Chu Li smiled and nodded, "Not bad at all."
East Garden belongs directly to the third Miss Xiao Qi's Yuji Island, only he and Li Yue two guards, not only leisurely and comfortable, but also have the opportunity to see the third Miss, once the third Miss green eyes, flying into the future.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath, this guy's luck is too good, but even into the East Garden, God is too open-eyed, he must properly clean him!
"Senior Sister Zhao, don't pay any attention to this punk, I just practiced the Breaking Delusion Sword Technique yesterday, how about a sparring session?"
Zhao Ying frowned, feeling that Zhuo Fei Yang had spoken harshly.
"Fine, not to say he's trash is!" Zhuo Feiyang was busy compensating for his smile and swept a glance at Chu Li, "Even though he is a waste!"
Zhao Ying's eyes widened in dissatisfaction.
"Senior Sister Zhao, it's alright," Chu Li smiled, "There's no need to be concerned about such arrogant fools."
"Senior Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying ranted.
Chu Li reached out his hand in a gesture of surrender, "Senior Sister Zhao, come and play in the East Garden, the scenery is beautiful and Brother Li's cooking is extremely good."
"Hmph, what's there to see!" Zhuo Feiyang bristled, "It's just flowers and plants, if you have that time, you might as well practice martial arts and play with things!" "According to you, the Third Miss and the Grand Duke are both playthings, not as good as you?" Chu Li seemed to smile, the West Garden belonged to the Grand Duke Xiao Tieying.
Zhuo Feiyang's handsome face reddened, sneered and decided not to fight with him.
"Senior Brother Zhuo! Senior Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying disgruntledly snapped, "Will you guys stop for a while! ...... Senior Brother Chu, I'll go over and play, so if you have something to do, just get busy first."
Chu Li looked at her deeply, "Senior Sister Zhao, someone with an empty skin can only see people's hearts after a long time, Senior Sister don't trust others so easily!"
"Surname Chu, what do you mean!"
Chu Li ignored him and smiled at Zhao Ying and clasped his fists.
Zhao Ying turned to leave.
Zhuo Feiyang was busy trying to follow, and as he was about to leave, he took advantage of Zhao Ying's inattention and suddenly reached out his hand.
His palm almost slapped Chu Li's face, very confident that Chu Li was too late to avoid, seemingly inattentive, but transported the internal force, the speed is very fast.
Chu Li gently tilted his head on one side, Zhuo Fei Yang's fingertips swept against his cheek, he could feel the breeze, the power of this palm was not light.
"Pop!"
Crisp, loud slaps rang out.
Chu Li slapped his left palm on his own face, crisp and loud, with little force and a loud sound, then quickly withdrew his hand.
Zhao Ying was busy twisting her head to look. Chu Li's expression remained unchanged, as if the slap was not on his face.
Zhuo Fei Yang glared at him with a gloomy face. Chu Li laughed and touched his face, "Really good kung fu, I admire it!"
Zhuo Feiyan stared at him dead in the face.
"Senior Brother Zhuo--!" Zhao Ying sunk her jade face.
"I'm sorry I'm sorry, I really didn't mean it." Zhuo Feiyang gritted his teeth, his voice squeezed out between his teeth, and coldly said, "I don't think Senior Brother Chu will care, right, Senior Brother Chu?"
Chu Li twisted his head and laughed, "Senior Sister Zhao, forget it."
Zhao Ying looked at him in embarrassment and busily tugged Zhuo Fei Yang away, if they stayed any longer, the two would have to fight!
Chu Li stared at Zhao Ying's shapely back for a moment, touched the left side of his fiery face, and activated the Great Circle Mirror Wisdom to suppress the fluctuation of his mind.
If it was not for the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom, he would have been assassinated by Zhuo Feiyang!
This world is honored by martial arts, a concept deeply rooted in his heart since he was a child, and Zhao Ying is gentle and kind, protecting himself explicitly and implicitly, which makes him quite touched.
But as a man, he needed a woman to protect him, and as a man, he just couldn't stand it!
He passed through the crowd on the martial arts practice field and entered the Hall of Performing Arts.
Undoing the wooden plate between his waist, he handed it to the youth in front of the temple, who had a lightning-like gaze and swept a glance, signaling that he could go in.
Into his eyes were rows and rows of bookshelves, and he walked with faith, stopping occasionally, reaching out and pulling out a book, flipping through it quickly, putting it back and continuing to walk, stopping again, pulling out another book and flipping through it.
In one hour, he went through twenty-two books.
It seems that he already knew the location of these books, and he just went over and drew them out directly, in fact, he came over for the first time, and the small pulse cleansing skill was read in the bookstore.
The entire martial arts hall was presented in his mind, every row of bookshelves, the name of every book, clear and vivid.
He walked faithfully to the second floor and went directly to the third row of bookshelves, pulling out the Breaking Delusion Sword Spectrum on the second floor and flipping through it, and then pulling out seven secret books, which were the cultivation tips of the Breaking Delusion Sword Spectrum.
When he left the martial arts hall, his mind had already branded thirty secret scrolls, twenty-two minor pulse cleansing skill cultivation notes, one delusion breaking sword manual, and seven delusion breaking sword cultivation tips.
He was traveling on the lake in a small boat with a fresh breeze, and his original bearish anger had dissipated.
The thirty secret books in his mind began to meld together.
The midday sun burned as he sailed back to the East Garden.
The East Garden was a small island of two miles in circumference, divided into flower beds, each bed a kind of rare flower, and the whole island floated with the fragrance of flowers.
There was only one small courtyard on the island, Chu Li pushed the door into the courtyard, the shady atmosphere came to his face, a large tree covered half of the courtyard, driving away the heat.
He went into the west room and came out with a green blade sword, waving it in the center of the courtyard, slow as a Tai Chi sword, and in a few moments a layer of sweat broke out and his forehead shone.
He can't forget what he's seen, the secret manuals he's read over and over again are burned into his mind, the Delusion Breaking Sword Technique that he just learned from the Hall of Performing Arts is really amazingly powerful, but it also consumes a lot of strength.
"Squeak ......" out of the main hall came a burly young man with a big round cake face and small eyes.
He shook like a black bear, stretched his waist twice, and yawned twice before speaking lazily, "Brother, back so early?"
Chu Li focused on practicing the sword, only hmmm. Li Yue, the ninth rank guard, the two of them together in charge of the East Garden, good appetite, excellent cooking, good martial arts, but afraid of death not to break into the ninth rank building, willing to serve as a guard.
The guards of the State Duke's Office and the guards are divided into nine grades, and the difference in wages is ten times.
The guards are paid less, the grade should be simmering seniority, three years nine products, ten years eight products, twenty years seven products, forty years six products, seventy years five products. Guard promotion regardless of other only look at the martial arts, break into the building of nine products, break through a layer to rise a product.
More money, but also can often go out of the house to do the task, live colorful, unlike the guards can only stay in the house to wait on people, but all the ability to do a little, all as a guard.
Li Yue shook his neck and stretched his legs, his bones sent out a series of crackling sounds, and then swung his fist to start practicing, his fist was like a meteor, whistling the wind.
"Brother, don't practice your sword, practice boxing with me!"
Chu Li spat out two words, a layer of soybean sweat on his forehead.
This world thrives on martial arts, and practicing martial arts starts with the children.
After the age of eight to eighteen, once the meridians were finalized, even the most miraculous heart method would be half the effort, and it would take several times longer to build the foundation.
Before he was eighteen, he had studied the Great Wisdom Origin Sutra diligently at the Akiba Temple where he grew up, and missed the foundation building. His essence and spirit are twice as strong as those of a normal person.
Plus, he was a high-energy physics researcher in his previous life, and his knowledge of the world was far more advanced than anyone else's.
It was only when the two were combined that he finally practiced the Great Wisdom Origin Sutra and achieved the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom Avatar.
Spirit is strong, his cultivation duration is far better than normal people, divine ability in the body, observation into the subtle, so his small pulse washing skill progress is very fast, five years can build the foundation.
"Oh ......, with that sword of yours, chickens can't even be killed, what are you practicing for?"
Chu Li suddenly withdrew his sword and hummed, "Compare?"
Panting and weak, he leaned his sword towards the ground to hold himself up, the Delusion Breaking Sword Technique was too physically demanding.
1. Chapter 1
In the ancient room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
It's the instinctive reaction of a good Special Forces soldier!
The hand had just dropped, and a wave of weakness came from the electrifying soreness.
Ling Tian opened his eyes.
A gentle female voice came to his ears.
Ling Tian saw an exquisite face that was looking at him with a caring face.
This was a classical beauty, so breathtakingly beautiful that one could completely describe her as a dumpster fire.
Ling Tian, a native of China.
He had served in the most outstanding Wolf's Teeth Special Operations Unit in China, and during his service, he had made countless achievements.
He has participated in world-class special forces competitions, winning the personal honor of being the first in single combat capability, and is recognized as the 'King of Soldiers'!
Later, during a cross-country SSS-class mission, a comrade was sacrificed because of a small personal fault on his part.
Blaming himself, he chose to retire and leave Wolverine.
After retiring from the military, he fell silent for a while and chose to go abroad, becoming an ace in one of the most prestigious international mercenary organizations.
As long as he was out on a mission, the success rate was a hundred percent of what had never been seen before!
Although he had retired from Wolf's Teeth for many years, he still had his heart set on China.
As long as the mission is unfavorable to the country of China, not only will he not take it, but he will also uncover the person who issued the mission and carry out inhumane and sadistic killings.
Over time, he has become a thorn in the side and a thorn in the flesh of countries other than China.
In the eyes of other countries, he's a ticking time bomb.
However, as one killer after another evaporated, Ling Tian became more and more nourished the more he lived, and no more killers dared to take on this 'death mission'.
Killing Ling Tian was tantamount to asking for death. This was a phrase recognized in the world of mercenaries and killers.
Throughout the Earth, he has rarely met an enemy and has never lost a single battle!
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted agent.
The R country has created a colorless and odorless biochemical weapon and intends to transport it into China for a tragic grand conspiracy.
In response to this, Ling Tian certainly wouldn't sit idly by.
He struck out!
With the help of a broker, find out where that shipment of bioweapons is.
Just as he killed his way out and entered the underground research room, preparing to destroy the batch of biochemical weapons. The underground research room suddenly dented, trapping him into a fully enclosed cage.
Upon seeing a single R-man holding a variety of firearms, he appeared outside the cage. Ling Tian then understood.
He himself was betrayed by the person he trusted the most!
Otherwise, with his shrewdness, the R's plot would not have succeeded.
Until he was killed by random gunfire, Ling Tian still couldn't figure it out.
"Tian'er, what's wrong with you, don't scare Mother."
The gentle voice came, full of anxiety.
He was beyond certain that he didn't recognize this woman.
But the woman's eyes were now as if she was looking at a close relative, without any hypocrisy and full of sincerity.
Just as Ling Tian was about to theorize with this beautiful woman.
Ling Tian was struck by lightning and was completely frozen, as if he had been nailed.
The only thing that satisfied Ling Tian was that this guy was also called Ling Tian, his full name was 'Duan Ling Tian'.
Duan Ling Tian, fifteen years old.
Qingfeng Town, the son of the Li family's foreign name.
His mother, ''Li Rou'', was the Ninth Elder of the Li Family.
His father ...... was pressed into his memory.
In the process of fusing this unfamiliar memory, Ling Tian also knew the reason why Duan Ling Tian was lying in bed with serious injuries.
Early this morning, the youngest son of the Li Family's Seventh Elder, 'Li Xin', scolded Duan Ling Tian for being a bastard born of a mother but not taught by a father.
Only, he who hadn't even finished quenching his body, how could he be the opponent of Li Xin, who was at the second level of the Body Tempering Realm, and was directly seriously injured by Li Xin, dying.
After fusing all the unfamiliar memories, Ling Tian sighed in his heart.
He knew that from this moment on, he would integrate into this strange world as Duan Ling Tian.
From now on, he was Duan Ling Tian, and Duan Ling Tian was him.
"Ma'am, the head of the family has had the medicine delivered."
A sound came from his ears, and Duan Ling Tian looked up.
A maid hurried in from outside the room and handed Li Rou the delicate box in her hand.
The box was opened. At once, the fragrance of medicine wafted out.
"Tian'er, come, take the pills, Mother will heal your wounds."
Li Rou took out a black and colorless elixir from inside and handed it to Duan Ling Tian's mouth.
Taking a deep breath, Duan Ling Tian opened his mouth and swallowed the elixir.
The elixir melted in his mouth and turned into a warm current that entered his body.
Then, Duan Ling Tian saw it again.
A cold stream of air entered his body, melting away the warmth that the elixir had transformed into, healing his wounds.
An hour later, Leroy wrapped up.
Duan Ling Tian realized that most of the aches and pains in his body had disappeared without any burden.
Was that a magic pill he just took?
At this time, Duan Ling Tian realized that Li Rou's face was pale and her forehead was still sweating, obviously using up a large amount of Yuan Power to heal his injuries.
"Mother, are you all right?"
Duan Ling Tian's heart warmed.
The 'Mother' was called affectionately, without any unnaturalness.
"Mother is fine, just rest."
Leroy smiled and shook his head.
For the sake of his son, consuming this amount of Yuan Power was nothing.
"He and the Seventh Elder are still waiting in the Penal Courtyard." Half an hour later, the maid once again walked into the room and said softly.
"Release? Go tell the people sent by the family head that this is a matter that I will personally go over to deal with."
The amiability on Li Rou's face was gone, and she had a cold face.
"Mother, what kind of elixir did you just give me, I feel like my injuries are almost healed."
Duan Ling Tian got off the bed and slightly stretched his body.
"That's the 'Eighth Grade Gold Creation Dan'."
It turned out that this eighth-grade Golden Chuang Dan, even for the Qingfeng Town Li Family, there were only two of them, and now they had actually used one on him, a son of a foreign surname.
Obviously, his mother's status in the Li family was not low.
"Tian'er, the family head is still waiting, let's go over."
Li Rou brought Duan Ling Tian with her to a spacious courtyard in the Li Family Residence.
Here, this is exactly where the Li family enforces the family law. The Criminal Court!
It was high noon and the sun was blazing.
The area around the criminal court was filled with people, all of whom were the Li family's children who were watching.
In the courtyard, a teenager was tied to a Xing pillar and exposed to the sun, with two middle-aged men standing on the side.
The cock-eyed middle-aged man on the right side had an angry face when he saw Duan Ling Tian's mother and son.
"Duan Ling Tian has also come ...... The family's treasured Eighth Grade Gold Creation Pill is so potent!" "Yeah, I saw it when Duan Ling Tian was carried back, half dead."
"Li Xin is also, usually it's okay to casually bully Duan Ling Tian, and the Ninth Elder won't say anything, but he went so far as to lay such a heavy hand on him this time, and almost killed Duan Ling Tian, it's only strange if the Ninth Elder doesn't go ballistic."
One by one, the children of the Li Family whispered as they watched Li Rou and Duan Ling Tian arrive.
Li Rou led Duan Ling Tian and saluted the middle-aged man on his left.
"Ninth Elder, today's matter, my son Li Xin was at fault first, but now since your son is fine and my son has been exposed to the sun for a morning, is it possible to put him down?"
At this moment, the cock-eyed middle-aged man, also known as the Li Family's Seventh Elder, 'Li Kun', had a gloomy face.
Who knows, Li Rou didn't pay any attention to him at all.
Instead, he brought Duan Ling Tian and came to the tied up Li Xin.
"Tian'er, how did he hurt you in the morning, now, you will pay him back in full!" Chapter 1
Gu Shijiu woke up to a very deadly problem. The surroundings changed to something she didn't recognize at all!
Looking out through the gap in the cloisters, there was a moon wheel hanging curved in the sky, the stars were bright in the sky, and she was lying horizontally being carried forward.
She was a little confused and couldn t help but move a little, and then realized an even more damaging problem ---- She was naked! Her body was only wrapped in a thin silk quilt that wrapped her tightly from head to toe, with only a pair of eyes exposed.
Her cool gaze fell first on the two big men carrying her.
Kongwu powerful, muscle gnarled, ancient costume warrior dress, although carrying people walk quietly, a look is the practitioner, martial arts is not low look.
Gu Shijiu's fingers in the quilt tightened a bit!
She is the king of modern killers, cold and ruthless, across the world, but did not expect to encounter the most trusted person's backstabbing, that person's name is Long Xi, is her former instructor, but also the doctor, she does not believe in anyone but him, and even like him, want to marry him.
She was already dead, I did not expect not to go to Hades to drink tea, but somehow came here.
At this point in time she naturally didn't think that she was arriving at some shooting location.
She crossed over!
Crossing over to this body, he was wrapped up like a dumpling and carried towards a rather luxurious hall.
"Ah ...... ah ...... help ...... help ...... ah, ah, don't ...... "The woman's delicate, agonized screams instantly came out, calling back Gu Xijiu's drifting thoughts. She quickly swept her gaze, slightly staring! The furnishings in the hall are naturally beautiful, whether it is a rosewood table and chairs, or a bird and flower tortoiseshell screen, all show two words - luxury!
The man above has a handsome face, twenty-seven or eighty-eight years old, a head of long hair with a jade hairpin pin, haphazardly draped over the shoulders, muscle texture smooth, strong and powerful in the movement of one undulation, the corners of his lips pursed, lightly hooked with a hint of a cold smile, is a bit of a cool and handsome fierce man.
The following is a tender girl, looks on the age is very small, eyebrows clear, and that man face enjoyment expression is different, the little girl's face white, small mouth slightly open, voice has shouted mute, whimpering, cold sweat has been her hair wet through, obviously pain to the extreme. Gu Shijiu's face changed slightly!
This asshole, he's a hatchling! Who the hell is he?
The two big men carrying Gu Shijiu in didn't disturb the man's good mood, and his movements were faster and fiercer!
The little girl finally couldn't stand it, screamed a few times in a dark voice, her eyes rolled over, her head tilted, and she didn't move.
"Spoilsport!" The man let out a low curse and flipped over, getting off of the girl, and in one smooth motion, kicked the girl off the bed like a piece of trash.
The girl didn't move, her little face had turned a waxy yellow color, and there were lines of blood running down from the corners of her lips. It was not known whether she was dead or alive.
"This one is too useless, carry it to the mass grave and feed it to the dogs!" The man's tone was full of resentment.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff, is a small city in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in the northern part of Arizona and on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, neighboring the gambling city of Las Vegas to the west and the famous Grand Canyon of Colorado to the east.
The United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon of Colorado and Las Vegas, these four names many Chinese have heard of, but the city of Flagstaff, which is wrapped in the middle of these four regions, is probably not known to many people.
Six months ago, Lidu was one of those 'not many' until he came to Flagstaff to study abroad.
Flagstaff is not well known in this country, nor is it well known in the United States, but it does have a few good universities, such as the University of Arizona and Flagstaff American College.
Li Du studied at a school called Flagstaff State College, than Flagstaff American College difference in only one word, but between this one word, is a world of difference!
American College of Flagstaff is a branch of American College, which is a very good private university that offers undergraduate, specialized, and preparatory educational work.
It's a pheasant university, and Lidu was totally lured into graduate school.
As a result, his tuition and research funds were only paid for the first half of the year, and the school was closed down, the school board and the admissions department got the news in advance and ran away, leaving a group of international students full of confusion being driven away from the school by the police.
Li Du is considered lucky, because the school accommodation is too chaotic, he did not live in the dormitory in order to meditate and study, but found an apartment room to rent, now at least there is a place to stay. Those of his classmates who paid the accommodation fee to live in the school would be wandering the streets by now.
But his situation is not much better than his classmates; it's the end of January, his rent is due, and if he doesn't pay it in time, then he may have to live on the streets.
Tragically, this would leave him with no money on him!
Of course, he could have borrowed money from his parents and his classmates and friends in China, but that had a prerequisite that he was studying abroad. Now that the school has been banned, he definitely won't be able to go to graduate school, so how can he still have the face to ask his elderly parents for money? As for his classmates and friends?
He was sitting sadly in the doorway of the small building when the door to the pine room behind Lidu was pushed open and a blonde girl poked her head out, "Hey Lee, you here?"
The girl is his landlord, named Hannah Fox, and the house, an inheritance from her parents who died in a car accident, belongs to her and her brother, Hans Fox.
However, Hans claimed to be 'busy with big business' and would not come to stay for more than a few days a year, and the empty bedrooms were then rented out by Hannah to generate income.
At the sound of the greeting, Lidu got up and said, "Oh yes, Hannah, what can I do for you?"
The girl shrugged her shoulders and smiled, a pearly swirl appearing on her pretty face, "I was just cleaning out the fridge and saw a couple cans of beer that must have been left by that Hans guy. I remember you like wort beer, might as well drink it?"
In her hand she carried half a dozen six-packs of beer, very commonly packaged in a wooden box with a distinctive Budweiser logo.
The sight of the beers brought a smile to Lidu's face as well; there was only a small refrigerator in the apartment that he opened and closed every day, so where was the beer in it?
Besides, with Hans' temperament, he wouldn't have stayed if there had been any real beer, the guy was addicted to alcohol.
At his guess, the beer had been bought to comfort him by Hannah, who had already comforted him many times after learning that their school had been seized, and had touched him.
But Hannah has a small set of ways to comfort him, either by giving him an inspirational book or a beer.
This American girl once approached him to learn about Chinese culture and learned the expression 'a drunken night's sleep relieves a thousand sorrows'. She thought that according to the Chinese character, getting drunk and sleeping could relieve sorrows, so she gave him beer to drink several times.
Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness as a favor owed to the girl. In American society, some gifts could not be refused or they would be misunderstood as a rejection of friendship, and he cherished his friendship with Hannah.
When he took the wooden box, Hannah smiled and left, saying before she left, "Life is full of problems, but beautiful as usual."
Chanting this American slang a few times, Li Du opened the package and wanted to take out a can of beer. But just as he unwrapped the wooden box, a piece of crystal that seemed like amber suddenly fell out and fell to the ground with a 'click'.
The crystal was about the size of his thumbnail, and a few cracks appeared on it from the heavier fall on the concrete.
The reason why he guessed that it was amber was because it was yellowish in color and had a small worm wrapped around it, much like an amber he had seen in the sixth grade. At that time, their textbook had a text titled "Amber" and the language teacher brought an amber to their class.
The crystal brought back some good memories of his childhood, he remembered his teacher at the time saying that amber encased in small worms was precious. Unfortunately, this one had cracked, which made him regret, otherwise he could have sold it for two months of living expenses.
The crystal had been dropped so badly that it had shattered when he picked it up, the little purple worm encased in it showing through.
The small insect resembled a locust, it was about two centimeters in length, oddly shaped, with locust-like compound eyes, but there were only two legs under its stomach, with strange patterns on its legs, and no wings on its back, making it look awkward.
Lidu had never seen this kind of bug before and strangely lifted it up to get a better look.
Just then, something treacherous happened: the bug's claws suddenly moved, then quickly rejuvenated and twisted their bodies to break free from between his fingers.
Before he could react, after the little bug jumped into his palm, its head dropped down and it just slowly, bit by bit, burrowed into his hand!
Lidu is scared to pee, really to pee!
Screaming in misery, he stumbled toward the house, calling, "Hannah, call 911! Help, a bug got into my hand!"
Figuring his screams were too harsh, Hannah came out with a panicked expression, "What? What bugs?"
Lidu spread his hand out for her to see, "This is it, this bug in my palm!"
Hannah was all confused, "A bug in your hand? Where are the worms in your hand?"
Not only was there a worm, this worm was still moving, after it drilled into the palm of Li Du's hand, it seemed to be unwilling to be left alone, this time it drilled outwards again, with half of its body drilling out.
Lidu pointed to the bugs that were burrowing out and said in horror, "This one, right here, the purple locusts, can't you see them?"
Lido interrupted her and called out, "I understand what you mean, you think I'm crazy! But I'm not crazy, Hannah!"
"Shelter, the bug's burrowed out again!"
Just as he was screaming at the top of his lungs, the bug slowly burrowed out of his skin and jumped to the ground, poking up his upper body to support himself with his legs, and striding across the ground just like a human.
As it happened, it landed next to a drain, and the little bug didn't pay attention to walk past it and fall headfirst.
Seeing this, Lidu rejoiced and said, "Great, the worm fell into the drain."
Subconsciously, a thought appeared in his mind, that is, what is in the drain? Would there be sewage and then drown this worm?
However, a scene that made him incredulous happened!
Chapter 1
God's country, the Northern Desert.
Ice and snow ravaged the entire land, mangled mountains, thousands of gullies and ravines are a silver, goose feather snow rustling down, look away from the sky and earth a color.
A caravan was resting on the curved mountain road, the wind and snow were so heavy that the wagons had difficulty walking, and they had to wait for the wind and snow to be lighter before going on the road.
"Look, the coffin puller!"
A middle-aged man's exclamation of surprise caught the attention of the merchants, a group of people curiously raised their heads towards the distance, and after only a few glances, all of them were physically and mentally shaken!
The wind and snow whistled in the sky, the sky and the earth became misty, and a mysterious golden ancient coffin loomed in the distant mountain pass, gradually appearing in the field of view of the crowd.
That golden ancient coffin was two meters long, one meter wide and high, and the walls of the coffin were engraved with ancient patterns and runes. The patterns and runes emitted a faint ghostly light, isolating all the falling snowflakes, bizarre to the extreme.
There was one more thing that shocked the crowd, the coffin puller in front of the ancient coffin.
It was a teenager who looked to be only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was bare~naked, arching his back, his hands grasping the two giant chains of cold iron, carrying the chains with his shoulders, and was struggling to pull the ancient coffin forward step by step.
A teenager pulling a coffin on an icy day!
This picture is very visual impact, heart-stopping. Behind the golden ancient coffin emitted a ghostly light, the teenager's body reflected a little blurred, can not see the face, in a trance the crowd as if they saw a god and goddess pulling the coffin to come.
"This teenager was born with godly strength."
That middle-aged man exclaimed again, and many people turned back to carefully examine the teenager, determining that there was no Xuan Li light shining on him, and once again moved.
Ordinary willow coffins have three to four hundred pounds, this ancient coffin is cast in gold throughout, needless to say at least three thousand pounds or more.
If a teenager did not have Xuan power, then he was not a true martial artist, even powerful strong men only had a huge strength of five or six hundred pounds. The fact that a teenager could pull a three thousand kilograms ancient coffin by himself, although it seemed a bit of a struggle, it was shocking enough.
"Young and quite handsome, actually came to pull the coffin, this teenager wants to be unlucky for the rest of his life?"
An old man lamented, and many people nodded in agreement. Although this matter of pulling coffins is not common, but in the history of the Northern Desert occasionally occurred, the crowd all understand some.
When an important clan member of the Northern Desert dies, they like to be buried in a giant coffin of gold. These giant coffins are not buried under the earth, but are placed on top of the icebergs, which is said to bless the people of the clan.
When the family declines or encounters a major change, the family will organize a coffin pulling ceremony to find a new iceberg to transfer the ancestral coffins of the family, replace the feng shui, and reestablish the well-being of the family.
This brings us to the coffin pullers.
Pulling the coffin is something that will damage the luck, in the minds of many people in the North Desert, when pulling the coffin, their own luck will be sucked up by the corpse in the coffin, and their body essence and longevity will also be absorbed, and they will be unlucky or sick for the rest of their lives.
So pulling coffins is the North Desert is the most lowly occupation, even if the commission given even higher young martial artists will not be moved, only down and out elderly martial artists will go to pull coffins.
The teenager had fine features, was about one meter seventy-five in height, had broad shoulders and a narrow waist, and his legs were long and muscular. Wearing an ancient beast tooth around his neck, he looked wild, very good in terms of appearance alone.
Fourteen or fifteen years old, handsome in appearance, with all the power of the gods, not a bad condition for a teenager. And yet he's here to do this most despicable and degrading job of pulling coffins?
"Isn't he afraid that his qi will be taken away, his yang life will be greatly reduced, and he will be unlucky for the rest of his life?" The middle-aged man stared at the golden ancient coffin for a few sweeps and released, "This seems to be the ancestral coffin of the Liu Family? That's right, I've heard that the Liu Family has recently suffered a great change and offered a sky-high price."
"Silence, the Liu Family's people are coming." An old man suddenly said, and everyone in the caravan hurriedly shut up, their gazes cast into the distance.
Woo-hoo!
A howl of wild beasts came from the distance, a team of martial artists wearing black battle armor and riding silver giant wolves came running wildly, and before they got close to the giant wolves the ferocious aura of the wolves' bodies came on their faces.
"The Silver Wolf Guards, they are indeed martial artists from the Liu Family."
The crowd nodded their heads secretly, in the entire vicinity of Wuling City in a radius of a thousand miles, there was only one army riding silver wolves, and that was the strongest silver wolf guards of the Liu Family.
The Silver Wolf Guards stopped after catching up with the teenager, and a middle-aged giant man at the forefront, holding a long whip, looked at the teenager and coldly shouted, "Lu Li, walk faster! If you don't pull up to Black Eagle Ridge before nightfall, you will not have any reward."
The teenager known as Lu Li looked up, surrounded by a dozen or so huge silver wolves a meter tall and two meters long, he didn't have much fear and nodded, "Don't worry my lord, I'll definitely make it before nightfall."
The giant man let out a deep cry and took the Silver Wolf Guards on a run, quickly disappearing into the vast mountains in the distance.
Lu Li swept a glance at the merchants staying nearby and continued to pull the coffin forward in silence. He grasped the giant cold iron chain with both hands and carried it on his shoulders as he fought his way forward, every step he took was extremely difficult, and the muscles of his entire body trembled. Nonetheless, his steps did not stop at all, and he quickly passed the merchant group and walked towards the distance.
"That's heavy!"
After traveling a few miles forward and up a steep slope Lu Li stopped. He was panting with exhaustion, hot and sweaty in such a bitter cold weather, so one could imagine how much physical exertion he was experiencing.
Thinking of resting for a while, he placed the ancient coffin in place and sat down on a rock to take out fresh water and dried meat from the sack behind him, chewing and swallowing to replenish his strength.
We should be able to make it before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat and looking at the sky, his gaze quickly brightened and he said to himself, "Pulling a coffin can be exchanged for an elixir, I wonder if the Liu Family's Body Tempering Elixir is really as the legend says, a single one can increase the strength of five hundred pounds of enormous strength?"
"If I can really increase my giant strength by five hundred pounds, I now possess three thousand pounds of strength, and I only need to pull a dozen coffins to reach ten thousand pounds of giant strength, and I will be able to ...... awaken my bloodline!"
"Let's see who else in the tribe dares to bully my sister. Hey, I'll soon be able to bring my sister to a good life."
Thinking of this, Lu Li's tired face glowed with glory as he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward, this time his footsteps were more steady and fast.
Rustle!
After traveling forward for several miles, a voice sounded from behind, Lu Li looked back and his face was slightly gloomy.
At the back was also a puller, but it was an old man. This old man's hands that were grasping the chains were lit up with channels of white light, and there was also white light vaguely flowing on his feet.
Lu Li murmured enviously, the white light was the Xuan Power that only martial artists had. A martial artist who possessed Xuan Power would have a much greater strength, and this old man had utilized his Xuan Power, which made him as fit as a fiddle, pulling the ancient coffin with ease.
The old man caught up with Lu Li, he took a look and frowned, "Young man, why are you pulling coffins too? It'll depreciate your chi."
Lu Li slightly smiled and did not say anything, the old man looked at him a few times, no more words quickly pulled the coffin far away.
"If we can no longer awaken our bloodline, what future is there to speak of? The only thing to do is to be mediocre for the rest of your life, being bullied every day and dragging your sister along to suffer."
"No, this is not the life I want!"
Thinking of this, Lu Li's face became a little twisted up as he roared angrily, gritting his teeth and quickly pulling the coffin forward.
The wind and snow are getting bigger and bigger, the sky is gradually becoming dark, and the ghostly light emanating from the golden coffin in the vast mountain road is hidden and appears to be unusually bizarre and mysterious.
Chapter 001
"Brother is going to look for a job, you stay home and do your homework, here is ten dollars, don't forget to go out and buy something to eat at lunch."
In front of the door of a low hut in the slum area, Lu Li patted the little loli's head and rubbed it lovingly again and again, it was so nice to see his sister so healthy and lively!
"Brother, I know," Lori whined, "Don't rub my hair, it's all messed up."
The younger sister Lu Xin was very considerate in helping Lu Li to organize his clothes and urged like a little adult, "Be sure to work hard, oh, brother is so capable of hard work, I'm sure he will be able to find a job this time."
"Don't worry, my brother will find a good job and earn lots and lots of money, so that Xin Xin can live let a good life," Lu Li hugged his sister and secretly added in his heart, and will not watch you lose your life little by little because of lack of money.
"When Xin Xin grows up, she'll make lots and lots of money too," the little loli twisted in Lu Li's arms and waved her little fist with conviction.
No matter how reluctant he was, Lu Li still bid farewell to his sister.
When he got on the bus, his hands in his pockets paused and he couldn't help but smile bitterly.
The money I had just given my sister for her lunch was back in my pocket, I should have expected this little girl to do this, what a heartbreakingly good behavior.
It is now the 23rd century, technology is infinitely advanced, all kinds of intelligent technology fills every corner of the world, this development has brought people's lives a rapid progress, but incidentally, it also makes the manpower needs to minimize.
Unemployment was no longer an uncommon thing, especially for people at the bottom of the social ladder like Lu Li, finding a stable job could only be a luxury.
If there are no accidents, he will remain unemployed.
Until by chance he joined a game union's gold-beating group to stabilize, but due to the fact that when he entered this game called Dawn, the game had been open for almost a year, and his level lagged behind too much, so he had not been able to rank amongst the super masters.
Two more years later, my sister Lu Xin was found to be seriously ill during a school physical.
Without the money to pay for the treatment costing up to millions, and having been hunted down by several unions teaming up during that time in the game, he could only watch in agony as his only loved one weakened day by day.
The feeling was even worse than cutting flesh with a knife, and Lu Li cried out in pain as he hugged his sister more than once.
However, there was a twist of fate. On the day he received the critical notice, Lu Li cried for a while before falling asleep on his sister's hospital bed, and woke up to find that he had been reborn, reborn to three years ago.
While happy that his sister was still healthy, he knew he had to make money, lots and lots of money.
With money, she can cure her sister's illness as early as possible, and only with money can she let her sister live the happy life that innocent and cute little girls should live, just like those countless others of her age.
With money, you can raise your eyebrows and not be inferior at any time!
After doing the math, Lu Li was helpless to realize that even after being reborn, it wasn't easy to become rich.
All he could do for himself, it seemed, was play the game - the one he'd been playing for over two years, Aurora - and right now there were only a few days left before it opened.
Lu Li had already given up on finding a proper job, he came out today and went directly to the Star Moon Labor Union headquarters that he had served in his previous life.
Star Moon Labor Union is not a game top ten, nor is it the top four in China, it is just a game alliance made up of a group of college students, the union's heads are all very rich rich second-generation, because of the willingness to spend money, so the development is also in a good shape.
Located next to the university town of Qinghu district is considered the most beautiful scenery of this generation, by the mountains, cherry blossoms everywhere, in front of the office building, the back is the villa area, only very wealthy people may be able to set up a company here.
The receptionist beauty took a somewhat disgusted look at Lu Li's outfit, dialed a string of numbers, and then informed Lu Li that he could go in for the interview.
"We're only recruiting Daredevils at the moment, no more gold beaters," the person in charge of recruiting was a girl, dressed in a very trendy way, and was in charge of the interview while painting her nails and not raising her head.
The so-called death squads are actually cannon fodder, and it's not unusual for a dozen or so meetings to die in a day.
The reason why Lu Li wants to find a studio to join, the purpose is to use the studio's game helmet for free, although the goldsmith has no future, but at least it can be upgraded, doomed to upgrade the difficult cannon fodder is not what he wants, death in the game will lose experience.
"What, 20 gold!" Nail polish was applied to her face in one fell swoop, and the girl shrieked like a cat that had been stepped on.
Although "Dawn" represents the most advanced virtual technology today, with the world's most first-class design team, but it is not so confident that it does not need the inside to dare to market the point, only that the test content is relatively small, and is decentralized testing, and will not have an impact on the normal game just.
In just a few days of testing, the most profound impression left on players is that gold is not good, and there are just too many places to spend money.
Normal game players basically can't make ends meet in the early stages, and experienced goldsmiths can't save more than a few silver coins a day.
Some senior professional players estimated that if they wanted to save enough 20 gold to establish a labor union, a 100-member gold hitting group brushing the right monsters and removing the consumption of repairing equipment and potions, it would take a week or even more at the very least, and this was still the case when the money burst rate was on the high side before the game's third system update.
And this kid in front of me, he actually promised to come up with 20 gold within a week!
20 gold. That's 200,000 copper coins.
"Have you participated in the inner side, did you find any bugs to swipe money?" The recruiting beauty asked suspiciously as her heart fluttered.
Lu Li smiled without saying anything, looking extremely inscrutable.
"Ao Jian, I have something here, come over here ...... En, someone came to apply for the job of gold hunter, said that he can turn in twenty gold in a week, I suspect that he has a BUG for brushing money," the recruiting beauty had no choice but to call the senior in a whisper.
It wasn't long before he heard a rush of footsteps, and when he turned his head to look, Lu Li was also a bit surprised.
The people who came over in addition to Star Moon's boss Ao Jian, actually followed by several people, Lu Li's previous life in the Star Moon union for two years, most of these people know, all the union's senior.
"Ow oh, don't tell me, the one who can get twenty gold a week is this kid," the small man walking next to Ao Jian couldn't help but wail, this man's game name was Half Smoke, he was the head of the Thieves Group of the Star and Moon Union, and he was a very hairy person.
"You have a way to get twenty gold coins within a week, sure it's the game Dawn?" Ao Jian's face wasn't very pretty either, he was holding on to a ray of hope, but seeing Lu Li's appearance, that ray of hope was gone.
Lu Li has an ordinary appearance, his face is waxen and dark, the clothes on his body are wrinkled, and there are obvious traces of wear and tear at the edges and corners of the threads, and it is clear at a glance that he is the kind of person who rolls and crawls at the lowest level of society.
"Word of mouth is no proof, even if I can't get you, I don't have much to lose, don't I?" Facing the social elites with huge aura and front and back clusters, Lu Li was not in the hurry of a small person at the bottom of the hierarchy, he just smiled faintly and his calm gaze seemed to be full of endless confidence.
Chapter 1
"Ye Mo, Ye Mo, are you alright, get up quickly, class is about to start, this class is for Emotionless Ice, hurry up." A somewhat urgent voice rang in Ye Mo's ears, Ye Mo had a very strange feeling.
"This idiot, I guess he's covered his face up since he's been disgraced." Another voice rang in his ears, but Ye Mo woke up this time.
Ye Mo looked around a bit bewildered, not a single person he recognized, all unfamiliar faces.
Seeing Ye Mo's bewildered look, another burst of laughter came from the room, it was obvious that all the laughter here was directed at him, seeing that the people laughing around him seemed to be mocking him, for a moment he didn't dare to make a question, he could only be secretly on guard against someone laying a hand on him.
Looking at the classmate sitting next to him, he seemed to be the only one who didn't laugh at himself, and he was the one who kindly pushed himself to wake up just now.
"How is it like a schoolhouse?" Ye Mo asked subconsciously with some surprise.
"Haha ......" came another burst of laughter.
"Ye Mo, I think you're just angry and confused, is it okay for Yan Yan to just write love letters too? You were fine in the Ye family, now you're no longer a member of the Ye family, be careful in the future."
The table sighed, naturally of course he didn't believe that Ye Mo wouldn't remember in such a short while, it was just love of face. He hadn't recognized the reality that he wasn't Ye Mo of the Ye family anymore.
Ye Mo's head ached for a while, he remembered that he and his master Luo Ying were refining the Yuan Recovery Dan, and then the group of mongrels from the Xiliu Sect fought over, and then there were explosions and all kinds of killing noises, and he remembered that his master hugged himself and used a recluse talisman in the back, but how did he end up here? This is still the Luo Yue continent?
Right, he was sitting here now, where was Master? Master was only three years older than him, not to mention that the reason why the Xiliu Sect had come to attack them suddenly was because Master was too beautiful, and the young master of the Xiliu Sect wanted to marry his beautiful Master, something that happened only after Master had rejected him.
In case his master fell into the hands of the Xiliu Sect, the consequences would be unimaginable, thinking of this, Ye Mo could no longer hold back his inner panic and stood up abruptly.
"What's the matter, don't you know that the class bell has rung?" A young woman with a cool face walked onto the podium with a few books in her hand, and coldly swept a glance at the students below who were roaring with laughter, and the sound of laughter suddenly diminished.
Everyone knew that this was the English class lecturer Yun Bing, what she hated the most was students getting up in arms, and that once they were targeted by her, there was absolutely no good fruit to eat. Ye Mo already felt that something was wrong, although he could understand the words, it was obvious that the language was not the one he originally used, could it be that this was no longer the Luo Yue continent? Frowning, Ye Mo wanted to know more clearly, a headache came and a lot of messy information was memorized.
And Ye Mo was completely kicked out of the Ye family after his father's death, specifically because Ye Mo wasn't Ye Wentian's seed. To be more precise, after Ye Mo's father died, Ye Mo's bloodline was re-validated once again, and he was recognized as not being the seed of the Ye family, which led to the expulsion from the Ye clan.
However, he also had a younger sister, Ye Ling, and a younger brother, Ye Zifeng. It was just that neither of them had the same mother as him, but were half siblings. Three years ago, his father seemed to know that he owed Ye Mo as if he was in debt to him, and purposely proposed a marriage with the Ning family to the Ye family's old man, and Ye Tianwen most likely knew that he was physically unable to do so, so he wanted to help Ye Mo find a backer, and that's why he found the Ning family in the capital.
For being able to marry with the Ye family, one of the top five families in China, the Ning family was of course willing to do so. They promised Elder Ning's granddaughter, Ning Qingxue, to Ye Mo.
During a medical checkup in a hospital, Ye Mo was checked out as being Heavenly Impotent, which, to put it bluntly, means that he cannot be humanized. Although the Ye family wanted to try hard to hide the fact, but overnight it seemed that the entire capital city knew that the Ye family, one of the five great families of China, had produced a Heavenly Impotence, and the Ye family was considered to have lost a big face.
"Ah ......" the memory was turned over, Ye Mo shrieked and stood up, and almost immediately had to take his pants off to take a look. He already somewhat understood that he might have been reborn into a person also named Ye Mo, but he actually couldn't be humane, it would be better to kill him.
"That student, what's your name, what are you yelling during class, come to my office after class." The beautiful teacher who was lecturing was interrupted by Ye Mo's shrieking and her face was very unsightly.
The rest of the class is secretly funny, moving to let a college student to go to the office, it is estimated that only this English teacher can do it, do not go is not good, credits in the hands of others.
Ye Mo disheveled sat down, although he does not quite understand the inner workings of the family struggle, but also some understanding of their own likely because of the impotence of the day was driven out of the Ye family, not necessarily because he is not a person of the Ye family, and the DNA test to do something about the foot who knows.
Ye Mo's concern was not about him being kicked out of the Ye family, for that, he wouldn't care at all, what he was concerned about was his heavenly impotence. There was also the matter of how his master Luo Ying was doing.
But he also understood why the class was laughing, it was because this predecessor of his had obviously been kicked out of the Ye family, but he was still dead set on going after the hottest girl in the class, Yan Yan. As a result, the other person had posted her love letter of confession on the blackboard, then stood on the podium and looked at herself defiantly and said, "Young Master Ye, can you sleep with me?"
Later, after the impotence of the sky was rumored, he wanted to find a girlfriend because he was ashamed to save face, but he did not expect the original very flattering girls actually so to him, under the shame and urgency of this fainted, cheap rebirth of his own.
He was actually reborn to such a place. He couldn't understand a single word of the beautiful teacher's class on the podium, and even if he did, Ye Mo wouldn't listen to it, and for him to be impotent right now was something that he absolutely couldn't accept. Instead of being reborn into such a place, he might as well not be reborn.
Whether or not to go to this university is already a matter of indifference, the main thing is to figure out his current situation. His impotence was related to the Ye family's reputation issue, although he was kicked out of the Ye family, but who knows if he would suddenly be killed? Maybe there were other insiders that caused the expulsion from the Ye family, was his safety still guaranteed now?
After the bell rang, Ye Mo's first thing of course is not to go to the beautiful teacher, but hurriedly rushed out of the school, he wants to find a place to look at his own little **, is not really heavenly impotence.
It was good that there wasn't much else beside Ninghai University, but there were quite a few small hutongs, and Ye Mo hurriedly ran into a remote and unoccupied small hutong and hurriedly pulled down his pants.
The small ** was really small, but Ye Mo wasn't disappointed because the small ** was small, but instead, he really let out a long breath. He wasn't Heavenly Impotence, but because the small ** was too big, it was blocked from developing by one of the meridians, causing this fake Heavenly Impotence.
But that's just it, with the current technology on earth wanting to open this blocked meridian of his is undoubtedly a fool's errand, but it's not hard for Ye Mo, although right now he doesn't have the ability to open up the blocked meridian to make his little *** majestic, but as long as he reaches the third level of qi practicing, this meridian will automatically be flushed open.
It was just that Ye Mo immediately started to get a little disappointed again, because in this Earth where the Yuan Qi of heaven and earth was so thin, it was undoubtedly an arduous task to cultivate to the third level of Qi cultivation, maybe he wouldn't be able to reach it for the rest of his life, and in that case, he would still be equating to impotence. Sighing, Ye Mo was about to pull up his pants when a sudden shriek made him jolt.
"Playing hooligans ah ......" an absolutely high decibel soprano voice, rang right in front of Ye Mo, Ye Mo just now only focused on checking his own little **, actually forgot to check the surrounding situation. I didn't realize that this little hutong was still connected, it's just that the turn in front of it can't be seen here.
Ye Mo wasn't an exhibitionist, besides he didn't have any capital to expose right now, and hurriedly pulled his pants up and was about to sneak away.
"Ye Mo, how come it's you?" After this woman screamed, she actually asked in a surprised tone again, it was obvious that she recognized Ye Mo.
Chapter 1
It's late at night, and the Green Bamboo Senior Community in Jinhai City.
Shi Feng sat quietly on the soft leather sofa, holding a stack of papers in his hands, looking out the floor-to-ceiling window at the swimming pool, filled with loss and resignation.
As the leader of the Phantom Shadow, one of the four major game studios in Jinhai City, he was in charge of a large guild of tens of thousands of people, and he was also a renowned expert of the Sword Magician in Jinhai City, but now he could only sit at home and drink to relieve his sorrows.
Ten years of gaming.
Ten years of bloodshed.
Experienced countless pains and tribulations, finally led the shadow guild, in the "God's domain" established ten city states, can start and first-class guilds to compete, enjoy endless glory, a paper, all into the passing clouds, never to return.
Shi Feng never thought that his ten years of hard work would be in vain, for the sake of the game, he gave up so much, but in the end, he became someone else's dowry, all because of his opposition to the Phantom Shadow's merger into the super guild Xiong Ba Tian Tian, less than the next day, the Blue China Consortium gave him an answer, deleting his account of a level 200 Sword King, which he had spent ten years of hard work to train, and going to the finance office to settle the salary.
What he could get was just five million credits and a mansion, which was less than a drop in the bucket compared to the ten city-states that had been established and the virtual kingdoms that were making money day in and day out.
Shi Feng thought about how he had paid so much for the Phantom Shadow, making the Blue China Group into a large consortium, and a great deal of the credit was his, but it turned out to be like throwing away garbage, and for what the Blue China Consortium had done, he would surely retaliate.
"I would never just let it go, big deal, start over."
Shi Feng's eyes flashed with confidence and determination as the termination documents in his hands were torn to shreds, then he picked up a bottle of red wine on the table and fiercely poured a few mouthfuls.
Even without the King of Swords account and the support of his team, the technology and knowledge in the game would not betray him. As long as the technology was still there, it was just as possible to rise up in the God's Domain and build a virtual kingdom of his own once again.
Early in the morning, the sun had just risen.
Tick-tock!
The ringtone of the cell phone kept ringing.
Disgruntled at being woken up, Shi Feng got up helplessly and picked up the cell phone next to his bed, still dizzy from last night's hangover to this day.
"Hey, what's up?"
"Brother Feng, I'm Blackie, what's the matter you're still asking about? We agreed to become professional players, today is the recruiting day for the Phantom Shadow Studio in the school, haven't you always wanted to become a core member of Phantom Shadow?"
Shi Feng was a bit confused.
He had just been fired from the Blue China Consortium, so how could he go to the Phantom Shadow to take the test. "Brother Feng, Brother Feng?
Are you listening? They're going to test at ten o'clock, if you don't get here soon, it'll be too late!"
"Kuroko, don't kid yourself, I was just fired from Phantom Shadow."
"Brother Feng, how much did you drink yesterday? Until now did not wake up ah, the shadow of the ghost has not yet recruited, how you were fired? Well hurry up and come on."
Before Shi Feng could react, Blackie hung up the phone.
Shi Feng, whose head was drowsy, looked at his cell phone and realized that this worn out Love Crazy Six was not his cell phone at all, but his cell phone was the latest Love Crazy Twelve.
Then he looked around. The small bedroom of less than fifteen square meters was in disarray, there were books about game strategies everywhere, as well as the laptop sitting on the desk in the corner, which was also a very outdated and old model, and in the large closet by the wall, there were many clothes scattered, and in the fitting mirror of the large closet a familiar face appeared.
Shi Feng was suddenly startled when he saw this familiar and incomparable face.
Shi Feng immediately got up and walked over to the fitting mirror, taking pictures again and again before he was sure that he had really gotten younger.
Yesterday I was sleeping in a spacious, luxurious bedroom, and now I get up, and I'm in this shitty place, and I'm younger.
Shi Feng still had some memories of this place. That was ten years ago, when he bit the bullet and rented a small house when he was in his senior year of college in order to conquer the God's Domain, he lived there for more than half a year, and then after earning some in the God's Domain, he went to the city and rented a large apartment-style house.
I think back then it was tough as hell, the family situation is not good, in order for him to go to college, but also owed a lot of foreign debt, so that parents still hard work every month to earn enough money to send enough living expenses, so that he suffered.
Shi Feng is bent on making money to change the family situation, but college students are all over the street, want to find a good income job is harder than heaven, so thought of the most lucrative virtual games, in order to enhance the game technology, he was ruthless to buy a virtual helmet, has become a professional player as the goal, in the virtual game to practice hard technology.
At that time he ate white bread buns and noodles every day, in order to save money, the class every time the organization of classmates reunion or fellowship did not participate in, so it became the class of the small transparent, the boys despise, the girls see and far away, every time you go to the supermarket to buy noodles, but the wallet is less than ten credits, and even one credit ham sausage do not dare to buy, the female saleswoman look at the poor Shi Feng, recommended a special ham, Shi Feng looked at the tempting ham, but also After touching his wallet, he gritted his teeth and refused.
"Could it be that someone is playing a joke on me?"
Shi Feng couldn't help but shake his head as he looked at the familiar scene and his younger self in the mirror, dismissing the idea.
Even the most developed United States of America doesn't have such rejuvenation technology, who would joke with a wayward uncle.
Shi Feng looked at the time on his cell phone again.
April 19, 2129.
"Could it be that I've been reborn?" Shi Feng joked with a bitter smile on his face.
He remembers that today is August 5, 2139, it can't be April 2129 when he was still in his senior year.
Shi Feng shook his head, wanting to clear his head a bit, but still holding a hint of expectation in his heart that he would be reborn and actually return to ten years ago, he walked over to his computer desk and turned his laptop on.
If you can fake the time on a cell phone, you can't always fake the news on the internet.
After a few minutes on the internet.
Shi Feng was completely shocked, the various information he had checked on the internet all showed that today was indeed April 19th, 2129, and even the official website for the official opening time of the globally hot God's Domain was written clearly, with the countdown being April 25th, six days later.
"Have I really returned ten years ago?" Shi Feng stared dead center at the Divine Realm's news report, leaving tears of excitement in the corners of his eyes.
At this time, Shi Feng's mood was indescribable, with regret, grief, and joy.
It was as if everything in front of me was a dream.
But the cicadas chirping outside the window and the cold air blowing from the air conditioner reminded Shi Feng that it was all true.
Looking at the family photo on his cell phone from when he went to college, Shi Feng never realized that his father had gray hair, and his mother had wrinkles at the corners of her eyes, and that they were really getting old and not as vibrant as they used to be.
When he noticed that his parents were getting old, it was a year and a half after the opening of the Divine Realm, the high debt, excessive labor and stress had caused both of his parents to become seriously ill, and once they fell ill, it would take millions of credits to recover from the cure, but at that time, Shi Feng was only a squad leader of the Phantom Shadows, and the amount of money that he had earned would not be able to pay for such an expensive expense.
In order to raise money, Shi Feng tried everything he could think of, but unfortunately it was still not enough, and even though Shi Feng tried everything he could to keep it up, his parents left a few months later.
In his last life he had not taken good care of his parents, and who knew about the pain and regret?
Even if Shi Feng later earned millions of credits, this became a permanent pain in Shi Feng's heart.
I didn't realize that fate had played such a joke on him, that he really started from zero and everything returned to square one.
"Good, great, hahaha. Since I've been reborn, I'm going to change all of this, earn enough money to cure my parents, and not let them labor over their lives." Shi Feng wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes and secretly vowed.
Just as Shi Feng was planning his future, Blackie's phone call came again, constantly urging Shi Feng to go to the university to take the test.
However, Shi Feng was not slow to get dressed and clean himself up before heading to Golden Sea University.
He was more than familiar with the Phantom Shadow.
I remember when I was in college, the Blue China Group's eldest son, Blue Sea Dragon, opened the Phantom Shadow Studio, and at the same time provided a large amount of funds to organize the master students in the Golden Sea University, to fight in the God's domain, at that time, he also went to the examination, and became a core member, and the black son became a peripheral member, and at that time, he was happy for a long time.
Three years later the Phantom Shadow Studio had his leadership, and all of a sudden it allowed the Blue China Group to make a lot of money in the Divine Realm, leaping to become a large consortium, not expecting that it would end up being fired by Lan Hailong himself.
Since he has been reborn, he also has an advantage over God's Domain that others can't match, naturally, he is not prepared to join the Phantom Shadow again and become someone else's tool to make money for someone else, he is going to take a different path, he is going to fight for his own life, he doesn't have to ask his parents to send his living expenses and pay off all his debts, so he is going to start a new business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and live a good life.
When Shi Feng arrived in front of the No. 1 Teaching Building, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned youth walking around the main entrance, anxious, and this person was none other than Hei Zi.
"Brother Feng, you're finally here, luckily registration hasn't closed, let's quickly go in and register." Blackie said anxiously after seeing Shi Feng.
Shi Feng shook his head and said very seriously, "Blackie, I'm not going to go to Phantom Shadow, I'm going to open my own studio, are you coming?"
Blackie is in a virtual game to know, technology is very good, and then together to break into the world, can be said to be a blood brother, in the shadow of the shadow of the phantom together, blackie although no game talent, but management is very strong, the guild of hundreds of thousands of people to manage the orderly, if there is the blackie's help, to achieve the goal will be further, but he will follow the blackie's choice, after all, he is now nothing, the blackie's family situation is also Not good, in order to live only decided to be a professional player, join the shadow of the shadow of the ghost to earn a living.
A full minute passed before Blackie looked up at Shi Feng.
"Brother Feng, don't say anything stupid, do you know how much a virtual helmet costs? That's eight thousand credits, to open a studio, you need at least six people, right, and a working space, and pay wages, etc., the start-up capital alone will be seventy to eighty thousand dollars, and the subsequent investment, that's a lot of money, but do you have that much money now?" Blackie knew Shi Feng's situation very well, knew that Shi Feng's family was not well off, and wanted to persuade Shi Feng to give up this crazy idea.
"You're right, I don't even have the money to buy the Divine Realm Virtual Helmet right now." Shi Feng silently nodded his head in acknowledgement, as Blackie said, even seventy to eighty thousand was said to be less, remembering that Blue Flying Dragon's recruitment of a hundred-man studio had cost more than five million, and a lot more had been spent at a later stage in order to improve the quality and strength of the studio.
"If that's the case, why are we bothering to take the risk, wouldn't it be more stable to go to Phantom Shadow, at least Phantom Shadow can provide virtual helmets, otherwise we wouldn't even be able to play, let alone become professional players." Blackie could see that Shi Feng understood the crux of the matter, and with a sigh of relief, he pulled Shi Feng to enter the school building.
Shi Feng shook off Hei Zi's hand and looked earnestly at Hei Zi with a serious and incomparable expression, "But I still intend to open my own studio, I don't want to be subjected to moderation, Hei Zi, are you coming?"
Shi Feng would not force himself on Blackie, after all, he did not have any guarantees and could not possibly reveal the secret that he was a reborn, he only hoped that Blackie would believe him.
When Blackie saw Shi Feng looking so serious, he always felt that today's Shi Feng was very strange and too crazy, it was impossible to make money in the early stages of the virtual game, this was known to everyone, did Shi Feng have any way to make money in the God's Domain? Even if they made money, it would be a few months later, they didn't have that much time to waste.
Blackie hesitated for half a day, gritted his teeth, and finally agreed, "I know, who let you be the big brother, I'll open the studio with you is, but what about the virtual helmet, we can't play the game without it?"
Shi Feng's tightened brow instantly loosened, happily patting Blackie's shoulder, smiling, "This is my good brother, the matter of the virtual helmet is assured, I remember that God's Domain has a trial offer for college students, there is a place of issuance in every university, as long as by virtue of a student ID card, you can pick up the virtual helmet for a free trial of ten days, let's go and take a look at it."
Blackie's dark face turned iron blue at this moment, feeling that the future was a dark one, why did he trust Shi Feng? Could it be Shi Feng's kind of confidence and peace of mind? Is it really okay to follow Shi Feng and start a business together?
What can you do in God's domain in ten days?
Ten days passed, surely we would miss the good time for major studios to recruit, and in the end, we would still have to buy virtual helmets, but how would the money come?
Trying to earn sixteen thousand credits in the ten days of the opening of the Divine Realm was something even a regiment of professional players couldn't do!
"I'll take care of the money."
Shi Feng patted Blackie's shoulder with a confident smile.
Earning sixteen thousand credits in ten days was whimsical, but he had the vigor of being a born-again, and no matter what difficulties he faced, he would break them one by one. And the opening of the Divine Realm was the beginning of his rise.
Shi Feng then took Blackie to collect the demo helmet, and then bought all the money for instant noodles and put them next to the computer desk in the rented room, two whole big boxes, enough for more than ten days of meals, and after that explained some things about the Divine Realm, he quietly waited for the opening of the Divine Realm.
At nine o'clock in the evening of April 25, a few dim lights flickered in the dark and silent cabin.
Shi Feng lay still on the bed, his eyes closed as he gently clicked the helmet's start button.
"God's Domain, here I come."
Can't tell what kind of sound this is, hear in the ear seems to be able to penetrate the body into the soul, let a person's body can't help but will be in this cold snowy night on a few shivers.
Bleak north wind whimpering in this world, gusts of white snow dancing with the wind, the dome of the sky divided into pieces, layer by layer sprinkled all over the earth, far away from a look, if the silver, all over the desolate.
It was not late at night, just dusk, but the dullness of that sky was the same as the darkness of the night, giving people a heavy feeling that seemed to press on their hearts, unable to catch their breath. On that silver-colored earth, a huge silhouette could be seen, it was a majestic city, as if a giant beast was approaching.
The center of the city, there is a towering tower altar, into the shape of seven horns, black, straight into the cloud peaks, standing in the storm within the towering immovable, that altar blowing through the whimpering wind, it is mixed with the sound of such a khala khala, scattered into the distance, with a primitive roughness, and a unique charm.
Hoarse murmuring voice, in this wind and snow from that altar floated out, seems to be fused with that wind, vaguely somewhat indistinguishable.
"If there is hope, then where is it, and if there is no hope, why am I shown it! !" That voice was like a maniac, almost hysterical, roaring back into the nine heavens.
Below the altar, at this moment there are countless figures wearing straw raincoat, silently standing there, far away from a look, there are hundreds of thousands of them, they have men and women, around the altar, densely packed a, immobile, but there is a frenzy emerges, as if the altar on the person a sentence, they can give everything for it.
Snow, more snow.
"Since you let me see, there must be hope, but where is the hope ......!" The hoarse voice on that altar was bitter and contained sorrow for a long time.
"Today the bright yellow wrong return, the three tai open the land, the snow wind to come, ten thousand years a creation, the old man want to count the barbaric sky again!" That voice suddenly become bigger, also don't know to perform what means, but see that the sky on the wind and clouds color change, countless falling snowflakes all suddenly stop, followed by all the inverted, from all directions whistling to come cohesion together, make the heaven and earth quake!
That the sky no longer snow falling, all the snowflakes cohesion formed a huge snow-colored XuanLong, this dragon just formed immediately up to the sky miserable hissing, the sound of harsh into the ears, so that all hear the people, immediately heart and soul, seems to be torn apart by the sound like.
Array of shocking blood, from the snow dragon body secrete, soon filled its entire body, making this snow dragon such as becoming a blood dragon, it hissed miserably, struggling body violently rushed toward the sky, such as a barbaric meteor plunged into the sky, seems to want to this day blasted open a hole, open a hope.
The speed of the fast, in the twinkling of an eye is endless, roaring back and forth, like this dragon crashed into a certain invisible diaphragm, heaven and earth shook, the buzzing sound spread to the eight directions, the blood dragon once again screamed miserably, the body to the naked eye visible speed layer by layer collapsed.
In the moment it will be completely broken open, that altar below the hundreds of thousands of silent people, all hands pinch knots, bite the tip of the tongue, sprayed a mouthful of blood, the blood seems to be some kind of power traction, sprinting up, as if the sea of blood to rise up into the air, straight to the collapse of the blood dragon and go, and the fusion of the dragon collapse of the situation has eased, rushed to the higher skies.
See the blood dragon higher and higher, cohesion of all the eyes, but just at this time, the blood dragon is fierce body shock, issued a spread over tens of thousands of miles of hissing, and then can not stop the collapse of the body, turned into countless blood-colored snowflakes, drifting down, far away from the sky and earth has been dyed into a red yellow spring.
Even more so, at this moment, the instant that blood dragon collapsed, a voice completely different from the mournful roar came out from its mouth! "Gotham ......"
At the top of that altar, right in the center of the position, sitting on his knees an old man wearing a purple robe, that old man is full of wrinkles, but also full of brown spots, he mumbled in the eyes open, but its eyes are dull, obviously a blind man.
A complete spine was placed in front of him, radiating a morose-white aura, and in his right hand he held a stone tablet that rested on top of the thirteenth spine.
His empty eyes looked silently at the sky for a long, long time, and let out a long sigh.
As he spoke, his right hand, which was holding the stone slice, moved once again on the bizarre spine, rubbing against the animal bone, emitting a clicking sound, scattering towards the distance, his figure showing a depression, fusing with the sound, revealing a sad loneliness and decline.
Late at night, dark, but the reckless mountains are not calm, ferocious beasts infested, roar shook the mountains and rivers, the forest trembled, the leaves rustling down.
There was another beast roar, and Lin Feng shrank his neck, dusting off the leaves that had fallen on his body, looking at the mountains in the darkness and sighing in his heart, this place could be completely different from Earth.
Lin Feng sat under a tree and fumed, several swarthy teenagers across the street surveyed him with contemptuous gazes, and a little fat man even shouted at Lin Feng, "Leaving you a foreigner in the village isn't for you to eat dry food, hurry up and go to work!"
Lin Feng came back to his senses and didn't say anything, patting his ass and standing up to walk away.
Behind him, Little Fatty grunted, "Useless waste, his physical strength is not even as good as a small child, he should be thrown into the mountains for the ferocious beasts to eat!"
Lin Feng bristled, Brother, a traveled earthling, how can I compare my physical strength with you livestock?
This Tian Yuan World was a world dominated by cultivators.
This Wolf Village in front of him was just a small village in the Mangda Mountain, and there were naturally no cultivators, but every villager practiced martial arts and beat their strength, even the women and children were no exception.
Only then could one survive in a world where ferocious beasts were rampant and there were even ancient relic species that infested the world.
Just like now, even though it was late at night, the village's young and strong had to go into the mountains to hunt, and many prey were used to coming out at night, and although it was dangerous to go into the mountains at night, the harvest would also be bigger.
Everyone in the village is used to this kind of life, and the children who stay in the village don't sleep, so they gather together to compete and play, waiting for their own adults to return from the hunt.
Small children, still dragging clear snot, mixed with unconcerned play with dozens of hundreds of pounds of stone locks as toys, while a group of teenage boys were competing to see who could lift the giant tripod weighing thousands of pounds at the mouth of the village.
Lin Feng looked at this group of small livestock and secretly sighed, comparing his strength to theirs, he really did look like a loser.
But this wouldn't make Lin Feng feel frustrated, although he was talked about behind his back from time to time, he still managed to stay temporarily in this small mountain village called Wolf Village with his flimflam skills. What really made his balls hurt was that there was one more thing in his mind.
Super Ancestor System.
At first, Lin Feng was still straight up happy in his heart, thinking that crossing over just had benefits, but the first item of the system description made his heart half-cold.
"System main mission: the host opens a mountain and establishes a sect, establishing the first great sect in this side of the world and becoming the first ancestor."
"The main mission is divided into different stages, each stage needs to be completed within a limited time, and if it is not completed overtime, it will directly erase the host!"
Lin Feng looked at the system description, especially the last sentence, "Erase the host", half speechless, and finally squeezed out a few words through his teeth, "I bought a watch last year!"
After his anger, Lin Feng helplessly read the content of the mission, he wasn't going to risk challenging the system to see if the other side could obliterate him or not, he had just come to this world and his ass wasn't even warm yet, he didn't want to die again.
Main Quest 1.0 - Take in four personal mantle disciples.
Mission Statement: Even a casual cultivator who wants to pass on his mantle has to take on disciples. The most important resource of a sect is always the people, the disciple heirs with outstanding talent, a famous teacher produces a high disciple, a famous teacher is hard to find, a high disciple is even harder to find.
Time limit for the mission: one year. Failure to complete the mission after the time limit will directly erase the host.
"Pitiful!" Lin Feng sighed, as far as we're concerned, we're newcomers who just crossed over, as tender as a crisp cabbage, I'm the one who should hurry up and find a big bull to be a master and hug my thighs properly, right?
System big brother you at least give me a secret book, so that I can go to collect disciples, this penniless, you let me teach people what? What do you want me to teach them?
What's even more pitiful is that the system explains that there are newbie gift packs, but it informs itself that the gift pack system is malfunctioning, and the newbie gift packs are delayed, so that Lin Feng sighs that there is no such thing as the most pitiful but only the more pitiful.
The exchange system that was opened, but all kinds of good things are full of, spirit elixir magic treasure, gongfu magic, only you can not think of, there is no he did not have the goods.
The problem was that everything needed exchange points to be exchanged, and Lin Feng didn't have even one exchange point at the moment, so he could only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was cursing in his heart when a commotion suddenly rose at the entrance of the village, it looked like the hunting party had returned.
The waiting teenagers in the village all cheered and greeted towards the entrance of the village, Lin Feng glanced indifferently, but was shocked to find that the group of young and strong men who had returned from the hunt had all returned empty-handed, no prey not to mention that even their weapons had disappeared.
For these villagers, weapons are the second life, living in this big mountain, without weapons can not live at all.
The corner of Lin Feng's mouth hooked into an imperceptible smile, "There seems to be a story." Thinking of this, he also walked towards the crowd at the entrance of the village.
Before they even got close, someone could be heard roaring, "Wolf Wind is the hope of our Wolf Village, now that he's been seriously injured by the people from Stone Village, we must not let it go!"
Lin Feng raised his eyes and saw a teenager in the middle of the crowd with a shriveled expression dropping to the ground, covered in wounds, with a hateful, icy light emerging from his eyes.
"This is the genius that is being talked about by the people of Wolf Village?" Lin Feng peeked his eyes to observe, for this Wolf Wind, he had also been known for a long time, the idol of the teenagers of the entire Wolf Village, regarded as the village's hope, today Lin Feng was seeing a real person for the first time.
Although Wolf Wind had injuries at this time and was depressed, he was full of qi and blood, and although his physical strength could not be compared to that of a cultivator, he was definitely at the top among secular martial artists.
According to the public opinion of the Tian Yuan World, having this level at such a young age, if one were to cultivate and practice qi, there would also be a future for development, in the end, a cultivator is to guide the heaven and earth's spiritual qi into the body, to condense the mana, and to strengthen one's own foundation.
Lin Feng didn't move to call up his Super Ancestor System, which contained a disciple talent detector, and he pressed OK on Wolf Wind.
"The subject's qualifications are too low to become the host's personal disciple."
Lin Feng frowned, this system is also too picky, he had thought that he would first casually accept four disciples, to fool the system that one year deadline, and then in the end, the big deal is to expel these disciples who make up the number of disciples out of the door wall on the line.
But now it seems that it's not that easy to drill the system's loopholes, even a talented youngster like Wolf Wind, who was known for ten miles and eight villages, wasn't qualified, so it was too difficult for Lin Feng to collect all four disciples to complete the system's tasks.
"A year's time, a year's ...... time," Lin Feng sighed depressingly.
In the crowd, an old man beside Wolf Wind grimaced and grunted, "Wolf Wind is my grandson, of course this matter can't just be left alone, but not now. There has been a lot of movement in the mountains in recent days, it looks like a mountain treasure is about to come out, let's get the mountain treasure first, then we can settle the score with Stone Village!"
There are often armed fights between clans in the countryside, so Lin Feng has no interest in this, but the word "mountain treasure" caught his ear and made his heart flutter slightly.
Lin Feng was pondering over Shan Bao, when he suddenly heard someone in the crowd curse in a low voice, "I don't know how Stone Village raised a little monster like that, he's not even four years old yet, a little doll who managed to defeat our village's genius, Wolf Wind, that's really a hell of a thing!"
Lin Feng's eyes suddenly lit up.
A little doll less than four years old defeated this Wolf Wind in front of him?
Wolf Wind was already considered to have some talent, the person who injured him wasn't even four years old yet, so what kind of talent should he have?
The little fat man beside Lin Feng cursed in a low voice, "Damn brat, we must get him killed!"
Glancing at him, Lin Feng echoed, "Yeah, yeah."
In his heart, he was thinking that this little doll might be able to be recognized by the system. Thinking of this, Lin Feng did not move and withdrew from the crowd, he now could not wait to immediately grow wings and fly to the stone village, but he did not dare to go out of the village alone, or else it would be a direct way to add food to the ferocious beasts in the mountains.
Right at this moment, a mechanically dull beep suddenly sounded in Lin Feng's mind.
"Newbie package released, do you want to view it immediately?"
After Lin Feng froze for a moment, his heart was overjoyed, he had never felt that the boring and dull system beep was so pleasant to the ear.
Finding a place where no one was around, Lin Feng clicked on the gift bag.
Newbie Gift Pack: The host obtains a base cultivation of the fourth level of the Qi Practicing Stage realm, a chance to draw a lottery, 300 redemption points, the Taoist secret manual "Nine Heavens Thunder Positive Law", and the divine ability Nine Heavens Moving Thunder Leader.
Lin Feng froze as a warm current fell from the top of his head and went straight between his chest and abdomen, quickly rushing through a hidden acupoint in his body.
There are twelve important acupoints hidden in the human body, which cultivators call the Twelve Heavy Floors.
The cultivation of the Qi Practicing Stage was divided into twelve levels, which were meant to open the twelve floors. As each acupoint was opened, the aura would be transformed into mana, and the cultivator's mana would go up a level.
Lin Feng was now feeling a warm current that traveled all the way in a series of battles, and it didn't disappear until after the four acupoints in his body had been opened. As Lin Feng breathed in, the heaven and earth energy from the outside world was drawn into his body at a rapid pace, hovering in the four acupoints that had been opened.
Each acupoint was like a constantly running star cluster universe, and the aura was constantly being transformed into Lin Feng's own mana, just like the beginning of the universe's flood and the evolution of all living things.
Lin Feng felt his entire body become lighter, and when his mind moved, the mana in his acupoints was like a spring of explosive power.
It was only after a long time that Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body, and in his heart, he was relieved, "There's finally some self-preservation." However, when he thought that the ultimate goal of the system was to establish the number one clan in history, and he himself was going to become the number one ancestor in history, Lin Feng was instantly pressurized again, and he hurriedly examined the other things in the newbie gift bag.
"Drawing opportunities?" Lin Feng looked at it, in the Auxiliary Cultivation System, apart from the redemption system, there was a lottery system, but it was grayed out and was still in an inactive state, so for the time being, there was no need to think about it.
At this point one can only hope that the purchasing power of those 300 exchange points is higher.
While thinking about it, Lin Feng went into the exchange system, and being penniless before, he didn't even have the heart to look at the price.
Looking carefully at the price tags, Lin Feng cursed the system for being black-hearted, the lowest level bottle of Qi Nourishing Pill cost ten exchange points, and a slightly spiritual Iron Refining Sword cost thirty points.
Even trying to get a basic line of clothes, a set of feathered star crowns, cost fifty points.
The most basic aptitudes, such as "Fireball" and "Palm Thunder", were a hundred points.
As for those high-class goods with a string of zeros hanging from the back of their asses, Lin Feng didn't even dare to look at them for fear of getting dizzy.
Lin Feng looked at the pitiful 300 in his "Existing Exchange Points" column and shook his head, "The startup capital is too little."
Luckily, the Newbie Gift Pack opened up a Dao secret book and a divine ability, otherwise Lin Feng would really be blind.
Dao is the root of cultivation, mainly to enhance the realm, while Shentong is a practical martial art or spell that has many wonderful uses.
Surprisingly, the grade of the Nine Heavenly Thunder Orthodoxy in the gift pack is so high that the existing redemption system can't even redeem it, and it has to be redeemed after the system is upgraded.
As for system upgrades, however, they needed Lin Feng to complete a certain number of system tasks before they would be opened, and it was still far too early to say.
The Nine Heavenly Thunder Orthodoxy was one of the top lightning dao methods in this Tian Yuan World, but it had been lost for many years, and the seniors who had practiced it successfully in the past were all great bulls walking sideways with this dao method.
According to the instructions, the novice gift pack is randomly opened a dao, can open the nine heavenly thunder positive law, Lin Feng is considered to be the ancestral tomb of smoke, 300 exchange points, although the purchasing power is limited, but Lin Feng at this time in the heart of the depression swept away.
Such a top-level Dao, if there is no that damned mainline task, Lin Feng must first find a no one place to practice a divine skill before coming out to kill the four sides.
But now since he's going to take on disciples, that's a different story.
Dissatisfaction aside, Lin Feng quickly adjusted his mindset and acted quickly.
He didn't move, and after asking for the path to the stone village, he quietly left the wolf village without alerting others.
There was now hostility between the two villages, and Lin Feng, who had already become a cultivator, wasn't afraid of the people of Wolf Village making a scene, but he was afraid of them exposing themselves in front of the people of Stone Village.
Fortunately, the people of Wolf Village were all gathered at the entrance of the village right now, talking over the matter of Wolf Wind being injured, and Lin Feng circled out from the back of the village, so no one noticed his movements.
Walking down the road, Lin Feng didn't hesitate and directly invested fifty exchange points to get himself a suit.
How could Lin Feng from the Earth not know the truth that "the Buddha wants to be dressed in gold, people want to be dressed in clothes", want to sell things, publicity and packaging should be done first.
Look down at their own feathered star crown, white robe and wide sleeves, a faction of the immortal style of the Taoist image, Lin Feng nodded with satisfaction, the system things are expensive, but the quality of the seller is really nothing to say.
When Lin Feng arrived at the entrance to the stone village, the first thing that caught his eye was half of a huge dead tree, the trunk of which was more than a dozen meters in diameter and scorched black all over.
Lin Feng took a glance and surmised that this was a lightning struck wood that had once been struck by lightning many years ago, and the old tree's huge crown and vigorous vitality had been destroyed, and now all that was left on the ground was a section of stump that was eight or nine meters tall.
But just by looking at the size of the surviving trunk, you can imagine how huge the tree was when it was alive.
The dead tree was scorched black all over, with no sign of life at all.
At this time, an old man walked over, coughing as he said, "This tree has withered for ten years." He walked up to Lin Feng and looked him up and down with a pair of eyes, "The little old man is the village chief of this stone village, I wonder if there is anything I can do to help this Taoist master?"
Lin Feng smiled slightly, his body naturally exudes a dusty and arrogant atmosphere, and then matched with a line of clothes, white robe with wide sleeves, feathered coat and star crown, the selling appearance is completely no nitpicking, absolutely worldly highlander paradigm.
"Target found, suitable to become the host's personal disciple."
Lin Feng was just about to speak when he heard the system beep that suddenly rang out and almost choked on his saliva.
The old head of the stone village looked at Lin Feng strangely, but he shivered in fear.
Only to see Lin Feng's two eyes glowing straight green, staring at the entrance of the village like a hungry, wailing wild wolf.

The system sound in Lin Feng's mind kept going, "The talent system has finished organizing, target number one's information is as follows."
"Roots and Bones -> 10; Enlightenment -> 8; Mind -> 8; Blessed Karma -> 8."
"Summary: The target is extremely gifted, it is recommended that he be taken under his tutelage and taught carefully, he will surely be a pillar of the clan."
Lin Feng did not see anything else, his eyes stared straight at the blood-red number "10" behind the root bone.
A root bone of 10, what does that mean?
Let's say someone else is running and it takes a hundred meters from the start to the finish line, and with the same finish line, this little bitty guy is starting from ninety meters!
No wonder, no wonder he was less than four years old when he could beat up that Wolfwind with a face full of peach blossoms.
Little Dot had also discovered Lin Feng at this time, looking over with a bewildered expression, blinking his big eyes, a full-on cute Zhengtai.
Lin Feng smacked his lips, not only were this bastard's roots and bones strong to the point of being heaven-defying, his enlightenment, heart, and blessings were all at the level of super genius.
Isn't it a bit too much pressure to take such a bastard as a disciple?
Lin Feng pondered, a warm and sunny smile gradually appearing on his face.
If someone who was familiar with Lin Feng in his previous life had seen him show such a smile, they would have immediately avoided him as far away as possible.
Chapter 1
The morning sunlight, spilling in through the light silver-colored veil, landed just on the bed, stinging her eyes.
Last night's party, she drank too much in a moment of joy, and Lu Yanchen was the one who picked her up in the back.
Time sat up, the thin silk comforter slipping away, a splash of red on the white sheets showing, and on herself, her delicate white skin covered in hickeys.
This look would tell you that it was the result of a night of indulgence.
"I love you."
When the love was strong, his moving words of love seemed to still be in his ears. Time face peach blossom, eyes shy, twisted his head to look around.
Where's Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out to get breakfast?
Time lifted the covers and got out of bed, nearly falling to the floor with a weak flinch as her legs touched the ground.
When the time light came out again, Lu Yanchen also came back, slowly walking into the living room calmly, his slender and upright figure carrying a powerful and oppressive aura.
When Time raised his eyes, he fell into a pair of deep eyes, his gaze so calm that it was like an unfathomable clear pool.
After all, it was the first time such a most intimate relationship had occurred, Time was inexplicably a little shy, dropping his eyes and not daring to look at him.
In the heat of the moment, she vaguely heard him say that he was going to surprise her.
Is it to propose to her?
Time was a little overwhelmed, his heart pounding.
She had just spoken out when she was interrupted by Lu Yanchen's deep voice: "Break up!"
What did he just say, break up?
He's going to surprise her with a breakup?
Was he teasing her, joking, or was he serious about breaking up?
A hiss of pain so extreme that it was hidden in his throat that he could not send it out, and it was half a dozen moments before Time found his voice and
It was very light and light, as if it was low to the dust. "Break up, after we have sex ...... Lu Yanchen, what do you mean?"
Lu Yanchen's cold expression, without a single change, "Last night, who was the one who called me to pick her up, and who was the one who hugged me to death so that I wouldn't stop, and last night you enjoyed yourself as well."
Time was stunned as if struck by lightning!
Her jaw dropped as she looked at this man who was so different from what she remembered that she couldn't control the trembling and asked three hard words, "Why?"
After saying that, he turned to look out the window, a faint smile on his lips.
That smile looked like mockery to Time.
Time's face was as white as snow, the excruciating pain started from her heart and pressed against her nerve endings to her limbs, and vertigo-like darkness hit her, and she pinched her palm tightly with her fingertips to keep herself from fainting.
The air was suddenly flooded with a cold, biting humidity, freezing and suffocating, making it impossible to stay for a minute.
Time to go.
Chapter 1
Rain Country, Cang Yun Town, Ling Family, the moon passed the middle of the sky.
It took Ling Chen a full ten seconds before he was finally sure that he had indeed been reincarnated and reborn.
For a Celestial Realm powerhouse to need to spend ten seconds in order to be certain of something was absolutely unbelievable, but it also proved just how unbelievable what had happened to him was all the same.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts, but also in the dan Dao has unprecedented achievements, pioneered the "three fire lead" art in the alchemy industry sparked a revolution, was honored as "Dan Emperor".
However, he was not satisfied and wanted to go further, reaching the legendary Void Breaking Realm, shattering the void and transforming mortals into gods. To this end, he visited countless monuments and eventually entered the Black Blood Valley, finding a mysterious ancient tower after going through many dangers.
Without letting him down, golden words floated on the ancient pagoda, it was a supreme gong method called the Undying Heavenly Scripture, when practiced to the highest level, the body would be indestructible and imperishable, coexisting with the heaven and earth and living the same life as the sun and the moon!
But even with Ling Han's Heavenly Human Realm martial arts cultivation, he still felt that this Undying Heavenly Scripture was obscure and difficult to understand, as if he was reading a heavenly book, with no clue at all.
He forcibly memorized this gong method, and was about to study the ancient tower when it was lightly vibrating, releasing an infinite divine light that instantly shattered his physical body. But the odd thing was that his soul actually didn't dissipate, and fell into a state that seemed to be waking up and not waking up, and seemed to be dreaming and not dreaming, and it lasted for tens of thousands of years.
During these ten thousand years, his soul had been trying to figure out the Undying Heavenly Scripture - he couldn't do anything else besides that, and after ten thousand years, he had finally comprehended the first layer of this gongfu.
A Celestial Realm powerhouse spent ten thousand years to comprehend the first realm of a technique, what kind of concept was that?
Knowing that Celestial Realm powerhouses generally had a lifespan of less than a thousand years, normally, no one in the world could even cultivate this Undying Heavenly Scripture, because they would already die of old age before they even started.
However, Ling Han had mastered the first layer of the Undying Heavenly Scripture in such an odd way, and then, he had suddenly come to life, reincarnated and reborn in the body of a sixteen year old teenager who was also called Ling Han.
"Whatever's going on, anyway, I'm alive again!"
"Although this body is only at the second level of body refining cultivation, so wasted that it can't be wasted any more, but I was once a Celestial Realm powerhouse, standing at the top of the martial arts path, and a master of the dan dao, so if I have poor qualifications, I'll make up for it with pills and don't believe that I can't make it back to the top."
"Moreover, I can finally cultivate the Indestructible Heavenly Scripture, which is a supreme technique, and even ...... may not be owned by the Mortal Realm, but rather come from the legendary God Realm, or else how could it possibly take 10,000 years to understand the first technique?"
"In this life, I will be able to surpass my predecessors and achieve godhood!"
"Also, what's going on with this body, only cultivating to the second level of Body Refinement at the age of sixteen, could it be because today's martial arts are too withered?"
Boom, countless memories flooded into his mind, memories that belonged to the other Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in the process, two completely different people fused together, indistinguishable from each other.
"I see."
Ling Chen nodded in his mind, the reason why he was only at the second level of Body Refining right now was because his spirit root was too poor.
If one wanted to cultivate and become a martial artist, there was one prerequisite, and that was that one must possess a spiritual root. With a spiritual root, one could absorb the aura of the heavens and earth, quenching one's body and transforming it into one's own Yuan Power.
Some spiritual roots are fast in absorbing spiritual qi, while others are slow, therefore, spiritual roots are divided into four major grades, each major grade is further divided into three minor grades, with the top grade of the heavenly grade being the best, and the bottom grade of the yellow grade being the worst.
The key to judging the superiority of spiritual roots lies in the purity, the purer the better, and Ling Han's spiritual roots are both five elements, the most chaotic, in the martial arts world, this is the most inferior spiritual roots, counted as the yellow level of the lower grade can only be said to be reluctant, so he is now sixteen years old, but only only to cultivate to the refining of body second layer, and the same age people how to also reach the refining of body fourth layer, fifth layer.
In his previous life, Ling Han, however, was a Heavenly Spiritual Root, and it was also a Heavenly Grade Upper Grade Nine Yang Fire Spiritual Root, and coupled with an unrivaled talent for the dan Dao, supplementing his martial arts with dan, he reached the Celestial Man Realm in only two hundred years, a record that no one had ever seen before.
"Five element miscellaneous spirit root, this is the lowest grade of spirit root, no wonder the predecessor only had a cultivation at the second level of body refining despite his incomparable efforts." "As far as I'm concerned, although the Five Elements Miscellaneous Spirit Root is a bit tricky, but supplemented with pills, I'm bound to still be able to return to the peak in at most four hundred years!"
"Huh!"
Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, a shocked expression of unbelievability on his face, he froze for a while, and with his powerful soul force, he re-inspected the spirit root at his dantian, and his shocked expression suddenly turned into ecstasy.
"This isn't a Five Elements Heterogeneous Spiritual Root, the five elements are completely balanced, forming a Dao Lotus! This is the Five Elements Chaotic Lotus, the very best of the very best, rarer than the Nine Suns Fire Spiritual Root, and can be called a God-level Spiritual Root!" "The reason the predecessors were slow to cultivate is because all divine grade spirit roots require specialized techniques to bring out their true power."
"And I ...... happen to have mastered a Five Elements Heavenly Extreme Technique that matches the Five Elements Chaotic Lotus!"
"One hundred years! No, just fifty years and I'll be able to reach the Celestial Realm again!"
Even with Ling Chen's cultivation of the Celestial Realm in his previous life, he couldn't help but reveal a joyful expression, spiritual roots were destined at birth and could not be changed after birth. In his previous life, he had visited countless monuments in order to break the void and become a god, and had obtained a large number of secret techniques, and the Five Elements Heavenly Extreme Technique was one of them.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts, and in this life, he would create another brilliant and immortal myth.
"How did the predecessor die?"
Ling Chen flipped through the memories, while soon he revealed a look of anger.
The former body was the only son of Ling Dongxing, the head of the Ling family, and his mother and grandparents had passed away a long time ago. And the Ling family is a martial arts family, every member of the clan practiced martial arts, also respected by martial arts, like Ling Dongxing why can sit in the position of the family head? It was because he was the strongest and had fought his way out.
However, because of his spiritual roots, Ling Han had been regarded as a waste material since he was a child, and had been treated with disdain.
In order to wrestle a bright future for his son, Ling Dongxing reached an agreement with the Tiger Yang Academy - the Tiger Yang Academy would recruit Ling Han as a disciple and train him with all his might, while in exchange, Ling Dongxing would enter the Violet Light Earth Valley and search for an item that was lost a long time ago for the Tiger Yang Academy.
Tiger Sun Academy was built by the Rainy Kingdom's imperial dynasty, with countless resources, and if it was cultivated with all its might, even the most wasted person could be elevated to the Gathering of Yuan Realm.
But the people of Huyang Academy couldn't be idiots, if that item was easy to take, how could they be willing to offer such favorable conditions?
Violet light valley, the danger is heavy, take a wrong step may die, but for the sake of his son, Ling Dongxing set off seven days ago without hesitation.
Yesterday, the Tiger Sun Academy's people came and informed the Ling Family that they would come to pick them up today as promised. However, at this time, Ling Chongkuan, the Ling Family's Archdeacon, came running over to discuss with his predecessor, asking him to give up this precious spot to his grandson, Ling Muyun.
The reason was that Ling Muyun was a genius with an unlimited future, and such an opportunity could not be given to a wasted talent to be wasted.
The predecessor naturally wouldn't agree, this was an opportunity that his father had traded his life for! However, Ling Chongkuan said that he was discussing it, but in fact, he was just informing the predecessor, and did not take his opinion to heart at all.
His predecessor couldn't bear to make a move, but Ling Chongkuan was a Yuanyuan Realm powerhouse and could suppress him with a single finger, so how could he be an opponent?
With just one punch, the predecessor was seriously injured, and then locked up in his room, apparently not wanting him to make trouble in front of the people of the Tiger Sun Academy. And by the time Ling Dongxing came back, the wood had been turned.
And the heavily traumatized predecessor just died of raw anger.
Ling Han grunted, what a bully, his own father put his life on the line to get this spot, but to be taken away by Ling Chongkuan's grandparents like this?
The pair of shameless dogs!
Can't stand it!
He rose from the bed, and felt a sudden ache all over his body - he was alive, but his injuries were not going to get better without a fight.
"The spirit root is still traumatized!" Ling Chen frowned, that strike by Ling Chongkuan had caused damage to both his spirit roots, and with a traumatized spirit root, it was a very troublesome matter, and ordinary healing stones were ineffective.
"As far as I know, there are seven types of elixirs that can repair spirit roots, but four of them require materials that are too expensive, and even selling the entire Ling family would not be able to replace them--and besides, my spirit root is only lightly damaged, so I don't need such a high-level elixir."
"Of the remaining three, two need to be refined into pills, which is too much of a stretch with my current cultivation at the second level of Body Refining. Then there's only one option left - Yuanxin Rejuvenating Spirit Scatter, which only requires the herbs to be blended in proportion and boiled into a medicinal juice."
"First heal your injuries, then go and stop Ling Chongkuan's grandparents, although I don't care about this quota, I mustn't let the opportunity that my father exchanged his life for go cheaply to this shameless pair of grandparents!"
He sat down with his knees crossed and began to operate the "Undying Heavenly Scripture".
This was the first time he had ever run this possibly divine level technique, but since he had already been figuring it out for tens of thousands of years, he was now able to navigate it with ease.
Buzzing, a powerful vitality was born in his body, his Yuan Power was consumed in large quantities, but his injuries were recovering rapidly.
In just a few minutes' time, he had already lost all his injuries.
"Worthy of being called the Undying Heavenly Scripture, I've only just begun cultivating it and it possesses such a strange effect. It's just that this is completely different from other techniques, whereas normal techniques utilize the spirit root to transform the heaven and earth's aura into Yuan Power, the Undying Heavenly Scripture is the exact opposite, quenching the Yuan Power into the body and being able to heal injuries."
"After practicing to the highest level, immortality is not impossible." "That's why it's called the Heavenly Scripture!" "It's a pity that I'm not at a high enough level right now, otherwise I'd be able to repair all my spiritual roots with the Undying Heavenly Scripture."
Ling Chen opened his eyes, looked at the whitening sky outside the window, and muttered, "Now, it's time to go meet that shameless old bastard Ling Chongkuan and surprise him."
He put on his shoes, went to the door and opened it.
A tall figure immediately appeared at the doorway to block his way, this person was called Zhang Yuan, one of Ling Chongkuan's lackeys.
"Young Master Han, the Archdeacon has ordered that you have to stay in your room today!" Zhang Yuan hemmed and hawed, this person opposite him, although he was the son of the family head, he was a notorious wastrel, and was a joke in his eyes.
Ling Chen's gaze chilled as he said, "You dare to stop me?"
You are the one who stops, the Archdeacon said that Ling Han must not be allowed to mess up today, and if necessary, it would be fine to beat him up! Zhang Yuan said with a smile on his face, "This is the order of the Archdeacon, please don't make things difficult for Young Master Cold."
Ling Chongkuan, this old dog, was really cautious, he was still not at ease even after he was seriously injured, and he even sent someone to guard the door, and this was also able to show how important it was for Ling Chongkuan to let his grandson enter the Tiger Yang Academy - but when this hope was dashed, Ling Chongkuan's disappointment and annoyance could be imagined.
"Get lost!" Ling Chen said coldly.
Snap!
Ling Chen raised his hand and slapped it, coldly saying, "What are you, telling you to get lost or not?"
What, he was actually slapped by a scum? Zhang Yuan couldn't believe it and stroked his face, this loser actually dared to take a shot at him and even hit him, what kind of joke was this?
Snap!
Ling Chen waved his hand again and slapped him solidly again.
"Baa... Baa... Baa..."
A sound like a sheep's call echoed through the silent mountain range.
Li Qiye climbed up the hillock, the night wind was sharp and cold, but, at this time, he was so anxious that he was covered in sweat. At the age of thirteen, he climbed up the mountain range on his hands and knees, and the night looked particularly lonely and creepy.
Although the night appeared frightening, Li Qiye was anxious in his heart.
Li Qiye, who was born into a tenant farmer's family with poor parents, started herding sheep for people at the age of seven.
Today, Li Qiye herded the sheep as usual, however, when he drove the sheep back in the evening, he realized that one sheep was missing, which made him anxious, he hurriedly returned to the hillock to look for it, however, he turned over the whole hillock and couldn't find the sheep.
Thinking about the ferocity of Zhang Dahu's landlord and losing a sheep, Li Qiye was anxious and on edge.
Now that the entire hillock had been searched and there was no sign of the goat, at this point in time, Li Qiye thought of one place, only one place he hadn't searched for - the Immortal Demon Cave!
When he looked up at the night color of the valley in front of him, it was like a flooding beast with its mouth open ready to choose people to devour, the sound of wolves crying and ghosts could be heard faintly in his ears, and he looked at the misty night color of the Immortal and Demon Cave from afar, Li Qiye couldn't help but shiver.
Immortal Demon Cave, in the local out of the fierce reputation of the place, legend has it that there is a demon living inside, anyone who goes in, will be eaten, after going in, no one has ever been able to come out alive.
However, at this moment, Zhang Daido's snapping whip echoed in Li Qiye's ears, and after losing a sheep, Zhang Daido would surely whip him to the point that his skin would burst!
"Good, good, good, this seat's immortal Yin Crow has finally been refined, it only lacks a soul, today it's just the right time to borrow your soul!" It was not known for how long, the Immortal Demon Cave resounded with a deep and gloomy voice.
"Snap-snap-snap-snap-snap-" Not a moment later, a sharp sound of flapping wings rang out, and a crow general strange bird flew out of the Immortal Demon Cave.
"Fly, fly, this seat will borrow your soul to remember the burial ground, fly over the remains of the earth, as long as the Nine Realms are still there, this seat must find it!" In the Immortal Demon Cave, a deep and gloomy voice echoed.
Since then, between heaven and earth, there is a Yin crow roaming, into the burial ground, into the immortal city, across the murderous domain ...... body, flying over the nine worlds, through all kinds of tribulations, millions of years and not die!
Time passes, times change, one invincible character rises, one giant falls after another. Slowly, I don't know from what time**, a moment of mysterious crows began to appear, a mysterious crow that got rid of its confinement, began to search for the path that could dominate its own destiny.
From the Pill God, to the Flying Immortal Emperor, to the Blood Seal Immortal Emperor, to the Mingren Immortal Emperor, to the Sun Swallowing Immortal Emperor, to the Ice Feather Immortal Emperor ...... and finally to the Black Dragon King.
Generations of invincible giants had risen, and generations of gods had perished and gone far away, but, spanning millions of years, that raven, still appeared vaguely in the river of time.
The cold wind was like a knife and the snow was flying.
As soon as Lu Sheng opened his eyes, he saw that he was sitting on a yellow and gray carriage, which was swaying a bit, and there was the sound of a little girl talking in a thin voice beside him.
Outside the carriage, there was a cacophony of noisy, boisterous people. There was hawking, yelling, and cheering.
Lu Sheng sighed deeply.
He knew he couldn't go back, from an old greaseball who'd mucked around in a state-owned company, waking up in this world after one drunken stint.
It's been five days so far.
He sniffed, and the air smelled of wine, flapjacks, and fried fruit.
"Aiya, Gui Hua Fang's white cinnamon wine is getting more and more fragrant." The personal maid in the carriage, Tiny, said in a milky voice.
Coupled with a natural baby face, he grew up to be small. It looks no different from a ten-year-old child.
Little face chubby, white and red, wearing a small green cotton dress, small hands are still rubbing for Lu Sheng ready to get off to tie the hair rope.
This kind of hair rope is made of a very expensive kind of cross tree bark, will naturally emit a light fragrance, but the only bad thing, is that when it is cold, it will be hard, and need to be rubbed with hot hands to soften.
Lu Sheng smiled and didn't say anything. The carriage soon stopped.
He lifted the curtain and stepped out of the car, and the gray-white street was paved with blocks of lapis lazuli bricks, each the size of a faceplate.
The streets were filled with cars and vehicles, and people came and went with horses. Hawkers and girls and women out for a stroll had no qualms about throwing their heads in the air and giggling.
Lu Sheng tilted his head and looked at the wine shop in front of him. The white plaque was rectangular in shape, with three big words written in the center in a dragon's flight: Gui Hua Fang.
"Please come inside! The A-size room is reserved for you!" A small boy greeted him with a smile on his face.
Lu Sheng nodded his head, a rich gentleman style, from the side of the small hand received the silver edge of the white paper fan, gently shaking, the fan surface unfolded, on the top of the painting of a landscape smoke and water picture, landscape rise and fall, dark and light overlap, and at first glance is the style of the inscriptions.
He lightly followed the boy into the wine shop.
The wine shop was divided into two floors, and the hall on the first floor was seated with a lot of people listening to people singing songs.
A young girl in green stood crisply in the empty space, her voice melodious, with a middle-aged woman playing a lute on the side.
The song is a Sanhui Chuan, which is about the poignant love between a marching general and a fox girl in the mountains.
Unfortunately, the drinkers present were all rough men, and only a few of the literati gentlemen were still able to understand, the rest of them turned a blind eye to the two young girls.
Lu Sheng stopped his footsteps, seeing that the first floor was so lively, he also simply found an empty seat on the first floor and sat down.
"Who here ordered the three club passes?" He asked the boy casually.
His status in this Gui Hua Fang could be different, if this Gui Hua Fang was equivalent to a high-class entertainment club on Earth, then he was the supreme vip customer here.
Such an expense was already considered a top-tier customer in a small northern city like Jiu Lian City.
"It's Duke Zhou. Zhou Lacks Duke Zhou."
Lu Sheng didn't make things difficult for him, so he waved his hand and let him go.
After he pulled Xiaoqiao to sit down, his eyes swept around the crowd on the first floor, and soon saw a pale and thin male, dressed in white, holding a tawdry golden ruffled folding fan in his hand, gently shaking it.
"Probably looking at that singing little girl again." Lu Sheng shook his head.
"Grand Duke only warned him last time, this guy is really bad!" Xiao Qiao beamed in dissatisfaction.
Lu Sheng smiled and stopped talking. Started listening to the song quietly.
A table of wine and food was quickly served on the dark red wooden table, and Lu Sheng took a clip of lettuce fried shredded pork and put it in his mouth.
Take a sip of White Cinnamon which is almost like a drink. The light sweet floral flavor mixes in and it's almost like drinking juice.
This northern snow city, ice shrimp is the specialty of this place, in the thick ice hole casually fishing, can hit a large number of body translucent small shrimp.
Ice shrimp is half the length of regular shrimp, but has a delicious flavor.
And of course the price is extremely expensive.
Normally, it's already a luxury for people to eat once in January, where can they have it all the time like him.
While Lu Sheng ate the food, drank the wine, and listened to the little song, his heart was thinking of other things.
It had been so many days since he came to this world that resembled ancient China. But according to his observation, there were many oddities in this world.
At first he thought he was back in ancient times, but then he realized he wasn't.
The customs, the festive climate, were far different from any dynastic region he knew.
While things were on his mind, the doors in the brewery opened once again.
A line of burly men in skimpy power suits walked in one by one and found a table near the corner and sat down on their asses.
These few strong men were not locals at a glance, they were dressed more like they came from the Central Plains, their clothes and temperament were not as rough as the Northland side.
One of the burly men at the head was bald, with brass earrings and a full face, but at that moment he was sighing." "
"What's big brother worrying about, we can't get past Li's village, we can take the second road, it's fine to go around from Zhang's village side." Another han frowned.
"What do you know, when I came over to rendezvous it was from the Zhang Village side. The situation is pretty much the same as Li's village, a lot of people have died."
"What exactly is going on, big brother, tell the brothers and let us get a better understanding." A Han urged.
The bald burly man sighed again. "Specifically how, I'm not sure, I only know that several fishing villages by Suiyang Lake, have had accidents, as if they are haunted by water ghosts."
"? No?"
Lu Sheng's table was not far from them, and he could hear their undisguised chatter as well.
Originally, he was just playing along as a listener, but he didn't expect these people to actually talk about godly things.
His Lu family in this life is one of the biggest families in this Northland Ice City, the family wealth of ten thousand Guan that is still said to be less.
To put it in comparison on Earth, that would be at least a rich man with over a hundred million dollars in assets.
In the past few days when he came out to drink, he had heard a lot of rumors about demons and gods and ghosts in the wine shop, but most of them were legendary stories.
This time, like these people such a personal experience, but it was the first time. So Lu Sheng perked up his ears and listened carefully to the body.
It was good to see that the guys didn't hide it. Continuing to chat aloud about the strange happenings in the fishing village.
"That water ghost, I saw it with my own eyes, more than ten feet tall, green face and fangs, covered with a lot of water plants, boy, if it wasn't for your big brother I ran fast, now you guys don't want to see my people." The bald head is still having palpitations.
"Big brother, is there really such a thing as a water ghost?" A hanyou didn't believe it.
"I'm afraid it's not a story you made up, big brother?"
Lu Sheng heard here is also feel funny, is estimated to be another where the emergence of a reckless bragging just. During this period of time, he had seen a lot of such people.
After eating and drinking, he asked the boy to bring over the songstress's song list and casually browsed through it.
The three club passes were good, but not in tune, and he was going to switch to a more upbeat song.
Snap!
But just then, the bald man was red-faced and slammed the table.
"A piece of bone that water ghost left on the ground! I picked it up afterward on the sly!"
At once he carefully removed a jade-like green stone from his arms and slapped it on the tabletop.
"Isn't this just a piece of miscellaneous jade!" A hanyou laughed.
"Miscellaneous Jade? This is mixed jade?
"This brother. Can you show me this thing."
Suddenly a gentle voice came from the sidelines.
Lu Sheng stood at the table of several people with a smile on his face, his eyes sweeping over the green jade on the tabletop.
"This thing, you dare to take it? This is something left behind by the water ghost." That bald man said in amazement.
He's just taking it out for show now, and plans to throw it away in a little while.
After all, it's not a thing that people leave behind. If the water ghosts that were really attracted were looking for trouble, it would be a real loss.
"I'll just take a look." Lu Sheng didn't believe in water ghosts, he just looked at the jade and saw that it looked good and didn't look like ordinary miscellaneous jade.
To know the general miscellaneous jade, stores stalls can be bought everywhere, is the edge of the jade randomly polished out, the price is extremely cheap.
But somehow, as soon as he saw this piece of jade, he felt that something was wrong.
He was dressed in green and white fox fur, with a green jade officer's hat on his head, and he wore black-soled boots with cloud patterns embroidered with silver threads.
A single dress can be spent in this Gui Hua Fang for several months. It's even enough for an ordinary family to live for more than a year.
"It's not impossible if you want it, Mr. Gong, uh .... One or two silver will do!"
Lu Sheng had Tiny pull out one or two pieces of silver and put them on the table.
The bald man decisively picked up the jade and shoved it into Lu Sheng's hand. A few people exchanged glances, got up and left.
Lu Sheng didn't say anything and watched a few people leave, cupping the jade in his hand and holding it up for a closer look.
"That's how this life can be so wealthy." He shook his head, a silver tael was nothing to him, according to this body's memories, on weekdays, his expenses in January were at least a hundred taels of silver or more. Occasionally more, he might even spend a thousand taels.
The thought of it made him mentally defeated.
Holding the jade, he didn't care about the sight of the guests watching around him, but left the wine shop with his feet small and walked towards the carriage waiting outside.
But just after leaving the wine shop, not even halfway down the road, he was suddenly struck by surprise, picking up the jade and placing it in the palm of his hand.
The jade actually melted in his hand, right in the palm of his right hand.
The originally hard stone texture was transformed into a cloud of dark green slime in just a few seconds, and a scream was faintly heard from the slime.
The entire slime suddenly exploded into a cloud of green smoke that slowly drifted away from in front of Lu Sheng.
He stood in place in shock, shaking his eyes, that jade is actually still in his hand, only the green color inside has already disappeared quietly without knowing when.
He stood in a daze for a moment, constantly recalling the images from before.
Xiao Qiao kept calling out to him from the sidelines.
Lu Sheng came back to his senses and then looked at the jade in his hand, it was simply an ordinary pebble, not even a jade anymore.
"Let's go, back to the house!"
The two men got into the carriage, and the driver took the whip and gave it a few empty strokes, and the two black horses with long hair all over them walked slowly.
In the carriage, Lu Sheng didn't say a word and kept looking at the pebble in his hand. Xiao Qiao also discovered the stone's abnormality at this time.
"Fooled again ah!" She mentally muttered, and didn't say much, the Grand Duke was quite good this time, the biggest time he was cheated before was for a so-called antique wine jug, he spent thousands of taels of silver, and almost made the old master angry. This time it was only one or two silver, the young master sometimes eats a meal for more than this amount of money.
The carriage traveled all the way back to the house. As he passed the city gates, Lu Sheng heard someone yelling outside.
"..... I heard before that the water ghost was removed! A Taoist monk who traveled to the square stepped in to save the fishing village from danger!"
"Has the court come from above?"
"Early to come, I heard that even the city governor's office of the Ouyang constable also almost trapped. Luckily met a cloud traveler Taoist, it is said that when that Taoist struck, it was a flash of golden light, that water ghost when the warehouse screamed miserably, turned into green slime, and then exploded into thick smoke scattered."
"Of course not!"
Lu Sheng heard that it was the officers of the gate guard making small talk.
From time to time he would purposely pass by this side of the city gates, where the officers guarding the soldiers were well-informed and liked to go around bragging about rare things.
"That's a coincidence ...." Lu Sheng's face did not move.
His heart sank as he recalled the piece of jade from earlier.
In the fall of the 9999th year of the Divine State Calendar, in the East Sea, Qingzhou City.
Qingzhou Academy Palace, Qingzhou City, the holy land, Qingzhou City, the noble families and clans within more than half of the strong family, are from the Qingzhou Academy Palace out. As a result, the people of Qingzhou City are proud to be able to enter the school palace to practice, once they have the opportunity to set foot in the school palace, they will study hard.
However, it seems that not everyone has this realization. At this moment, in a schoolhouse in Qingzhou Academy Palace, there was a teenager who was lying on the table asleep.
Above the lecture hall, a young girl wearing a long green dress also noticed this scene, a touch of anger could not help but appear on her pretty face, and she took a step towards the sleeping teenager.
Qin Yi, seventeen years old, official disciple of Qingzhou Academy, outer disciple lecturer, beautiful face, fiery figure. In the schoolhouse, a pair of eyes moved along with Qin Yi's moving figure, even if she was angry, the steps Qin Yi took were still elegant.
"This guy, he even slept in Senior Sister Qin's lecture hall again." Seemingly noticing the sleeping figure only then, many of the surrounding teenagers were somewhat speechless, obviously, this was not the first time.
"With Senior Sister Qin's looks and figure, even looking at her is enough to please the eyes, what exactly is in that guy's head."
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi was definitely the most popular lecturer, there was no one, as for the reason, one only needed to see her to understand, I don't know how many people worshipped her as a goddess, and her lectures never failed to fill up the schoolhouse until it was full.
Qin Yi's steps were light, and she did not make a sound as she walked over to the teenager's side; she stood in front of the table and looked at the soundly sleeping face in front of her, and her beautiful features were covered with frost.
"Ye Futian." A soft voice came out, but it was not shouted from Qin Yi's mouth, but from behind Ye Futian.
Seemingly hearing someone calling out to him in his sleep, Ye Futian's body moved, propping his head up with both hands, he leisurely opened his eyes, and under his hazy gaze, what came into his eyes were undulating peaks.
"So big." Ye Futian couldn't help but whisper, his voice was very soft, as if he was talking to himself, however, in the quiet environment at this moment, this voice still seemed extraordinarily abrupt, and in just an instant, many gazes froze in the air, which then transformed into anger.
"How dare he ...... blatantly flirt with Senior Sister Qin?"
A furious gaze looked like it was transformed into a sharp sword, causing Ye Futian to shiver coldly, as if he felt something was wrong, his gaze moved upwards along that tantalizing place, and then he saw a face that was delicate like jade but filled with anger.
"Eh ......" Ye Futian had a black line on his face, how come it was Qin Yi?
When he looked back, he saw an innocent fifteen-year-old girl glaring at him.
Ye Futian swept a glance at the young girl, then cursed, being victimized, no wonder the size was wrong.
"Senior Sister Qin, I ......" Ye Futian just wanted to explain.
"Ye Futian." Qin Yi indifferently cut him off and said, "Under what background was the Qingzhou Academy Palace founded?"
Obviously, Qin Yi was trying to avoid the embarrassment she had just experienced and change the topic, but her anger at the moment was clearly felt by Ye Futian, and he even vaguely felt a strand of sword intent flowing out from Qin Yi's body, sharp and piercing the bones, stinging every inch of his skin.
"Three hundred years ago, when the Eastern Phoenix Emperor unified the Eastern Divine State, he ordered the lords of the world to create martial arts palaces to flourish the martial arts path, and the Qingzhou Academy Palace was created in this context." Ye Futian responded, of course what he was talking about was the official historical record, there was another name that existed in the wild history he had seen in the family, however, that forbidden name was never allowed to be mentioned.
"What are the professions of cultivation?" Qin Yi asked again.
"Cultivation can be divided into martial arts and arts and crafts, there are warriors, knights, swordsmen, and many other professions that cultivate martial arts, and those who cultivate arts and crafts have many professions such as mages, danmasters, and artifact refiners, and mages are divided into multiple faculties, and of course there are also gifted people who cultivate martial arts and crafts at the same time." Ye Futian responded.
"You seem to have left out one more occupation." Qin Yi looked solemn and asked very seriously.
The young man's face revealed a touch of divine radiance, "Divine State is recognized as the strongest profession, those who have been favored by the heavens, the Divine Mage, possessing the talent bestowed by the heavens, those with rare talents, such as Summoners, Beast Masters, and Astrologers, the vast majority of them come from the Divine Mage, and the Divine Mage, regardless of the cultivation of martial arts, is able to possess a stronger natural talent than others. "
All the people around were fascinated, Divine Fate Mage, a legendary profession, bearing the destiny of heaven, favored by the heavens. "Not only that, even a Heaven's Mandate Mage is naturally suited to practicing both martial arts and law."
Qin Yi's eyes showed longing, then she looked at the young man in front of her and said with some anger, "I didn't expect you to know a lot about this."
"Of course." Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said seriously, "I am a Heaven's Destiny Mage."
"Puff ......" A teenager who was drinking water not far away choked violently and coughed violently, the surrounding pairs of eyes looked at Ye Futian as if he was looking at an idiot.
How could there be such a brazen person in the world, worthy of being a legend of the Qingzhou Academy Palace, who not only openly molested Senior Sister Qin, but now falsely claimed that he was a Divine Fate Mage in order to attract Senior Sister Qin's attention?
However, what kind of person is he, the Enrollment Palace has been cultivating for three years, has been lingering in the Awakening first realm of Qi Gathering realm, his body is weak, apparently body refining has not even been completed, such a mediocre or even wasteful character, to say that he is a Heaven's Mandate Mage? Is this even more shameless?
Qin Yi's chest rose and fell once again, suddenly rippling as she looked at Ye Futian angrily, "Since you're a Heavenly Fate Mage, naturally your Fate Palace has a soul, release your Fate Palace's soul for me to see."
"My life soul is still sleeping and cannot be summoned out, I fell asleep in the lecture hall also because of my life soul." Ye Futian calmly responded.
"Ye Futian ......" Qin Yi suddenly shouted out loud, her beautiful eyes staring at the young man in front of her, said: "Three years ago, you were twelve years old when you entered the school palace, at that time, I was still an outer disciple, visiting your talent test, your perception of aura as a Heavenly product, shocked the school palace, many teachers and teachers attention, however, after three years, no inch, always stay in the awakening of the first heavy gathering qi realm, all day long nothing to do, lazy, in the lecture hall absent-minded, you actually have no cultivation?"
"In the past three years, whether it's the spring exam or the big exam in the fall, you all abstained from the exam, and directly ranked the bottom of the school palace, Ye Futian, do you have any shame or not?"
Accompanied by Qin Yi's angry roar, the entire schoolhouse became silent, a needle could be heard as the gazes of the people gazed at Qin Yi's agitated countenance, as if, this was the first time they had ever seen Senior Sister Qin in such a state.
Ye Futian seemed to be subdued as well, those dark eyes gazing at the exquisite face in front of him that was reddened from anger.
"Three years already." Ye Futian whispered in his heart, he didn't expect that three years had already passed without him realizing it, and the guy in the Fate Palace, still hadn't changed at all, and he was a little bit surprised that the iceberg sexy goddess Sister Qin, who was always cold and indifferent, turned out to have actually been paying attention to him all the time, and it had already begun from the year when he had stepped into the Academic Palace and detected a heavenly quality perception talent.
Space a dead silence, Qin Yi beautiful eyes staring at the young man in front of him, clear lines of handsome face, clean deep eyes brilliant as a star, fifteen years old, in addition to the body type is thin, can not pick other faults, and then after three or two years, will be a beautiful man.
"Is my tone a bit too heavy?" When Qin Yi saw that Ye Futian seemed to have a bit of despondency in the corner of his eyes, he couldn't help but say in his heart that his anger dissipated a bit.
"There is still a month time again to the autumn exam examination, this time if you still abstain or fail, even if Yu Sheng for you to intercede is useless, the school house will not allow you to continue to stay, do you understand or not?" Qin Yi continued, the people in the schoolhouse gaze condensed, it seems that the school palace on that guy is intolerable.
If so, I'm afraid that it will go down in the annals of the Qingzhou Academy Palace, after all, being able to be expelled from the Qingzhou Academy Palace is also extremely rare.
"He goes, I go." At the very back, an indifferent voice came out, and many people looked at the teenager sitting in the corner with complicated eyes, with envy, jealousy, as well as admiration and awe.
"There has been a decision in the academy palace, Yu Sheng doesn't need to participate in next year's spring exam, he can arbitrarily pick any one of the academy palace's war building, knight's corps, as well as any one of the art palace to cultivate in, his future can't be dragged down by you anymore." Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed, the fate of the two of them, him and Yu Sheng, would eventually go in completely different directions.
The corner of Ye Futian's mouth sketched out a faint smile, somewhat cynical.
"Shut up ......," sitting behind Yu Sheng stood up, those eyes penetrated with a bright sharp light, piercing to Qin Yi.
"Sit down." Ye Futian didn't return his head and said indifferently, Yu Sheng's gaze stagnated as he looked at the back in front of him, then quietly sat down, as if Ye Futian's words were an iron order to him.
"I've decided ............" Ye Futian had a slightly frivolous smile on his face as he looked at Qin Yi and said, "I'm officially participating in this year's Autumn Exam Grand Examination. "
In the back, a brilliant light flashed in Yu Sheng's eyes.
Three years, and he's finally, getting serious?
Qingzhou Palace of three years of cultivation, the people of the Palace are only know that he Yu Sheng talent is outstanding, gold attribute perception of heavenly products, martial arts talent is also strangely high, can be law and martial arts cultivation, although it is an outside disciple, the realm is higher than many lecturers.
However, who really knows that sleeping teenager?
"Your body is weak, you are still stuck in the realm of Awakening first level of Qi Gathering, even if you participate in the Autumn Exam Grand Exam, how can you pass?" Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed in her heart, even if she rises up now, she is afraid that it is still too late.
"What if it passes?" Ye Futian didn't seem to have any self-awareness at all, and there was a powerful confidence in his tone.
"If you can pass, you can do whatever you want in the lecture hall in the future." Qin Yi said.
Ye Futian's gaze flashed with a strange luster, looking at the silhouette and hot figure in front of him, his eyes couldn't help but look where they shouldn't, and he weakly said, "Can I do whatever I want?"
"This guy, what does that mean ......" Many people stared at Ye Futian.
"This shameless bastard, where are his eyes looking?" Seemingly noticing Ye Futian's eyes, many people had the urge to storm out, how dare he molest Senior Sister Qin?
Qin Yi naturally also noticed Ye Futian's eyes, the sympathy that had just arisen instantly disappeared, her beautiful eyes stared viciously at Ye Futian, gritting her teeth and saying, "Whatever you want to do, do it!"
Deep mountains and dense forests, ten thousand demons converge.
For the first time, the various clans put aside their grudges and appeared at the same time, and the tiger, rabbit, fox, snake ...... and all kinds of demon types arrived. At one time the whole forest is all kinds of demons or big or small or delicate or charming voice. The upper head is even sitting ten demon kings, these ten top powerhouses of the demon world, but at this time, the same heavy look appeared between the eyebrows.
"All the demon tribe, what happened here recently, I think all of you have a clear idea in your heart." Tiger tribe has always been tough, the tiger king is the first to open his mouth to make all the demons are quiet, "we belong to the same kind of demon, under this kind of crisis, I think that all the tribes should put aside their preconceptions, the same voice even branches, and work together to solve the problem at hand."
"To what end?"
"Is there any need to guess about this?" The Tiger King snorted coldly, "Other than those cultivators in the six sects and three clans, who would do such a thing. Have we had fewer demons slaughtered by him over the years?"
"But we and these Immortal Cultivation Sects have always been distinct from each other, so why are they suddenly blocking our path out of the realm." The Fox King was puzzled.
"It's not like they ate the first son of their three clans and six sects." The Snake King also guessed, "There's no need for them to tear their faces off like this, right?"
"That's right!" The Leopard King was also indignant, "It's been like this for so many years, which demon hasn't eaten a single mortal, why would the three clans and six sects suddenly lash out? I don't think it's them."
"Right, everyone knows that the demonic qi of our realm is detrimental to their cultivation, so they never go near the Boundary Forest, so how could they specialize in guarding this place."
"But ...... besides the six factions and three clans, who else has the strength to kill all the demon clans that are out of the boundary within three months." The Tiger King still insisted on his idea.
The eagle king nodded, seemed to recall something, the feathers on his body shook, "I heard that those demon clans that went out of the world, each one died without bones, and there are also skinned and cooked corpses, and there are wind-dried corpses on the old guilt trees in the forest. The hands are so cruel ...... beasts are worse than animals."
"Simply deceiving the demons too much." The Tiger King smashed the armrest of the stone chair with a slap and stood up angrily, "Fellow Demon Kings, I think that instead of guessing who did this here, we should kill them together to find out clearly. I just don't believe that if their cultivation is even higher, they can still block this army of ten thousand demons?"
As soon as he said this, the other nine Demon Kings instantly revealed expressions of approval, indeed instead of being scared, it would be better to take the initiative.
Deer King head one responded, "My son died in their hands, instead of guessing around here, why don't we go out and kill them. So what if there are three sects and six factions, when have we demons ever been afraid of them!"
"Isn't that why we are gathered here today? Who cares who he is, kill out and avenge the deaths of our kind." Even the least courageous Rabbit King stood up to respond, the Rabbit Clan was the one that had died the most.
"That's right, if I don't take this revenge, I'm a demon in vain!"
"The demonic souls of our clansmen are above us, we vow to avenge this."
Other demon kings have also stood up to respond, even around the standby various tribes of various demons, also have the appearance of the appearance of the bright claws of the bright claws, excitedly shouted up the slogan of revenge, Huma a whole army ready to go look.
"So what ......," a thin voice suddenly sounded in the group of demons, "I don't think we need to go."
In the waves of group anger, an opposing voice suddenly appeared, and although it was not loud, it managed to attract the attention of the demons. As soon as the shouting stopped, all the demons' sights stabbed over in unison.
"Who is it?" The Tiger King even let out a tiger's roar, searching for this gutless demon type.
All the demons looked around, obviously the five senses of the most sensitive demons, but after half a day of searching did not find the person who made the sound.
"Who the hell was the one who just spoke?" The Tiger King was a bit enraged, "Where did the goon demon come from? If you have the guts to stand out for this king!"
"I'm here, here!"
The demons once again looked around a few times, and still didn't see who the person who made the sound was.
"Here here ......" the voice resumed, "left left, no ...... over over over, a little to the right, wrong, look here, look here! "
The demons followed the voice and looked left and right several times, but still did not find the person who made the sound.
"Ugh! Never mind, I'm here!"
It wasn't until a sigh was heard that a figure suddenly, hand over hand, climbed up on top of the high platform where the Demon Kings were sitting. Only then did the demons see the person who spoke out.
It was a woman in a gray fluffy robe, shoulders weakly under the hitch, eyes lifeless also a pull down, the whole person has a lazy air, short and thin, the face also has a little waxy.
The word "weak" appeared in the minds of all the demons at the same time, too weak! Even the demonic aura on her body was pitifully weak, as if any demon could blow her away with a single breath of air.
It was no wonder that the demons had just searched for half a day without finding this person, such a demon was really too inconspicuous.
The bloodthirsty Tiger King could not look past it at once, the tiger's nose sprayed and said fiercely, "Hmph, you gutless brat, a few cultivators in the area scared you, and you changed into this appearance." All demons can take shape, but this is the Ten Thousand Demons Conference, so most of the demons here have shown some prototypes to differentiate between the races, only she kept her full human form, which made the Tiger King look even more unfavorable, "Not daring to show people in your original form, what kind of demon are you to?" "I am a human."
"I'm human." The woman replied.
"Human Demon?" The Tiger King froze for a moment, "What kind of demon is a human demon? Never heard of it!"
"How is it that any messy, weak demon type dares to come to the Ten Thousand Demons Conference." The Tiger King indignantly glared at the woman, "You gutless little demon, don't talk nonsense here, affecting our morale as we go forward to take revenge."
"No, I'm serious." The woman raised her hand unrepentantly, but her shoulders sagged involuntarily, looking weaker, "You guys really don't need to go out and seek revenge."
"Still talking demoralizing words!" The Tiger King was enraged and roared, "Believe it or not I'll eat you little demon."
"You didn't have to come all the way out here for nothing if you ate me, did you?"
"What do you mean?"
"I mean, that guy you guys just talked about who killed all the demons and was worse than a beast ...... " she sighed, patted the gray robe lifted her head, still that listless look, but pointed to her nose and said. "It may ...... be me!"
The room was silent for three whole seconds.
"Kill her!"
The ten thousand demons that reacted simultaneously lunged towards the woman.
Critters and stuff - what a pain in the ass!
Five minutes later.
--The first and last Ten Thousand Demons Conference, concluded!
Chapter 1 Tony · Dunn?
A loud clamor stimulated the nerves in the brain, the decibels so loud they could cause deafness. A blinding white light shot into his eyes, and the sun ** bulged and ached.
Donn couldn't help but squint his eyes, but the white light didn't fade, instead it spread throughout the world.
What the fuck is going on here? Am I at a rock concert?
Cursing in his mind, Dunn opened his eyes, and what rushed into his eyes was a big, scary face. A face covered in sweaty blackness, the hot air spewing out of the two black holes under his wide nose seemed to have gotten on his face. The gaping mouth with its white teeth seemed as frightening as a wild animal's, and of course there was the halitosis that spewed from there.
What followed was an intense, head-on collision. Donne felt as if he had been hit in the jaw by a heavy punch, and his whole body fell backwards.
The weight of two people pressed on those poor plastic bottles, they were overwhelmed and declared disintegration. White water splashed out, and even a column of water shot out from the mouth of a bottle, directly soaring into the face of the "pool fish" behind them, and the other "pool fish" as if frightened sparrows rushed up to the sky.
"Shit!"
"Bloody hell!"
"What's going on?"
"Team doctor, team doctor!"
"How did you kick it?"
Dunn lay on the ground, staring blankly at the strange faces surrounding him, some of them with anxious faces, others gloating, and still others covering their faces to see no expression. The surrounding area was still noisy, but the loud clamor of a moment ago had changed tone, it was permeated with boos and laughter.
Where is this? Who are they? What's going on here?
Wait, let's see what's happening on the sidelines?" The live commentator suddenly became exuberant, he stood up and probed down from the top bleachers, "Forest's star striker David·Johnson (davidJohnson) was knocked into the sideline coaching box during a scramble with an opposing player, and poor Coach Tony·Donn happened to be standing on the sidelines directing the game! ...... Oh! Look at the tragic situation on the ground, this is really a Mars collision rushing!
Dunn lay on the ground, his light gray suit soaked and crumpled with grass clippings and dirt that it looked as if it had just been used as a rag.
A large-nosed, black-bearded man who looked somewhat like a rank Mario appeared in his field of vision, and he nimbly pulled white gloves out of the back-colored leather bag he carried and slipped them on before beginning to examine Dunn's body.
Hell, it looks like he landed on the back of his head!
"Can you hear me?" He held out his hand in front of Dunn's eyes, his tone obviously much more anxious than earlier.
Meanwhile the TV screen began to play the scene from earlier over and over again.
David · Johansen in a fierce struggle with the opponent's No. 14 was pushed by the opponent, and then the big black man slanting his body rushed into the field standing on the sidelines of the Tony · Donn. But the strange thing is that Donn could have dodged, he had plenty of time, but at this time as if the puppet stood on the sidelines, watching his own players to crash into their own.
The scene is up. Forest players anxiously gathered around the coach's seat, the center of the crowd is naturally lying on the ground Donn, made the mistake of the black striker David & # 183; Johansen is kneeling on the ground and kept praying. If their own coach has any shortcomings, he can become the first player on the pitch to kill their own manager.
Unlike the nervousness of the Forest players, most of their opponents stood inside the stadium, watching the action with their arms wrapped around them, and there were the curious ones who took on the duty of being scouts for the whole team and kept running to see what was going on before running back to share what was going on in the crowd with their teammates.
The Forest fans in the stands didn't seem to be worried about the life or death of their manager, they took the opportunity to curse their team's poor performance, with all kinds of words starting with "F" or "s" bursting out of their mouths, and countless middle fingers raised high to make the "0:2" on the big screen particularly harsh. Numerous raised middle fingers made the "0:2" on the big screen particularly eye-catching.
Forest's team doctor, GaryF1eming, is still doing his best; he clearly saw Tony's eye move a moment ago, so how come it didn't react next?
He patted Tony · Dunn on the face and there was still no response. The team's acting head coach lay on the ground as if he were a wax statue, his mouth slightly open and his eyes round, as if he had seen something very surprising.
The blue sky, the cotton candy white clouds, the faces with different skin tones and expressions, the hustle and bustle, it was all familiar, yet so strange, as if it were a million miles away.
The referee signaled to the team doctor to see to it himself, he couldn't have the game suspended indefinitely because of an off-field injury. He whistled for the players to get back on the pitch and the game to continue, even though the Forest players were disinterested.
"But his life might even be in danger!" Fleming was furious at the home referee's indifference, and he yelled at the referee, pointing at Donn, who was still lying on the ground.
"Then call an ambulance, I'm just the referee!" The head referee shot back without a hint of weakness, "Besides, he didn't seem as dangerous as you make him out to be from the looks of it." He pointed behind Fleming, then ran back onto the pitch.
Fleming turned back around to see Dunn rubbing the back of his head as he slowly stood up, and he rushed up to help him. "How are you feeling, Tony?"
Bewildered, Dunn asked rhetorically, "Where is this?"
Fleming turned and cursed, it had been such a bad time lately. "Des, Des, come here!" He beckoned a golden man in the coaching box over.
The man called "Des" came running over. "How's Tony?"
"It's awful. He just even asked me where this is."
Des reacted in the same way as Fleming had earlier, and he too whipped his head around and cursed.
"I suspect this is the result of him falling to the ground a while ago and taking a blow to the back of his head."
"Is it bad, Gary?" Des bit his lip and looked grave.
"I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad." Fleming shook his head.
"What does that mean?"
"Good case he just has a brief memory loss that will ease up with some rest. Bad case ...... you still need me to say?"
Des waved his hand, signaling that he understood. "Send him to the hospital? But the game is still going on, and we are behind, we need him to direct the game ......" said he twisted his head to look at Tony· Dunn next to him, but he was surprised to see that Dunn was slowly moving towards the players' tunnel alone.
"Hey!" Des dropped Fleming in a hurry and ran forward to pull his colleague back.
"Tony, where are you going?" In a noisy environment, Des's shouts of teeth and claws actually had the effect of a "whisper".
Dunn looked back at Des blankly, a look that sent chills down Des's spine, the afterglow of the setting sun was now golden above their heads, but he couldn't see any of the luster running through that pair of eyes at all.
"Tony, where are you going?" Des repeated.
"I ...... I don't know, maybe ...... it's going home ......" Dunn mumbled, still trying to break away from Des's hand.
Fleming also ran over from the side, "Tony, you can't go home now. We're in a game, you're the head coach, you're calling the shots!"
The tugging of the three men at the entrance to the passageway drew the attention of both teams' benches, as well as the stands, and even the players on the field, who occasionally glanced here and there.
Donn suddenly laughed, "I'm a coach?" This is ridiculous, how can I be a coach ...... Although I am a fan and often play soccer manager games, how can I be a coach? This must be a dream, or a damn nightmare!
Fleming said next to him as if introducing the two people who met for the first time, "He is Des, desa1ker (desa1ker). Former England international, fielding as a center back, only retired from the team last season, now he is your colleague, your assistant."
Donn nodded, then said to Des, "Okay, now you call the game for me, I'm going to go rest." After saying that, he broke away from Des's hand, no longer caring about the loud booing behind him and the two dazed men, and walked into the passageway.
Fleming looked at Dunn's back, then at Des·Walker.
Walker sighed heavily and turned to walk back. "This match is unplayable!"
Donn sat in the passageway, his back against the wall, staring blankly at his surroundings. On the white wall opposite him was a huge symbol, a big red "mushroom" with three wavy curves underneath, and an English word "Forest" underneath.
Where am I? What the hell is going on?
Dunn rubbed the back of his head, where there was still a vague pain.
***, sneak up on me and hit me in the back!
"What's my name?" He mumbled, but then suddenly covered his mouth. It wasn't until this time that he realized he had been speaking in bird language - English.
"****, what's going on here?"
Donn, who had finally realized where he was, froze again, it was so unbelievable that his brain stopped responding after loads of arithmetic. And it all looked as if it had nothing to do with him anymore.
Above is the scene that took place at the City Ground this afternoon, as Forest's acting manager Tony · Dunn stood on the sidelines and was knocked down by one of his players, before appearing to fall into a brief coma. When he got back up he walked straight into the players' tunnel.
By the faint glow of the streetlight outside, Dunn stood in the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. A middle-aged geezer with a straight, high nose, deep eyes, blue eyes, and a slightly curved brown head.
And actually Donn from Sichuan, China is only twenty-six years old, and at the moment the man in the mirror is even getting headlines! Thirty-four years old! This is Tony · Donn's age.
Not only had he somehow bent over an Englishman, but he had traveled forward four years and three months!
Though he never thought he was good looking enough to attract many women.
He growled at the mirror and then smashed it with a punch. His own self in the mirror instantly turned into countless others, the pieces fell to the ground with a sparse sound, and countless faces looked at Donn as if they were mocking him.
Feeling slightly dizzy, Dunn took a step back and leaned against the smooth wall breathing heavily.
After a few minutes of silence in the darkness Donn gradually calmed down, he decided not to think about such a complicated issue for the time being. He had a habit in China of going to find a place to drink once he encountered something bad. Chengdu's bars were all over the place, so he might even be able to find a one-night stand or something along the way. In his mind, he took Nottingham as Chengdu and decided to go out and find a bar to drown his sorrows.
Glancing at the overcast sky outside, he threw on a thick windbreaker and walked out the door.
"Losing to underdogs Walsall at their own home ground o:3, Forest have really had a bad year recently. Paul ·Hart, who was expected to do well for the team, did not bring good results for the team, and he submitted his resignation to the team chairman, Nigel ·Doughty (nige1doughty), after the last round of matches, and was quickly approved."
Today's sports news was being broadcast on a television set fixed to a high shelf, focusing, naturally, on what was happening on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest game.
A hush fell over the noisy bar.
A drunken hunk of a man raised his middle finger to this television. "That Tony · Dunn I know him! The little brat who used to be assistant to Paul ·Hart in the youth team."
This drunkard had just finished his long speech when Donn happened to push the door in. The slamming of the door attracted the attention of most of the people who were drinking and chatting inside the bar, everyone turned their eyes towards the door, when they saw who the person who came in was, they were first surprised, then a teasing smile appeared on their faces.
A typical middle-aged British man stood up with his glass raised and shouted, "Here comes our Coach Tony Down!"
"Woo-hoo!" A "welcome" boo came out of the mouths of the people inside the bar.
"To his beautiful off-field defense against Johansson's breakthrough!" The middle-aged man raised the wine glass in his hand, and the people around him instantly followed suit and raised their hands. "Cheers!
Another man, obviously drunk, stood up crookedly and walked over to Dunn, beer bottle in hand reaching up to his mouth, burped and asked, "Tony· Coach Dunn, that was a beautiful defensive play, but the referee and public opinion are apparently ...... not so sure about that ...... uh!
After asking he turned his head and laughed at the others inside this bar.
So he grimly pushed away the bottle in front of him. Then he walked straight to the bar and said to the bartender, "A bottle of ......, please." He was in the habit of saying, "A bottle of Xiaoyi". -A small bottle of Erguotou, although Sichuanese, but he went to college in the north, from that time on the love of this kind of strong alcohol - but he now he can not say "Xiao Er" in English, more importantly, he quickly reacted to this is in England, not in the United States. More importantly, he quickly realized that this was England, not China. He muttered a curse under his breath, then said, "The strongest drink you can get."
The others, who had been watching him from the sidelines, heard him say that he wanted the strongest wine, and they all raised their voices loudly.
"Whew! Tony the Coward is even drinking?"
The young bartender was also a bit overwhelmed by all the exuberant customers, and he tried to get a drink but was stopped by the boozers calling, "Get him juice! Juice!"
"No no, it's still milk, we have the freshest milk!"
"Ah-ha-ha!"
The owner of this bar, startled by the noise outside, came down from the upper floor and stood at the head of the stairs to see almost all the patrons who had not already fallen asleep at their tables gathered around the bar, and in the midst of them sat a man who had wrapped his body all in a black trenchcoat, and was being jeered at to his heart's content by the drunks.
His loud voice instantly silenced the inside of the tavern. The drunkards who had been arrogant just a moment ago were instantly quiet when they saw the person standing behind them.
Donne thought it strange that what kind of person could keep this group of people honest with just a single word? He turned his head slightly sideways and saw a man coming out of the shadows of the stairway.
The young bartender hastily pointed at Donn and said to the man, "Boss, he wants a stiff drink."
The visitor was a little surprised when he saw clearly who was sitting there, but he said, "Just take it to him."
"But ...... but they aren't letting ......" The bartender looked hard at the drunks who had returned to their respective seats.
This man looked around the bar, but all the people swept by his eyes did not lower their heads, either pretending to sleep or lowering their heads to drink vigorously. Donn became more and more interested in the capable middle-aged man in front of him.
"I see no one has a problem with that, pour him a scotch, it's on me." The barman turned to Dunn and asked, "Single or double?"
The drunks watching from the sidelines burst out laughing.
The barman smiled back. "I forgot what you are ......," he poured a glass half full of golden whiskey and added half a glass of water. Then handed it to Dunn, "It's a drink from my hometown."
Donn took a sip and immediately coughed, he rarely drank foreign liquor. Not to mention that this pure scotch had a strong smell of charcoal.
A gloating laugh rang out from inside the bar.
"The Tony · Dunn I know never drank and lived like a real traditional Puritan. And he wouldn't look at me the way he is looking at me now, don't you know who I am anymore?" The man stared at Dunn, and Dunn realized that he seemed as if he would be seen through everything by this man.
He had to find a way to cover himself. "Uh ...... me," Dunn lowered his head and took another sip, this time he didn't dare to let the liquor stay inside his throat for a second longer, he just swallowed it down, and the unpleasant feeling was definitely lighter.
There was another roar of laughter.
The man rubbed the back of his head in understanding.
Someone on the sidelines helped Donn out as a voice shouted, "It looks like our Coach Tony has really been dropped on his head! The man sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, a two-time European Champions Cup winner, and the 1978 Stanley ·Matthews Award winner, Mr. kennyBurns! He is a hundred times better than your stupid ass!"
Behind the man laughed loudly, "stupid donkey, stupid donkey," screamed endlessly, but unexpectedly the object of his ridicule violently back to the hand only half a glass of wine splashed out. The golden yellow scotch in the light shines brilliantly, in the air drew a beautiful arc, and then accurately shot to the unlucky man's face - accurate and beautiful as if David & # 183; Beckham's right foot free kick. "Bang!"
His dirty words were smashed back by a thick wine glass, and Donn pounced on the other side with a swiftness that the onlooker could not have imagined together with the wine glass. He has endured this breath to the point that he can no longer endure, somehow came to this place, somehow traveled forward for four and a half years, and somehow was ridiculed and insulted ...... He wants to find someone to let off steam right now, whether he beats down someone else, or someone else beats down him.
The two men crashed into the table behind them, empty bottles falling and shattering in a crunching sound.
The laughter came to an abrupt end, and everyone froze. They didn't expect Tony · Dunn, who had acted like a coward a moment ago, to suddenly explode.
The first person to react was the bar owner, Kenny · Burns, who pushed the fat man standing next to the bar and shouted, "What are you standing there for? Pull them off!"
In addition to the misery on the floor, blood had oozed from the beaten man's forehead, and there appeared a red circle, the very mark of the cup. On top of that, his left cheek had received a punch as red as if he had been drunk.
Dunn, on the other hand, had done nothing but mess up his head and clothes. Pulled to his feet, he seemed to have finished venting his anger, and without the stance of having to pounce after him, he straightened his clothes and head before spitting at the unlucky man being held up by his companion, "I don't fucking care who you are, don't fuck with me."
He then turned to Burns, "I'm sorry for the mess I've made of your place. It's been a ****ty day ......" he was annoyed at the thought of being crossed, "I'll apologize in person some other day ...... and please don't worry about compensation. "
Then without waiting for the bar owner to make any indication, he turned around and walked towards the door. As he passed the fat man, he added a sneer, "You'd better keep your milk for yourself, fat ass."
Everyone watched as he pushed his way out the door, but no one thought to stop him, so they just watched him leave, leaving a mess behind.
The bar was silent. That's when the drunken alcoholic sat up from the table, looked at the silent room of people and the mess, and asked in confusion, "Did I miss anything?"
I don't want to be a gweilo! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Dunn yell like that?
Since his "past life" is quite bad, why not use this opportunity to have a different life? Although he has never been a soccer coach, he has watched soccer for more than ten years, and has played every generation of soccer manager games, so he more or less understands the nature of the coach's work, so isn't this a good opportunity to challenge him?
He no longer thinks about boring questions like why God picked him. He now just needs to think about how to be more like a real professional coach, and as hard as that will be, it's worth trying.
"Hey man. You're trespassing in my home without my permission, and I'm going to call the police if you don't leave!" A pale voice suddenly rang out from the side.
Dunn looked blankly across the room at the old man standing with many, many newspapers in his arms and a half-bitten burger in his hand.
"This ...... is your home?" He gestured to the bench under his ***.
"Sure."
"Ah, sorry to interrupt ......" Dunn rose from his chair, and the other man immediately sat down with a *** and lay back down. Covering himself with the newspapers in his arms, he then pressed them firmly between the backrest of the chair and his body.
Looking at the beggar who was contentedly eating a burger and lying in the "newspaper nest", Donn even had to thank God for not letting himself be "possessed" by him. Fate treats him not bad.
A cab dropped off in front of him, he walked up quickly and got in. Dunn took one last look at the beggar lying in the cold enjoying his "dinner" and told the driver to take him back to his strange home.
Starting today, a whole new world slowly unfolded before Donn's eyes. Saturday morning was windy and sunny, and Zhao Yao walked on his way to neuter ...... On the way to neuter his family cat.
In the cat bag carried in his hand was a yellow civet cat, also known as an orange cat, one of the field cats. The head, back, and limbs were covered in layers of yellow-orange markings.
Chest and stomach is a large fluffy white hairs, the tips of the limbs are white, it is said that this kind of snow-white gloves on the girls have the effect of second death, will control their brain waves, make them make "ah ~ ah ~ ah ~ ~" sound.
Although it is a male cat, it has big eyes and is very girly looking.
At this point this cat is letting out a heartbreaking howl. The vast majority of house cats were very, very homely, and would only stay at home for the rest of their lives, moving or going out was a very scary thing for them. Zhao Yao could only keep comforting the cat with his voice.
Meanwhile, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dark meteor slowly crossed outer space and gradually flew towards the sky above China, the surface of the meteor flashed with a strange luster, seemingly releasing some kind of rays towards the surrounding void continuously.
Inside the Star Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao placed the cat bag at the front desk, "Male cat neutered, booked an appointment before, surname Zhao."
"Seeing as you haven't been with us before the record, the medical record card information field needs to be filled out by you."
On the outer space, the meteor slowly crossed the sky over the land of China and began to head towards the direction of the Pacific Ocean, and wherever the meteor passed by, many of the cats suddenly had their bodies shaken, and a deep luster flashed in their eyes, just like the luster emitted from the meteor.
At that moment Matcha suddenly moved, struggled and jumped up, scurrying towards the hospital doors.
The little nurse let out a shriek, but Zhao Yao, who was on the side, violently scurried out and grabbed the fleeing Matcha.
Zhao Yao's speed was still too slow, and he failed to grab Matcha's body, only grabbing Matcha's tail.
When his tail was grabbed, Matcha let out a hiss and instinctively turned his head back is towards Zhao Yao with a bite, this was the instinct of the feline, and the speed was also strangely fast, instantly opening up a gash on the back of Zhao Yao's hand, who also immediately let go of the palm of his hand when the back of his hand was in pain.
Perhaps knowing that he had intruded, Matcha, however, did not continue to run away, but only curled up and looked at Zhao Yao with some uneasiness.
Zhao Yao hugged Matcha and gasped, "Silly cat, what are you biting at, you've rebelled, haven't you!"
The matcha cat's gaze suddenly flashed with a ghostly light, and the slightest trace of blood staining its teeth completely disappeared.
Zhao Yao also felt his head suddenly dizzy for a moment, then he wanted to see if the wound on the back of his hand was deep or not, but this look was slightly dumbfounded, only to see that the back of his hand was bare, where were any wounds or blood stains.
The little nurse on the side took over the cat and comforted, "Good boy Matcha, it's fine, it'll be fine in a while, don't be nervous."
The purring sounded in Zhao Yao's ears, but it wasn't a mere cat's cry, but turned into understandable words.
Zhao Yao shockingly pointed at the matcha in front of him and said with a surprised face, "This ...... this ...... this cat spoke!"
The little nurse looked at Zhao Yao suspiciously and said, "Mr. Zhao, are you alright?"
"Didn't you hear it?" Zhao Yao hurriedly said, "It ...... it's talking ah."
The little nurse's brows furrowed as she looked at Zhao Yao with an increasingly strange gaze.
"Do you understand me meow?"
"Take me home!"

Zhao Yao violently opened his mouth wide, looked at the small nurse who was oblivious and still comforting Matcha, and then looked at Matcha again and said, "You can understand me?"

The little nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao, who was talking to the cat, but her face became more and more strange.
Ignoring the small nurse's strange gaze, Zhao Yao quickly picked up the matcha and stuffed it back into his bag, jogging all the way out of the hospital.
Inside the rental house, the matcha cat immediately relaxed when she returned to her familiar surroundings, laying down on the coffee table and began licking and fiddling with her small white hands, her eyes narrowed in a relaxed manner. For cats, licking their fur was always a perfect behavior for relaxation.
In front of the coffee table, Zhao Yao, however, stared dead at the matcha cat in front of him and said tentatively, "Can you still talk?"
With that, he stood up with an eager face and said, "Does master want to play a game?"
"Eh, this ...... wait and play again." Zhao Yao scratched the back of his head and said somewhat at a loss for words, "When did you learn to talk?"
Looking at the innocent-faced Matcha Cat, Zhao Yao had a strange look on his face.
The matcha cat, however, did not feel the slightest bit weird about the situation in front of her as if she suddenly jumped into Zhao Yao's arms, squinted her eyes and rubbed against Zhao Yao's body, saying in a milky voice, "Play a game with me."
Looking at the matcha cat in front of him that spoke like a five-year-old, Zhao Yao stroked the other party's head, and the latter revealed a purr of enjoyment.
"Counting, you're only a year old, now it's just the equivalent of a human's five years old, right?" A smile spread across Zhao Yao's mouth, "Still a child, ah, this seems not bad."
A month later, late at night at nine o'clock.
Zhao Yao opened the door of his rental house with a tired face and casually took off his clothes before sitting down on the sofa.
He lived in this rental house although only thirty square feet, but the decoration of the home is complete, is a newlywed couple in the past house, and from the company is very close to the company, let him work overtime every day do not have to worry about the traffic problem, so although the rent is not cheap, but still let Zhao Yao out of the willingness to do so.
After Zhao Yao lay down, the matcha cat unknowingly climbed up beside him and rubbed its head against his arm in an affectionate and flattering manner.
Zhao Yao laughed and rubbed Matcha's head, which revealed an expression of enjoyment.
But just then, the cell phone on the couch was pushed over by Matcha as well.
Chapter 1
Tang Mo'er lying on the desktop, fine white slender arm pillow small head, black as satin long hair flowing down in the mid-air, revealing half of her young girl bright little face, well, hot, so hot.
What's going on?
There was a constant source of dry heat within her body burning her small face, making her feel uncomfortable, and today she had come to the Imperial Capital from Ye City, having just drank a cup of plain water handed to her by Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, her half-sister.
"It's bad, Tang Mo'er jumped down, go after her, we can't let her run away!"
Tang Mo'er had a jolt, sobering up a great deal, Han Xiaowan had actually set her up!
What to do?
Tang Mo'er looked at the man as if she had grabbed a life-saving straw, "Sir, save me, I've been drugged, and there are a few men in the back who want to rape me."
The man's deep, cold and harsh narrow eyes glanced over the girl at the men behind her, his gaze was light, but it sent shivers down the spine.
Those men are punks and have seen the world, this man who covers the headlines of the entire financial magazines and controls the economic lifelines of the entire imperial capital they had seen on TV.
Gu Mohan.
This was a man they absolutely could not afford to mess with, so they turned around and ran. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, an earth-shattering battle was being staged. Angels with flaming wings, knights draped in heavy armor, and crusader warriors holding golden long swords were battling against a group of evil hordes consisting of bone dragons covered in black smoke, hideous and terrifying Death Knights, and countless skeleton soldiers.
The battlefield between the two sides is not in a plain full of fire and smoke or a burial ground full of skeletons, but in a dark and invisible darkness, which is undoubtedly a very bizarre imagination.
But what's even weirder is that outside of this battlefield, in the void shrouded in endless darkness, several faint voices can be heard whispering?
"Operate it, hurry up and operate it! My God!"
"When you talk about others you should control your death knight for a moment! The Death Knight and the Mobile Bunker are fighting! !"
"Where are my troops? Who is attacking my troops? Where is the enemy?"
After the end of the battle, the original existence of the battlefield angels, knights and scattered and fled the skeleton soldiers these also disappeared in the background of the darkness, this place once again returned to the endless darkness shrouded in absolute silence, it seems that everything has never happened in general.
But several voices continued to exchange something, even as more other voices joined in.
"My teammates are simply a bunch of pigs! Even bolting a dog is better than them! Not only do they not help the battle in any way, they have to steal the command of the core troops..." The voice that had failed before said with some reluctance.
"Bah! It's clearly because the undead creatures are just too weak, if they were replaced by my demon army, it would definitely be different..." Another voice also retaliated without showing any weakness and gave such a strong defense for his wrong command, "I had thought that the Death Knights could have easily taken care of those bunkers."
After hearing this voice, a few soft laughs couldn't help but come from the darkness, and both sides of the argument immediately lost their tempers and helplessly said to the victorious side, "Skill is not as good as a man's, so I'm willing to pay my respects."
And the winning team actually engaged in a round of graceless taunting at this point?
"Haha! Good will triumph over evil in the end!"
"In front of our strength, whether it's undead or demons, even the gods kill you!"
Such words undoubtedly made people even more furious, and the two sides that had already calmed down suddenly started a new round of cursing, while the third person of the victorious side, who had wandered away from this new battleground, asked somewhat helplessly, "Shouldn't I have organized this round of the game?"
It turned out that the gruesome and magnificent battle before was just a game?
A voice that wasn't involved in this game responded, "To be able to simulate a realistic battle with your consciousness and make us bystanders feel as if we were there, that's truly remarkable, you sure are good at surprising us, Your Excellency Hope."
And the fellow known as Hope, faced with this sudden thanks from the other, replied in a low tone, "You flatter me, it's just a pastime."
Yes, that great battle, which was like a life-and-death duel between the camps of good and evil, was nothing more than a pastime that could only add a small bit of fun to this endless prison.
This was the realm of the Void beyond the realm of reality, and it was supposed to be a Jedi of perpetual darkness, cold, and silence, where no living being would survive, a realm more terrifying than death.
However, in such a place, a place of death that could hardly contain any living beings, a group of creatures that were difficult to characterize tenaciously survived, having lost their physical bodies, with only the last of their consciousness remaining in this void.
They called themselves Voidwalkers and were imprisoned forever in this prison called the Void.
Before they were confined here, they were all supreme powerhouses in various fields of various races, mages who ascended to the apex of the magic path, warriors who touched the limits of martial arts, alchemists who created everything, preachers who were steadfast and noble, demons who dominated the hells, sorcerers and demons who controlled the souls, and so on and so forth, and they had left their names in the history of various realms.
Many people thought that they had long been extinct, only those historical records proved that they had once existed, but did not know that this group of old monsters strong enough to be described as perverted, in fact, they were confined in the endless void outside the realm, where they had spent uncountable years, and it seems that they will be permanently imprisoned here, between the realm and the void of reality, the seemingly thin barrier, is that they can never break through the wall of sighs. The seemingly thin barrier between the realm of reality and the void was a wall of sighs that they could never break through, and even though the power they once possessed was so strong, there was nothing they could do about it.
However, they never gave up hope of getting out of the trap because there was an extremely special existence among these 33 Voidwalkers, and that was the Fifth Walker codenamed Hope.
Hope, whose original name was Bai Yi, was not from one of those large or small realms outside the Void where humans live, but from an odd place called Earth, where he had been an editor of a small news website in his lifetime, and his daily job was to cull news from other websites both at home and abroad, and then replace it with something such as a shocker!
Headlines like men will weep and women will be silent are then published on your own website, a drumming and tedious job.
Later, because of an accident life and death of white also, but the consciousness did not immediately disappear, but instead under the mischance into this mysterious void, encountered a few other void walkers, and finally just so strong to live until this moment.
The Void Walkers insisted that he from a different world would be the key to getting out of this endless prison, "You are the only one who is different, to get out of here, you are our only chance, I firmly believe in this, that's why I call you by the codename Hope." The first walker of the void, the one codenamed Wizard once said this to him.
They've always believed in it, in their ability to see the light of day someday, even though they've been imprisoned for untold hours, centuries? Thousands of years?
To last for thousands of years in this constant prison without going insane, it was clear that chatting or discussing was not enough; in fact, the primary means by which the Voidwalkers spent their time was an activity called memory sharing.
This activity is based on a consciousness trick called Memory Recall, which, when used, allows a person to recall every detail of what he or she has experienced, even every punctuation in a newspaper, with clarity.
Then with a certain degree of editing, removing memories that you don't want others to see, such as things like sleeping with a woman or sleeping with your right or left hand man, and then swapping the memories with each other, you're talking about enjoying a super long movie about someone else's life, which is a wonderful way to pass the time.
The memories of the thirty-three Voidwalkers were equal to letting him experience thirty-three lives, and even though he later forgot most of his memories in order to avoid memory confusion and only retained their knowledge and experience, his state of mind had also sifted away all these various weaknesses of childishness and lethargy during these thirty-three life experiences, becoming mature and calm, and no longer the same ordinary person he was on the Earth.
That's why he was expected by the other Voidwalkers, yet these countless years had passed, and even he couldn't find any opportunity to break away, and the only thing he had managed to do was to make this tedious time slightly less boring.
At the same time at this time, the reality realm Isthmus is about to usher in the descent of the night, in the afterglow of the setting sun sprinkled all over the entire Xianshe Academy, the students finally ended this day's heavy coursework, accompanied by young and energetic laughter, strolling in twos and threes in the academy of a tree-lined pathway.
Yaya, a second year student of the Soul Armor Department, was also one of them, she had a cute and delicate face, her long black hair was combed into two equally cute double ponytails, and she was wearing the standard uniform of the Xiansei Academy, after saying a brief goodbye to her classmates, she came to the academy's plaza by herself, and casually found a bench to sit down on, and then she rubbed the pockets of her top coat to pull out some leftover half a loaf of bread from her dinner, and carefully tore the bread into little bits of crumbs before carefully spilling them on the verdant floor. The bread was torn into a little bit of crumbs, and then finely sprinkled on the square's verdant stone floor.
A few moments later, a sound of wings poofing and flapping came from mid-air, a few white pigeons flew down to Meiya's feet, pecking at the bread crumbs she sprinkled with their heads down while letting out cooing cooing, Meiya carefully squatted down, her long double ponytails gently sweeping on the ground along with her movements, she quietly looked at this group of pigeons that had long been familiar to her with a touch of a gratified smile on her face.
The beautiful maiden, the gentle white pigeon, the square where a few statues stand quietly, together with the surrounding lush vegetation of all kinds, under the last golden afterglow of the setting sun, together they come together to form a beautiful picture.
This was something that Mya did every day, and it was also the most relaxing moment of her day, as a student with average qualifications, life in the higher institution of Xiansei Academy would always seem extraordinarily hard.
"It's getting dark soon then, that's it for today, I still have to go back to practice, goodbye, Mr. Pigeons." Keeping an easy smile on her face, Yaya bid farewell to the group of pigeons, which then stepped away from the slender legs wrapped by white stockings under the hem of her short uniform skirt, and hurried back to her dormitory with quick steps.
Evenings were also important study time, especially for an average talented student like Yaya, the effort required was not as easy as the smile that seemed to hang on her face forever.
1. Chapter 1
In the Su Family Residence, in the huge martial arts arena, the Martial Soul Awakening Ceremony was being held.
This young man on the altar, named Su Yu, was the son of the Su Family's Grand Elder, with outstanding talent.
Su Mo, the son of Su Hong, the Su Family's head, had completed the Nine Heavy Body Tempering at only fourteen years old, and was known as the Su Family's first genius.
Now that a genius like Su Yu had appeared, then with Su Mo's talent, the martial soul that was awakened would inevitably be no worse than Su Yu's.
If Su Mo, too, was able to awaken a human level fifth stage or higher martial soul, then the Su family would be able to have two top geniuses this time, and the future development of their Su family would be extraordinary.
After the presiding elder shouted out the name, the shocked disciples, elders and others in the room, their gazes all looked towards the clear-cut youngster next to them, and in their eyes, the anticipation was incomparably strong, even surpassing that of the previous Su Yu.
Su Mo's face was calm as he lifted his feet and walked on top of the altar.
Su Yu, who walked down the altar, was full of pride and smiled coldly at Su Mo, his gaze full of provocation.
Su Mo ignored the other party, took a deep breath, sat on his knees, and closed his eyes tightly.
From the bottom of that altar, a talismanic light immediately floated out, continuously drilling into Su Mo's body.
His talent was a top-notch existence in the Su Family, having completed body tempering at only fifteen years old, his talent could not be considered bad. However, he was consistently suppressed by Su Mo.
At this time, the flickering runes on the altar grew more and more, wrapping Su Mo's body.
Su Mo, who was sitting with his eyes closed, breathed slightly sharply, and from within his body, bursts of rumbling sounds gradually sounded.
Everyone stopped breathing, their gazes staring deathly above the altar!
Boom!
Finally, with an explosive sound, a pitch-black shadow steeply rose up, the pitch-black shadow was like a black hole, within which it slowly rotated, deep and bottomless, giving people a sense of morose coldness.
At the same time, a yellow aura flashed out above the shadow.
Ah!
In an instant, everyone in the room, their gazes immediately froze.
A halo?
The most lowly martial spirit?
How is that possible?
Even Su Yu was filled with stupefaction and astonishment.
Because, he could not have imagined that the Su Family's first genius had actually only awakened a human level first stage martial soul, the lowest level martial soul!
Su Mo sat on the altar, his eyes slowly opened and he was stunned when he saw his martial soul.
"A human grade first rank martial soul ......!" Su Mo murmured to himself, the corner of his mouth hooked into a bitter smile, how could he not expect that he had actually awakened a lowest ranked martial soul!
The most trashy martial soul?" "Actually awakened a waste martial soul!
"What first genius, it's simply the number one waste of my Su family."
For a while, including the Su family elders, deacons, and others, everyone's eyes changed when they looked at Su Mo, there were disappointment, disdain, and contempt.
On the altar, Su Mo slowly got up, his fists unconsciously clenched.
Coldly scanning the circle, Su Mo sneered in his heart, "These people are really snobbish!"
In the past, Su Mo's talent was outstanding, everyone was polite to him, everywhere he went he was greeted by the front and the back, and his ass was patted.
Now that he had awakened the Trash Martial Soul, these people immediately changed their faces.
Su Mo shook his head and didn't bother with them, walking off the altar and leaving in stride.
There was some tickling on his face, and what seemed to be a patch of grass around him.
"Didn't I die in a car accident? How come I'm alive again?"
He was a bit surprised, but before he could figure out how he had come back from the dead, the sight before him caused his eyes to immediately widen in excitement. It was then followed by confusion!
I can't! How can such a pretty girl just go wherever she wants?
Xu Yao's eyes widened. He just watched that pretty girl completely shed her skirt in front of his eyes, and the dirty pants inside were also taken off bit by bit, and to his eyes was a piece of tender white and tender white, and it also carried a unique body fragrance of a woman's body.
"Girl, what are you doing? You can't defecate anywhere!"
The scene froze. She let out a scream and dropped her skirt in panic, her entire body bounced up from the spot with a miso, actually stepping on a sharp sword and swept across the sky.
What the hell is this? Flying with a sword?
So, it's really a fucking fairy?
Xu Yao was instantly startled, and at the same time, a large section of unfamiliar but familiar memories suddenly surged out of his head, as if he had experienced them innately.
I fucking crossed over!
Immediately read the file in the middle of the brain that did not belong to his own memories, Xu Jiao sorted out everything.
This place was surprisingly a world of fairy cultivation, just like this little fairy in front of her who was so angry that she could fly to the sky with her sword, people were able to cultivate all kinds of techniques to become immortal.
The owner of this body is the emperor's son-in-law, but the emperor's side by the side of a team of horse harnessed by the side of a team is completely unlucky.
He himself was just a poor orphan, but he possessed a unique spiritual root that could rarely be found in a thousand years.
When he was young, he was recruited as the emperor's son-in-law by chance, and provided countless heavenly treasures for him to cultivate, and in just six years, he had condensed his belly dan and stepped into the Jindan stage.
When he stepped into the jindan stage of the day, only really with the princess into the cave, so seven days and seven nights in a row are in the wedding bed, the results of the beauty of the demonic princess such as the fox charming, actually will be all his body cultivation to fill up the empty, and even the spiritual roots of the talent was also taken away.
Genius emperor's son-in-law just newly married will be reduced to invalid, there is no longer the slightest use of value he was low-profile overnight sent out of the palace, on the way to the frontier by the emperor arranged for a slap, gas dead, and finally abandoned the body here.
"Alas, it is a pity!"
Sorting out these memories, Xu Yao's face was filled with regret as he shook his head and sighed, chagrined, "Damn it! How come I didn't take a step earlier and cross over to the pleasurable time when I was madly doing exercises in bed with the beautiful princess?"
Thinking of that gorgeous princess's soulful winks, proud body, and flavorful gasps on the wedding bed, Xu Yao felt more and more pity for coming a step too late!
"Daring lecher, how dare you spy on this girl's toilet, give me your life!"
At that moment, a chirping voice suddenly came, and it was actually that fairy who had gone and returned.
Her face was red with shame and indignation, but there was an endless killing intent in her eyes, and with that cold and sharp sword still under her feet, she killed towards Xu Jiao.
"Holy shit, fairy, this is definitely a misunderstanding! It's clearly you who squatted on your butt where I was lying, and ...... even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, could you please lift up your pants first? This look of yours makes me very unmotivated to run away ah!" Xu Yao shouted, pulling out his legs and running.
The woman's face instantly changed, blushing as she lifted up the blasphemous pants under the hem of her skirt, puked, and angrily rebuked, "The lecherous thief seeks death." The speed of the sharp sword flight under her feet steeply accelerated, whooshing towards Xu Yu to kill.
Between flying and running wildly, Xu Yao frantically thought of a way to escape.
Suddenly, there was a flash of light in his head.
Immediately, he stopped his footsteps, reached out and fished out a familiar token from his pocket, turned around and shouted at the woman, "Bold Demoness, I am the emperor's son-in-law of the current Fire Yuan Kingdom, how dare you disrespect me? Beware of me executing your nine clans!"
Right at this moment, a series of system beeps suddenly sounded in Xu Yao's head.
"Congratulations to host 'Xu Jiao' for activating the Pretend and Beat System, this system will escort you and help you pretend and help you fly!"
"Congratulations to host 'Xu Jiao' for successfully pretending to be a bully, rewarding him with 1 point of pretending value, will you enter the mall for redemption?"
"The system has detected that the host 'Xu Jiu' has low and weak abilities, making it difficult for him to survive in this world's difficulty, and has rewarded him with a newbie gift pack, do you want to check the gift pack?"
At the same time as the tone sounded, a light screen window popped up in front of him, displaying several pieces of information data.
Xu Yao first sucked in a breath, followed by an uncontrollably loud and wild laugh. What kind of pretentious face-beating system is this, the moment I hear it, it's a heaven-defying system that's tailor-made for me and helps me to grips the heavens ah! Now there's something to play with.
"Succubus, what's so funny about dying?"
Suddenly, a petulant rebuke pulled Xu Xu back from his ecstasy.
The woman did not know when she had already stood a dozen meters in front of him, holding a flying sword inside her hand and pointing at him, while her big watery eyes stared at him with vigilance and suspicion.
"Come come ...... want to fight with me is not it? Have the guts to try taking a step closer to me?"
"Ding, congratulations to host 'Xu Jiu' for successfully pretending, rewarding him with 1 point of pretense value."
As expected, the system beep in Xu Yao's ears that only he could hear sounded again, and he couldn't help but laugh out loud once more. "Right, there seems to be a gift pack."
At once, the image of the light screen window in front of him changed, and a square gift box appeared, which was opened, and several streams of light leaped out and flashed away.
"Congratulations to host 'Xu Jiao' for obtaining the Beginner's Experience Pill, which can be taken to gain 10,000 experience values."
"Congratulations to Host 'Xu Jiao' for obtaining two Beginner Level Divine Escape Talismans, which allow you to instantly move anywhere outside of a five kilometer radius after use."
"Congratulations to host 'Xu Jiao' for obtaining the beginner's level 'Swire's Five Elements Technique' (Note: the beginner's level chapter can only be cultivated up to the Foundation Establishment Stage, and can be redeemed at the mall in the following years)."
"Ding, it has been detected that host 'Xu Lack' has a crippled spiritual root that does not fulfill the conditions for cultivation, the system will make up all the spiritual roots for you."
Immediately, Xu Yao felt like a current was running through his body, his scalp instantly tingling.
But what immediately followed was a sense of relief, like the pores of his body were completely opened, greedily drawing on the four directions of spiritual energy.
Boom!
Soon, he felt his body change radically, becoming closer to nature, as if he could blend into everything and control it.
But he knows very well how familiar this feeling is, when the heavenly fire spiritual root has not yet been taken away by the princess picking up, it is the flame has such an intimate feeling, and now the system will not only repair his heavenly fire spiritual root, but also make up the other attributes of the spiritual root.
Gold, wood, water, fire and earth, all at once all five kinds of spiritual roots, and each of them is the most superior "heaven" level.
Holy shit, this is going against the grain!
Thinking of this, Xu Yao finally couldn't help but raise his arms and shout, "With the system in hand, I have the world, what kind of bullshit Fire Yuan Kingdom Princess Emperor, when I, Xu Yao, return from my upgrades, I'll trample all of you under my feet and crush them to pieces."
"Bold lecher, since you claim to be the emperor's son-in-law of the Fire Yuan Kingdom, how dare you speak out of turn and attempt to kill the emperor?" The woman next to her was a bit dumbfounded, has this emperor's son-in-law lost his mind?
"Ding, congratulations to host 'Xu Jiu' for successfully pretending to be a bully, gaining 1 point of pretense value."
It was only then that Xu Yao slowed down, the corner of his mouth slightly twitching, damn, concerned about pretending to look forward to the future, almost forgetting about this trouble at hand, he had to quickly think of a way to run away before he could do so.
"Right, experience pills!"
He suddenly remembered that there was also a Beginner's Experience Pill in the Newbie Gift Pack.
Without the slightest hesitation, he hurriedly used his mind to operate the system interface and opened a parcel, in which three items appeared.
"Use, use." Xu Yao stared at two of the items and shouted in his heart.
"Ding, congratulations to host 'Xu Jiu' for successfully cultivating the Taikoo Five Elements Technique."
"Ding, host 'Xu Jiao' has taken the Beginner's Experience Pill and gained 10,000 experience points."
"Congratulations to host 'Xu Jiu' on his upgrade, his current realm is the first level of the Qi Refining Stage."
"Congratulations to host 'Xu Jiu' on his upgrade, his current realm is the third level of the Qi Refining Stage."
"Congratulations to host 'Xu Jiu' on his upgrade, his current realm is the tenth level of the Qi Refining Stage."
In just a few short breaths, Xu Yao transformed from a handless mortal into an Immortal Cultivator, directly sprinting to the tenth level of the Qi Refining Stage, just one step away from the Foundation Establishment Stage.
Moreover, his current strength was actually countless more powerful than the normal tenth level of the Qi Refining Stage.
The reason for this was that he possessed five Heavenly Spirit Roots, which was the same as a person possessing five times the strength of an unusual person.
Even under the mutually exclusive properties of these five different auras, the power that erupted was far more than simply five times as much.
"This time there are really no words, if I am not invincible who is invincible?"
Xu Yao couldn't stop his excitement within his heart. However, at this moment, the woman on the opposite side of the room was wielding a stream of light that cut through the clouds, and her sharp sword blade scurried over like a viper in the blink of an eye.
"Holy shit, Fairy, I just told you, a little beauty, to come up and give this Emperor's son-in-law a good look, who told you to make a sword strike? You're sneak attacking!"
Xu Yao was startled when he saw the flying swords coming, and immediately opened his mouth to curse.
But scolding to scolding, the movement of the feet but not at all ambiguous, sliding back smoothly, the tip of the finger actually condensed a wisp of water elemental aura, gently flicked on the oncoming sword blade.
"Dang!"
With a chiming crunch, the rapier was flicked out of his way.
"How is this ...... possible?"
The woman was dumbfounded, the clan can so lightly crack this sword, excluding those cultivation of the profound senior uncles not to mention, at least must be the sixth layer of the Foundation Establishment Stage of those senior brothers and sisters can do ah!
"I just wonder, I have said that what happened just now was a misunderstanding, but you still keep pestering me, and you actually want to kill me? Don't think that I won't beat you up just because you look like a fairy, anyway, I didn't see it clearly just now, this time I'll see it brightly for once."
Xu Jiu cursed in annoyance as he stepped out with Yu Steps under his feet, and the earth elemental aura instantly merged into the earth, his speed violently multiplying as he appeared in front of the woman in the blink of an eye.
Immediately following, a wisp of Water Elemental Aura surged out of the palm and surrounded the four directions, and before the woman had time to react, she was confined on the spot.
"Succubus ...... Succubus, what do you want?" The woman was shocked, feeling that the Fire Elemental Aura in her body was being fully suppressed.
"Heh heh! Since you've called me a lecher? Then I can't take the blame for nothing."
With a cheap grin on his face and a raised eyebrow, Xu Yao reached out and directly raked his hand towards the woman's skirt.
Chapter 1 If there is an afterlife, I will accompany you in the world dance!
Nine heavens, between the sea of clouds, the wind and thunder table, a line of heaven!
This is the Nine Heavens Continent, the upper three days, a Jedi, Wind and Thunder Terrace! You can catch the wind and thunder, and enter and leave the sky!
But at this moment, on the Wind and Thunder Stage, it was a fishy fog!
"Chu Yang, hand over the Nine Robbers Sword! Spare your life!"
"Chu Yang, the Nine Apocalypse Sword, which is the most divine thing in the world, is purely wasted in your hands, how many years have passed and you have made no progress, it's simply a tyranny of the heavens! It's better to hand it over.
A clamor of shouts came from all directions.
The look in his eyes is still as calm and steady as a rock! -The body is still as straight as a javelin!
Just like the sword in his hand, it was filled with the implication that he would rather bend than bend! Even though he had been fatally wounded!
At his feet, within a circle of hundreds of feet around him, countless limbs and broken bodies were drenched in blood.
Looking at the surrounding area of a group of experts who were just shouting, but not rushing over, Chu Yang had a sneer on his face, arrogant and disdainful!
Such a person, with such a heart, no matter how high their cultivation level is, no matter how many people they have; even if they can kill me ten thousand times, they are not worthy of being my enemy!
How could the matter of the Ninth Robbery Sword being in one's own hands have leaked out? He had clearly examined the area for three years before and after before determining that there was a section of the Ninth Robbery Sword's body in the Wind and Thunder Terrace of this Upper Three Days, and it was only after going through all the trouble that he had finally found the opportunity to risk nine deaths to come to the Upper Three Days, but why had he encountered such a powerful ambush after arriving here?
Today, it is only the fifth day since I entered the upper three days! Today's situation is purely a dead end! I've always been known for my secretive behavior, who knows what I'm planning?
He himself had rushed a dozen times in a row, and every time, he had been held back! And these places that one chose were all part of a dead end!
I am very happy with the sword! One's own extinction of love into the sword, the sword way into the martial arts way, the martial arts way to seek the heavenly way, to life-long loneliness as the price, to kill everywhere as the world's treasure raft, but unfortunately in the end, still can not be practiced nine robberies of the sword, practiced the nine heavens of the Divine Power!
Did you make the wrong choice? Or is this path simply wrong?
Ruthless swordsman Ruthless swordsman, if the swordsman has feelings, what kind of swordsman is it? Sword Dao Wu Dao Heavenly Dao, in the end, are all ruthless ...... But now on the occasion of life and death, why is it so shaky?
Nine Robbers Sword, Nine Robbers Sword, what is your secret?
Looking at the surrounding gazes that were greedily staring at the Nine Tribulation Sword, Chu Yang let out a bitter smile in his heart. You guys only know that you can be invincible by obtaining this Nine Tribulation Sword, but do you know how much I have paid for this Nine Tribulation Sword?
There's nothing left.
Blood was flowing, Chu Yang clearly sensed that his life was rapidly passing away, he had pursued the martial arts path all his life, entering the love, breaking the love, out of the love to the ruthlessness and then extinguishing the love, at the moment of near death, he had thought that the only regret should be that he did not reach the supreme state that he had pursued for all his life in his lifetime, but what he did not expect was that, at this moment, a figure had popped into his mind that he had thought that he had long forgotten about.
Mo Qingdao, the woman Chu Yang entered into love to break his love!
"So it turns out, I haven't really broken my love ......" Chu Yang's mouth showed a hint of a self-deprecating smile and muttered.
A hint of remorse, quietly spreading in his heart, like smoke, swept through his entire mind in an instant.
Light Dance! Unknown that I may meet you on this trip to the Yellow Springs?
"Everyone together! Simply chop him up! As for the Nine Robber Sword, let's discuss it later!" A person shouted, "Otherwise, when he recovers some, it will be our turn to make a big fuss!" The crowd around them boomed a promise, and immediately raised their swords and daggers in unison, and surrounded towards Chu Yang.
"One life is not a light dance, one dance is a lifetime of suffering; this life is a dance for the king, a dance of a lifetime of suffering!"
This is a small poem made by Mo Qingdao on the night of the fixed love. Remember, at that time, Mo Light Dance had tears in her eyes, her eyes were forlorn and sultry, she ...... had known that she was practicing with her love, but she still fluttered into her arms like a moth to a flame, and let herself burn to her heart s content!
After hearing the news, I immediately rushed there, but in the end, I was one step too late. Although I will hurt Mo Qingdao's family after that all the people of the world all cut down all the nine clans of chickens and dogs not to be left behind, but the good people can't come back to life in the end!
That absolute generation red face, on the verge of death, softly lying in his arms, said to himself, "Chu Yang, if there is an afterlife ...... if I can still meet you, I hope you can take a good ...... look at me. I am better looking than the sword!"
Light Dance, you're not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, why would there be tears in the corners of your eyes?
Two drops of tears, but his heart, at that moment smashed to pieces! From then on, this heart is dusty!
Life and death follow each other to the ninth heaven!
This was a poem that the world's number one talent, Xue Tearhan, had specially made in response to Mo Qingdao's deep love for Chu Yang.
And now, Light Dance, you have gone to the nine heavens, but I am still in the human world ...... But, I will immediately be able to live and die with you ...... for the rest of my life!
Chu Yang was out of his mind, and the corners of his always cold and hard mouth hung out a gentle and poignant smile.
Light dance, wait for me!
Light Dance, do you know that if there is an afterlife, I would rather not cultivate any sword paths, I would rather not be at the top, I would rather not take revenge, and I would still want to be with you! In this world, what can compare to your satisfied smile?
No! Not bitter ...... light dance, you bitter, but do not feel bitter, now ...... I am very bitter!
Swords and knives were added more and more, blood flew out in spots, and pain focused a little bit from all over his body, finally breaking the song and dance in his head!
Chu Yang roared long and furiously! Standing up violently, his long black hair flew up fiercely!
Chu Yang's heart ached, and when he looked down, the jade pendant hanging around his neck shattered in front of his eyes with a snap. In a blink of an eye Jairus!
It's the only memento Lightning Dance left for herself!
"Kill!" Chu Yang suddenly raised his head, the killing opportunity in his eyes madly rushed, and with a wild shout, the Nine Trials Sword in his hand suddenly swung up ten thousand sword lights, just like the lightning in the nine heavens suddenly connected into a belt of girdle of light!
There was a bang, a bang, a bang, a bang, and all the weapons that surrounded him were neatly chopped off in one piece!
Everyone hurriedly retreated, looking at the neat circle of half-broken weapons under Chu Yang's feet in horror, cold sweat beading down on their undershirts. It was unthinkable that the power of a single strike from the Nine Robber Sword would be as terrifying as this!
Chu Yang looked around and suddenly asked softly, "You guys want the Nine Robber Sword?"
Without waiting for anyone to reply, he laughed coldly and slowly said, "Good! I'll show you the Nine Robber Sword!"
He suddenly leapt up violently! He had already suffered countless fatal and serious injuries, and he actually leapt up!
"The Nine Robber Sword, a little cold light with ten thousand awns!"
As the arc shot out, millions of cold auras rushed out!
The Nine Heavens Sword Technique! One sword!
Nine Heavens was the name of this continent. Historically, all sword techniques have never dared to use these three words to name, but this Nine Heavens Sword Technique is directly using the name "Nine Heavens"!
It is the only set in the ancient world!
Although Chu Yang was not able to utilize the true power of the Nine Tribulation Sword Technique, he had been comprehending these swords for a long time. The power of these few swords, although not as great as he had imagined, was still far beyond worldly sword techniques.
Dozens of experts in the surrounding area, knowing that this sword was not trivial, all of them took out their skills and tried their best to defend against this attack! Everyone's body was shaking, feeling the weapons in their hands, almost unsteady.
"Nine Robber Sword, what's the harm in slaughtering the world!"
Before the first move was finished, the second move had already descended in a murderous manner! The rushing light was like the rising tide of the ocean, and the boundless killing machine shot out in a violent manner from the sky!
Miserable screams rang out as a dozen or so experts who were strong enough to dominate a party simultaneously tried their best to resist, yet they were still splattered with blood and retreated in a sorry state!
At this moment, everyone had an illusion: the current Chu Yang was definitely not injured! Definitely in full condition!
They didn't know that they had interrupted Chu Yang's memories, interrupted Mo Qingdao's song and dance, and caused Chu Yang to completely rage, thoroughly utilizing all of his body's potential! This was the power of life, the rage of the soul!
"The Nine Robber Sword, once you gather the wind and clouds, you are the Emperor!"
Chu Yang opened his eyes with a huff and roared in a low voice, "Why? Why would there be none?"
In the distance, in three directions, three types of light rose at the same time, transforming into three golden shadows in the air! It was terrifyingly dazzling and carried an unrivaled rampancy.
He himself was only a Martial Zun, and although he was only one level away from the King level, this one level was tantamount to the difference between heaven and earth!
Three Kings! What a big deal!
"However, this Upper Three Days is not a place where you, a mere Poison Sword Martial Zun, can act wildly!" A person said peacefully, "It's just a pity that I can't have a fair fight with you, very regrettable!"
With the sound of the words, the remaining two appeared together. All three of them, with wide robes and big sleeves, had fluttering sleeves and came with the wind. Their posture was dashing and their faces were calm.
Chu Yang s eyes have blurred a bit, "You three kings ...... also want the Nine Robber Sword?"
"Rather, I want you to die!" The three of them smiled at the same time, with a dignified demeanor, "But taking over the Nine Robber's Sword by the way, it's also an unexpected gain. Great harvest!"
Chu Yang smiled coldly and proudly, straightened his back and said proudly, "It's just a pity that you guys don't understand the Nine Robber Sword! You guys will never get it!" His eyes became determined and desperate!
He was now powerless to fight!
This was the only sword that he could utilize with full power, and when he first saw the sword skill, he knew that he was able to perform this sword himself. However, such a sword needed to be catalyzed with his own life!
It is the soul of the nine-jacked sword that kills and destroys everything on its own!
The three kings, barely able to even parry, and before they even had the chance to let out a miserable scream, they flew into ashes! Even the golden shadows illuminated by their king-level power were still flickering in the air, but their lives, however, had been reduced to nothingness!
Chu Yang sighed, and while he was in mid-air, his eyes casually glanced over, but he discovered a character that he thought should never appear here. In the distance, a white-robed man looked over here dumbfounded, his face filled with unbelief.
"Tian Qi?" Chu Yang's eyes kept going, finally understanding. Why such a stealthy action of his had been ambushed, why all his attacks had been calculated to block!
So it's him, God's Plate and Ghost Calculator Mo Tianji. No wonder he was so defeated!
Chu Yang's body slowly fell from the air and slowly collapsed, just like a withered leaf drifting in late autumn, falling to the dust, with a faint but warm smile on his face, murmuring, "Light Dance, if there is an afterlife, accompany the king in the world dance!"
Since death is inevitable, embrace it with the greatest passion and the strongest longing! For there, there is one's beloved!
Chapter II
Meng Qi's dark joy was interrupted, complacency turned to annoyance, while Zhen De and other small sanyas look over with surprise and contempt, rather like an elementary school student who wants to draw a line with his bad classmates, except for Zhen Hui "Fang Aqi" who stared blankly at the golden Buddha statue in front of him, with a look of wandering out of the sky.
Subconsciously, Meng Qi half-turned his head and looked at Xuan Zang next to him, would he see anything?
For him, the shame and frustration were minor; exposing the fact that he had borrowed a body was the big problem!
Xuan Zang was still full of bitterness, his eyes containing disillusionment, and after feeling Meng Qi's gaze, he gently shook his head, "Namo Amitabha Buddha, everything is subject to Senior Brother Xuan Bitter's decision." He did not hint at it, and said it directly.
Uh, he thought that I was looking at him to plead with him ...... Meng Qi quietly sighed with relief inside, understanding that he passed this hurdle, unless the parents who abandoned this body, the horse face uncle, and so on, find it, otherwise it should not be seen through, and if it is another ten years or eight years, then no one will be even more skeptical, and memories from childhood are inherently easy to forget.
Compared to that, breaking into the handyman's yard is a small thing!
Crookedly, Meng Qi tried to make his expression as dull as Zhen Hui's, lest Xuan Zang see through that he wasn't actually that frustrated and sad.
After the wide-faced, big-eared Xuan Bitter questioned the remaining children one by one, together with Meng Qi and Zhen Hui, there were a total of six people who were admitted to the House of Miscellaneous Services, while the rest belonged to the House of Martial Monks.
The precept in his right hand gently tapped on his left palm, "Follow me to the Sundry House to be shaved, receive monk's robes and Buddhist scriptures and other things, and in the future, if you work hard, you may not have no chance to enter the Bodhi and Dharma Houses to practice profound Buddhist scriptures and martial arts."
There's a Dharma here too?
Meng Qi froze for a moment, but Xuan Bitter didn't give him time to think, and walked straight through the children toward the outside of the hall.
Surrounded by strangers, Meng Qi didn't dare to ask too many questions and followed closely behind the two yellow-robed monks, Xuan Bitter and Xuan Zang, and turned into a nearby compound.
"You are not considered to be formally initiated, you only need to worship the Buddha and shave your head to keep your name." Xuan Bitter pointed to the futon inside the small Buddha hall and said.
"Yes, Master Xuan Bitter." The children all responded along with Zhen De, then one by one, they knelt on the futon and bowed to the golden Buddha statue above them.
When all the children had paid their respects to the Buddha, Xuan Bru saluted the statue with his hands clasped together in a dignified manner, chanting "Namo Amitabha Buddha", and then he walked up to one of the children and stroked his right hand gently on the top of his head.
The child's long black hair immediately changed, with the speed visible to the naked eye of Meng Qi root root turned yellow, falling leaves like drifting to the ground, less than two breaths of time, the child became a real little Shamans.
"Troubles fall away, red dust is far away." Xuan Bitter solemnly said, his mellow voice echoing within the purified Buddha Hall.
"What kind of martial arts is this? It's amazing!"
Meng Qi was stunned and excited, would he have the opportunity to learn such martial arts in the future?
Xuan Bitter walked up to the children one by one and removed their hair, always saying the same thing under his breath.
When it was Meng Qi's turn, he lowered his head and silently recited the name of the Buddha and the Taoist ancestor, mourning the hair that was about to bid farewell to him.
The thick and broad palm lightly caressed the top of Meng Qi's head, a dry hair floated down in front of his eyes, which made him so sad that it was almost difficult for him to restrain himself, he was in love with the red dust, and had never thought of becoming a monk.
"Troubles fall away, red dust stays away."
Xuan Bitter's voice was like a chime bell that suddenly struck, shaking Meng Qi's body and clarifying his mind.
But after Xuan Bitter left and Clarity disappeared, Meng Qi's conviction remained firm that he must return to secularism in the future!
After worshipping the Buddha, shaving his head, and leaving his name on the monk's disk, Xuan Bitter had a couple of gray-robed monks take the boys to the backyard to receive their respective things-two sets of gray monk's robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, the Shaolin Precepts, and the Twelve Little Mantras of the Morning Lesson, among other things.
"After you have learned the characters in the 'Lecture School', you can recite the precepts of this temple and the small incantations of the morning class, before that, I will first roughly talk about the main precepts of this temple, one, you must not deceive your master, two, you must not allow, you cannot steal the martial arts, three, you must not kill, four, you must not drink alcohol, five, forbid meat and spices, six , shall not break the precepts of color ...... " Xuan bitter will need to comply with the main precepts repeated a few times, and at the end of the serious: "The person who violates the light is scolded, the heavy abolition of martial arts, expelled from this temple."
He mentioned only two of these punishments, the lightest and the heaviest, and the rest were punishments of hard labor, copying scriptures, caning, and facing the wall.
After explaining these things, he and Xuanzang took the group of young sanyasins and left the "sundry yard".
"In this temple, those wearing gray monk's robes are the general monks, those wearing yellow monk's robes are the deacon monks of each house, and those wearing yellow monk's robes and red robes are the abbot, the head of each house, and the elders. ......" Along the way, Xuan Bitter didn't let go of the "general knowledge of the temple" that he had been instilling in the young monks until Zhen De and the others entered the "Martial Monks' House", and only then did he become silent again. "Temple common sense", until Zhen De and others into the "martial arts monks courtyard", he only became silent again.
A line of people walking more and more remote, yellow wall inside and outside, all green trees, rarely see the Buddha temple, after a while, Meng Qi only saw a mottled and old courtyard.
"Aiya, Senior Brother Xuan Bitter, Senior Brother Xuan Zang, you guys came so early?" A big fat monk at the doorway greeted him with a smile, also dressed in yellow, but with his collar slanted open and his stomach shy.
Xuan Bitter frowned and meticulously folded his arms, "Namo Amitabha Buddha, Senior Brother Xuan Xin, how can you be so lethargic?"
The big fat monk Xuan Xin had long been familiar with Xuan Bitter's temper and said without any anger at all, "Aiya, you're too obsessed with external appearances, this is for the disciples of our Miscellaneous Service Academy?" He was unwilling to tangle with Xuan Bitter on this issue and directly pointed at Meng Qi and the others.
"Please also ask Senior Brother Xuan Xin to make arrangements." Xuan Bitter replied in a serious manner.
At this time, Xuanzang, who had been working as a sawbite gourd, suddenly spoke, "Zhen Ying, is Zhen Guan still in the House of Miscellaneous Services?"
"Still there, still there!" The fat monk Xuanxin said suspiciously, "Senior Brother Xuanzang, what are you asking them for? Could it be that you intend to take them as disciples?"
Xuanzang shook his head and sighed, "My martial arts path has been destroyed, so it is inconvenient for me to mislead others, so how would I dare to accept disciples? Master Xuanxin, please let them be in the same room as Zhen Ying and Zhen Guan."
He was referring to none other than Meng Qi and Zhen Hui.
Meng Qi's heart beat violently, this was the first time Xuan Zang had stepped in to arrange things for himself, could it be that the two monks, Zhen Ying and Zhen Guan, had something special that could help them?
"Haha, what you commanded, Senior Brother Xuanzang, how would I dare to bear a word of 'labor'? Such a small matter, why is there a need for this?" Xuanxin agreed in a single breath.
Xuan Bitter glanced sideways at Xuan Zang and didn't say anything more, but instead said to Meng Qi, Zhen Hui, and the other young sanyasins with a straight face, "I'm placing you all in the House of Miscellaneous Services because you each have your own problems, and if you can get yourselves solved and polish your minds, you may not necessarily not have the opportunity to enter the Martial Monks' House, the Dharma House, or even the Bodhi House in the future."
"But if you continue to be sneaky, lazy, playful, and fickle-minded, and are unable to suffer, I will not hide it, and will certainly inform the Precepts Court and punish you accordingly."
He unabashedly stated his thoughts to show that he was open and honest without a hint of selfishness, causing Xuan Xin beside him to slightly blush with his old face.
"Yes, Senior Uncle Xuan Bitter." Meng Qi and the other little shamans replied in unison.
After seeing Xuan Bitter and Xuan Zang leave, Xuan Xin twisted his body, causing a piece of fat meat to shake up and down, "Finally gone, I'm most afraid of seeing this iron faced ghost."
This monk ...... Meng Qi pretended not to look at the eye, and followed the Xuanxin who walked and swayed east and west into the Zen room.
"Zhen Ying, Zhen Guan, this is your senior brothers Zhen Ding and Zhen Hui." After Xuanxin pointed at both Meng Qi and Zhen Hui, he turned around and led the other junior sanyasins to other meditation rooms.
Inside the meditation room, there was a bunk, enough for seven or eight people to sleep, and nothing else.
On top of the bunk, two gray-clothed monks a lying a sitting, are twenty years of age, lying people with a dull expression, speechless, sitting people with two eyebrows deep locks, tone of voice cold: "parcels of luggage, etc. put on the bottom of the bunk on the line, want to drink water, since go to the courtyard water tank to take." "I don't know how to call the senior brother?"
Meng Qi glanced at the mute Zhen Hui, and decided that it was better for him to speak up and establish a good "roommate relationship".
The seated man said coldly, "True view."
After answering, he stopped speaking and even turned his head to not look at Meng Qi and Zhen Hui, leaving Meng Qi with no way to play out his bellyful of topics that would bring him closer.
As for Zhen Ying, he even closed his eyes and continued to fall asleep.
What a bunch of people!
Meng Qi secretly slandered in his belly, but on the surface, he smiled and said to Zhen Hui, "Senior Brother Zhen Hui, I'm Zhen Ding, in the future, you can just call me Senior Brother."
"Yes, senior brother." True Hui called out without any difficulty at all.
It's still good to have this dorky little guy!
Meng Qi secretly sighed and decided to play the role of a senior brother and help Zhen Hui properly, "Junior Brother, eh, I'll just call you Junior Brother, come on, let's change into the monk's clothes first."
Although there were people in the room, but when the university often in the dormitory bare shoulders cool Meng Qi did not feel uncomfortable, quickly removed the clothes, changed into the monk's clothes.
He was quietly thankful for the simplicity of the monk's garments to wear and that he wasn't going to make a fool of himself as he examined the things on his person that he hadn't had time to scrutinize before.
The robes of this body were finely woven, with a soft and light texture, and even if Meng Qi didn't know how to read, he could tell that they were worth a lot of money. At the same time, there was a piece of translucent jade pendant hanging on his waist, and on his neck he wore a small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red rope, which was close to his chest, and it was so cool and so comfortable.
Meng Qi carefully played with the thumb-sized Jade Buddha, only to see "it" full of compassion, lifelike, obviously extraordinary carving, at the same time, "it" feel delicate, both warm and give people a sense of coolness.
"According to what the horse-faced uncle said, this Jade Buddha was given by some nameless old monk? But since what Marquis didn't take it away, it's probably not an extraordinary item, so it's better to wear it close to your body."
Meng Qi re-suspended the Jade Buddha Pendant on his chest and hid it close to his body, then packed up the jade pendant, clothes, and so on, and placed them under his chosen bunk.
At this time, Zhen Ying, who had been in a deep sleep, violently rolled over and sat up, nimbly put on his shoes and went out the door, looking at Meng Qi in a daze, not understanding what had happened.
"It's time for the evening meal." Zenkan said coldly, also getting out of the pass and heading for the door.
What are these two!
Meng Qi cursed once again, then turned his head to Zhen Hui and said, "Junior Brother, are you done yet? It's dinner time!"
"There!" As soon as Shin Hye's words left his mouth, the tiny figure scurried to the door like a rabbit, as if he was already hungry.
"...... "Meng Qi was embarrassed, was he the only one here who was more normal?
Zhen Hui suddenly stopped at the doorway and looked back at Meng Qi with a puzzled expression on her face, "Senior Brother, aren't you going?"
You've got a conscience, you know how to wait for me!
Meng Qi thought darkly, then replied half-jokingly, "I'm not as hungry as you guys yet."
Look at one or two of you, you look like starving ghosts! \Q>
He turned on a dime and took off running.
Feed! After opening and closing his mouth a few times he shouted, "Eh, Junior, wait for me!"
Suddenly, a wave of sadness struck his heart, other people's are little sisters, why do I only have little brothers, and there will be no sisters in the foreseeable future.
Under the pouring rain, a beautiful-looking woman aged twenty-seven or eighty-eight, with a little boy aged five or six, knelt in front of the iron gate of a luxurious villa.
Woman named Zhao Meiling, from a remote mountain village, six years ago was with a dream and hope to get into the university, but did not expect to meet a man who changed everything for her, this man is the North Township City, the famous spendthrift ...... Li Zhe!
At that time! Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe were in the same school, an accident, she was seen by Li Zhe, and then Li Zhe launched a crazy pursuit of Zhao Meiling, almost a hundred tricks, by any means necessary.
And Zhao Meiling is just a just come to the city of a simple and plain girl, that will be the opponent of such a master of love, not only the body, but also the heart are completely handed over to him, but then Li Zhe play tired of her, then ruthlessly abandoned her.
At a later date, Zhao Meiling realizes that she is pregnant, and she wants to give birth to the baby, and for that reason, she has a falling out with her family.
After the child was born, Zhao Meiling wanted to be the one to raise him to adulthood, but after five years, because the body is too tired, replaced by a terminal disease, there are no years to live, she finally decided to send the child wanted to send to the Li family, want to let the child feel the love of the father, have a better life, then she can also rest assured after death.
But this was coldly rejected by the Li family, completely not recognizing that the child is their Li family, Zhao Meiling can only be with the child kneeling in front of the iron gate, bitterly begging.
At this time, the iron door slowly opened, a few people holding umbrellas walked out, the leader of the man and the little boy has a few resemblance, he is the little boy's father Li Zhe.
"Here! Stinking woman, this sum of money is enough for you to live well", Li Zhe frowned and reached out to hand Zhao Meiling a check.
Zhao Meiling shook her head and looked up at Li Zhe, saying, "Zhe! You must keep Fu'er, he's your son!"
Li Zhe balked, then said coldly, "Do you want this money or not?"
Upon hearing this, Zhao Meiling had already burst into tears and shook her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe let out a cold snort and threw the check in his hand at Zhao Meiling, then was about to turn around and leave.
Zhao Meiling, who was kneeling on the ground, hugged Li Zhe's thighs at once and bitterly begged, "Zhe!"
"Pop!"
Before Zhao Meiling could finish, Li Zhe heavily slapped her face, "Let go! You stinking woman."
The little boy next to him, seeing his mother being beaten, hurriedly ran over and hugged Li Zhe's thighs, calling out with a childish voice, "Dad! Don't hit mommy."
In fact, the little boy from birth, and do not know who his father is, and the mother also heavy did not say, until this time Zhao Meiling took out Li Zhe's photo to show the little boy, the little boy only know that he has a father, then happy to jump up.
But now, he doesn't understand why his dad doesn't want his mom and beats her.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy who was hugging his thighs with a look of disgust and kicked the little boy out, "Who's your father, dead ~wild~ seed!"
The little boy was kicked out and fell to the ground, curled up with a face of pain covering his stomach, the pain was far beyond what a five year old boy could bear, and couldn't help but a big rolling teardrop flowed out of his eyes.
Zhao Meiling was also startled, and hurriedly let go of Li Zhe, running over to pick up the little boy and asking with nervous concern, "Fu'er are you alright?"
The little boy looked at his mother's worried face, pursed his lips, held back his tears, and shook his little head.
Li Zhe didn't even look at the mother and son and walked inside the iron gate, next to a man with some white hair like a butler, picked up the check and handed it to Zhao Meiling, sympathetically urging, "You'd better take this!"
Zhao Meiling shook her head and hugged the little boy, slowly disappearing into the rain.
The butler looked at the back of the mother and son, sighed deeply, turned around and walked into the house, slowly closing the iron door behind him.
Four years later! Zhao Meiling dying before, has been nine years old, grew up a lot of the little boy called to the bedside, gently rubbed his head, smiled with a weak said, "Fu child you can study well in the future, in the future so that a good job, as well as do not resent the Li family, and do not resent your father, promise me okay?"
The little boy fought back tears and nodded seriously.
Watching the little boy earnestly nod his head in agreement, Zhao Meiling had a peaceful smile on her face and slowly closed her eyes forever.
At two o'clock in the late night, a bright moon hung high in the sky, and the bright moonlight shone on the earth, making the surrounding not dark.
"Boom!"
A deafening sound suddenly came from the sky, Zhao Fu was startled and looked up to the sky, only to see that the entire sky seemed to be on fire, transforming into a huge sea of flames, and countless things emitting colorful light and dragging long tails, like meteors, were falling down from the sky.
"Bang!"
With a loud bang, a meteor emitting seven-colored light landed in front of Zhao Fu, and the blinding light caused Zhao Fu to block it with his hand, and then the strong light dispersed, and a one-finger-long, two-finger-thick crystal stone floated silently in the air two meters above the ground.
Zhao Fu curiously walked up and held the crystal, floating in mid-air the crystal was unresponsive to Zhao Fu's grip.
At this time, the original sleeping people were also awakened by a series of loud bangs, opened the door or opened the window, looked at the countless crystals floating in mid-air, and began to madly rush out of the house to grab the crystals in the middle, Zhao Fu did not stay in the same place, and rushed back to his own home.
Inside a single room rental, Zhao Fu carefully measured the crystal stone, if based on the selling price alone, this crystal stone did not have a kind of gemstone that could be comparable, if the number was scarce, then the value of the city was not even in the question, but the key to the number of too many falling from the sky, to say the least, it was also a few tens of billions of looks, so this crystal stone could be worth nothing at all.
"Detecting host as Primary Intelligence, beginning soul binding ......".
Ding! Soul binding successful, start traveling to the apocalypse world.
After this sound, Zhao Fu's eyes went black and he fainted on the ground. "Hong Dali, male, 22 years old, orphan, died due to his courage in saving two children who were about to be hit by a car. It has been decided by the relevant authorities to posthumously honor Hong Dali as a hero and a provincial outstanding college student."
"No go no go no go, I'm not going to go with you to the Hong family to get engaged!" Tang Muxin buried her head inside the pillow, desperately kicking her white tender calves, "Hong Dali is the city's famous waste ah, the face of their Hong family are disgraced, and the person looks sickly, the brain does not work not to say that it is also a standard loser, I do not want to find such a person as my fiancé!"
Tang Moxin, Tang's Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. chairman of the Tang Ruisi's only daughter, multi-talented, erudite and not to mention, look is also a flowery face, fair lady, set the spirit of heaven and earth and all in one, especially a handful of good food, the standard hall down to the kitchen on the bed, in the school I do not know how many boys' dream lover.
But today, he heard his father say that he would take him to the famous Hong Dali's family to betrothal, how can she stand it: "If it were not for his parents favoring her, a single seedling of a thousand hectares of land, on his kind of waste, has long been driven out of the Hong family to fend for himself, which still has the opportunity to so all day long everywhere to lose their homes?"
Hearing his daughter's words, a bitter smile appeared on the face of Tang Ruishi, who was sitting at the head of the bed, and said helplessly, "Xinxin, I can't help it."
The marriage between you and Hong Da Li was set by your grandfather himself back then, he was a bit of a loser, but it's not a big deal, right?
Tang Ruishi wearing a green-gray vest, inside is a spotless white sweatshirt, the collar at the tie a simple bow tie, lips with a light stubble, hands holding a bronze pipe, a head of short black hair combed backward meticulously, shiny, the whole person image is quite good, just the original gleaming eyes are now full of helpless as well as unwilling.
Speaking of which, if he wasn't really driven to desperation, how would he be willing to give away his own daughter? After all, that Hong Dali, can be called a strange flower on earth, the only thing he likes to do or will do is two words: defeat.
One of his most famous quotes was, "I have to be a loser, wouldn't it be a waste of my parents' talent for making money if I didn't?"
This sentence can be called a joke that no one in the entire Tianjing City knows about, and many parents educate their children by saying, "If you dare to learn from that loser, Hong Dali, see if I don't break your legs!"
Therefore, it did make sense that Tang Moxin would have such a big reaction.
"That's ...... true," Tang Ruisi frowned and thought about it, then suddenly his eyes lit up and said, "Xinxin, why don't you look at it this way? Let's get engaged first, and when dad's company is back to normal, then we'll find an excuse to get out of the marriage. This time, our research funding exceeded the budget, once the funding keeps up, as long as this project is successful, it will definitely be a world sensation, when we get over it, then we will find a way to withdraw the marriage, and his family should not say anything else, right?"
Tang Moxin whimpered, "It's easy to get engaged but hard to get out, his family is one of the world's top 500 companies, how can it be that easy?"
It had to be said that Tang Moxin was a very smart girl.
If her family fell, she would definitely not end up in a better place when the time came. This world is like this, the weak are the strong. When you are strong, no one may dare to touch you, but when your family really falls, the number of people who will come and throw stones at you will definitely not be small.
Let's compare it to the youngest member of the Ryu family who had been pestering her all through school.
So Tang Moxin cried again for a while, and finally knew that there was really no other way but this method, and could only climb up unwillingly, "Then, then go ahead and try it out, oooh, dad, in the future you must remember to back out of the marriage, I don't want to marry that loser!"
"En, okay, for the sake of my home XinXin, dad will definitely try to maneuver as much as possible." Tang Ruishi sighed and patted Tang Muxin's shoulder, "Xinxin, let's go."
Hong Dali sat on the bed, his gaze blank, his mind in a mess.
The surroundings were unfamiliar, his brain was having considerable trouble remembering, and nowadays he could only barely recall the harsh sound of the brakes, and the rest of it was a jumble of memories that didn't belong to him at all.
"Didn't I die, here, where is it again?" Looking at his pale and slender hands, Hong Da Li secretly thought, "This is not my body, and this is not where I usually live. Then, where is this place?"
He looked around for a moment more, searching, "The first order of business is to figure out the current situation."
"One, am I dead or alive now. Two, what is this place and who am I. Three, what I should do next."
"Now then, let's look at the first point first," Hong Dali pinched up a small piece of oil skin on the back of his left hand and rubbed it, it hurt, "There's a feeling of pain, so I should be alive." He carefully touched his face, neck, ears, and the top of his head again, "This body is obviously not my previous body, but it's still within the realm of humans."
"Then the next question is the second question, what is this place and who is my identity." Hong vigorously looked around again, reinforced concrete house structure, snow-white walls, all kinds of modern household appliances, even in the corner of the room there is a computer with a thirty-inch LCD monitor: "It's a modern society yes, except that I haven't seen any of the stars plastered on the walls around me, and all kinds of toys and models are all never heard of before. In that case, this world should be the legendary parallel space?"
There was no one around, Hong Dali carefully stood up and took a deep breath, "This body can be really weak, skinny like a bamboo pole, really don't know if it will suddenly die violently at any time."
Opened the computer, Hong vigorously opened a few random URLs, the content displayed was very different from the Earth, but at least it let him figure out a few things: "One, the script of this world or this country, or Chinese characters. Two, it is indeed a parallel space, many things are different from Earth, but not too far off.
ID card are not?" Thought about it, but then quickly relieved: "Oh, look at the age of this body should not be very high, about seventeen or eighteen years old, ID card may have to do, but the greater likelihood is that it has not yet been issued, after all, this world is different from the earth, some nuances are considered normal."
"Great Loser System Binding Successful, Current Level: one."
When the system tone was introduced here, a small person immediately appeared in Hong Li's mind, and it looked like it should be exactly himself.
"Host name: Hong Dali."
Sexuality: 32. Note: Normal people have an index of 100 for each."
Hong Da Li looked dumbfounded, "Big Loser System? Is this thing real or not?
Fortunately, the sky is not a dead end, Hong Da Li is hating to kill himself, the system's metal voice once again came: "Note: The host can obtain one attribute point for every 100,000 yuan (RMB) that he loses.
When all of the host's attributes reach the level of a normal person, the Biggest Loser System will be upgraded, and new items and props will be added at that time, so please look forward to it."
"Can get attribute points?" At this time when there is really nothing better than being able to improve one's attributes, Hong Da Li's eyebrows smiled as he listened, "It's really possible to gain attribute points through defeat and make yourself like a normal person?"
Although the system's voice was still so cold, but at this time, it was almost like a song in the ears, "Yes."
Hong Li was so excited that he almost didn't jump up, "I'm going to splurge! I want to lose money!"
"Next, please ask the host to take the first task: the first time to lose money. Task requirement: lose at least one hundred thousand dollars before midnight today.
"Current Defeat Amount: 0."
"Holy shit, it's already eight o'clock at night! Only four or so hours left, no, I'm going out! I'm going to lose my money!"
Just as he was thinking of this, suddenly the door of the room was gently pushed open, and a maid who was about forty years old slightly bowed at Hong Dali and softly said, "Young Master Dali, the master and madam are asking you to go over, please follow me."
"Can you buy me a game pod?" Jiang Fei asked his old dad with anticipation.
"Fei, you're in high school now, you can't be addicted to games like before!"
"Mom! This game is different! It's a masterpiece that Shengshi has been crafting for thirteen years, and it's called the second world of mankind!"
The game called "Dawn" that Jiang Fei was talking about was indeed another innovation in the history of mankind, not only was it a model of virtual reality type of game, with a degree of simulation close to one hundred percent, but also through a brand new technology that allowed players to experience a completely different life through eight hours of sleep at night, through which the human body physically enjoys eight hours of quality sleep but mentally but can experience twenty-four hours of a completely different magical career!
"This game is one that the country is promoting! It's not a lie, not only does this game not interfere with studies, it also gives people a better rest!"
Jiang Fei is still holding on!
"I'm saying for the last time, no! If you don't go to your room and do your homework in twenty seconds, then your allowance for the next month is cut by fifty percent!" Dad said with a stern face.
"Old codger!"
Jiang Fei muttered in a low voice, but he also knew that there was no way to talk about this, his family was in a good condition, and it was definitely not the case that his old man could not afford to buy this game pod, it was just that his old man's brain was rigid, and he definitely didn't believe that playing a game wouldn't affect his studies! "Brother Fei, how's it going? Tonight 'Dawn' is going to be officially opened, have you prepared the game pod yet?"
As soon as the bell rang and the teacher left, a little fat man behind Jiang Fei picked his shoulder and asked.
Don't mention it, I won't be able to accompany you guys this time!" Jiang Fei let out a bitter laugh!
The brothers are counting on you!"
The little fat man Zhao Feng hurriedly said, this little fat man is one of Jiang Fei's few friends in the school, Jiang Fei's senior class 9 is the key class in the school, but Jiang Fei's grades belong to the middle, his grades are not up and down, his sports is not good, and he is not very good at interpersonal communication, so he definitely calls himself a standard transparent person.
"My father doesn't agree, what can I do?" Jiang Fei rolled his eyes, he had nothing to say to this only friend.
"Why don't the brothers pool their money and buy you one?" Zhao Feng said, because he was in a similar condition as Jiang Fei, both being the kind of guys who weren't outstanding in all aspects, the relationship between these two transparent people who weren't noticed by their teachers and classmates was very good.
Jiang Fei reassured himself.
"Hopefully!"
Zhao Feng nodded.
Jiang Fei has been fond of playing games since he was a child, especially this kind of anthropomorphic game. As a boy, who doesn't want to fight with a sword and be a warrior? When a man with a three-foot sword, the success of the world, this is the dream of every boy, but the era of peace, but also highly developed technology society, not to mention the absence of war, even if there is a war, but also press the electric button, so you want to enjoy the blood of the battle can only go to the virtual game to experience!
But this time, Jiang Fei is hopeless, since ascending into high school, Jiang Fei was issued by his father to restrict entertainment, all the game equipment at home sealed, online games are exempt!
Good not to stay up until the end of school, Jiang Fei listlessly walked toward home, at this time although only about six o'clock in the evening, but because it has already entered the winter, so the darkness is extremely early.
Thinking that today was the day of the opening of Dawn, Jiang Fei gamely locked himself inside his room! Almost around ten o'clock, Jiang Fei also finished his homework, he lay on his back on his own bed, looking at the wall clock a little bit closer to the ten o'clock position, his heart was a little bit not feeling good.
The opening time of Dawning is today at ten o'clock in the evening, and then every day from ten o'clock to six o'clock in the morning of the next day, running for eight hours a day, which does not delay the normal life of the players, but also allows the players to experience twenty-four hours of gaming time in full! "Hehe! Such a great game actually doesn't have me!"
Jiang Fei muttered while subconsciously rubbing his hand over the ring that was on his index finger.
"What the hell is this?"
Jiang Fei's mouth opened wide, looking at the ring on his hand that emitted a faint shimmering light, he was so frightened that he was somewhat speechless!
"Buzz!"
A white light flashed, Jiang Fei's eyes flashed, and when his vision regained clarity again, it was no longer his room in front of him!
"Ding! Welcome to the world of Aurora! Newbie Assistant #34784 at your service!"
A clear female voice entered inside Jiang Fei's ears!
"Aurora? This is the login screen for Aurora?"
"To be precise, this is the character creation screen!" The rookie assistant replied.
Jiang Fei was still a bit hard to imagine, he didn't even have a game pod, how could he enter the middle of the game?
Maybe this is his own dream! Maybe he was too tired after doing his homework, so he laid down on the bed and fell asleep, including the mysterious ring thing just now, I'm afraid it's all part of the dream, daydreaming, nightdreaming, maybe he wanted to play this game too much! Chapter One
"Liar! Big liar!"
An angry chortle followed by the sound of feet stamping on the verdant ground to escape.
Zhang Hang helplessly stretched out his hands, "I'm really not a liar, I'm a teacher at the academy ...... just want you to be my student! Moreover, even if you say I'm a liar, why do you need to add the word 'big'?"
After muttering, remembering what the political education director had said, Zhang Hang rubbed his brows, "Seventeenth one! If I can't even recruit a single student today, I'll be able to pack up and go home tomorrow!"
Zhang Hang was not a person in this world, but an ordinary college librarian on Earth, only remembering the bear fire, and then ...... there was no then, waking up to this world again.
It was similar to what was recounted in the novel, the martial arts way was honored and strength was king!
I thought I could cross a scrap, miserably retired, and then hit the face of the reverse, all the way to the high song ...... It seems that I want to overthink it, and when I arrived here, I realized that it was actually not a cadet, but a ...... teacher!
One of the saddest teachers in the entire academy!
Other people's classrooms are overcrowded, too crowded to sit down, but his classroom, not a single one, it was hard for him to pull in a few, but finally even cursed several times "liar", turned around and fled!
The reason for this is that the guy who was penetrated by his own soul, the lowest strength among the teachers, not to mention, but also extremely poor vision, nothing can be seen, the key ...... is still teaching the wrong, out of a case of going off the deep end!
This is the same as the hospital dead, reputation is greatly damaged, spurned, even the new students, one by one, respect far away, afraid to fall into his hands, be taught a half dead!
Without students and criticized, last year's faculty evaluation saw the entire college finish dead last, even receiving the only zero in its history.
Depressed, he drank to drown his sorrows, and ended up hanging up, as expected, and took the opportunity to cross over himself.
The new semester began with an ultimatum from the college that if he couldn't enroll a single student in his classroom again this year, he would simply be fired as a teacher!
Today, seventeen new students have passed by his classroom, and as a result, once they heard the name, all of them, without exception, fled, like a little girl encountering a strange uncle, running as fast as they could.
"Looks like we have to find a way to fool one of them!"
In his mind, he was wondering how he should open his mouth to pull someone in, when he saw a girl's with a dopey face peeking her head out from the doorway.
"Excuse me, is this Mr. Lu Xun's classroom?"
The voice is sweet and lovely, the look is clean and attractive.
Mr. Lu Xun, the star teacher of the academy, the classroom is full every time and countless people come here.
"It's her!" Seeing someone throw themselves into the net, Zhang Hang's eyes lit up.
Recalling the various pretentious routines he had seen in his previous life, he sat quietly in his seat and assumed a worldly pose: "You want to worship him as your teacher?"
The girl nodded her head repeatedly like a sparrow, her dark eyes full of admiration, "I've heard that Mr. Lu Xun is the most powerful teacher in Hongtian Academy, and that the students he teaches, all of them have extraordinary strengths, and everyone is proud to be able to join his classroom!"
"No matter how well he speaks, if it doesn't fit with your cultivation theory, instead of making progress, you might even go backwards! Teacher's fame is not obvious, and if his theories are compatible with yours, he can also make rapid progress and increase his cultivation greatly!"
"That's right ...... I've heard my brother say something similar!" The girl froze for a moment, her beautiful eyes a little confused, "But I don't know what kind of classroom I'm suited for!"
Seeing her take the bait, Zhang Hang's eyes lit up, hesitated for a moment, Marx, Enkos and other sages surfaced in his mind one after another, and put on a look of difficulty, "Meeting each other is destiny, how about this, I'm also a teacher at this academy, so I can take a look at your roots, talent, and aptitude free of charge, and by the way, I can help recommend a suitable teacher for you!" "Then I'll trouble you, sir!"
Not realizing that this random teacher she met was so righteous, the girl nodded her head in excitement.
"Show me your cultivation first!"
Zhang Hang's eyes were half-open and half-closed, seemingly unconcerned.
"Yes!"
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
In a few moments of effort, the room was filled with fist winds whistling, a qi energy swimming like a dragon running amok in the girl's body, and the whole person's breath, condensed but not dispersed, and mighty but not obvious, represented that she had an extremely good foundation.
"Alright, I can see, you usually practice seriously and hard, your foundation is solid, your talent is excellent, you are an unrivaled genius!" After a set of punches, Zhang Hang nodded his head in satisfaction.
He had learned this from fortune-tellers on Earth, and the words were all a million bucks, so wide-ranging that one could not hear the error, but instead cry out in secret for accuracy.
"Teacher, I have suffered an injury to my leg, and the physician said that it is basically equivalent to being wasted ......," the girl interrupted his gushing, some doubt in her eyes.
"Injured ......," Zhang Hang's old face flushed, but, with a thick skin that no one else could see, he continued to flirt and incite, "You think I didn't see it? I knew it just now when you exerted your power! The reason why I said that is because ...... it's not broken!"
Anyway, it's all a flim-flam, so if you can talk blindly, talk blindly, and flim-flam over a disciple first.
"Chance? Teacher, what kind of chance?" The girl's eyes lit up.
After she hurt her leg, she had always felt inferior to others and secretly had an inferiority complex, not realizing that there was the possibility of a blessing in disguise.
"This chance, can let you soar to the sky, become the first freshman is not too much, after all, your talent is already very good, is one in the ancient times of the supreme genius, but ......" Zhang hung sea mouth again and again, almost did not take out a book "Rulai The first thing you need to do is to take out a copy of the "Rulai Palm of the Gods".
Hearing that she could be the number one freshman and praising her for being a genius, the girl couldn't help but show fire on her face and hurriedly inquired, "But, what?"
"But ......," Zhang Hang sighed with a sigh of good talent about to be buried, "There aren't many teachers who can see this kind of chance throughout the entire academy!
"Do not accept students?" The girl originally held great hope, heard this word eyes slightly dimmed for a moment, then figured out what jumped up: "They do not accept students, then the teacher you ...... accept or not?"
"Of course I still collect, it's just that, as you can see, I'm aloof and don't have that much time!"
Poof!
Before the words were finished, the girl fell to the ground in obeisance, "I know that sir is noble and pure, so please accept me as your disciple! I will definitely cultivate well and not disgrace my teacher!"
"The student promises to never disturb the teacher until it's absolutely necessary!" Seeing that he was a bit reluctant, the girl hurriedly nodded her head with a sincere face.
"I don't have many students, so I may not be able to compare to other teachers in terms of resources, and I will also be subjected to being criticized ......," Zhang Hang continued.
"So ...... I've heard that refining resources are important ......" the girl hesitated.
Teachers receive resources at the academy that are tied to the grades and number of students they teach, among many other conditions, and if they don't have enough resources, it will be difficult to progress in cultivation.
"Ahem, I said that on purpose to test you, and since you have a firm heart and are sincere in recognizing me as your teacher, I will reluctantly take you in!" Seeing her hesitation, Zhang Hang immediately interrupted and hurriedly said, "Identity verification it is!"
"This ...... so fast?"
Unexpectedly, this teacher changed his face like turning over a book, ridiculously fast, the girl was slightly stunned, and after receiving the token representing her identity handed over by Zhang Hang, she was considering whether or not to verify it, when she saw that Teacher Zhang, who had previously been calm and unparalleled, had already pulled over her palm, took out a sharp knife and gently scratched it, and a drop of blood landed on the jade token.
Buzz!
The light flickered.
The girl fumed.
Didn t this teacher say just now that he wanted to think about it and was indifferent to fame and fortune? How do you move so fast, and ...... the knife is ready?
"From now on, you are my student!" Dripping blood and recognizing his master, Zhang Hang then sighed in relief and once again resumed his nobleman appearance, "What's your name?"
"Back to teacher, my name is Wang Ying!"
Knowing that she couldn't change it, the girl said no more and nodded with a budding face.
"Well, take your ID card and go get your bedding, books, and find your own place to live by the way! Tomorrow, when classes officially start, just come here and look for me!"
Zhang Hang waved his hand.
"Yes!" Wang Ying nodded and turned to leave.
"Successfully snubbed the last one!"
Seeing her become his trainee, Zhang Hang was relieved and smiled faintly.
It's really not easy. If I hadn't read a lot of pretending techniques on the internet, I'm afraid it would be hard to succeed today.
With a trainee who would be saved from the bad luck of being expelled, under the relaxed mood of Zhang Hang, he immediately felt that the whole spirit of the person had smoothed out for a moment, and the bit of obsession hovering over the predecessor in his mind was also slowly disappearing.
"Don't worry, since I crossed over into you, I will live well for you!"
Previously, that Zhang Zhang hung died because he couldn't recruit any students, much to his displeasure, but at this moment, with the students, the last of his insistence disappeared without a trace, and up until this moment, Zhang hung was considered to have complete mastery over this body.
Boom!
Completely controlling his body, Zhang Hang was about to fool a few more students next when he felt a tremor in his head and a yellow bell voice boomed out.
Boom!
All kinds of subtle languages shook him a bit, and immediately afterward a huge palace appeared in his mind, with five big words shining on it.
Tendo Library!
Pushing the door and walking in, countless bookshelves stood, with an endless variety of books, one could not see the end at a glance.
"A library? Nima, I was a librarian in my last life, it can't be the same in this world!"
Other people's big gift packages are either old grandpas, systems, and all kinds of awesome goodies, but he himself is a library, and Zhang Xian only felt his eyes go black and almost didn't faint.
The library? What the fuck? When we fight, I'll throw books while others throw swords?
"Let's see what kind of books they are?"
Helpless in his mind, Zhang Hang reached out and grabbed at the books on the shelves, wanting to see what this library actually did, but only realized that his palm passed right through the shelves and grabbed an empty hand.
"You're playing me? What the hell are you going to do when you're given a library and can't get any books to read?"
Zhang Hang was filled with speechlessness and wanted to cry.
Chapter 1
Hey? Where's my tattoo!
Zhao Yu lifted his sleeves and looked at his two white and tender arms in surprise. Before, his arms were tattooed with two fangs and claws, dominating green dragons!
How come ...... is all gone?
Zhao Yu looked up and realized that he was sitting in a harshly lit office with office cubicles in front and behind him.
At this moment, the phone has been ringing non-stop, paper documents flying everywhere, more than a dozen office workers are flying through the hall, all of them look anxious.
At this time, a middle-aged man in a brown jacket came quickly and greeted the crowd, "Team Leader Qu Ping is now going to tell you all about the case of the electric baton rape* case, and we are going to start the action tonight, so pay attention!"
Someone quickly pulls over a whiteboard with writing all over it and several photos attached.
Upon hearing the greeting, numerous staff members hurriedly gathered around, pulled out a chair at random, and sat down in front of the whiteboard to listen attentively.
Zhao Yu didn't move places and remained in his seat.
At this moment, he was still in great shock, he touched his right ear and it was actually intact! Previously, his right ear had been split in half by a punk during a fight.
Zhao Yu wanted to find a mirror to look at his face, but suddenly saw the photo on the desk. On the photo was a handsome young man in a police uniform, who actually looked exactly like himself!
Grandma bear! Under the great shock, a stream of unfamiliar memories instantly flooded into his mind as if the Yellow River was flooding. Only then did Zhao Yu gradually realize, could ...... he have encountered the legendary - crossing over!
Zhao Yu clearly remembered that he was originally a gold medal fighter of the Green Dragon Gang, a gangster king who fought without a fight! Although his real name was also Zhao Yu, people in the jianghu preferred to call him Zhao Tianba!
Granny bear!
Zhao Yu was once again startled, and he finally remembered that he had already been executed by drug injection before this!
But how did reading ...... get here?
Did ...... I really cross over! ?
And it's still seamless, no reincarnation at all?
With the influx of new memories, he was shocked to discover that this was a parallel world similar to the previous one, and his current identity, an agent of the Crime Squad's Mobile Team, was actually a - police officer!
The hall he was in now was no other than the office of the police department!
Zhao Yu could not believe his eyes, this huge contrast was unimaginable. A senior small ruffian unexpectedly shifted into a serious crime unit agent, this ...... where to reason this?
He subconsciously touched his head, in the past, due to several cuts on his head, his hair could not always grow, so he simply kept a big bald head, like a fierce god. But now, he actually had a head of flowing black hair, completely resembling a handsome boy.
"Colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been three cases of electric baton ra*pe in our city ......" At this moment, a short-haired, wide-eyed female agent is narrating the case for the crowd.
Zhao Yu quickly found the information of this agent from his memory, she was the team leader of Team B of the Serious Crimes Unit, don't look at her age, but she had a steady style and a high crime solving rate, she was a red person in front of the leaders. Generally, if there were any major cases that required the cooperation of the entire team, she would be the one to preside over them.
"The victims were all beautifully dressed young women, and all had bad life style problems." Team Leader Qu Ping introduced, "The locations of the incidents are mostly near bars, concert halls and other vice places, and the time of the crime is also after midnight."
"According to the victim's statement, the perpetrator first followed the victim into an unoccupied alleyway, then used an electric baton to stun her, and then committed rape. After committing the crime, the perpetrator would also - urinate* on the victim!"
At the word "pee", there was silence.
Zhao Yu glanced at him, this person was Liu Changhu, the deputy team leader of the mobile team of the Serious Crimes Unit. During Zhao Yu's internship, this person did not less support Zhao Yu, every day let him send letters and pour tea, with the same as the subordinate.
The Zhao Yu in this world is not a gangster king, but a big boy with a weak character, who has just finished his internship and turned into an official police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but also many of his senior colleagues, would make fun of him and assign him some jobs that should not belong to him.
The current Zhao Yu wasn't a soft touch anymore, how could he stand being yelled at? He slapped the table and stood up.
His sudden rise startled Liu Changhu, and even Team Leader Qu Ping had to pause for a moment.
Who knows, just when everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a silver bell-like female voice suddenly grabbed Zhao Yu's head. Only to see a girl with a ponytail, a slightly chubby body, and large glasses appear in front of everyone's eyes.
The girl is the new intern clerk assigned to the Serious Crimes Unit, named Li Beni. This girl is a nymphomaniac, only contact less than a month, it is dead on Zhao Yu.
Although Zhao Yu's character is weak and often bullied, he is a talented man, with a height of one meter seventy-eight, a jade tree, and a handsome young man, he really has a certain killing power on the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing her sweetheart being yelled at, Li Beni hurriedly stepped forward to relieve herself, "Captain Liu, I'll do it, I'll do it! I'm still in my internship, I'll naturally do these jobs!"
After saying that, Li Beni smiled knowingly at Zhao Yu and ran to the pantry in the hall to make coffee.
Zhao Yu couldn't afford to have a fit, so he could only patiently sit down again and continue to ponder over his crossing over. Despite crossing over, his memory was very clear, as just a few minutes ago he was still lying on the execution chaise. In his previous life, he was sentenced to death for the crime of murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in his heart that he had been framed and hadn't killed anyone at all! The person who was killed was the boss of a real estate group, Zhao Yu had only beaten him up according to the instructions of his superiors, it was impossible to kill him at all.
Besides, even if he did beat him to death, it was manslaughter and he shouldn't have been convicted of murder! So, his execution was all a conspiracy by someone else!
Thinking about all this, Zhao Yu couldn't help but be filled with rage, his fists clenched to the point of clacking. If he could find the people who framed him in the future, he would make them pay back twice as much!
By this time, Li Beni had already made the coffee, and gave a cup to each of the colleagues present. The little girl's face has been full of enthusiasm, every send out a cup, will be friendly to encourage a "hard work", "cheering" and so on, quite a colleague's goodwill.
"Officer Zhao, this cup has two packets of sugar in it! You're destined to stay up through the night tonight, so hang in there!"
Without waiting for Zhao Yu to react, Li Beni beautifully put the plate away.
At this time, Qu Ping, the head of the team had finished speaking about the case, and was replaced by the hand of the Serious Crimes Unit, Captain Jin Zhenbang, to speak. Captain Jin is already over 50 years old, gray at the temples, is an unsmiling, extremely serious old man.
Captain Jin said in a loud voice, "There have already been three electric baton cases, and one more will be characterized as a serial incident. Not only the higher-ups, we can't wear this big hat!
Therefore, we all get up the spirit, and strive to solve this case in the shortest possible time! "This ......A group sent people to the scene of the crime to investigate, since the culprit is tailing the victim to commit murder, then he must have appeared in the bar and opera house where the victim was before, pull out all the CCTV there, and make sure to find this person!
"Yes!"
"Team B, you're mainly responsible for evidence comparison!" Captain Jin ordered, "The culprit doesn't have a record, the blood line won't work. However, the perpetrator's urine is an important clue, although the police station can't find a match, you guys can go to the hospital or medical examination center to check and compare, as long as the person has had a medical checkup or has been hospitalized, you'll definitely be able to find him out!"
"Yes!"
"In addition, the electric baton used by the perpetrator, the cell phone signal that appeared at the scene, and the only victim who has seen the perpetrator's face, these clues can't be ignored, and all of them must be sent to follow up!"
"Yes!"
"Alright, let's arrange an action plan for each group, if there are no problems, then let's leave as soon as possible!" With those words, Captain Jin closed his folder and looked to turn around and leave.
"Wait, I ...... I have a problem!"
The crowd turned around and realized that the person speaking was no other than Zhao Yu.
Captain Jin was also stunned and asked, "What's wrong, Zhao Yu? What's wrong with you?"
Zhao Yu pointed to her forehead and said with a straight face, "I'm not feeling well, I'll go home first, you guys have fun by yourselves!"
Chapter 1
In the twenty-first century, the office of the director of a high-class private hospital in Donghai City.
"Splat", a thick case was slammed hard on the table, Dean Lin's face was ironic and furious, "Han Yunshi, Mr. Li is one of the directors of the Ling Yun Group, he owns 40 (percent) of our hospital, you must give him priority in arranging for the detoxification! "
Facing the dean's monstrous anger, Han Yunshi was calm with her hands in the pockets of her white coat. "Dean Lin, I'm sorry, but Mr. Li is suffering from chronic snake venom, and I don't allow queue cuts here for non-emergencies."
She was pure and pretty, with a pair of big eyes and a pair of small pear swirls. At a young age, she was known in the Chinese medicine industry for her amazing talent in needlework, and was a rare expert in detoxification, whether it was dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins, or endotoxins in the human body, which were all her strong points.
"Get it straight, this is Ling Yun!" The dean was so angry that he clapped his hands.
"That's enough, don't talk to me about how everyone is equal in front of doctors, and there's only a difference between men and women. Han Yunshi, I'm telling you, arrange for a detoxification right away, or else, from this day on, get out of the medical world!"
I thought Han Yunshi would be afraid, but she remained calm and collected, with a serious attitude, "Dean Lin, in front of me, there's no distinction between men and women either, there are only two kinds of people, those I want to save and those I don't want to save, I won't save Mr. Li, so please ask for another one!"
After she finished, a polite smile, turned around and left, seemingly thin body elegant and calm, quiet and beautiful in its own kind of can not be ignored pride. However, when Xuan Han Yunshi opened the door, Dean Lin was furious.
"Han Yunshi, how dare you speak to me like that, stop right there!"
Saying so, he casually slammed the case folder on the table toward the back of her head, and Han Yunshi was stunned, only to feel a hot and wet sensation slowly trickling down the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, the Kingdom of Tianning.
Han Yunshi woke up in a daze from the sedan chair, hearing a joyous celebration all around her, with the sound of oboes, gongs, and drums, while her eyes were dark.
What's going on?
Han Yunshi will be covered in the head of the thing pulled down a look, suddenly is down a mouth of cool air, this ...... this is not a wedding handkerchief? Subconsciously tilted his head and lowered his head, and found himself in a phoenix crown and cape, just like a bride who is getting ...... drunk!
The palanquin lurched and lurched, causing Han Yunshi to get a headache, and at this time, unfamiliar memories flooded into her mind, segment by segment. Undoubtedly, she had traveled across the world, and she was going to get married as soon as she did!
The original owner is the first daughter of the Han family, also known as Han Yunshi, of the medical family of the Tianning country, because of her mother's excellent medical skills saved the life of the then Empress, now the Empress Dowager, was married to the then seventh prince, now the King of Qin, Long Feiyi, which was rumored at the time as a good story, and the status of the Han family has also soared as a result.
But no one knows that Han Yunshi was born on the death of her mother, but also grew into a useless ugly girl who does not know the art of medicine, the marriage is therefore delayed again and again to become the King of Qin's taboos, but the other day the King of Qin annoyed the emperor, the emperor a paper order, before the end of the month to choose a date to finish the marriage.
Qin Wang Long Fei night young king, is the only remaining prince in the throne of the fight, young only early twenties, on the seniority is now the only royal uncle, can be described as the first person of the Tianning country high position of power.
Qin Wang's residence in the south of the city, the Han family in the north of the city, the palanquin has to go from north to south through the city, Qin Wang married, even if I did not show up but still attracted thousands of people, the whole city sensation.
Just as Han Yunshi was sorting through this memory information, the joy came to an abrupt end, only to hear Grandma Xi exclaim, "No good, no good, big deal!"
Chapter 1
"Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu, get up. It's almost zero hour, get up and eat some dumplings."
Feng Yu felt that the voice was somewhat unfamiliar, but felt very kind. He agreed in a daze and opened his eyes, only to see a young face that only existed in his memory.
"Sis?"
"Wake up, quickly go and wash your face. Told you not to drink, you had to drink, you fell asleep without even watching the Spring Festival Gala." Feng Danying said with a smile.
Spring Festival night? It's New Year's Eve?
Feng Yu looked around in confusion, a hut of less than six square meters, a single bed with patched bedding, an old wooden table, overhead was a twenty-watt incandescent lamp emitting a dim light, and there were old newspapers pasted on the wall with some national events that he could no longer remember.
This is not his childhood home farm old house it, but this house has long been demolished with the construction of small towns ah, and sister how to become so young?
Feng Yu raised his hand and realized that this was definitely not some kind of neat joke, as his hand became smaller and his arm became thinner.
He jerked out of bed and stood by the doorframe, which still had the markings he'd made every New Year's Day with his pocketknife, the highest row, 1988, 166 centimeters.
It's 1988? He hasn't graduated from middle school yet?
He pinched himself so hard he almost screamed in pain, was he not dreaming?
Feng Yu opened the door and came out, his mother was cooking dumplings in a large pot in the kitchen. He lived in a hut, and out the door was the kitchen, and on the other side of the kitchen was the living room, which was called the parlor on the farm.
"Get up, will you still drink in the future?" Zhang Mu Hua glanced lovingly at his son.
Feng Yu's eyes moistened as he looked at his mother, who still had a full head of black hair.
"Mom, you've worked hard."
"This kid, what are you talking about. Hurry up and wash your face, go inside and watch some TV, the dumplings will be ready soon." Zhang Muhua heard that hard work, and inwardly was very pleased, his son was growing up.
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips trembled. In the future when he just had the ability to make money, his father was found to have a terminal brain tumor and passed away in less than three months without even spending a penny of the money he earned.
The son wants to raise but his parents are not waiting for him, this makes a long time, Feng Yu heart is very difficult.
"Dad." Feng Xingtai turned his head and looked at his son, "Up, head still dizzy? Watch some TV, ethnic dance gala, it's festive."
"Dad, I still want to drink with you later." Seeing the anger bubbling up on his father's face, Feng Yu hurriedly explained, "Beer will do."
Having never drunk with his dad a few times in his life, Feng Yu now had a strong desire to drink with his dad just once more.
"Still haven't grown up, that's fine, drink some more later, I'll see if you can get up tomorrow to pay your respects! Dan Ying, go get two bottles of beer."
Feng Danying shook her head helplessly and turned to get the beer and glasses.
There is also a single bed in the hall, with bedding on it. Feng Danying goes to school and lives in the school, and when she comes back from vacation, she lives with her mother in the inner room, and this bed is Feng Xingtai sleeping. But three years ago, it was still Feng Yu who was sleeping.
On the west wall of the living room was a three-door vertical armoire with two suitcases on top of it. On top of a solid wood table sat a fourteen-inch black-and-white TV, which was showing the Spring Festival Gala.
In the center of the living room stood a folding round table, which was already filled with dishes and dishes. There were eight dishes in total, but all of them were leftovers from the night. There were chicken, fish and elbows, all eight dishes were meat dishes, not a single vegetarian dish.
Instead of watching the TV, Feng Yu walked to the front of the closet and took a closer look in the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall by the door, February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve.
He could be sure now that he was reborn!
Mother quickly cooked the dumplings, Feng Yu and Feng Danying both went to the kitchen to help serve the dumplings, after all four people sat down, Feng Xingtai picked up chopsticks.
"Xiao Yu, you're still drinking!" Zhang Mu Hua glared at Feng Yu.
"Mom, it's New Year's Eve, just let me drink some more."
Feng Xingtai also helped to say a few words, Zhang Muhua shook his head and let them go. Feng Yu also attentively poured a glass of beer each for his mother and sister as well, family, must have a drink.
"Dad, Mom, Sis, Happy New Year, cheers!"
These leftovers on the table, Feng Yu casually ate a bite, all felt extraordinarily delicious. In this year, there are not yet those hormone additives and so on in the latter days. Fish, rabbits and other things are all wild, chickens and pigs are home-raised. The two men ate these dishes, and with the dumplings, one person drank a bottle of beer, and more Feng Xingtai will not allow it.
After eating, Feng Yu washed up and returned to his hut to lie down. While lying on the bed, he tossed and turned and could not help but think of his life before he was reborn.
Feng Yu was originally a middle-aged man in his forties, after resigning from the securities company, he did some investing on his own to make a living.
He has a wife, no children, his father died of an early illness, and his mother lives with him.
He remembers that it was the spring of 2015, he wanted to make more money in order to take his wife abroad for infertility treatment, so he mortgaged all the family's savings, including the house and the car, and borrowed a large sum of money, and all of it was invested in the stock market, which, according to his prediction, was a bull market at this time, and fools could make money.
Things started going very well, and his investment, soon doubled. So he had the audacity to use high leverage in an investment company, wanting to profit even more, and then have such a doubling, he can do nothing for the rest of his life, also can not worry about food and clothing.
The stock market rose to 5,000 points, he was like many people, greedy, he thought it could continue to rise, the stock market did rise some more, but the stock market soon ushered in a dive, because he used a high degree of leverage, and no funds to add, but instead of a large sum of money lost. The borrowed money to pay back, he became penniless, his wife does not know the house and car has been mortgaged out, he did not know how to go home to face his family.
He was broke, and that day he drank a lot of alcohol, and then on purpose, with a lot of people watching, he accidentally fell off the road and was hit by a big truck.
That shouldn't be considered suicide, and that accident insurance he took out should pay out a couple million, enough to foreclose on the house and car, and leave a fortune to his mother and wife.
He remembers looking at the speeding big truck and thinking that if God could give him a chance to start over again, he would not want to die in such a shabby way, and he would want his family to live a comfortable life!
But I never thought that God would actually give him a chance to start over!
Since God had allowed him to start over, the regrets of his previous life would definitely not be repeated in this life. He was going to become a tycoon, he was going to become a legend in the investment world!
"Xiaoyu, stop yelling and get some sleep."
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted. At the same time, she complained about her husband, how she let her son drink again at night, this is all nonsense.
Hearing his mother's complaining voice, Feng Yu smiled, rolled over, and sweetly fell asleep. Chapter One.
May 20, 2019, Monday.
Spring ends and summer arrives.
In this season, the temperature difference between day and night in the south of the Yangtze River becomes very big. In the daytime, you can still wear pants and be hot as a dog; at night, you have to shrink under the quilt and freeze as a chilly bird.
Jiangnan University Town.
Song Shuhang, however, stayed alone in the dormitory, the computer desk was pulled to the side of the bed, making it convenient for him to watch the movie in various positions.
Song Shuhang didn't have a penchant for skipping classes - the weather was sweltering in the first half of last night, and in his sleep he made a move to 'Double Dragon Out of the Sea' to stomp off the covers.
In the second half of the night, the temperature dropped drastically. Song Shuhang, who only had a pair of small pants all over his body, was instantly miserable, and in his sleep, his hands groped painstakingly on the bed, searching, but he couldn't feel the quilt. In the end, he could only shrink into the shape of a skinned shrimp, shivering under the obscene authority of the midnight cold wind.
By the time the sun rose, Song Shuhang had become part of the seasonal cold army.
The roommate had already excused him from today's class.
Then he took cold medicine and slept through the night.
The high fever faded, his body was still a bit weak, and he couldn't go to class in such a state. Therefore, he could only stay alone in the dormitory and watch movies in boredom.
On the screen, the movie's playback progress bar slowly advanced. But the content of the movie, Song Shuhang didn't read into it at all.
"Hasn't the medicine worn off yet, so sleepy." He yawned, feeling his eyes get a little heavy.
'Drip-drip-drip~' At that moment, the chat software in the lower right corner of the computer jumped.
It was a hint that someone had added him as a friend, or to a group.
"Who added me?" Song Shuhang muttered as he reached out and tapped the bottom right corner of his computer's touchscreen, and a prompt message popped up.
[The True King of Yellow Mountain (＊＊＊＊＊＊) has requested to add you as a friend. ] Additional message: none.
Yellow Mountain True Lord? Who is it, with this strange nickname?
"Is it someone from the class?" Song Shuhang said darkly, and in his mind, he couldn't help but think of the few guys in his class who had obviously gone to college but were still in their youthful fantasy period. If it was them, they would indeed come up with such strange nicknames.
With that in mind, he clicked 'agree'.
Immediately after that, another system message popped up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun invites you to join the group 'Nine Continents One Group', do you agree?
Song Shuhang continued to press agree.
'Book Mountain Pressure' has agreed to join the 'Nine Continents One Group'.
[You have agreed to join the group, say hello to your group mates! ] There's also a system smiley face attached.
These days chat tools are made more and more user-friendly.
After a series of prompts popped up, Song Shuhang talkingly turned off the prompts and the group chat window - he was so sleepy right now, how could he have the energy to care about what group he had added?
Anyway, his group settings have always been 'no message alerts just number', group chats don't pop up to bother him, they just show the number of chats after the group.
When he's more awake, he can go through the chat logs and he'll know what group he's joining, as well as the chat logs of the group members won't be lost.
The movie progress bar was still tenaciously advancing, but Song Shuhang's consciousness was becoming more and more blurred.
In the No. 1 Group of the Nine Continents, after seeing a newcomer join the group, some diving members of the group ventured out. North River Scatterer: "Did Yellow Mountain True Lord add a new Daoist friend in? It's been over a year since a new person was added, right?"
Another ID, 'Su's Archie', quickly replied, "There's a new daoist? Which area of China is your friend from? What's your Dao number? How many levels of cultivation?"
This series of questions always felt like something was wrong?
"Are you a fairy? If so, tell me your measurements and take a picture!"
"Brother San Lang, are you really a goldfish?" Beihe Scatterer sighed, "Don't you dare die again, what if the Yellow Mountain True Lord adds another great senior into the mix?"
This guy, Three Waves, is good at everything, affectionate and helpful, so he's well liked - it's just that he usually likes to mouth flowers and make a good death.
This guy's luck value is ridiculously low, and every time he dies unintentionally, it's always the seniors who are offended. These big seniors are worried about not having fun, naturally very happy to toss up the crazy knife three waves of this door to the fun.
"Kneel and beg not to mention the words 'Great Elder', this seat has a shadow in its heart." Mad Sword Three Waves sent a row of 'tearful' emojis.
Four years ago, this broken mouth of his offended a beautiful 'big senior' and was tossed ...... that big senior tossed him for a whole year and four months in a row. You heard right, is a whole year and four months ah! When he thought of those inhumanly lofty years, his eyes became moist.
It was only just after San Langjie had said this that bad smiley emoticons popped up in the group one after another - unabashed, outright gloating.
There were eight people in the group showing online status, and six of them popped up in unison to swipe a row of smiley faces.
"You group of gloating fellows, this seat remembers each and every one of you, don't let this seat meet you, or else I'll make sure to let you have a taste of this seat's seventy-two fast swords!" Mad Sword Three Waves said with hatred. He was very confident in his fast knife, the six guys who were laughing badly just now, none of them were his opponents if they went one on one.
Mad Sword Three Waves had only just finished speaking.
His cultivation was so profound that he had reached the 5th grade Spirit Queen stage realm and was only two steps away from the 6th grade Spirit Monarch, but he couldn't beat Qi.
He had a hand of seventy-two swordsmanship that was fast and vicious, as well as a lightning-fast stance, but he couldn't beat Archie.
He was called the Mad Sword, and when he was mad, he was even afraid of himself, but he just couldn't beat Archie!
Another string of unbridled smirks from the group as they saw Three Waves wilt.
"......" This time, Wild Blade Three Waves could only send a string of colons in a depressed manner.
The group was a little confused when they made a lot of noise but didn't see any newcomers make a sound.
"The new daoist doesn't make a sound?" Beihe Diaspora asked out loud.
Unfortunately, because of the effects of the cold medicine, Song Shuhang had already entered a half-sleep state once again.
At this time, Su's Aqi happily sent another message, "I read that the new daoist is called 'Book Mountain Pressure'. Have you ever heard of an expert with this Daoist name? This Dao name sounds a bit like a Confucian walker?
In retrospect, the practitioners of Confucianism are even more enjoyable than the Buddhists, not only is their mouth clever, but their fists are also hard enough. And when they are in the mood to fight, they will also recite poems in a heroic manner, which is doubly enjoyable! I like to beat them the most."
"Seven, I mean, is the only thing you ever expect from a new daoist is whether it's a good fight or not, and whether it's a good fight or not?" Mad Sword Three Waves sent a tearful emoji and said.
"Uh." Su's Archie was a little embarrassed.
The North River Scatterer laughed evilly, "Could it be another 'big senior' who can't use chat tools?"
When he said that, the crowd felt that the scene was instantly recognizable?
Yeah, almost four years ago there also seemed to be a senior who came out of seclusion after more than a hundred years in seclusion, and similarly had a hard time getting on the chat software and was added to the group by the Yellow Mountain True Lord. Yet, because he couldn't type, he didn't speak.
Then, a guy named Mad Dagger Three Waves was happily mouthing off in front of this senior, asking this senior to report her circumference, asking her to send pictures, and asking for a voice chat or something.
Then ...... not more than a few days later, the Wild Blade Three Waves saw this senior with their own eyes. It was a very beautiful senior, as dazzlingly beautiful as the bright moon in the night sky.
Then, this beautiful senior tossed around the Mad Dagger Three Waves for a whole year and four months before she was satisfied and left.
At that moment, an ID called 'Pharmacist' spoke.
Inexplicably brief message with no end in sight.
It was good that the people in the group had long since gotten used to the pharmacist's brief chatting habits - he was asking the group leader, Huangshan Zhenjun, where he was.
Speaking briefly is not the pharmacist character noble and cold, but because he typed with two fingers Zen plus handwriting, the speed of the thief slow. When the number of words is large, it is easy to make a mistake, and it is painful to delete and write. Therefore, the pharmacist is used to speak as short as possible.
"He went offline right after he added someone, I heard that his family's precious big demon dog ran away from home again in anger, and the Yellow Mountain True Lord went after it again." Beihe Scattered Man returned.
"......" Pharmacist.
"That will have to wait until the new dawg learns to use the chat tool."
They were all preoccupied with the idea that the newcomers were also fellow travelers.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang came to his senses slightly.
"Remember when someone added my group just now, I think it was called the Nine Continents One Group?" He murmured in a low voice, casually clicking on the chat tool in the lower right corner and pulling out the chat window of the Nine Continents One Group.
What kind of group is it anyway?
Soon the chat from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang roughly toured it.
This seat? Chasing the Great Demon Dog?
Various words used exclusively in fairy tales.
The chatting and speaking style of the group's personnel is also interesting - half-ancient and half-white. It gave the impression that modern people were trying to communicate in ancient language, but the way of communication was awkward due to their failing skills in ancient language.
"Giggle~~" Song Shuhang burst out laughing.
It looks like this is a group built by fairy lovers?
Oh no, this is definitely not your average group of fairy lovers!
Everyone in the group gave themselves a dao name, the place where they live to be called a cave, the group owner's lost pet dog are to be described as the family's big demon dog ran away from home. There are also people who claim that they have not fought a Confucian walker for hundreds of years or something, that is to say, that person claimed to have lived for hundreds of years?
Just looking at these chats gives me a good sense of shame.
"This level of obsession has already reached the level of middle-aged sickness, right, and it's a very Chinese immortal middle-agedness." Song Shuhang secretly nodded his head.
It looks like it's a concentration camp for fairy middle-aged bimbo's!
This was his first impression of the 'Nine Continents One Group' and its members.
Why would you add him to the group though?
He looked at the profile of the group's leader, Huang Shan Zhen Jun, and it wasn't his classmate, and he certainly didn't know him.
Slender blue lines smoothly extended from under the tip of the pen. The pale blue lines on top of the palm-sized card continued to grow, and gradually, an intricate and arcane pattern continued to become more and more perfect as the tip of the pen slid.
Suddenly the nib of the pen gave a heavy beat, changing the lightness of a moment ago, followed by a sharp side hook, the hook of the pen like a knife blade! The pattern on the card suddenly lit up, and then quickly dimmed and returned to normal.
Completing this card his face remained as focused as ever, he had only completed fifteen now and was still ten cards short of today's task. The one he was currently working on was a one-star energy card, as the lowest level energy card it was one of the most widely used and consumed cards at the moment.
It was at this point that the room suddenly went dark.
The meter showed the number one hundred. I didn't expect the energy to run out, it seems that one more card will be added to today's task. Returning to the table Chen Mu swiftly plunged into his work, all his sources of livelihood depended on this most paper grade card.
Chen Mu's room was very small, less than forty square meters, with a half-used work table placed inside. In addition to the working table being relatively clean, the rest of the room was filled with mountains of miscellaneous items. These sundries were also varied, piles of old books, scattered various raw materials.
In this humble place, Chen Mu had lived for three whole years. This place was a relief room specially provided by the federal government, a small room like this could be occupied by paying only one hundred and fifty eudi per month. For a poor person like Chen Mu, there was really no place cheaper than this place.
At five o'clock in the afternoon, Chen Mu finally finished today's day's work - twenty-five energy cards. Carefully counting the number of cards, he counted them twice in a row, making sure that there was no mistake in the number before he carefully packed the energy cards into the card bag in his clothes.
As soon as he entered, the shopkeeper noticed and greeted, "Amulet's here!"
He replied towards the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper, Uncle Hua, was an old man of about fifty years old, and the years had left marks on him that could not be hidden. Fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, and a pair of old-fashioned glasses.
Chen Mu carefully took out the card bag from his arms, drew out the stack of energy cards, and handed them to the shopkeeper, "Twenty-five."
Uncle Hua took the card in Chen Mu's hand, didn't even look at it and casually put it on the shelf, smiled and said, "Luckily there's A Mu you send the card every day, otherwise I'm going to be short of supplies here."
Chen Mu smiled faintly but did not answer, he knew that Uncle Hua's words were largely meant as a joke. The one star energy card was the cheapest energy card, but it was also one of the most consumed cards, not to mention that this place was located in the vicinity of the Dongwei Academy, where could it be possible to sell only twenty five energy cards a day?
Uncle Hua also knew Chen Mu's temperament, and without any nonsense, he directly asked, "Does Mu need cash or transfer?"
Chen Mu replied dryly, and after saying that, he handed a light green colored disco card that he had already prepared to Uncle Hua. After the settlement of the bill, Chen Mu said goodbye to Uncle Hua and then wanted to turn around and leave.
Uncle Hua suddenly called out to Chen Mu, "A-Mu wait."
Chen Mu stopped and turned around to look at Uncle Hua with slight surprise, "Is there anything else? Uncle Hua."
Uncle Hua took out a goose-colored paper pad from the drawer and looked at Chen Mu with a smile, "There's something I almost forgot. This is a card maker training course attendance card, it was attached by the dealer when he bought the goods yesterday."
Looking at the compassionate Uncle Hua, Chen Mu couldn't help but be touched for a moment in his heart. He knew how much this old man in front of him had helped him over the years, and if it wasn't for him, Chen Mu believed that the life at hand would be just as out of reach for him.
Three years ago, he had just learned how to make energy cards and went around peddling them, but few people asked for them and no merchants were willing to buy them. The amount of one-star energy cards needed was very large, and merchants were more willing to buy large quantities at a time. Chen Mu could only make a maximum of thirty cards a day, which was only a small amount that could not even be counted as a fraction for the merchants.
Fortunately, he met Uncle Hua. Uncle Hua agreed to purchase his energy cards, but the purchase price for each card was one hundred and three eurodee, which was two eurodee lower than the wholesale price of energy cards in the market. Nonetheless, Chen Mu was still immensely grateful to Uncle Hua.
The price of one hundred and three eudi was lower than the lot price of one hundred and five, but Chen Mu felt himself surrounded by great joy. After selling all the energy cards he had on hand and buying the cheapest food, the rest of the money was all spent on the ingredients for the energy cards.
Since then, Chen Mu's life had finally stabilized.
Twenty-five energy cards a day, without a single day's interruption for him.
This time passed, it was three years. During these three years, he only made one type of card - a one-star energy card. On top of making energy cards, he spent all his time researching how to reduce costs.
Finally in the third year, the cost of the energy cards was controlled by him at ninety-five eurodee, and he was able to make a profit of eight eurodee for each energy card, and his daily income was stabilized at two hundred eurodee, which was a figure that he would not have dared to imagine at all three years ago.
Returning to his senses, Chen Mu smiled at Uncle Hua, "Thank you Uncle Hua!" Receiving the hearing card, he carefully placed it inside the card bag in his arms.
They tend to play an incomparably gorgeous advertisement, for example, this class card says what "the Dongwei Academy recognized academic qualifications" "Dongwei Academy senior senior card maker authority personally speak" clouds, in fact, inside what is actually inside Chen Mu know exactly. Undertake this training course organization and the East Guard Academy only have a little relationship is that this organization every time to the East Guard Academy to pay a fee, as they maintain this nominal "jointly organized" price.
Chen Mu still intended to go and listen to what exactly was being taught in the training course. Card making was one of the most difficult disciplines to learn, and for so many years, he had never given up on self-study, yet with little success. It wasn't until last year that he realized exactly what was going on.
For a teenager without the slightest foundation, it was naturally much more difficult for him to learn the card making science, which was known for its difficulty and obscurity, on his own. However, he didn't have the slightest doubt about his own intelligence, being able to learn how to make a one-star energy card within a week just by memorizing it, the card maker had praised him for his talent back then.
Since then, he put aside this goal, which was too high for him for the time being, and began to turn to the most basic theoretical studies. Every day, no matter how tired he was from work, he would find time to learn this boring knowledge.
After bidding farewell to Uncle Hua, Chen Mu headed south along an alley. It was Saturday and he had another job.
After crossing two streets and walking for about twenty minutes, he came to a used scrap card buying station.
He was also the owner of this buying station. Every Saturday and Sunday night, Chenmu would come here to work for three hours as a short-term laborer.
Chen Mu nodded slightly towards Xiao Hei, only that there were still a few moments of woodenness on his face vaguely.
Xiao Hei had long been accustomed to this face of Chen Mu. When Chen Mure first came here to ask for a short-term job, Xiao Hei had originally refused. This buying station had been run by a single person since his father, and when it came to him, it had been run by himself as well.
However, when Chen Mure said that he didn't want to be paid for his work, Xiao Hei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Mu was still paid, and usually Chen Mu would pick a few scrap cards to take away as his wages.
Sometimes Chen Mure would also pick out a few unused energy cards from these waste piles, Xiao Hei calculated an account, every month, the cost he saved on this was a large sum. Just for the silent Chen Mu, he couldn't help but be a little curious, how did this guy know that there was still energy left in these cards?
However, ever since then, he had been smiling and frowning every time he saw Chen Mu.
Chen Mu squatted down and began to categorize the piles of used cards. There were many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, anthropomorphic cards, and even some rare plant cards and animal cards. However, all the cards here were useless without exception, and all Chen Mu had to do was to categorize these cards.
The work went quickly and it was obvious that he was very familiar with the work.
Chen Mu flipped his wrist and threw over a card towards Xiao Hei, "Here, this card can still be used for a while." This two-star energy card still had at least half of its energy inside, Chen Mu couldn't even figure out why the original owner of this card would be so wasteful. The capacity of a two-star energy card was one thousand, which meant that there was still almost five hundred energy inside.
Xiao Hei looked at the two-star energy card in his hand, his eyebrows were smiling. Running to the energy meter, he inserted the card into it, and when he saw the number "523" lit up on it, Xiao Hei smiled so much that his facial features were almost squeezed into a ball.
His three years of crafting career had given him his own understanding of this most common and low-level card. There wasn't just one way to make a one-star energy card, Chen Mu had already collected twelve different structures of one-star energy cards from such.
These one-star energy cards with different structures had given Chen Mu a great deal of inspiration, and it was because he had borrowed some of the techniques of these cards that he had managed to lower the cost of making one-star energy cards to ninety-five eurodollars. However, this kind of luck would not come every day, so far, he had only collected twelve of them.
But luck seems to be with us today.
Looking at this one-star energy card in his hand, judging from the structural pattern on the surface, he was a kind of one-star energy card that Chen Mu had never encountered another new structure before.
He put this energy card aside and continued to bury his head in rummaging. The number of one-star energy cards was simply too many, but Chen Mu was not tired of checking them one by one. His speed was extremely fast, and he could almost tell if he wanted the one-star energy cards just by gently brushing his hand over them.
All of this came from his familiarity with one-star energy cards. This familiarity was left over from three years of uninterrupted crafting, and he didn't need to look at it, he could tell by the feel of his hand alone whether the card was a one-star energy card or not, and whether it was a structure that he had seen before. He was simply too familiar with them, to the point that every detail of them.
The finger that skimmed from the edge of the card stopped abruptly.
Lin Che got up from the bed in a daze.
Her head is drowsy as if it is not her own, the palm of her hand touches the gorgeous bed sheet, not the old one she used to wash, the lamp above her head is not the energy-saving lamp style she is used to seeing that is broken in half, her body aches as if it has just been torn by something, lifting up her wrist, the marks on the top of the bruises, clear and obvious.
She covered her mouth, not wanting to scream out, and lifted the covers to see her unclothed self inside, the scream nearly bursting out of her voice.
Lin Che's soulful eyes dripped around twice under his eyes, decisively lifted the covers, got out of bed to gather his messy clothes, casually put them on, and without looking back, he was going to run out the door.
"Ah ...... let go of me, you let go of ......" Lin Che struggled with his hands and feet.
The man's large hands pulled at her neck, without the slightest effort, and yanked the person right back onto the bed.
His deep eyes, which seemed to carry an innate arrogance, cold as ice on the cheeks, pen nose high on the white face, alabaster-like skin, making her, a woman who asked herself if her skin was still good, feel envious and jealous.
She asked herself that she had seen a lot of men, but all those men who were called male gods became eclipsed all of a sudden in front of him.
Is this the same man who spent half the night yesterday tossing her around?
"Who sent you, and you drugged me? You did something like that and thought you could still get out of here in one piece?" He looked at the frozen woman, anger flashing in his deep eyes.
This unfamiliar woman, with snowy skin and a pleasant little face, a pair of large, soulful eyes, with fluttering eyelashes, as if she were a frightened deer, and with wide-open, unwilling eyes forcing him to look at her.
Gu Jingze's gaze settled on her, and he saw Lin Che's eyes once again turn quickly with her brain.
But, she's enamored with the wrong person.
The person in front of her, although handsome enough to make people feel dizzy, was obviously not that super tier one big star Gu Jingyu.
This time, she was once again pulled roughly by his arm, and when she fell to the floor, she even rolled in a lumbering fashion before settling down again.
"You've got it wrong, I'm the one who's badly damaged right now." Her buttocks hurt from the fall, her hands hurt, the pain down there is even more so that one cannot ignore it, as soon as she was annoyed, she directly yelled out, "The one I want to bewitch is someone else, it doesn't have half a penny to do with you, you think that you're worth the drugs I put in my hand, and this Auntie isn't a casual handful, so you pay back the money for my medication!"
The wrong guy?
Gu Jingze's cheeks tightened, his eyebrows twisted into Chuan zigzags, his dome-black eyes like dormant beasts, staring at this disheveled woman, half of her white shoulders exposed, with bruised and reddened marks on them, clear and eye-catching, as if they were plum blossoms opening up on her white and tender skin.
Those images from the night flashed through his mind once again, and he felt that telltale fire surge through his lower abdomen with a sudden heat, once again.
Averted his eyes from her face.
This damned woman dared to drug him, and the drug was so strong.
His momentary opening allowed Lin Che to finally get the chance to jump off the bed without thinking, and she pushed the man away with all her might.
Not daring to return, she hurriedly ran out.
Hearing him hiss, she yelled, "What are you looking at, look at yourself!"
"You ......" Gu Jingze was just about to turn around and grab her, but he felt a burst of hardness in his body, and his bottom was already uncontrollably high once again.
"Damn." He cursed, clenching his fists to suppress the damn ***.
There was a flurry of voices from outside.
Qin Hao looked back, his mouth unable to close in astonishment.
What was that just now? Why did a disheveled woman come out of Mr. Mister's room?
He raised his sharp eyes, his dark eyes flashing with a refined light, causing Qin Hao to hurriedly swallow all the doubts he shouldn't have into his stomach.
Gu Jingze kept scrubbing himself in the bathroom until his body was washed pink before he cursed at the mirror, "****."
Gu Jingze froze, at this time, his mother even came over, and he knew at first thought that it wouldn't be good.
When the bathroom door was pulled open, the lady who stood outside with a gorgeous face was looking at the mess all over the bed in amazement.
The beds that hadn't had time to be made were telling everyone in front of them in no uncertain terms what had really happened last night.
Gu Jingze's dark eyes were somber, and with one hand he pulled the robe over his honey-colored shoulders, "I know what you want to ask, but, mother, I'm busy today."
How could Mu Evening Qing not ask, the excitement on her face was hard to hide, looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed at the bed and said, "Jingze, I already know, you had sex with a girl."
Gu Jingze pushed open the door and said in a cold voice to Mu Evening Qing, "Will you leave this matter alone?"
"How can I not care, Jingze, you have to marry her for that to happen, you have to take responsibility for other girls."
"Mother, I am not going to marry her, I am not crazy, she is just a strange woman, I don't even know her name."
"Mother!" Gu Jingze stood there, looking even more annoyed because he remembered that woman.
"Could it be that you're still thinking about that Mo Hui Ling? Let me tell you, there's no possibility for you and her, you've been with her for so many years and you still can't touch her a bit, you're simply destined to not be together!" Mu Evening Qing said nonchalantly.
"Mother, that's enough!" Gu Jingze tried to interrupt Mu Wanqing.
But Mu Evening Qing was very agitated, "Jing Ze, you know that with your illness, you can't touch a woman at all, and the family is almost ready to artificially inseminate you so that you can get a child, but the fact that you touched a woman today means that she's the perfect match for you!"
Taoist famous mountain Qingcheng, since ancient times, there are countless strange people in and out of it, the so-called grass and hidden dragons and snakes, exactly.
Countless myths and legends, countless legends, as if a thick cloud of mist, to Qingcheng put a layer of mystery veil.
The morning sun was slightly exposed, and on the stone path between the mountains, groups of green-clothed Taoists holding three long incense plants were quietly and quickly marching on the path, running towards a towering, smooth-as-a-mirror stone wall in the back of the mountain.
The mountain road is steep, wet and slippery dew, these Taoist people but faster than a galloping horse, bringing up a strip of green shadow. More people from time to time to leap up, the wind flying across the distance of 100 meters, the morning wind blowing, the clothes fly, that floating momentum, like the gods on earth.
In the mountains of Qingcheng Mountain, all the peaks, and all the major palaces and pavilions, there were Taoists constantly traveling out and converging in front of this nameless stone wall.
Among them, there are also a large group of small Taoist priests holding various colors of flags and streamers, magic weapons, carrying incense burners wandering around the nine palace array. Incense smoke straight up in the air, dense gas winding up, into a cloud covering the head of the group of Dao.
At the forefront of the many Taoists, just below that stone wall, a group of Taoists wearing gold-trimmed purple Taoist robes, with bagua embroidered with silver threads on the chest and back, and even more cloudy and hazy patterns on the edges of the robe's sleeves and a hundred grasses patterned, surrounded by gorgeous and unparalleled Taoists up and down the body, were holding whisks and stood there with expressionless solemnity.
The group of Dao quietly waited for a while, when the east of a red light suddenly jumped up, the red light instantly tore open the sky and the earth sprinkled in all directions, the many Dao people bowed down, toward the stone wall devoutly perform that three kneeling and nine kowtowing salute.
Thousands of Daoists simultaneously recited incantations under their breath, and the ''buzzing buzzing buzzing'' incantation sounds entwined together, transforming into a wave of subtle sound that made people's hearts and minds tremble and spread out far and wide. Gradually, a strange power rose from the incantation sound, and a bright seven-colored haze shot out from the heads of the many Daoists, shining on the smooth and polished stone wall.
Those Taoists wearing gold-trimmed purple robes bowed to the ground at the same time and muttered a prayer.
As this continued for half an hour, a ray of white light finally shot out from the top of the stone wall, and soon the entire stone wall let out a bright white light.
Smoke and haze rises to the sky, the stone wall has countless clouds and smoke winding, vaguely visible a few hazy body around the golden light silhouette appeared in the clouds and smoke. The silhouette is more and more clear, and finally three men and two women five wearing white robes, the face is obscured by the golden light can not see clearly in front of the Taoist.
The woman in the center of the room looked down at the many Daoists kneeling in front of the stone wall, and suddenly had an extra pair of scrolls in her hand, which she casually threw out.
White light on the stone wall flashed, the purple jade for the axis of gold silk woven scroll slowly floated out, just fell in the forefront leading many Taoist bowing to the purple-robed old Taoist hands. The woman who threw out the scroll said a few words in a nifty voice, turned around and left with a few companions around her.
A few purple-robed old Taoists suddenly shouted, "Ancestor's mercy, mercy!"
''Thud'' sounds kept resounding as all the Daoists heavily kowtowed and saluted to the five men and women, their heads knocking against the rocky mountain ground.
The woman who had thrown out the scroll gave a cold cry, and at once all the daoists fell to their knees stiffly, not daring to move their voices much longer.
Instead, the other female Taoist beside the woman laughed lowly a few times and threw a few more items out with her backhand.
The stone wall dimmed in light and the five daoists disappeared without a trace.
A few objects glowing with strange light slowly floated down from the air, namely a sword, a bead, a small tripod, five talismans and nine medicine bottles.
Sword, beads, small tripod size is as tiny as a child's plaything, but each piece is dazzling light smoke haze winding, obviously are extraordinary things.
Five talismans are even more golden light winding, purple qi compelling, if there is a wave after wave of pressure from the talisman gushed out, leaning slightly closer to those who are unsteady, have been pushed backward by this force.
The nine pill bottles, on the other hand, were densely engraved with talismans and seals of various colors. The old Taoist who received the scroll opened one of the medicine bottles in front of many Taoists, a clear and tranquil medicine box immediately spewed out, thousands of Taoists in front of the stone wall at the same time took a deep breath, and felt that the seven orifices were open, and all the meridians seemed to be washed by water, and all the surrounding body was open and bright.
Just smelling a wisp of medicinal fragrance was better than three months of these Taoist's exhaling hard work. The purple-robed old Taoist was busy sealing the bottle tightly. Just the aroma of the pill has such a magical effect, you can imagine what kind of treasure the pill in this bottle is.
A few purple-robed old Taoists got together and muttered in low voices for a while, and packed up their swords, beads, tripods, talismans, and medicine bottles respectively, and then unfolded the scroll in front of the crowd of Taoists.
The first half of the scroll was a scripture for practicing qi and nourishing the spirit, the Taixu Qi Scripture. The second half of that scroll, on the other hand, caused the purple-robed old daoists to lose their faces and cry out in fear. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Daoists swarmed out from within Qingcheng Mountain.
Mount Qingcheng's latent forces in the secular world were fully mobilized, setting off an invisible giant wave.
Chapter 1
In the scorching heat of July, the tarred road emits a pungent smell of paint under the scorching sun, and looks like it's about to melt.
The air over the road was twisted and crooked directly from the steaming air.
Under such a poisonous sun, there were hardly any pedestrians on the streets, and even the number of cars was low; everyone was either seeking a cool place to escape the heat or enjoying themselves in an air-conditioned room.
A woman in a white shirt so washed it showed pulp color and gray suit pants walked hurriedly, running straight towards the Second People's Hospital.
The hair was clinging to the woman's face from sweat, and the woman had an unusual flush on her cheeks, obviously from the sun.
The white shirt was damp from the sweat on her body, and it felt uncomfortable wrapped around her sticky body, but Qiao Nan didn't have time to worry about that, and grabbed the bag with the hundred thousand dollars in it tightly.
This is the money she sold all the valuable things around her with great difficulty to get together, her sister's surgery to 200,000 yuan, there are still 100,000 can only think of another way.
Walking straight toward the ward, Qiao Nan's hand had only touched the door handle guard when she heard the mother and daughter's conversation in the ward.
"Mom, it's all because of Qiao Nan, if it wasn't for her, Dajun wouldn't have divorced me." It was the voice of Qiao Nan's older sister, Qiao Zidian.
"Don't cry, mom has already taught Qiao Nan a lesson for you." Mother Ding Jiayi painfully stroked her eldest daughter's head.
Qiao Nan, who was standing outside, had a heartbeat in her heart, it wasn't because her sister had been caught cheating by Chen Jun that Chen Jun had left with her sister, but what did this have to do with her?
Thinking of Chen Jun, Qiao Nan's eyes glazed over for a moment.
Chen Jun was originally Qiao Nan's boyfriend, but Qiao Ziqi was pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child. Ding Jiayi scolded Qiao Nan, saying that Qiao Nan was harboring evil intentions, and that she was a heartless little brute for stealing a boyfriend from her sister, not to mention forcing her own sister to get an abortion.
In the end, Qiao Nan only withdrew to fulfill Chen Jun and his own sister.
"Mom, Dajun divorced me, my child is still not with me, and I have this disease, what should I do? Mom, I don't want to die, I haven't properly honored you yet, I really don't want to die."
In the hospital room, Qiao Ziyi hugged Ding Jiayi and cried a lot, she was still so young still had a lot of good life, she really didn't want to die.
Hearing that her eldest daughter had such a serious illness and was still thinking of being filial to herself in the future, Ding Jiayi was moved to tears.
Ding Jiayi coaxed and patted Qiao Ziyi's back, "No, mom will definitely not let anything happen to you. Mom has already gone to raise money for you because of that dead girl Qiao Nan. "
Not long after Qiao Ziqi divorced Chen Jun, she suffered from kidney failure and had to get a new kidney right away.
But in this marital relationship, Qiao Ziqi cheated on her husband and was the wrong party, plus Chen Jun works for the government, Qiao Ziqi was netted out of the house, and now that she's sick, she doesn't even have the money to pay for her medical care and medication.
Qiao Nan, who had long known that her mother was biased, still couldn't help the pain in her already numb heart after hearing this conversation.
She is already forty years old, when she broke up with Chen Jun, she has never been in love, not want to talk about, is her mother does not allow to talk about.
Over the years, most of the money she had earned had gone to her mom, who had used the money she had earned to buy her sister a one hundred and fifty square foot suite, while she was still stuck in a rented room with only a few dozen square feet.
She paid for all the food and even the utility bills at her parents' house, and every time her sister went back to her parents' house, although she came with some things in her hand, she went back with more.
Not being married at her age, she was laughed at for being a leftover girl no one wanted, and it wasn't as if Qiao Nan didn't know that her mom didn't want her to get married, she just wanted her paycheck.
But it's her own mom, and every time she goes on a blind date and falls in love, her mom makes a scene and seeks out her life, and there's nothing she can do about it.
I've been working hard all these years, and in the end I've only gotten three words, "dead girl", especially since Qiao Zidian also put the blame for her own cheating and divorce on herself, Qiao Nan grasped the 100,000 yuan in her hand, and suddenly she didn't want to give it to Qiao Zidian anymore.
Before Qiao Nan could leave, the next conversation Qiao Nan heard was the one that really called Qiao Nan to chill and despair.
What if Qiao Nan raises all the two hundred thousand dollars and can't find **? In fact, the doctor said that if a loved one is willing to donate a kidney to me, the match will be higher and less prone to rejection."
Leaning into Ding Jiayi's arms, Qiao Ziqi said pitifully, "If I really had a loved one's s*** maybe I could save a bit of money on my doctor's visit."
**It's not that easy to find, some people wait until they die for such an opportunity!
Knowing this, Jo knows that it's not enough for her to have money to survive, she has to find another way.
"Why don't mom go for a blood test?" Ding Jiayi asked with some hesitation.
Qiao Ziqi shook her head back and forth, her mom was at this age, her kidneys were definitely no better than hers, since she wanted them all, she definitely wanted a good one, "Mom, you're the mom who gave birth to me and raised me, I can't afford to have you go under the knife, and my dad definitely can't do it either."
"That ......" Ding Jiayi thought about it, her eyes lit up, "Wait a moment dead girl came, I let her go to the blood test, she is your own sister, surely fit!"
"It's good, but will Qiao Nan say no, it's a kidney after all." There was a calculating gleam all over Qiao ZiDi's eyes.
In order to survive, and just in case, she would never let Joannan have the possibility of refusing.
"Ms. Qiao, you came to see your sister, why don't you go in?" Qiao Ziyi chatted with Ding Jiayi to one side, when the,nurse's voice came from outside the door.
Qiao ZiDi's face changed greatly, "Mom ......" The conversation she just had with her mom was all overheard by {Qiao Nan that dead girl?
Without saying a word, Ding Jiayi got up and chased after her, and sure enough, she saw Qiao Nan's back and then shouted Qiao Nan's name.
When Qiao Nan heard Ding Jiayi's shouts, she refused to turn back or stop, her tears kept falling down, but her heart was broken into pieces.
For the sake of her mom and her sister, she didn't even have a home of her own, but what about her mom and her sister, it wasn't enough that they counted her money, now they wanted her kidney.
Qiao Ziyi's words, Ding Jiayi didn't understand, but Qiao Nan did, and the more this happened, the more Qiao Nan hated it, even if she really owed the Qiao family it was time to pay back enough!
Joannan's head hurt before she tried to tell her mom that it was dangerous on the street when a car came barreling toward her.
"Zee," "Bang," two loud bangs exploded in her ears, and Qiao Nan was in so much pain that she couldn't speak, but she still managed to open her eyes, wanting to see how her mom was doing.
Ding Jiayi was indeed frightened, and when she saw her youngest daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over, then muttered, "Qiao Nan, it's good that you, you're dead, at least you'll be able to help your sister if you die. Dicky's kidney is there, and so is the money!"
If the youngest daughter was run over and killed, the person who hit her must have to pay for it.
Hearing Ding Jiayi's words, Qiao Nan's eyes glared and stared at Ding Jiayi dead in the face, not waiting for the paramedics to arrive before she couldn't stay up long enough to be pissed off alive by Ding Jiayi!
Chapter 1
There are few things in the world that are more ballsy than fantasizing about heaven one moment and then finding yourself in hell the next.
Mo Wen is such a person, two months ago he was sitting in the classroom, fantasizing about getting into the key university of his choice, while at this time he is working as a small laborer on the construction site in the scorching sun.
Thinking of his own miserable encounter, Mo Wen fiercely spat a mouthful of spit on the ground and raised his hand to haphazardly wipe the sweat that continuously flowed down his face. He had just finished moving a load of bricks, and at this point, he was already drenched in sweat.
Mo Wen, a seventeen or eighteen year old teenager, plain face, tanned skin, lean figure, and a pair of somewhat calm eyes. Perhaps the children of poor families are early adopters, and his young age makes him look somewhat juvenile.
The hands of the cement truck transporting bricks to the side of the road, Mo Wen found a shady place to sit down, at this time the foreman is not in, but it is a good time to sneak lazy. In the boring and busy construction site, can steal a moment of laziness is very happy.
He sat on a concrete slab with a big horse, his eyes constantly roving towards the road, and it wasn't long before his eyes lit up; a delicate silhouette stepped out from the opposite side of the road, instantly catching his attention.
Although the distance was so far that he couldn't see the other party's appearance, the figure was definitely attractive, especially the elegant walking posture, like a professionally trained model.
Don't look at just women walking, there is a lot of learning in it. And Mo Wen is on the construction site all day long, opposite the road and sidewalk.
He seemed to remember something, and yanked a greenish metal disk, the size of a coin, out of his chest shirt, with a thin greenish chain to fasten it, like a strange necklace.
This object is still Mo Wen a few days ago when demolition of an old house accidentally found things, when he found an ancient green brick in a wall, the green brick pitted, crumbling, estimated to have a hundred years of history of the ancient brick.
If it was any other hundred-year-old antique, I'm afraid it would still be worth a bit of money, but a green brick, even if it was an antique, I'm afraid it wouldn't be worth much at all.
At that time, Mo Wen casually threw the green brick on the ground, but he didn't want the green brick to break from it at once, and a piece of metal jewelry fell out from it, which was the strange necklace in Mo Wen's hand.
There was something strange about that green-colored metal disk, divided into eight areas from the surface of the disk, with all sorts of strange and bizarre runes carved on it.
Mo Wen is not familiar with the antiquities, but can also see that the hands of the thing should be a scaled-down version of the gossip plate, unusual people will hang the gossip plate in the home to avoid bad luck, as a magic weapon for worship.
Although he is not superstitious, do not believe that the gossip plate can have any ability to avoid bad luck, but also know that this ancient gossip plate should be worth a lot of money, may still be a piece of antique, if it is sold to the antique dealers, it is likely to get rich overnight.
Mo Wen's eyes are full of longing, caressing the gossip necklace is like caressing his lover. Once he became a rich man, those big beautiful women who only dared to peep from afar and secretly swallowed their mouths in the past, were still not at his disposal.
"Something's wrong. Something's wrong!"
"Something's happened! Call an ambulance."
A noisy shouting sound rang out right from not far away, followed by a number of people running towards that place, the shouting sound also interrupted Mo Wen's beautiful dream at the same time.
He glanced over there suspiciously, hesitated, but stood up and ran towards where the crowd was gathering over there.
With a sweep of his eyes, the situation in front of him made him jump. A middle-aged man close to fifty years old, dressed in rags, was lying on the ground twitching continuously, his face pale, breathing heavily, his hands tightly covering his chest, seemingly in great pain.
From his eyes, a deep fear filled him, as if he felt death.
Many of the workers rushed to the scene, but no one dared to go forward; a group of workers without much education obviously did not know what was happening and did not dare to take action.
"Acute myocardial infarction!"
Mo Wen's face changed slightly, looking somewhat unsightly at the twitching Old Zhang on the ground. He recognized Old Zhang's illness at a glance, because there was a time in the village when someone had a sudden acute myocardial infarction and died in just a few minutes, and he had witnessed the entire process with his own eyes.
His village is very remote, the village basically no professional doctors, usually have a disease or something is to use the ancestors passed down the soil prescription simple treatment, there is no targeted treatment.
His mother is weak and sickly, and there is no doctor in the village. His biggest dream is to enter the most famous medical university in China, and become a doctor in the future to cure his mother and the people in the village.
Unfortunately, he failed in the college entrance examination, originally with his score precisely can be admitted to the medical department of Huaxia University, can get free admission qualification, but it was a family powerful and influential son of the family to take the relationship to replace, obviously the score is lower than him, but he squeezed him down.
Although he could have been admitted to other good schools with his grades, the high tuition fees were an expense he simply could not afford, and in order not to add to his mother's burden, he had to give up his studies and start working to earn money.
The site belongs to the edge of the city development zone, far from the city, the nearest hospital ambulance will take 25 minutes to arrive. But look at the patient's appearance, whether it can last 25 minutes is still a matter of opinion. 25 minutes? That's a miracle!
This person he knew, and he lodged in the same shed, named Zhang Laoshi, usually everyone called him Lao Zhang, an honest and simple person, due to the lack of any skills, can only be the same as him to do the lowest level of small workers on the construction site.
It is said that he also has a son who is in college, and he works so hard to earn money to pay for his son's college education.
Mo asked some hesitation to look at the ground worker Lao Zhang, his dream is to become a doctor, some simple common disease pathology has a certain understanding, for acute myocardial infarction, but know that there are several first aid measures can alleviate the condition a little.
But these days, who dares to save people? It's good to be able to save them, but if they don't, and the patient has a shortcoming, I'm afraid the responsibility will be put on his head.
Nay society is so realistic, perhaps simply taking some emergency measures to alleviate the condition and prolong the time of death can save a life. However, Mo Wen, like others around him, did not dare to rush forward to help.
Taking a deep breath, he was slightly silent for a while, and finally sighed and stepped towards the morbid old Zhang. He is not a bad person, but the old Zhang and his relationship is good, they are poor rural people out to work, deeply understand each other's hardship, the old Zhang is the pillar of the whole family, watching the old Zhang died, his conscience can not do.
"Don't move him, I'm a doctor."
A delicate figure ran from the distance, jogging all the way through the heavily cluttered construction site to the site of the incident.
Mo Wen slightly froze, subconsciously stopped his steps, a fragrant wind came, and there was a delicate figure in front of himself.
It was a girl with a stunningly beautiful face and a tall figure, only half a head shorter than Mo Wen, with a beige floral dress, the hem of which fell at the bend of her legs, revealing a pair of slender, white calves. All the way running, dress fluttering, Chu Chu moving.
Mo Wen's eyes could not help but stay, he squatted on the construction site every day to peek at the young girls passing by, but it was the first time he saw such a beautiful girl! A natural to carve a beautiful face in his mind constantly echoed! No powder, but it is stunning.
He realized that the girl in the white dress was the same woman whose figure he had quietly masturbated about earlier across the road. Only now did he realize that not only did people have a good body, but their faces were surprisingly beautiful as well.
The girl ignored Mo Wen and directly squatted down to check Old Zhang's condition, and soon her beautiful face changed, as if the situation was a bit grim.
Mo Man also knew that the patient was in shock at this point and was in a bad way.
"Can you help me?"
The girl raised her head and glanced anxiously at Mo Wen, who was the closest to the patient at this time, and naturally was the first to seek him out.
"Yes!"
Mo Wen was slightly stunned, not expecting the girl to ask for his help, but he quickly reacted and hurriedly walked to the girl's side.
"Can you help me level his body and slightly lift his legs?" The girl asked Mo as she carefully performed an external chest compression on Old Zhang.
Mo Wen already knew some methods that could alleviate myocardial infarction, and quickly followed what the girl said. He knew that what the girl said was right, lifting the patient's legs was to prevent the shocked patient's brain from being deprived of oxygen, and now without oxygen tanks and other equipment, doing so was the best solution.
He suddenly realized that his chest was a little hot, and it was getting hotter and hotter, as if there was a red-hot piece of iron sticking to his chest. His face changed slightly, and he subconsciously touched his chest, finding that it was the very same Eight Trigrams Plate that had been unearthed from inside the green colored ancient bricks.
Anlin stood at the top of the tall building, the wind blowing noisily in his face.
The howling wind and that sense of weightlessness from the sharp drop, even though he was already alive and well, he was still frightened and screamed. "Help! ! !"
That fear of impending death gripped his entire body, causing every part of his body to tremble.
Just then, Anlin's entire body was suddenly wrapped in a mysterious white light mass.
The terrible feeling of overweight also came at this moment, and he felt like he was riding a roller coaster like that, rushing to the bottom end, then circling around in an arc and flying up into the sky.
Anrin's screams continued as his body flew into the air before landing back on top of the roof of the building.
That incomparably intense super-heavy weightlessness, as well as the sensation of alternating life and death, caused Anlin to feel a dizzying sensation in his head, followed by an indisputable vomiting.
"Hey, hey, young man, feeling better?" Just then, a misty voice reached Anlin's ears.
He looked up and found an old man looking at him with a loving face.
The old man had a white beard and hair, immortal style, and his whole body was haunted by golden immortal qi, a holy and flawless appearance.
Seeing this scene, An Lin's entire body shook as countless episodes surged to his heart.
All sorts of episodes began to surface in Anlin's mind, and wasn't the beginning of all that fantasy the scene in front of him!
Poof!
An Lin kowtowed heavily and said with tears in his eyes, "Immortal, thank you for saving me!"
The old man, who was called Immortal by An Lin, gently stroked his white beard and said with a slight smile, "Young man you are in your prime, why did you choose to live lightly?"
"My mother died early and my father was addicted to gambling." "After losing the house to gambling, my father owed millions in gambling debts that he couldn't repay, and then ran away alone!"
"A few million dollars! What am I going to pay back?"
"After that I was forced to drop out of school to work as a laborer for my creditors."
Anlin poured out snot and tears, only feeling that his life was gray. What is the difference between a life of repaying debts and being a salted fish, it would be better to reincarnate earlier.
After that immortal heard An Lin's experience, there was also a look of sympathy in his eyes, he slowly spoke, "Young man, your life is really bitter ah ...... let's put it this way, you and I meet is destiny, and I see that you have excellent qualifications, why don't we just let this immortal send you a set of 'system ', let you go and change your life."
An Lin shuddered at the words, he had thought that it was already a great fortune to have an immortal bond with an immortal, but he did not expect the immortal to be so generous, and even sent the system as soon as they met!
I really don't know, how to repay you!"
The Immortal smiled lovingly and turned his palm towards the sky, followed by a pure white to the core ball of light that appeared in his palm.
"Come here, young man, and hold this ball of light in the palm of your hand." The immortal said to Anlin.
At that, Anlin was thrilled and couldn't wait to hold the ball of light.
The ball of light was in his hands, radiating a trace of warmth, and the light emanating from the ball was even softer to the extreme.
"Initiate system shift connection." The Immortal said slowly.
As soon as the immortal's words fell, the light on the white ball of light flourished!
Just then, the Immortal said to An Lin, "Young man, quickly swear an oath, swear to accept this War God System for the rest of your life!"
The God of War system?
What a dominant name!
But how is this vow like a wedding announcement?
Without much time to think, An Lin hurriedly said, "I swear to accept the God of War System and never leave it for the rest of my life!"
As soon as Anlin's oath was finished, the ball of light whooshed and slammed right into his body, merging with him.
Immediately afterward, a voice sounded in his mind, "Detecting the host as a Heavenly Underworld Dao Physique, meeting the qualifications, the system is beginning to fuse!"
Anlin was so excited, so excited that he wanted to cry.
Originally thought that his life was gray, but did not expect the peaks and troughs, but at this moment ushered in the life of the open system!
The Immortal was also excited, and so excited that he was already crying!
"Old Grandpa Immortal, what's wrong with you, are you alright?" Seeing the old man acting strangely, An Lin asked curiously.
The immortal came back to his senses and wiped the tears from his eyes, realizing that he had lost his temper.
"Young man, after getting the system, you have to work hard." The immortal said in a serious tone.
"Uh-huh! I will!" Anlin nodded heavily.
"So, do you want to go to school for immortality?" The fairy then asked.
Going to school for immortality? Only a fool would refuse okay!
"I want to, I especially want to cultivate immortality!"
An Lin almost didn't even think for a second before he opened his mouth and replied. The Immortal smiled gratefully and pulled out a golden piece of paper and handed it to An Lin, then said, "This is my letter of recommendation, with it, you can go to the United Immortal Cultivation University to study and formally embark on the path of Immortal Cultivation."
An Lin was shocked, dare this Long Ao Tian's path to immortal cultivation, the immortals have paved it for themselves!
He solemnly took the letter of recommendation that the Immortal had given him and looked at the Immortal with a grateful face.
Anlin was very curious about the immortal who had given him a new life.
"The name well ...... it's better not to say it." The Immortal caressed the top of Anlin's head with a sympathetic look on his face.
"I've got to go, bye lad."
The Immortal bid farewell to Anlin, and then took off in the clouds.
"Take care, Immortal!" Anlin gave a grateful bow to the Immortal who flew into the sky.
The laughter of the Immortals came from the sky, a laughter that was incomparably unrestrained and unbridled, as if pouring out a lifetime's worth of indignities.
Why is this immortal so happy? Why does it feel like he's happier than me?
Anlin looked puzzled.
Just then, a female voice sounded in Anlin's consciousness, "Hello."
This female voice was wonderfully melodious, like heavenly music, and it made An Lin's body tremble.
Is that the system's voice?
Anlin was in disbelief.
Just then, an interface appeared in Anlin's mind.
The interface was gray and white, with only a few words displayed on it: the functions of the War God System will be activated after entering the Tai Chu Continent.
What the hell is the Primordial Continent?
Anlin thought of the letter of recommendation given by the Immortal, and he spread out the golden paper in his hand with anticipation.
Then, he realized that there was nothing within the golden paper but a slightly indented handprint.
Anlin was a little unsure, but still obediently placed his hand on top of the paper, overlapping with that handprint.
Suddenly, the paper golden light bloomed, Anlin only had time to surprise "eek", was completely swallowed by the golden light.
Anlin only felt a twirl in the sky, and then his vision went from pitch black, to bright once again.
Then he realized that his body was once again high in the air and began to fall freely.
Anlin once again experienced the feeling of jumping off a building, the kind of sourness that made him want to shed tears no matter how many times it came.
Anlin raised his head with some difficulty and then saw a scene that he would never forget.
Two white tattooed dragon gate pillars, a hundred feet tall, stood between the skies, and above the plaques were inscribed with arcane scripts he couldn't understand.
Behind the gate, there were palaces by the thousands, with no end in sight.
Colorful clouds floated around the palace, and various spirit animals soared between heaven and earth, a grand and magnificent immortal weather.
Anlin was frozen in place, his face full of shock.
It turns out that in this world, there really is a fairyland!
Anlin tried to calm himself down.
After a few moments, he saw a woman in a Taoist robe approaching and hurried up to greet her.
"Hello, fairy sister." Anlin waved to the woman.
The beautiful looking woman saw that Anlin was waving at her and walked over.
Anlin saw this and asked with some excitement, "This beautiful fairy sister, may I ask what this place is, I'm new here and don't know much about this place yet."
Hearing Anlin's words, the woman looked a bit odd, then said, "Kirikou?"
"Ah, what did you say?" Anlin was a bit confused.
The woman wore the same expression as Anlin and spoke, "Kirigakure wow kirigakure?"
Anlin was blinded at this moment, and a terrible conjecture appeared in his mind.
"Fairy sister, can you speak Mandarin?" Anlin's eyes were a little moist.
The beautiful woman crossed her arms, a little angry.
It's over. The language barrier.
What the hell is she talking about? I can't understand a thing!
! Nani? In the end, Anlin cried.
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
On a platform, hundreds of people gathered around screaming and cheering, and the crowd was surrounded by dozens of cars, most of them supercars.
The most notable areas are the two cars that will be running.
One was the most expensive bright red Ferrari 488 in the room, worth more than four million dollars, and the one beside it was the cheapest Ford Mustang in the room, worth half a million dollars, and the two cars together formed a sharp contrast.
It's a showdown between Liu Feng, the newest young man in Shangjing, and Zhang Han, one of the former Four Young Men.
At the side of the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han silently leaned against the door of the car, his clothes were scruffy, his hair was very long, his bangs covered his eyes when he lowered his head, and people couldn't see his tightly closed eyes, and from the lower part of his knife-carved cheeks that leaked out, one could still vaguely see the unique handsomeness of the great young man Zhang back then, but his aura had now turned into one full of dishevelment.
As for Liu Feng, he was like a star in the crowd on the right side, his expression was as if he was saying that the world was under his feet.
"Let's go see the once high and mighty Zhang."
Liu Feng waved his hand, a cold smile hanging at the corner of his mouth as he led the way.
"Mr. Chang?"
"Are you asleep? The former unrivaled Zhang Da Shao is now down and out like this, tsk tsk, before the start of the competition, what coldness do you still pretend ah my Zhang Da Shao!"
"The way he looks now, he looks like a poor beggar to me!"
"No, I think he's worse than a beggar, maybe he's living on pig food."
On the side of the Ford Mustang stood a rolled-up, fat, spectacled man with a little three- or four-year-old girl in his lap.
The little girl was long and pink, wearing a white dress, her delicate little face was like a cute princess in a fairy tale, except for her hair which was a bit messy the rest was perfect, except that at this time, the little girl's big clear eyes contained tears of aggression, listening to the crowd's counting of Zhang Han, she seemed to be on the verge of watering.
If it was in normal times, it was estimated that the little girl's cute appearance would attract a lot of attention, but right now, this was Liu Feng's time to perform alone.
A burst of mocking abuse finally gave Zhang Han a hint of a reaction.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes for a moment, there was bewilderment in his eyes, seeing the behavior of the people in front of him he stared, and his eyes were full of a sense of contempt for the world.
"How dare you mole crickets bark in front of this father?"
Such an inexplicable sentence suddenly burst out of Zhang Han's mouth.
The room was silent for a moment, but the next moment, a cacophony of laughter tinged with sarcasm rang out.
"Zhang Han, I think you're fucking crazy, right?"
"I'm afraid I'm not going to turn out to be a fool yo."
The crowd mocked again, but Zhang Han froze when he saw the image in front of him.
"Isn't this when I raced against Liu Feng at Wolf Row Mountain in '09?"
"How did I get here?"
"Wasn't I crossing the heavenly tribulation?"
"Did ..... I come back?"
"I was reborn by the Heavenly Tribulation's Nine Heavenly Thunder?" A tremor flashed through Zhang Han's eyes.
Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight families in Shangjing, Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at that time, so Zhang Han was not afraid of the sky and the earth, but once the family traveled by plane, halfway was hit by a plane crash, his parents and his sister were killed, and the second uncle, Zhang Ming, took over as the head of the family, but did not manage to stop the Zhang family's fall from grace.
Zhang Han was devastated at the time and believed that his family was victimized. He began to privately investigate Zhang Ming, who had always hated his father, but was discovered by him, and coupled with the fact that Zhang Han had offended quite a few people before, he was eventually kicked out of the Zhang family.
By now it has been five years, Zhang Han refused to leave, always wanted to find out things clearly, the days are very bitter but also always insisted, until this time the Wolf Walk Mountain incident.
Remember when in this Wolf Row Mountain Racing, he was seriously injured in an accident, lost both arms, stumped for five years and eventually jumped off a cliff to kill himself, did not expect to accidentally enter the world of cultivation. Beginning to contact the cultivation of immortality, Zhang Han awakened the natural aptitude - smelling treasure nose, his own nose can smell a certain range of treasure scent.
With this divine ability, for five hundred years, Zhang Han had hardened his cultivation to the extreme with various treasures.
"Why not five years ago, huh?"
Zhang Han's expression raised a hint of despondency.
No filial piety has always been the biggest regret in Zhang Han's heart, loved ones before leaving, his own youthful arrogance and ignorance, to his father caused a lot of trouble, but also said a lot of words to make his mother sad, all this no matter how much remorse can not be undone.
All good filial piety is the first, Zhang Han was rebellious, but the heart of the love for parents is not less than others.
The trees want to be quiet but the wind will not stop, the children want to be raised but their parents will not wait.
"Zhang Han!"
A grim voice interrupted Zhang Han's contemplation, and when he looked up, he only saw Liu Feng looking at himself with a cold gaze.
"You kicked me out of the Upper Capital five years ago!
Today, five years later, I, the Los Angeles Car King Liu Feng, have made a strong return, while you, Zhang Han, are living like a pig or a dog! Remember, today I, Liu Feng, will let you, Zhang Han, walk out of the Upper Capital City sideways!"
"Oh, so powerful?" Zhang Han refused with a shocked cry, "Then I won't compete."
"Zhang Han!"
Liu Feng shook the car key of the Ferrari in his hand and said, "As long as you win me, this car is yours." "Then I'll be gracious."
Zhang Han said with a smile on his face.
"Meh."
Liu Feng sneered and raised his hand to order his men, "Set up the screen!"
When the words fell, the crowd behind him set up several TV screens, and at the same time, remote control airplanes were also raised in various parts of Wolf Row Mountain, opening the screens, and the footage from one remote control airplane was transmitted back to reflect the entire race track of Wolf Row Mountain.
"Get ready to start!"
Liu Feng nodded darkly to the fat man with glasses on the back side of the Ford Mustang and sat in the Ferrari.
"Daddy, come on, beat the bad guys.
"What's with the pretty cute little girl calling just anyone daddy?"
Zhang Han shook his head in amusement.
"Han, you will win!"
Fatty shook his fist at Zhang Han and made an encouraging look.
"I'll lend you a hand, your car will bring me luck."
Zhang Han gave him a faint look and sat sideways in the Mustang.
"Ready!"
A simultaneous angry roar from the engines of both cars.
Inside the Ferrari, the corner of Liu Feng's mouth hung up in a smug smile.
The fat man on the back side leaked a meaningful smile.
The lovely princess at his feet had a gaze full of fear and worry, her eyes brimming with tears, and she was pitiful.
While Zhang Han in the Mustang had a cold smile on the corner of his mouth.
"Colluding to try to hurt me?"
"Unfortunately, I am no longer the same person I was back then." "Even if I don't have any cultivation now, how can I be provoked by ants like you?"
Chapter 1
Rusty Lake.
Federal Special Waste Disposal Site No. 23.
It is also known as the "Tomb of Treasures".
With the continuous development of cultivation civilization, the former high above, only the cultivator can drive the magic treasure into the tens of thousands of households, become the ordinary people home travel, study and work of the necessary tools.
Along with the convenience of life, it also generates a lot of end-of-life treasure and metal waste.
Most of these junk magic treasures had a lot of spiritual energy left behind, which could easily cause radiation pollution, and the runic formations that constructed the magic treasures were extremely unstable, and even had the risk of exploding, so if they were left unattended, they would cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the Federation, there are always a number of "special waste disposal sites", specializing in the disposal of end-of-life treasures.
The 23rd Special Waste Disposal Site is located in the southern outskirts of the federal cultivation town of "Fugo City".
Under the yellowish sky, a swamp polluted into purple, emitting a thick stench, the peaks composed of metal fragments are like hundreds of dinosaurs revealing their backs from the swamp, the peaks are filled with broken flying swords, beside the flying swords there are rusty crystal puppets, the empty eye sockets have long since been extinguished the spiritual fire, only the small insects that feed on the spiritual energy to poke their heads out from inside, cautiously surveying the area. Crisis-ridden "magic treasure cemetery".
"Boom!"
Countless metal components scattered and splashed in all directions like a heavenly maiden, triggering the chain collapse of several surrounding trash mountains, raising a sky of smoke and dust, as if demons were dancing, covering the entire sky.
Here, it seems, is a no-go area for life, with only minuscule cockroaches and worms treating it as a paradise.
Li Yao hunkered down behind a mountain of garbage and licked his dry, cracked lips, his earth-colored trenchcoat covered in dust, causing him to blend in with the environment.
Glancing at the rising cloud of explosions not far away, the teenager's clear eyes did not show any half-emotions, rippling.
It was only when dirt and bits of metal splattered the mountain of garbage he was hiding in that he shrank slightly deeper into the pile while wearing windshield goggles large enough to cover half of his face.
"Coming!"
3:52:38 PM, the daily trash dumping time, is also the time for "trash bugs" like Li Yao to have a good time!
The spirit watch on his left wrist was a special hunting model introduced by the cultivation sect "Fei Ling Sect" three years ago, and it took him two months to repair it after he picked it up in the garbage mountain.
In addition to timekeeping, it also has a very powerful feature of being able to record special frequency vibrations and notify the owner when a specific vibration is coming from the neighborhood.
This function was originally used to alert hunters of the possible presence of powerful demonic beasts nearby.
Instead, after Li Yao's modification, it became a reminder that the garbage ship was about to appear.
A few moments later, accompanied by a minuscule buzzing sound, a dozen black dots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time the explosion brought about by the obscuring smoke and dust has not yet dispersed, a dozen small black dots mixed in, it is not clearly distinguishable.
Li Yao shrugged the tip of his nose and lightly touched his finger to one of the runes on the side of the wind mirror, "Swish", the surface of the wind mirror glowed a blood red color.
Under the scan of the red light, the garbage ship hidden behind the smoke was outlined round and clear.
And the hunting function of the Reiko watch was firmly locked onto the particular vibration frequency of one of the junk ships.
"Junk Ship 1327, that's you!"
Li Yao had stayed in the tomb of magic treasures for ten years from the time he was born until he was ten years old, and he knew every inch of this place and every garbage ship in the sky like the back of his hand, and this "Garbage Ship 1327" was specially responsible for collecting garbage from the "Upper East Side" of the city of Fuego.
The Upper East Side was the most luxurious and wealthy area of the city, with a number of cultivators living there, and their discarded magic treasures were also the most valuable.
There were quite a few magic treasures that were even intact, only to be discarded by the cultivators and the rich and powerful with no care in the world because they were slightly outdated or a new generation had been introduced.
To Li Yao, this was no trash ship, it was simply a treasure ship full of gold!
"Whoosh!"
Li Yao's feet were powerful, like a projectile shot out, between the garbage mountain rushed wildly, rushed to the smoke, rushed to the "1327 garbage ship"!
Surrounded by the crumbling garbage mountain, under the feet of the "gurgling" bubbling poisonous swamp, Li Yao is like the most dexterous monkeys in the mountains and forests, from time to time in the garbage mountain somewhere protruding part of a borrowed force, every stomp can be bounced out of dozens of meters away, the action of the clouds and water, pleasing to the eye.
"Li Yao, you bastard, grabbing food from me again!"
Just then, a dozen or so figures sprang out from behind a few mountains of trash, dressed similarly to Li Yao, only they weren't wearing the blood-red wind goggles and Spirit Son watches that were so advanced as his.
The men came in with shovels and iron bars clutched in their hands.
Like Li Yao, they are all garbage worms who rely on the "No. 23 Special Waste Disposal Site" to make a living.
Where there are interests, there are struggles, a boatload of discarded magic treasures may be just garbage to the high and mighty cultivators, but it is the hope of survival for these bottom poor people, Li Yao is the best junk bug in the tomb of magic treasures, and naturally, he is also a thorn in the side of most of the junk bugs.
Li Yao is not caring, hehehe smile, waist suddenly force, body shape bizarre fold, even without warning turned ninety degrees, dodging in front of a cross-eyed obese teenagers, but also take advantage of the situation in the fat face stepped hard on a foot, taking advantage of this foot, the whole person and swept out thirty or forty meters.
"Fat Dragon, we all come out to make a living, the competition is who is faster, you should lose weight!"
A huge red mark on the obese teenager's face, his nose sinking into his fat flesh, he was so angry that he was screaming, commanding his men to chase after him, and the group soon entered the smoky area.
There had just been an explosion here, it was extremely unstable, dozens of trash mountains would collapse at any time, even the vicious Fatty Dragon's gang of teenagers couldn't help but slow down when they entered this place and watched Li Yao wind up.
The fat dragon couldn't help but spit.
Before the words fell, the interior of a garbage mountain not far from Li Yao exploded once again, and tens of thousands of tons of metal components and broken magic treasures rushed down like a flash flood!
"So spiritual!"
But then I heard a scream from the smoke, "Blackie, help!"
A black aura deeper than the night sky shot out, in the metal torrents "drip drip drip" turned around, and then rushed up into the air, but a rusty, nicked blade, the body of the black flying sword, the flying sword has a huge hand guard like a black feathered wing, Li Yao is like a drowning man grasping the straws, very clumsily lying on the flying sword, the sword, the black aura surrounded the body, and then rushed to the heavens! The black aura around his body rushed towards the sky!
In the sky, more than a dozen garbage ship has revealed its huge figure, each garbage ship has hundreds of meters long, rounded body like the legendary tortoise supporting the earth, "turtle shell" densely engraved with tens of thousands of symbols, aura flashes, colorful, to help these tens of thousands of tons of heavy big guy to resist the gravity of the invasion.
"Wow!"
The hatch in the abdomen of a "big turtle" opened, pouring out an overwhelming amount of metal components and broken magic treasures, ruthlessly smashing into the ground.
For a time, the spiritual energy of the entire heaven and earth stirred wildly, setting off a shocking wave!
Even the junk ships weighing tens of thousands of tons swayed left and right and lurched violently in the waves of spiritual energy, and had to desperately separate to mitigate the disturbance.
Fatty Dragon and the others even dared not approach easily, lest they be affected.
Li Yao was still riding his black flying sword as he dashed left and right in the waves of spiritual energy, and although his appearance was lousy to the extreme, he was as flexible as a mud fish.
Of course he didn't dare to confront the shocking waves head on, but with more than a decade of survival experience he endeavored to find a relatively calm and safe area between the tides of spiritual energy, just to get as close as possible to the landing point of the garbage magic treasure, and get close to the water.
Nearly ten minutes of dumping over, the garbage ship makes a behemoth-like roar, turns around, and lazily makes its way back to the ship as the smoke dissipates.
It was with great difficulty that Fatty Dragon climbed into the center point of the dense dumping of garbage, and he saw Li Yao sitting comfortably on a brand new mountain of garbage, looking at him with a smile on his face.
"Shit!"
The fat dragon's face was shaking with horizontal meat, but his heart was quite torn.
The garbage mountain that Li Yao chose was quite ingenious, not the biggest one, and it didn't look like the one with the most abundant supplies.
There were also dozens of trash mountains scattered around the area, harboring trash treasures of immense value.
If he continued to tangle with Li Yao here, he might be caught by another trash bug.
Other litterbugs had already appeared faintly all around, and cheers rang out from many of the litter hills, that someone had found something of value.
Fatty Dragon heard that Li Yao, this brat, was also a student of the famous "Red Sky Sect Affiliated High School No. 2" in the city of Fuego.
The Red Sky Sect was a well-known large sect in the southern part of the Federation, with strong strength and many experts.
Although Li Yao may not have learned any real passages, but it is not something that can be dealt with with a couple of punches or kicks, or else he would not have been single-handedly wandering in the tomb of magic treasures for more than ten years, and still alive and kicking, but also wrestled out the nickname of "vultures"!
But where would he put his face if he just left?
His nose is still embedded in the meat! Mind is tangled, a strong wind swept through, fat dragon subconsciously reach out and copy, into the cold hand, but a fist size of the scrapped crystal brain.
Li Yao smiled and said: ''Fatty Dragon, we are all out to make a living, it's just that we robbed you of a 'Starlight' grade crystal brain last time, it's not like we killed your father, why do we have to go on and on like this? Here, I just found a 'Green Dragon Door' refined 'Snapdragon 17' crystal brain, is the most advanced model, can calculate more than five thousand thoughts per second, although burned out, I estimate that it can also be sold for three or four thousand dollars, as my filial piety to your brother Fatty Dragon, from now on! We are even, how about it?"
"You ...... "The fat dragon didn't expect Li Yao to come this way, and froze, scratching the fat on his face in some disbelief.
"Hey, look over there, the 'Coyote Gang' people are almost here, unlike me, a lone traveler, they will definitely eat up dozens of garbage mountains and won't even leave a screw for you!" Li Yao rushed to the west and pointed.
"Good boy, you've got a knack for it! Let's go, hurry up and sweep the goods!"
A squad of litterbugs scattered in all directions, rushing to the mountains of garbage in all directions.
Li Yao took a long breath and sat on his butt in the garbage, beads of sweat rolled off his forehead, and a smiling face instantly cried out.
"Damn fatso, the 'Snapdragon'-level crystal brain that I found with great difficulty is cheap for nothing!"
"Just you wait, are my 'Vulture Li Yao's' things so easy to take?
One day I want you to spit out what you've eaten from me, and return what you've taken from me, with interest, at usurious rates, so that you'll know why everyone calls me 'the vulture who wants money but not life'!"
"No, we must speed up, those scumbags from the 'Coyote Gang' are even more unreasonable than Fatty Dragon!"
"Mom, how many times have I told you, I'm going to save lives, not kill myself!"
"Don't lie to mom, you don't even know how to do a doggy paddle, and you're still saving people? Besides, there's no one in the river at all!"
Wang Yao speechless, today he came down from the mountain, saw the village side of the river someone fell into the water, rushed to jump to save people, jumped down only to remember, he does not know how to water, even more ironic is that the water is not a person, is an inflatable doll, very realistic kind.
"Is there actually someone else in the village who is so hip with this stuff?!"
It was the last thought he had before he lost consciousness, and when he woke up again he was lying on the bed of his house, next to his parents, with their worried brows clenched.
And then less than a day later, the whole village knew that the college student who foolishly contracted the mountain and planted herbs couldn't think straight and jumped into the river to commit suicide. "Children nowadays, ah, haven't experienced setbacks, can't take the blows!"
"That child is probably going to school on Piao, nowadays there are no famous college students who go home to work the land."
"That's it!"
"Let's not grow this medicine!"
Has been squatting on the side of the smoking bag of the father of the gas popped out this sentence, the village people good face, this rumor, the old king listened to the heart of the diaphragm of panic, and then planted on, lose some money nothing, or even his son was also lost in the.
"That's right, listen to mom this time, don't plant herbs anymore, go to the city some other day and let your sister help find a decent job for you, your Changmao's third uncle's family's child is just a graduate of a school that is not well known, and got a job in the city, and now they are all there to buy a house!" Wang Yao's mother also helped out.
After hearing this, Wang Yao also stopped lifting a finger with his parents and had to nod his head in agreement.
He was a graduate of a prestigious university, after graduation, a passion to return to the village, self-employment, contracted the village of a barren mountain, want to plant herbs, get rich. As a result, when he really started to dry up only to find that the planting of herbs is far from what he imagined so simple, solely based on full-blooded enthusiasm is not possible, and many things are not in the books, can only rely on practice and experience.
The first year, he planted the herbs suffered from insect disease, blood money, the second year, the herbs blossomed, long leaves just do not grow roots, this is the third year, look a little better, and then out of this shit.
But after the body comfortable point, he went up to the south mountain, this is a barren mountain, probably because of the soil, not too long crops, but there are more than a dozen large chestnut trees, jujube trees, the mountain has a large area of gentle slopes, where there are a few acres of medicinal fields he reclaimed with great effort, for which he also paid people to build a hut on the mountain, pulling on the electricity, dedicated to the maintenance of these acres of medicinal fields, rain and shine, spring, summer, autumn and winter, he has poured three years! He said to give up, he really can't give up.
Looking at the well-grown herbs, he reached out and touched them.
Why don't you try it for another year?
"Herb detected, trigger condition met, do we activate the Unity?"
A cold mechanical voice suddenly sounded.
"What's that noise, who? !"
All around, there were mountains and water and woods, just no people.
"Hiss, is it a hallucination."
"Is the system activated?"
The sound of the weapon sounded again, seemingly just out of reach.
"There's a ghost!"
Wang Yao was jolted.
The pharmacist system?
As soon as he uttered those words, a curtain of light appeared in front of him, resembling the character panel in the middle of King's Worry.
A hallucination. It must be a hallucination.
He shook his head vigorously, and the curtain of light that had appeared out of nowhere disappeared.
Woof woof woof, just at this time, a clay dog rushed down from the mountain and came to him, spitting out its tongue and wagging its tail in a very happy manner.
"San-fresh, where have you been again?"
This is the earth dog that Wang Yao raised and accompanied him for three years on this mountain. One person and one dog entered the hut on the mountain, Wang Yao made a trip to the bed and felt a little dizzy.
"What the hell was that just now?"
He recited the name of that Unity again, and as a result, the curtain of light reappeared, as if it were a projection.
"Again!"
After a few tests, Wang Yao was sure that this thing was not an illusion, but something that really existed and could not be explained by science. There were character attributes, skills, and packages, as if it was an online game.
Occupation level: rookie (Actually, you're not even a bird, you're an egg at best!
Physical 1, Strength 0.9, Mental 0.85, Agility 0.9, Will 1.1 (1 is the average for a normal adult male).
Is this true? He was blinded.
Great, he is growing herbs now, and this is what he is missing! Returning to his senses, Wang Yao excitedly jumped up, startling the "Three Freshmen" at the side.
There was also a skill panel? Wang Yao wanted to click but couldn't.
"Why can't you open it?" He asked subconsciously.
"You can't even grow herbs well, and you want to do anything else, go shovel shit!"
As if hearing his question, such a line popped up on the panel.
Holy shit, what is this? Who designed this, come out, I promise I won't kill you! "What's this again?"
Wang Yu tapped in the middle of the parcel column and found a kettle-like symbol.
Ancient spring pot with ancient spring water, one bucket a day.
How do you use it? Do you reach for it?
Wang Yao thought a movement, the hands of more than one thing, it is a wooden kettle, antique color, hold in the hand, but also some weight, gently shake, inside the water bamming.
"Real water! Ancient spring water?"
He looked for a bucket from the room and then poured out the water in the kettle, a small pot, but the water is out constantly, until the whole bucket is full before stopping the water.
Amazing?
! Wang Yao stared blankly at the water in the bucket, very clean and pure, reached out and cupped a mouthful into his mouth, very sweet.
Delicious!
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank it, and drank three large bowls before stopping, drinking this water, feeling that the whole person is much more comfortable, and the fatigue on his body is eliminated.

"Here, you have some too."
Wang Yao gave it a bowl of water to drink in the basin also filled a bowl, this earth dog quickly drank it all, and then barked again, wagging his tail, obviously this is not enough to drink.
"OK, let's get you drunk!"
This man and dog drank a small half-bucket of water, and if they weren't bracing themselves, it was estimated that the bucket of water would have been drained by them.
Wang Yao had never drunk such sweet water in his life.
Chapter 1 I want to lose weight!
On a hot summer day, the Pool Cloud Rainforest located in the eastern part of the Federation was filled with clouds and mist, as if surrounded by a layer of thin veil, with a sky-high ancient tree, crisscrossing the lush canopy, and from time to time, a few birds soared into the air, hissing as they soared between the skies.
In the sky, the sun that seemed like it could exist for eternity was no longer the way people remembered it, but years ago, it had been pierced directly through by a bronze ancient sword that was so huge that it was indescribable, revealing a small half of the tip of the sword!
This ancient sword seemed to have gone through ten thousand years, coming from the starry sky, transmitting endless vicissitudes, and there was even a strong pressure, forming a halo that enveloped the sky, as if it could suppress the earth and make all beings worship!
From afar, this scene of the Jianyang rainforest looked like a picture until the buzzing sound came from the distance. A large red hot air balloon ship was slowly flying above the rainforest.
This hot air balloon cabin is large enough to accommodate hundreds of people, and many teenage boys and girls can be seen on the deck in groups of three or five, with laughter coming out from time to time.
They, the students from Phoenix City who had been admitted to one of the four major Dao Institutes of the Federation, the Ethereal Dao Institute, this term, were traveling on this airship belonging to the Ethereal Dao Institute, crossing over ten thousand miles to the Ethereal Dao Institute to pursue their studies.
Perhaps it is the anticipation of schooling, the journey is not boring for these young men and women, between men and women, there is more of a hazy attraction, making this 10,000-mile journey, there are some fun.
And because of the long distance, the dirigible was equipped with an eatery, spirit cultivation room, infirmary, and other areas.
At this moment, there were quite a number of schoolchildren in the airship's cafeteria, and at one of the dining tables, there sat a small fat man with a belly.
This little fatty was about seventeen or eighteen years old, wearing a wide blue robe, with a round little face that could barely be considered a clear brow, and was patting his stomach, making snapping sounds, while looking after the seven or eight empty plates in front of him.
"I'm going to go up another three pounds on this one meal, why didn't I hold back, trying to become President of the Union, I can't die young."
The little fatty burped as he looked sad and remorseful. This little fatty was called Wang Baole, and was also a student who was admitted to the Netherworld Taoist Academy this time, his dream in this life was to become an official, and took becoming the President of the Federation as his lifelong pursuit, the reason why he had such great ideals was inextricably linked to his childhood experiences.
He had memories of his father often patting his head with a long, emotional sigh when he was little.
"Bao Le, it's still good to be an official, you have to remember that although money can solve everything, you will still be bullied, the only way to not be bullied is to become an official and become a man of honor."
In the beginning, Wang Baole did not understand, until he was in elementary school, because he did not hand in his homework on time, was reprimanded by the head of the class, after he gave two pieces of candy, and then by the head of the class, snitching to the teacher, all of which left an indelible mark on his young mind.
So from that moment on, he wanted to be class president, not to bully, but so that he could keep from being bullied by others.
But as he grew up, he realized that there were so many more that could bully the class president, so he thought that if he became the biggest official, the president of the federation, no one would really dare to bully him. The reason why he chipped in and enrolled in the Ethereal Dao Academy was also because all the high officials of the Federation had graduated from the four major Dao Academies.
It was just that he hadn't had a very good life, and the family line was odd, and he still remembered that night a year ago, when his withered father had shown him the genealogy at the family shrine.
That was the first time Wang Baole saw the genealogy, and he clearly saw that generation after generation of ancestors, but all those who weighed more than two hundred pounds died young and did not live past thirty-five.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream ...... He had not yet waited to become the president of the Federation, and he was reunited with those fat grandpas, reunited.
In the year that followed, for him, losing weight, this kind of thing, had risen to a certain level, but even after the Federation stepped into the Spiritual Yuan Era, with the richness of the aura, with the resurgence of ancient martial arts, there were all sorts of ways to lose weight, but Wang Baole tried almost all of them, and his weight was still steadily improving.
The memory surfaced, making Wang Baole bite his teeth hard and resolve to lose weight tomorrow.
After having such a decision, Wang Baole instantly felt much less stressed, picking his teeth while humming a little song, looking up at the blue sky outside the distant window, and his brain began to come alive.
"I don't know if he'll like the gift for Dr. Lu, it's an antique that I shunned out of my house, that old guy should like it."
Wang Baole consoled himself, pondering that as long as he got on Dr. Lu's good side, in the future, he would have a small backer in the Daoyuan.
"Teacher's power is limited, but I will have to give some gifts in the future, but this Dr. Lu is old, he must have a lot of connections, this step of mine, I should be on the right track."
Thinking of this, Wang Baole was gorgeous and only felt that he was one step closer to the position of the President of the Federation.
He was confident that he could become the President of the Federation, and this confidence came mainly from all the autobiographies of high-ranking officials that he had delved into since he was a child, and he had even summarized a few killer moves to become an official.
At this moment, his body and mind were happy, and when Wang Baole looked at the blue sky outside the window, he also all felt extraordinarily beautiful.
But very quickly, his eyes suddenly widened, noting that in the distant sky, there is a black cloud cohesion, diffuse as if it wants to cover the sky, within it there is thunder and lightning, flashing out a ray of electricity, is slowly approaching, this scene also attracted the attention of many scholars, spreading out cries of alarm.
Wang Baole was also taken aback, it was really the fact that after the Federation stepped into the Spirit Elemental Era, due to the emergence of spiritual qi, it led to a lot of amazing weather breeding in the heaven and earth, and it was difficult for once flying objects to be safe, which led to the birth of hot air balloon airships relying on the driving of spiritual stones.
With the constant exclamations of alarm, the rumbling thunder suddenly came, the loud noise shocked the sky, could see the distant thunder magnetic black cloud growing rapidly, the lightning within it had spread out, like a big black net, flashing the sky, dazzling and shocking, so that people's heartbeat couldn't help but speed up, the original traveling airships, at the moment, also slowly slowed down.
Just when this crowd is disturbed, the food hall door was pushed open, as if the wind whistling, into an old man wearing a white robe, this old man is full of wrinkles, but the immortal style of the Taoist bones, the face of the correct, especially the eyes shine, a righteousness scattered and four directions, just came, his majestic voice, spread throughout the food hall.
"All of you, report to the Spirit Cultivation Room immediately and put on your magnetic spirit suits, in half a pillar of incense, we will enter the Thunder Magnetic Zone!"
As soon as the words came out, the crowd of scholars in the food hall were in awe and hurriedly stood at attention.
Wang Baole's eyes lit up, this old man in front of him, it is he before sent a gift to Dr. Lu, at the moment looking at the other side of the dragon walking tiger-like momentum, Wang Baole more and more feel that their previous investment is right, secretly this old man must be very human, and their own is even more chess high hand.
When he was being beautifully complacent, that old physician swept his eyes and saw Wang Baole, grunted, walked over, took out half of a black mask from his arms and threw it on Wang Baole.
"Little age, mind don't put on some messy place, you haven't even entered the Dao Academy yet, you have learned to give gifts, the old man is also a person who has seen a lot of things, this mask of yours, it's better to keep it by yourself." The old physician looked solemn, a clean and upright look, as if he hated iron and rebuked.
Wang Baole took the mask, heart thumped, saw the old physician this is angry, some anxious, just wanted to go to explain, but suddenly thought of his own in those high officials autobiography on the summary of the killer, one of them is in front of the boss, cheeky first time to admit mistakes, often can be a big deal.
So taking a deep breath, he hurriedly put on a contrite face and admitted his mistake.
"The teacher was right, I was wrong!"
The old physician was a bit surprised, the words he was going to reprimand, because the other party so painfully admitted his mistake, he was a bit unable to say anything.
Wang Baole saw the old physician's expression and sighed with relief and some complacency, secretly saying that this high official's autobiography is indeed useful.
The old physician grunted and looked up to sweep all the scholars throughout the food hall, pointing his right hand at the crowd.
"And you all, you are all the future scholars of my Misty Dao Academy, ah, look at what you are like these days, you must always remember that martial artists of my generation should first establish themselves, then their words, and then their actions!"
The old physician was deeply disgusted, and these words echoed in the food hall, so that when everyone heard it, they could not help but bow their heads, somewhat ashamed, while Wang Baole here, his eyes snapped open, feeling that the time to express himself had arrived.
So he quickly took out a small book from his pocket and recorded on it, looking up at the old physician from time to time with a listening expression, and also nodding his head earnestly from time to time, as if he wanted to memorize every word the other party said, and this move, too, was the killer move he summarized on the autobiography of the high-ranking official.
When the other students saw this scene, they looked at Wang Baole as if they were looking at a godly man.
The old physician after seeing, also instantly stayed for a moment, an unprecedented sense of strangeness, can not help but float to the heart, really he ushered in and sent to so many sessions of students, this is still the first time to meet such a strange person, can not help but look at a few more eyes, but gradually sneered.
"Little fellow, the old man's ass is not that easy to kiss, you have to be thankful for this Thunder Magnetic Storm, otherwise, the old man could train for three days and three nights in one breath, I'll see if you can write it all down in the little book!"
The old doctor's words, the aura is suddenly different, a strong breath, scattered from its body, as if into a pressure, shrouded the entire food hall, all the students are not stunned, only to feel this fight, or the old doctor Road high feet.
Wang Baole blinked, felt the recording jade slip in his pocket, weighed it for a long time, and then looked at the approaching thunder magnetic storm, but still gave up the idea of taking it out, he felt that it was not shameful to wimp out in front of his boss.
Seeing the look on the faces of the crowd, the old physician was inwardly pleased and said a few more impassioned words.
"You guys remember, you have to focus your minds on cultivation, and in the future, you can't be greedy or unrighteous as a human being, and don't always think about finding any female companions, you must know that there is a knife on the head of the word "color", and these days, it's really too much of a bad thing for you guys to make love to each other!"
As he was saying this, suddenly, a delicate voice floated out from within the old physician's voice transmission bracelet.
"Healer old grandpa, where are you, people don't know how to tie this magnetic spirit suit, come and help me."
This voice was delicate, and when the old physician heard it, his body involuntarily trembled, barely coughing dryly and glaring solemnly at the crowd, he then turned around and left in a hurry, while rushing to the Spirit Transmitting Bracelet to excitedly open his mouth. "Oooh, here it comes, baby there's no rush, I'll come over here to help you."
This scene reversed too quickly, the contrast was too great, the crowd was all dumbfounded, even Wang Baole froze for a while, and only after a long time did he suck in his breath, as the crowd couldn't help but clamor, Wang Baole gritted his teeth and cursed a few times as well.
"This old pervert, what he said before was all bullshit! There are only so many female classmates, we don't have enough to share, he's so old, he still comes to grab resources with us, isn't it just based on the size of being an official!"
Wang Baole the more he thought the more angry, and around the classmates in the discussion, the heart of their own dream of becoming an official, more determined.
As the sound of the alarm intensified, the crowd then ended their discussion, and one by one, they went to the Spirit Cultivation Room with indignation in their hearts.
The Spirit Cultivation Room, which was in the core area of the airship, as the name implied, was a place for these scholars to cultivate, and at the same time, it was also the place where the airship was the most protected in the process of passing through the special area.
At this moment, within this spirit cultivation room, as the crowd converged, under the arrangement of the teacher accompanying the ship from the Netherworld Daoist Academy, all of them were seated in several rows and put on the special magnetic spirit suits for airships issued by the Netherworld Daoist Academy.
Having just put on the magnetic spirit suit, Wang Baole was immersed in his indignation towards Dr. Lu, and casually looked up at the surrounding area, and his already depressed mood was instantly made even worse by a gaze in the distance, unconsciously furrowing his brow in disdain.
At the place of his gaze, there sat a girl with slender legs, very moving, but her eyes were also frowning, revealing a look of disgust, obviously in their mutual gaze, the other was familiar and extremely disgusted.
"Obscure!"
Both of them mentally muttered and hurriedly avoided their gazes, as if even a glance at each other was hot.
"Everywhere I meet this flat Du Min, so annoying!" "What's the big deal, it's just a broken class president, wait until we get to the Taoist Academy, with my official killer, I can also get a position!"
Very quickly, after everyone had finished dressing, and the teachers from the Ethereal Dao Academy who accompanied the ship inspected them one by one, they explained some precautions, and even more so, they sternly warned the crowd of the dangers that existed after the airship entered the Thunder Magnetic Zone, and that there was a certain likelihood of life and death crises occurring.
Only after seeing that all the people's complexions had changed, did these teachers accompanying the ship solemnly leave, and the door to the Spirit Cultivation Room, too, was directly sealed, and the lights gradually dimmed.
At this moment, the Spirit Cultivation Room, although there are still whispered conversations, but with the passage of time, the sense of tension becomes more and more intense, and gradually no one speaks, falling into complete silence.
In the silence that was as if he could hear his own heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still in the midst of indignation, couldn't help but tense up until half a column of incense later, the entire airship violently shook and entered the area of the lightning magnetism!
From the outside, the entire thunder magnetic black cloud is majestic, as if a big mouth, will be compared with its very small hot air balloon airship, directly engulfed.
This weather, seems to contain the power of destruction, can sweep everything, perhaps only the dome of the sky, the round of shocking sword sun, can ignore all, as if looking down on the earth thirty-seven years is not enough, but also longer.
The year was the thirty-seventh year of the Spirit Era.
A.D. 3029, the Earth's technological development was so fast that there were no more national boundaries, realizing the great unification of the Earth and entering the era of the Federation, and it was at this time that a great sword flew from the stars and pierced through the sun, and the world was stirred up.
The hilt of this great sword, perhaps because it was already in disrepair, ruptured in this violent vibration in a large number of fragments, spilling out all over the starry sky, with some of them landing all over the Earth.
With the arrival of the bronze great sword, as the shards fell, the earth suddenly had an additional new energy source that seemed to permeate the heavens and earth, an unending source of energy, later named ...... aura!
Aura is like air, some places are thick, some places are thin, and because those spilled fragments were obtained by the Federation as well as various forces, and all kinds of techniques about cultivation as well as weapon refining, alchemy, and refining of spirit stones were found on them, and the words on them were full of ancient meanings, which led to people contacting the ancient language and became a trend.
And the emergence of aura, but also quickly eliminated the original energy, changed people's lives, not only formed a spiritual network, but also changed the process of civilization of the Earth, making the whole Earth, opened the cultivation civilization.
From then on, the ancient martial arts rose, the world changed greatly, and the era of all people cultivating immortality was thus opened.
The history is called, Ling Yuan Ji.
At this moment, within the thunder magnetic black clouds, the slowly traveling red hot air balloon blimp was surrounded by countless lightning bolts that continuously bombarded it, but fortunately, there was a soft light curtain spreading to protect the left and right, making the blimp safe and sound.
As for the Spirit Cultivation Room in the core area of the cabin, at this moment, all the scholars, including Wang Baole, had unconsciously fallen asleep, as if there was a strange force that guided them into a dream world.
Only in the main pavilion at the bow of the ship, at this moment, there were seven or eight teachers, some drinking tea, some with smiles, were talking to each other in a relaxed manner, very different from the way they had scared the students before.
The person at the head is an old man, full of wrinkles, holding a smoking gun, is smoking a mouthful, if Wang Baole is here, will certainly recognize at a glance, this old man, it is the previous shameless old doctor Lu.
As a middle-aged teacher spoke, the old physician, who was smoking a cigarette, smiled slightly.
