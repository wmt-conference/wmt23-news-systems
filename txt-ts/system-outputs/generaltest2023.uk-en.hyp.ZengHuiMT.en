Letter from the occupation.
Kherson.
‚Äú Natasha, we are holding on with all our might.
It feels like they are afraid.
They are very afraid.
They can stop any person on the street and make them repeat several times that they are big, that they are strong and that we want to live with them.
We lower our eyes and repeat, and in our head we spin - how are you, s@ ki, afraid if you, for your greatness, need someone to repeat this greatness!
How insecure you are of yourself?
It's like sexual intercourse with an impotent person, who needs to endlessly repeat that he is strong, that he succeeds, for a very long time and stubbornly for him to try and at the same time think when this painful abuse will finally end, but at the same time, this painful abuse will finally end.
We repeat this in order to save us all.
Because it is very difficult for an unarmed person to fight against a brainless body with a machine gun.
Because then, when this evil spirits are expelled from our land, we will need to put the city in order.
Whoever we talk to now, everyone has the same words.
Words that there is a smell of rot in the city.
We will probably need a lot of detergents just to wash sidewalks, houses, and even trees for a long time. Because everything these inhumans touched has the smell of rot.
Yesterday, one woman, a pensioner, refused to repeat that they were big.
Three healthy men undressed her and left her outside, forbidding anyone to approach her to help.
For three hours she stood undressed on the street and only spoke loudly:
‚Äú Don't come near me, my dear.
Do not put yourself in danger.
Please.
We will still have a lot to do with you.
Then he goes ‚Äú well, here we go‚Äù .
And one more thing.
They steal.
They steal everything.
It is even difficult for me to imagine that they do not steal.
We have never seen theft on such a scale.
Starting from children's toys and ending with a box of rotten vegetables.
They are afraid because leaflets are constantly posted in the city.
Our postcards with Ukrainian symbols.
We are waiting for the Armed Forces of Ukraine to arrive.
And when they are close, Kherson residents will deal with dishonesty with their bare hands and teeth.
They feel it.
So they are in a hurry.
And we will wait.
We'll wait.
We clench our teeth, clench our fists until numbness in our fingers and wait for us.
Because we have something to wait for.
To be once and for all.
And none of this evil spirits remained.
And then we will wash the city.
For a long time,
Natasha, tell everyone that Kherson is Ukraine.
And, if you can, pray for us, calling all Ukrainian names in your prayers.
Because these are our names.   ‚Äú
The author of the written for obvious reasons is not indicated.
And I need communication. I was sour in some of the things. I know few people want to communicate with sour people, but still I don‚Äô t lose hope.
How satisfied are you with housing?
You need help.
You work in the same profession as before you left Ukraine.
These and similar questions are now reflected by the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs as part of research among Ukrainians who came to the Czech Republic because of the war.
The conclusions will help to better know their situation and plan the most effective assistance.
Data collection is carried out through an online questionnaire.
Anyone who provided a functional e-mail when requesting humanitarian assistance will receive an invitation to the study( from the invitation address@ click4survey) . Jk ;)
The questionnaire is filled out by everyone only once.
Filling out the questionnaire, you will greatly help to outline the current situation and needs.
Thank you for your cooperation.
PRODUCTION TECHNICIAN
, PRODUCTION MECHANIC IN PRODUCTION
We manufacture electron microscopes and spectrometers that help scientists around the world.
Modern materials, powerful electronics or modern medicines  none of this would have happened without these devices from Brno.
We are looking for new colleagues in our production team who want to work in a unique environment, are not afraid of technology and want to get a stable and promising job.
We offer opportunities to both recent graduates and experienced professionals.
I would like to say a few words about this.
There is a great desire to gather with the residents to discuss important, exciting issues, but the gathering is prohibited by law, because the country has a war in the country.
I will be grateful for good advice and any help in my desire to do as much as possible for the residents.
Together we are a force.
Together we will overcome all adversity.
Together we will win.
So get in touch.
I will listen to everyone.
I will be infinitely glad and grateful for your support and cooperation.
On Wednesday, May 18, the Czech government approved a change in the conditions for the payment of humanitarian aid to Ukrainian refugees.
Today, all arriving Ukrainian refugees are entitled to a first aid payment of 5, 000 CZK without any additional conditions ( only a temporary protection visa is required) .
In order to receive the same amount for the next five months, the applicant must prove his difficult financial situation  be considered unemployed, have no property in the Czech Republic, etc.
The Ministry of Labor decided to change this practice as follows:
1Ô∏è The first payment of assistance will cease to be unconditional.
If a refugee is provided with free housing, daily reusable meals and hygiene supplies, he will not be able to claim the payment of 5, 000 CZK.
The authorities will begin to believe that basic assistance was provided in kind ( housing, food and hygiene products), which means that the purpose of humanitarian aid has been fulfilled and there is no need to pay money.
This event is designed to solve the problem of Roma refugees from Ukraine.
Many of them come to the Czech Republic only for financial assistance.
2Ô∏è As before, only those refugees who prove an immediate need ( lack of work, etc.) will still have the right to cash payment of the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth assistance.
However, two more conditions will be added:
üìå as in the first point, assistance in the form of money can be received only by those in the country who would not be provided with free housing, daily meals and hygiene supplies;
üìå the applicant must actually live on the territory of the Czech Republic.
This is necessary in order to stop the practice of "tourism for assistance", when a refugee lives in one country, and comes to the Czech Republic for a few days exclusively for money.
According to the law, every foreigner is obliged to inform the Ministry of Internal Affairs about the change of residence within three working days after moving.
If the address in the application form for the payment of assistance does not coincide with the address indicated in the database of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the applicant will be asked to provide evidence that she really lives in the Czech Republic.
Otherwise, the payment of assistance will be refused.
At the moment, the Czech Republic has spent 2.626 billion on the payment of humanitarian aid. The crown is a crown.
And today I was engaged in the whole day digging up defensive structures, and the whole city is being dug in, some not very happy forecasts for the near future.
Honestly tired, it is very difficult to organize such a process.
We help the army dig trenches and trenches, for this someone needs to organize equipment and people, and I am the head of the village, then these are my duties.
All utilities are involved, and we also appeal to farmers, they have excavators and tractors, they have excavators and tractors.
We must unite, otherwise we will not overcome the Catsaps.
There is a lot of propaganda for people to despair and weaken resistance.
To be honest, I haven't picked up a shovel today yet, I hope I don't have to.
My children have pasted girls' stickers on my phone case so that I don't forget that I'm female if I'm female.
What happens if the bill is passed?
Ô∏è A government Commission will be formed from representatives of the Office of the President, some ministries and business associations, which will accelerate the instruments of state regulation of economic activity.
Ô∏è The Commission and other executive authorities will review all permits for doing business in most areas by the end of the year.
And they will suggest which permits or procedures need to be removed.
Ô∏è The Cabinet of Ministers in an accelerated mode will remove all ‚Äú unnecessary‚Äù permits and procedures.
Without any public discussion, behind the scenes.
Ô∏è It will not matter whether the decisions of the Cabinet of Ministers contradict the current laws.
The public and deputies will lose the opportunity to influence the regulation of economic activities that may harm the environment.
And the law itself will become something like the Constitution of Ukraine.
Ô∏è Regulation of business by the state will be based on the principle of ‚Äú one new permit  minus two old ones‚Äù .
Whether or not it makes any sense.
How does this relate to the environment?
Ô∏è In the backstage mode, the Cabinet of Ministers will be able to change any documents on permits or procedures in the field of environment.
Forest protection, wildlife protection, waste management, environmental impact assessment, etc. will be at risk.
Ô∏è Neither the public nor parliamentarians will influence the process.
We will not even know how and who changes the by-laws, until the final decisions are made.
Ô∏è The only ones who will have access to information and the possibility of influence are business associations.
Bill No. 8058 is a direct threat to the environment.
Short deadlines for review of permits, non-transparent procedure, lack of any decision-making criteria are a movement somewhere to the east, not to the EU, and not to the EU.
Therefore, we call on environmental organizations and initiatives to support the appeal wholeheartedly.
They told her - grandmother, the Russians came to the village; Grab your cat and climb into the bead.
But she refused  that I, an old mare... Save children and girls, I'll stop here... Grandma goes down to the cellar, sows cucumbers, rolls back a tub of trash, a bunch of troughs; There are doors with iron bolts and silver locks and silver locks; There are doors - iron bolts and silver locks.
And someone rattles in chains behind the door.
I didn't think, says the woman, that I would live.
Seventy-odd years old  and again the rod
Go not through the cities, for I will curse you, you will bring us closer to "Putin Capu", you will bring us closer.
The cat hisses, glass cracks in the windows, and the glass cracks in the windows.
Tanks rumble and slide between houses.
Russians enter the village.
A dog with three heads comes out of the cellar.
Good afternoon, go to the post office and confirm your identity through the "check-in", then upon confirmation you will be given a code, and this code must again be indicated in registration on the Internet and you are ready for registration on the Internet.
There must be a bank card registered for the person who wants to receive financial assistance, another is not suitable.
I did so to an acquaintance, it also indicated that some key was needed, but when she survived, she waited in the government there she was told why she came because she was already registered.
She was also shown, in this application, that she needed some kind of key, but in fact, she was already registering without that.
help me too, the application was made online on May 5, but something is not fashionable to understand whether to go to the labor government or wait for the labor government.
it is written that you will receive money on the card after processing your application, but writes that the identity is not confirmed, through the banking system it gives an error.
Good afternoon, dear Ms. Angelina.
I want to express my point of view regarding the use of "in"/"on" in relation to the word "Ukraine"
The use of this term in recent decades has become a serious political issue.
Russia's current war against Ukraine has been prepared for a long time and purposefully, including through information and linguistic policy, through information and linguistic policy.
Thank you for interesting exercises and tasks, for a clear explanation of grammar, pleasant communication, and pleasant communication.
We are especially grateful for the technical support of training, first of all, for the textbook, which made it possible to understand what was sometimes not learned in lectures.
These three months laid the foundation of our knowledge.
We hope that our next course will be even more fruitful.
We wish the entire creative team creative inspiration, peace and happiness to us.

Connoisseurs of Mr. Mykhailo's talent hope that at the end of the war they will hear him play the saxophone again, see his unsurpassed ability to transform, and be able to overcome their fear and pain thanks to high art thanks to high art.
Minerals of Ukraine.
By origin, minerals are divided into igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic ones.
Therefore, their placement is closely related to the structure of the earth's crust.
Fuel minerals of Ukraine.
Fuel minerals mined in our country include: coal and lignite, oil, natural gas, peat, oil shale, oil shale.
The territory of Ukraine is rich in certain types of fuel resources.
The state fully meets its own needs for coal and brown coal.
Instead, Ukraine is feeling an acute shortage of oil and natural gas.
Practice shows that until we have a rational economy, an acute shortage can arise in anything.
Peat in Ukraine has long been mined in Polissia.
Since the mid-1990s. it was used as fuel only for local needs in rural areas, farms, glass, porcelain, food industries, and food industries.
Various chemicals are also obtained from peat, in particular acetone, phenols, paraffin, fodder, yeast, yeast, etc.
There are considerable deposits of oil shale in Cherkasy and Kirovohrad regions.
The geography of the location of fuel resources is related to the tectonic and geological structure of the territory.
Fuel resources are of sedimentary origin, therefore they are included in the covers of ancient and young platforms, as well as in the marginal foothill troughs.
Coal.
94.3% of the coal deposits of our country are coal.
Ukrainian coal is of high quality.
Due to its high carbon content, it has a high calorific value.
In Ukraine, there are deposits of the best grade of coal  anthracite, the carbon content of which reaches 94-97%.
1/3 of coal is coking.
After special processing, it is used in the smelting of cast iron and steel.
According to proven reserves of coal, Ukraine ranks VIII in the world and 1st place in Europe, and in terms of production, it ranks XI and III, respectively, in terms of production.
Explored coal reserves in Ukraine are about 50 billion tons.
Estimated reserves are about 120 billion tons.
Russians like to write "messages" on shells that are dropped on peaceful Ukrainian cities.
Thus, the Ukrainian band Kalush Orchestra called from the stage of Europe to save the military blocked at Azovstal in Mariupol  and the next day the Russians wrote on the shells Kalush, as you asked, "Kalush, as you asked." # to Azovstal"
On April 8, 2022, the Russian military fired at the station in Kramatorsk with the inscription "For the children", it was written "For the children", which was used by the Russian military.
Then 61 people died from shells with a cynical inscription, including 7 children, including 7 children.
The tradition of making inscriptions on shells appeared in the First World War.
In World War II, Soviet troops also wrote similar messages to enemies.
This then helped soldiers maintain morale while defending their land.
Today, the inscriptions left on the shells by the Russian military are a cynical and cruel gesture of the aggressor army.
With these shells, they kill civilians and destroy peaceful cities in Ukraine just because they do not like Ukraine's political course.
Russia needs to be stopped so that such "messages" do not fly to any other country.
The Vy≈°n√© Nemeck√© crossing greeted us with a relatively short queue and friendly Slovak border guards.
"We carry insulin, it needs a temperature regime - it cannot heat up.
Is it possible to pass the control in an accelerated mode? ‚Äú
The border guard allowed us to stand at the beginning of the queue, even the trucks cordially gave way to a place.
The lieks were owned.
The city of Lion lives.
It is like the aorta of the Ukrainian body  an endless stream of people.
People from all regions of the country have found shelter and a sense of security here.
Someone goes further to Europe, someone returns home, someone stays, someone stays.
At first glance, the war is immediately visible at checkpoints around the city.
The war is reflected in the dictation windows of cathedrals.
It envelops monuments and sculptures in white canvases.
But the war is not heard on Rynok Square, where thousands of voices are heard at the same time, it is not heard in coffee shops and bars, where people continue to live, where people continue to live.
Yes, life subsides earlier  at 11 pm life hides from the curfew.
But it is there: when we were sitting in a cafe at 9 pm and announced the alarm, it was heard only from a warning on someone's phone.
And the street siren was drowned out by the voices of people living life.
Bucha, Irpin.
We paved the way to Kyiv through two of the many martyr cities  through Bucha and Irpin.
Hero cities in which the air smells of hope.
Despite the pain, people return and rebuild their lives.
Private house.
The fence is like a sieve.
( Debris of shells or automatic queues.   )
On the crushed balcony, Ukrainian banner is stretched.
There are holes near the front door, such that the living room gradually becomes a street.
And at that front door, three are poking around at that front door.
They clean, repair, build a wall and with it a new life.
And the park two blocks below is walked by a mother and a child.
I can't help but ask myself: " Did their dad survive the shooting of men in Bucha?
Will he walk with them again? ‚Äú
At the exit from Irpen, there is a cemetery of cars.
These are the same cars in which civilians tried to leave and which were ruthlessly shot by the Russian occupiers.
This cemetery has already become an object of a kind of ‚Äú patriotic tourism‚Äù .
If you go deep and stand surrounded by auto-keletons, you can feel a heavy smell.
This is probably one of the smells of war.
Heavy, slow air, it seems that it can be cut with a knife.
And weeks have passed since the death of passengers...
If you look through the holes in the car bodies, you can see hundreds more of the same shots.
And in one of the cars there is an abandoned bicycle, in the other  a warm children's overalls.
Somewhere a booklet with instructions for using the airbag is not burned.
Remnants of someone's everyday stories and someone's lives.
We drive on, look back at the city for the last time, and come across the same bridge under which frightened civilians were hiding.
Here is the same overturned bus, but it was on these broken plates that the Ukrainian military carried a baby in white.
This child in the white jumpsuit probably survived.
But is there a chance that a child who wore clothes abandoned in one of the cars is also alive?
On the torn bridge sits a man, a camera over his shoulder, sitting on the torn bridge.
Just sitting and looking at the abyss between Kyiv and Bucha.
He does not take pictures, but only looks at them.
Perhaps he also imagines that he is standing under the bridge, and thinks: how it is?
"Happy holidays! ‚Äú - the man exclaims to us happily. ‚Äú Happy City Day‚Äù ‚Äú
On May 29, the military Kyiv celebrated its 1540th anniversary.
Ukrainian, Strong and Independent.
Mykolaiv.
The hero city, the outpost of the Ukrainian South and my hometown.
A front-line city that the occupiers still cannot capture.
And we believe that they will not seize it  the city is at war and lives.
At the corner of streets, at every second intersection, tires and Bandera stripes are neatly folded together.
Evening Mykolaiv is now incredibly quiet  the noise against which the city lived has subsided against the background of which the city lived.
No voices, no cars in the evenings, no cars.
And at night it is extremely dark.
Light masking for safety purposes.
People live ‚Äú by candlelight‚Äù, more precisely, by the flashlights of mobile phones.
At home, we turn on the lights only in the kitchen  quickly and as needed  quickly and as needed.
Grandma covered the windows with heavy blankets, through which light does not break through the light.
There is a hunting rifle by my sister's childhood bed.
"At hand since the 24th, " says the father, " says the father.
With air raid alarms and sounds of explosions, we hide in the garage or go down to the basement to the basement.
But not every time, now.
Even in the frontline city, it is very difficult to live in constant alarms.
When then to live?
Russian army  30 kilometers from the city, shots from the ‚Äú peony‚Äù reach the Zhovtnevy district, cover Kulbakyne.
He flies close to my relatives several times.
To the next block, across the street from us.
To my grandmother's neighbors - my grandmother's windows were taken out, the children took them to their home, to a safer area, to a safer area.
And we are on the border of Ingul and Central districts.
Life goes on.
A siren is howling on the central Cathedral Street, and an elderly couple is sitting on a bench, talking about something, calmly discussing it, and that's how they discuss it.
A cyclist passes them by.
Watching with Dad  what will we do?
‚Äú Well... Let‚Äô s go and have some coffee.‚Äù ‚Äú
So we sit on Sobornaya Street ( former Soviet, by the way) in the park near the monument to St. Nicholas's.
And what else to do?
To be honest, when the siren takes you by surprise on the street, there is often no place to hide, there are no open bomb shelters or basements nearby.
I look at the building of the regional state administration, or rather, through it.
This is not just a hole in the building, it is a hole in the heart of every Mykolaiv resident.
On the lawn at the entrance lies a huge trident  once decorated by the Regional State Administration.
Now in the place where the trident flaunted, there was an empty "nothing" left in the place where the trident flaunted.
As well as in the place of the office of the head of the Regional State Administration and a dozen offices around the area.
The rocket landed squarely on Kim's desk.
The war takes on a completely different outline when it is not in the news, but underfoot.
I walk along the corridors of the Regional State Administration, and with each step I hear the crunch of glass.
Numerous documents are scattered on the floor  someone submitted requests and applications, but now it does not matter.
On the table of one of the surviving offices is a dusty cosmetic bag on it.
There is a flower on the bedside table.
They took her home, transplanted her, even if she lives.
We met a guard who was at the post on March 29th.
Survived
"Shut up, sewn up, " he points to his head, pointing at his head. ‚Äú Already at work‚Äù .
Only journalists can enter the Regional State Administration.
Together with us are a couple of journalists from Italy and the BBC.
Photos, live inclusions, interviews, etc.
According to official data, 36 people were killed.
This is "September 11 in Mykolaiv", "a monument to the Russian world", comments the press attach√© of the regional head of the region, commenting.
The Mykolaiv regional state administration is just one of the wounds on the body of Mykolaiv.
And these wounds will not heal soon.
Even when Denmark helps restore the Regional State Administration, Mykolaiv residents will always see it as a terrible emptiness.
Russia has launched a new "gas war"
This time against Europe, which supports Ukraine in the Russian war.
Since the beginning of hostilities, the Russian Federation has reduced gas transit to the EU through the Ukrainian gas transport system by more than a third.
In April, it completely stopped gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland, in May  to Finland.
In June, the Russians significantly reduced gas supplies to European countries through the Nord Stream gas pipeline.
Official Berlin expects that Russia will cut off natural gas supplies by this way already in July.
Russia used such blackmail in Ukraine in 2015, too.
After the Revolution of Dignity, when Ukraine finally chose the European path of development, the Russian Federation cut off gas supplies to Ukrainians within two days.
Gas has always been for Russia not just a commodity, but an element of pressure in political matters.
Russia is not interested in creating healthy economic ties.
For her, the first priority is the desire to recreate the USSR and punish the West.
Financing of the Russian economy is donations to the Third World War.
The coming winter will be difficult, but it will allow Europe to become independent of Russian gas.
European countries are already accelerating the transition to alternative energy sources and are trying to quickly diversify gas and oil supplies.
But in order to become energy independent of Russian energy, the EU needs time.
Meanwhile, Putin's regime intimidates Europe with an inevitable energy crisis and lack of heating in homes.
European countries, especially dependent on fuel supplies from Russia, may feel its shortage.
But this crisis will stimulate a more economical attitude towards natural resources and increase energy efficiency.
Europe will benefit when it abandons Russian energy.
Because then Putin will not be able to use gas and oil as a geopolitical weapon.
Temporary discomfort should be endured so that the next generations of Europeans do not have to die in a new war with Russia.
Russia is burning crops in Ukrainian fields.
The Russian army uses ignition shells that destroy ripe crops of grain and oilseeds.
By doing so, Russia is causing the spread of hunger in the world.
Due to the Russian war, the number of people in the world suffering from food shortages could increase by more than 40 million.
Simultaneously with the destruction of Ukrainian crops, Russians steal already harvested grain from Ukrainian elevators, destroy agricultural infrastructure, block sea exports, and block sea exports.
The destruction of Ukraine's agricultural potential is another manifestation of Russia's military aggression.
So Russia wants to further weaken the Ukrainian economy and increase pressure on the world economy.
We need more sanctions against Russia so that it cannot continue to kill people and blackmail the world.
The Ministry of Digital Affairs launches an innovative hotline format  the Diia virtual center Business.
Internally displaced persons from Ukraine in European countries often face a lack of information about the rules and procedures for registering their own stay, registering a business, finding employment, and receiving assistance.
Therefore, the Diia virtual center is being launched. Business in order to provide all the necessary answers remotely until Ukrainians can return home.
It's scary how you have to be afraid of every important day, and more than ever you know the day or the minute that may come.
Good afternoon, Hanna, can I ask you to call the pediatrician back and ask when the next time you can come for vaccination for Darus.
It was supposed to be tomorrow, I can't come because I need to replace the battery in the car, it will be by the end of the week.
A neighbor brought a cable and we charged it from Marina's car.
But on the panel of the car writes, you need to replace the battery and replace it.
My husband bought a battery and on Wednesday Anastasia has to bring it from Ukraine, and here it will be replaced for me.
I will try to start the car tomorrow, if it works, we will go by ourselves, I will leave my grandmother in the car and I will not turn off the engine.
If I do not start, then I will write to you and you will come for us.
It is very inconvenient for me to bother you, to distract you from work.
Okay, let's go with you at 11:45 so as not to risk it.
‚Äú The war is not over yet, and the fates of our new neighbors are also becoming our reality.
We hear stories of escaping to safety, stories of mothers telling their children about the great adventure journey they embark on together, to put them in hastily loaded cars.
Stories of children who feel insecure and afraid of all adults who still do not quite understand why their parents stayed at home.
Stories of children for whom the only memory of the house is a toy that they could cling to during the many hours spent on crowded trains surrounded by strange, inexplicably sad people, the organizers emphasize, - emphasizes the organizers.
At the end of each trip, there is a return to a safe home.
But this trip is different, scarier.
This trip did not end even after more than eight months.
Return home is expected.
The theme of war is omnipresent, so our walk may seem superfluous.
On the contrary, in the face of increasing antipathies and hostile sentiment in society, which are fueled and exploited by the populists, we want to point out that peaceful travelers are still among us.
We want to give them the opportunity to tell their story in a poetic form and thus apply to participate in this celebration of Czech civil society.
Now they are part of it"
Despite such a painful theme, the parade still managed to make it bright and encouraging.
This was done by craftsmen and craftswomen who, together with children and adults, created costumes and masks of huge toys, sunflowers, wagons, houses and amazing birds that shine and shine with amazing birds.
The parade was held from Kampa to Vaclavak, and at each stop a huge performance was played, the drama of which was developed by the Ukrainian playwright and writer Oksana Maslova.
"It was very important for me to preserve the bright idea of the parade and at the same time show what Ukrainians are facing now, " says the playwright. - Therefore, the structure of the performance reflects a normal life that is interrupted by an air attack.
Glowing birds are the first to come to the rescue  they cover children with their wings in the first place, covering children with their wings in the first place.
And after the recent large-scale missile attack, this symbol of defending wings becomes even more realistic.
Children's voices begin to sing a Ukrainian song.
This song spreads in a column.
And all creatures came back to life: sunflowers, moths, toys and even houses.
Such symbolism.
I am very grateful to the Czech Republic and every Czech who has helped and is helping Ukraine and Ukrainians.
And I believe that together we can overcome this difficult path and security will reign in homes."
A wife sends her husband to the market for snails for cosmetic skin care.
On the way, a man meets friends and gets into a binge for three days, of course, without coming home, of course, coming home.
Finally, on the third day, he remembers snails, goes to the market, buys snails and comes home.
Thought to tell his wife why he was gone so long.
He rings the doorbell, pours snails on the floor, his wife opens it, he, driving them with his hands, says:
Well, they came from here.
We go in, we go in, we go in, we go in.
Our editorial staff spoke with Ukrainian refugee Marina, who worked in the field of architecture of buildings and structures in her native Nikopol.
" Now I am trying to realize myself as an artist, " said the Ukrainian woman.
Anxiety, uncertainty, fear, worries for relatives.
In a conversation with Marina, a refugee from Ukraine, one can see the confusion about adapting to the new conditions in which she found herself with her children together.
But the woman believes in herself and tries to adapt to life in Prague, without giving up the idea of returning to Ukraine.
From Nikopol to Prague.
Marina is from Nikopol, Dnipropetrovsk region.
It was there that she met her husband and gave birth to two children  a son and a daughter.
She worked as an architect in the Nikopol State Institution.
‚Äú By education, I am an architect of buildings and structures, graduated from the Dnipropetrovsk Academy of Architecture with a red diploma.
Before that, she studied at an art school, graduated from the lyceum with a degree in "artist-designer", "said Marina.
And everything was fine, but on February 24, her life changed.
Like millions of Ukrainians fleeing the onslaught of Russian aggression in Ukraine, Marina, without thinking, left Ukraine with her children.
Prague became a refuge for women.
‚Äú Of course, a new city, big, crowded... A new language, but Czech is very similar to Ukrainian, so I understand a lot of what the Czechs say to me, I understand the Czech, I understand a lot of what the Czechs say.
Knowledge of English and sign language also came in handy.
In addition, I am not ashamed to seek help from the Czechs and have never felt any aggression from them.
I thank them for that,‚Äù Marina shared.
According to her, in solving issues related to finding housing, obtaining a visa and insurance, submitting documents for benefits, she was helped by people who have been living in Prague for a long time.
But she has to solve many problems on her own.
Lack of space in the kindergarten.
Having received a tolerated stay visa, Marina dreamed of finding a job.
‚Äú Of course, I want to find a job in my specialty.
But when employers find out that I have two children, they throw up their hands...‚Äù she said, ‚Äú she said.‚Äù
‚Äú They didn't take us to kindergarten, because there are no places to live.
They say that it is necessary to look for adaptation groups for children, and where they are, no one specifically knows what they are.
I met a girl who speaks Czech well.
She sought to help me find a place in the kindergarten for children, calling a number of different authorities, but...‚Äù, continues Marina, continuing.
"In general, I am very concerned about the condition of my children, it is difficult for them to adapt to new conditions, they have become capricious and disobedient, they have become capricious and disobedient.
I can't say that children interfere with me, but if they went to kindergarten, I would be able to safely attend Czech language courses.
One day I went with the little ones to classes in Czech, so they played a little, and then they began to behave restlessly, and then they began to behave restlessly.
I, like a normal mother, was distracted, could not study normally... If there were language courses for adults with children or with children, someone was during the training... But my daughter is so attached to me, "the woman sighs, "the woman sighs, "as if there were language courses for adults with children or with children."
"Of course, together with our children, we go to various free events that are created specifically for refugees from Ukraine, for which we are very grateful, " added Marina, "the Czech Republic, "added.
When children sleep, Marina is engaged in self-education, learns Czech online, because she understands that this will help her find a job and somehow organize herself in a foreign country.
In support of Ukraine, in support of Ukraine.
Once Marina was browsing vacancies on the Internet and saw an ad: ‚Äú As part of the initiative of the Association ‚Äú Spolek Zaedno‚Äù with the support of the EC Delegation in the Czech Republic ‚Äú 12 Stars for Ukraine‚Äù, we organize a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague. We organize a one-day art workshop in the House of National Minorities in Prague.
We are looking for Ukrainian artists, we offer brushes, paints, paints, etc.
All that is required of the participants is creative imagination..."
Marina could not help but take advantage of this opportunity.
‚Äú I gathered courage and applied for participation.
Everyone was invited to a meeting where we painted all day long.
Before that, I didn't sleep, I was worried.
Besides, I haven't picked up a brush for six years, " the Ukrainian said, "the Ukrainian woman said.
During the creative meeting, 14 large-format acrylic paintings on canvas measuring 80 x 60 cm were created, including 12 paintings by Ukrainian artists - works of Ukrainian artists.
‚Äú The subject of the paintings was free, but we still agreed that we would use Ukrainian themes in our works  we chose the colors of the Ukrainian flag as the basis of the palette.
Therefore, blue and yellow colors prevail in the collection of paintings, " added Marina, adding.
The event was attended by 30 applicants, of which only 12 were chosen, and only 12 were chosen.
Marina was among them.
On June 1, an exhibition of paintings will be held in Prague with their participation, with the support of the EU Delegation to the Czech Republic.
‚Äú This is how it happens in life.
All your once acquired knowledge and skills can be useful, and also support our Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees in the Czech Republic,‚Äù said Marina.
"And now I'm trying to realize myself as an artist.
Every step is a struggle with your fears and yourself.
But we have to do something...‚Äù the woman said.
Marina owes the Czech Republic for its hospitality and hospitality, but believes that the war will end quickly, and she and her children will return to Ukraine with her children.

War destroys everything it touches.
And Ukraine will need a lot of time to fully recover from the full-scale war that Russia started.
However, Ukrainians do not expect better times, but have already begun to clear their cities and villages of Russian garbage, rebuilding infrastructure, rebuilding infrastructure.
Kyiv region took a blow in the first days of the full-scale war, when the Russian occupiers wanted to break into the capital in a few days and capture it.
These cities and villages survived active hostilities, atrocities of the Russian army, in some places - occupation.
In early April, the Armed Forces of Ukraine completely liberated the region from the enemy.
Photographer Oleksiy Khomenko collected photos from Kyiv and the region, taken immediately after the active hostilities and a few weeks later, to show how Ukrainians are restoring their homes and public space.

Any response to the aggressor country by the Ukrainian military is justified.
After the failure of the plan to quickly seize Ukraine, Russia began a new stage of this war  an information war.
Russia is trying to force the world to change its view of the Russian war and reduce international support for Ukraine.
International organizations evaluate the actions of Ukrainian defenders instead of helping the Armed Forces fight the aggressor, and thus become accomplices in the Russian information war.
For example, a well-known human rights organization noted in its report: the Ukrainian military is arranging positions on the territory of civilian infrastructure facilities.
At the same time, she ignored the fact that we are talking only about objects from where the civilian population has been completely evacuated.
Do not succumb to information attacks of the Russian Federation.
Remember: Russia attacked Ukraine, seizes its territories, kills and tortures civilians, destroys cities and villages, and destroys cities and villages.
The Russian Federation is guilty of the war, it has no right to any actions on the territory of another country.
Ukrainian soldiers have the right to defend their land and expel the enemy from the occupied territories.
Help Ukraine withstand Russia on all fronts.
I'm sure every person in the world has ever dreamed of their perfect home.
Believe me or not, I am no exception, I am no exception.
Now let me tell you about my ideal home.
My ideal home would be on an island in the tropics.
It would be next to the beach and have a huge balcony overlooking the ocean.
I will definitely be happy to live in the heart of picturesque landscapes.
My house would be a two-storey cottage with a wonderful exotic garden in front of the house, and there would be many different flowers and fruit trees there.
I will also have a garage for my car.
By car, I'll be able to go to work, shop, or just travel with my family wherever our eyes take us.
My ideal home will have at least six rooms: a bright and spacious kitchen, a large bathroom, two cozy bedrooms, an office with a workplace and a spacious living room.
The bedrooms will have large comfortable beds with bedside tables and chests of drawers.
In the office there will be many interesting books in bookcases.
The living room will become the most visited place in the house, where the whole family could get together, share news or just have fun.
That's why there would be a large sofa with small cushions, several armchairs, a wardrobe, a huge TV and a long built-in aquarium.
Also, my ideal home would have an attic where we could make a home theater or entertainment room.
Behind my house would be a pool with some hammocks.
We will also have a sports center where we could do exercises every day to keep fit or just practice different team sports such as volleyball, basketball, football, etc.
My ideal home would be big and cozy, beautiful and beautiful.
I would really like to live in it.
But this is just my dream... I have to make it a reality.
Hello, and how many people there should be so that I know which room to prepare. Is she alone?
I handed the letters to you by the secretary.
Yes, of course, I also ask how many of them to know where to settle them.
Clearly, you tell me right away what I would know.
To have time to clean the room.
Tell me how you can send a parcel to Ukraine daughter-in-law on the 6th has to give birth and probably needs our help, she is now left alone at such a time, I cannot leave her without support, then my only granddaughter can leave her without support, then my only granddaughter will be born.
Products, diapers.
It's just that on June 6, I lay down for safekeeping.
I was released from the maternity hospital for only 10 days.
I did not have time to buy everything for the child.
There is no bedding yet, a blanket cover.
Yes, they should know, I hope that they will find the main thing not to panic, because now I don't know what to do, I'm ready to go and search myself, but I won't be allowed to Donetsk, there are heavy battles there now, and I don't know how it will be with the search, it's hard, because now I don't know what to do, I'm ready to go and find myself, but I won't be allowed to go to Donetsk, it's hard, and I don't know, I'm not going to find it.
So the last words I heard from him that I was a worker and it was good that I took my sisters and brothers away that they were safe.
I have to hold on, children are what keeps me going, they are my hope and support, I have nothing but them for me, they are everything, I am happy that I have them.
My whole body is stiff, I don't feel anything good at all, that even though I can walk with me, this has never happened to me.
So thank you I can't go there today another time I need to calm down and gather my thoughts a lot.

The parties confirmed that it was a fight on the territory of a local hotel, where both teams accidentally settled.
Initially, Ukrainian and Russian media wrote about the conflict that occurred on February 13, Ukrainian and Russian media wrote.
Then the fight was confirmed by both clubs.
According to the official statement of FC Minaj, the conflict was provoked by the Russians.
As if one of them was drunk and clung to the hotel employee, and the Ukrainian player intervened.
" The fight did take place, but already on the floor where the Russians stopped, and in equal warehouses.
The number of victims on the Shinnik side only confirms the fact that the Russians are also "abandoning" their own, " the statement said.
The club says that after the end of the fight, the Russians continued fighting among themselves, the local police had to intervene.
" Before the start of the meeting, the main requirement of FC Minaj to the organizers was the absence of Russian teams in the hotel.
The organizers themselves claim that the hotel agreed to settle Shinnik, " the statement said.
Football journalist Roman Bebeh, who was one of the first to report on the situation on Twitter, posted a photo of a Ukrainian player defending an employee.
The Russian side confirms that there was a fight, but assures that Ukrainians provoked the conflict.
In particular, the Baza Telegram channel writes that representatives of "Minaya" approached the players of Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and began to demand to sing the Ukrainian anthem.
Ukrainians denied this.
" The quantitative advantage was on their side.
Several people attacked our boy.
Yaroslavl residents stood up for him and defended him.
There were five or six of us, there were much more Ukrainians,‚Äù a source close to the Russian club told Kommersant, a source who was close to the Russian club.
As a result, several Russian players were injured.
" Yaroslavl football players were examined by a doctor, among the injuries - a dissection of the lip, a fracture of the toe and a suspicion of bruised ribs, " Kommersant writes, " Kommersant" writes.
"I do not understand where the hotel could have come from Ukrainians, because when we booked the hotel, there was a condition that there would be no teams from Ukraine, " Shinnyk general director Sergey Kulakov was indignant in a comment to journalists.
Kulakov later told Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that the Russians were leaving the hotel, but stressed that they were not evicted, they decided to leave on their own.

Russia launched a major offensive in Luhansk region - ISW- DW- 09 - 08. 02 2023
Russian troops have launched a major offensive in the Luhansk region, according to the American Institute for the Study of War ISW.
The pace of Russian operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line in the west of the region has increased significantly over the past week, analysts said in a February 8 report by analysts.
It also notes that geolocation footage of the fighting confirmed Russian offensive successes in the area of Dvoryny northwest of Svatovo.
The Armed Forces of Ukraine do not allow the Russian Federation to achieve significant success.
According to experts, the involvement of significant parts of at least three large Russian divisions in offensive operations in this sector indicates that the Russian offensive has begun, even if Ukrainian forces have not yet allowed Russian troops to achieve significant success.
ISW suggests that the Russian offensive has not yet gained full momentum, the Russian command has not yet activated parts of the 2nd Motorized Rifle Division ( 1st Guards Tank Army, Western Military District), which was deployed to Luhansk region in January after deployment in Belarus in January after deployment in Belarus.
" Although Russian forces in the Luhansk region now have the initiative ( in the sense that Russian forces are setting the conditions of battle, ending the period of the Ukrainian initiative from August 2022), the full involvement of these forces could lead to their final culmination on the Svatove-Kreminna line without achieving the goals of capturing the entire Luhansk and Donetsk regions, " the report says in the report.
Analysts predict that this culmination is likely to create a window of opportunity for Ukrainian forces to use for their own counteroffensive.
At the same time, in the morning summary, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine reported that the Russian troops, trying to take full control of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine, continue to focus their main efforts on conducting offensive operations in five directions: Kup to Yansky, Limansky, Bakhmut, Avdiivka and Novopavlivka in the districts of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Mar"inka and Vuhledarar in the districts of Kreminna, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Opytne, Mar"inka and Vuhledar and Vuhledararar.

We know that the military uses it for communication, and that's okay.
But we never wanted them to use it for offensive purposes, " Reuters quoted the director as saying.

Exactly what measures the company took, she refused to clarify.
SpaceX "bargained" with the US Department of Defense for Starlink for Ukraine.
Immediately after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, SpaceX gave Kiev free Starlink systems to provide the population with the Internet.
However, in September, SpaceX told the US Department of Defense ( Pentagon) that it could no longer continue funding Starlink in Ukraine and asked to take over the issue.
At the time, it estimated the required funding by the end of 2022 at $120 million, and over the next 12 months at about $400 million over the next 12 months, at about $400 million.
The issue of securing funding was discussed at the political level, both in Ukraine and the United States, and in the European Union, but soon the owner of the company Musk said that SpaceX withdrew its request to the US defense department to take over the costs.
In December 2022, Ukraine agreed with SpaceX to receive thousands of additional Starlink antennas.

Ukraine wants a ban on the tour of Russian artists in the EU- DW- 14 02 2023
Ukraine collects data on Russian cultural figures who actively promote the policies of Russian President Vladimir Putin, support Russia's war against Ukraine or work in institutions and organizations financed from the state budget of the Russian Federation in order to include them in the new package of EU sanctions.
Deputy Minister of Culture and Information Policy of Ukraine Halyna Hryhorenko said in an interview with DW.
Culture as Russia's weapon.
According to Hryhorenko, Russia uses culture to promote its militaristic aggressive policy and justify the war it is waging in Ukraine.
" Culture is Russia's strategic weapon.
For example, in one of his interviews, ‚Äú the director of the Russian Hermitage Museum very clearly says that the museum's exhibition projects abroad are their special operation,‚Äù says Hryhorenko.
In her opinion, now dialogue through culture with Russia is impossible.
Therefore, Ukrainian artists often refuse to perform on the same stage in European countries with Russian artists, poets, musicians, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine, explained the Deputy Minister of Culture of Ukraine.
Thus, recently the choir of the National Opera of Ukraine and the orchestra of the National Philharmonic of Ukraine refused to perform on the same stage with the Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko, who in 2012 was registered as a confidant of Vladimir Putin in his election campaign, and in 2014 supported the actions of pro-Russian militants of the so-called ‚Äú DPR‚Äù in the Donbas.

EU sanctions will officially deprive Russian artists of the opportunity to tour.
However, according to Hryhorenko, this is not enough and those representatives of the culture of the Russian Federation who support Putin's policy still manage to tour in Europe.
"In order to officially cancel such tours, you need to have surnames on the European sanctions lists, " says Hryhorenko and adds: "We are working to ensure that cultural figures of the Russian Federation who promote Russian narratives outside Russia become part of the next sanctions package.
This will make it possible on the territory of the EU to officially ban their economic activities, including concerts."
According to Hryhorenko, this issue in Ukraine is handled by the Ministry of Economy, the National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption, the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and a special working group under the Office of the President of Ukraine.
As previously reported, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a joint press conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Brussels on February 9 noted that he had asked her to impose sanctions against Russian propagandists at a summit in Kyiv.
She promised that many propagandists would be included in the sanctions list of the tenth package.

Duda also stressed that combat aircraft, like the F-16, have a " very serious need for maintenance, " so "it's not enough just to send a few aircraft."

‚Äú I have heard from some European leaders about their readiness to provide us with the necessary weapons, including aviation, which are necessary for us.
Now I have a series of bilateral negotiations, we will raise the issue of fighters and other aviation.
Therefore, we continue our work here in Brussels, " Zelensky said.
As Voice of America reported, last week Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said that his country was ready to transfer its F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine in "full coordination" with NATO countries.
And last month, Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said his government would consider Kyiv's request for the F-16.
At the beginning of the month, US President Joe Biden denied the supply of F-16 aircraft from the United States, but Western experts believe that these aircraft could come to Ukraine from European countries.
In particular, observers point out that previously, weapons that the United States refused to supply eventually entered Ukraine if it was agreed to be transferred by European NATO allies.
The Ukrainian military began training on Leopard 2 in Germany and Poland.
Chisinau, Moldova ( AP) .
On Monday, the Moldovan president announced Moscow's conspiracy to use external saboteurs to overthrow the country's government, put the country "at Russia's disposal" and disrupt its aspirations to join the European Union.
President Maia Sandu's briefing came a week after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said his country had intercepted plans by Russian special services to destroy Moldova, which was later confirmed by Moldovan intelligence officials.
"The plan for the next period involves the involvement of saboteurs with military training, camouflaged in civilian clothes, who will resort to force, attack some government buildings and even take hostages, " Sandu told reporters at a briefing, " Sandu told reporters at a briefing.
"The purpose of these actions is to overthrow the constitutional order, to change the legitimate power of Chisinau to illegitimate, " Sandu said, "which would put our country at Russia's disposal and stop the process of European integration."
She promised: ‚Äú The Kremlin's attempts to bring violence to our country will not succeed,‚Äù she said.
Russian officials did not respond to Sandu's statements.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moldova, a former Soviet republic of about 2.6 million people, has sought closer relations with its Western partners.
In June last year, she received the status of a candidate for the European Union, the same day as Ukraine, on the same day as Ukraine.
Sandu said that between October and December, Moldovan police and the Intelligence and Security Service ( SIS) intervened in ‚Äú several cases of organizing criminal elements and stopped attempts at violence‚Äù .
Over the past year, Moldova, which is not a NATO member, has faced a number of problems.
These include a serious energy crisis after Moscow sharply cut gas supplies; rapid inflation; as well as several incidents in recent months involving missiles that crossed airspace and debris that has been found on its territory.
Moldovan authorities confirmed that another missile from the war in Ukraine entered its airspace on Friday.
Sandu said Russia wanted to use Moldova in the war against Ukraine and that the information obtained by the intelligence services contained what she called instructions on the rules of entry into Moldova for citizens of Russia, Belarus, Serbia, and Montenegro.
‚Äú I assure you that government agencies are working to prevent these challenges and keep the situation under control,‚Äù Sandu said.
She said Moldova's parliament should pass bills to provide the Intelligence and Security Service as well as the prosecutor's office "with the necessary tools to more effectively deal with risks to the country's security."
The president added that the plan would "rely on several internal forces, but especially on criminal groups, " and continued the names of two Moldovan oligarchs, Ilan Shor and Volodymyr Plahotniuc, both of whom are now in exile.
Last year, both men were sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom.
Last fall, a series of mass anti-government protests organized by Shor's populist, Russia-friendly party also rocked Moldova amid the energy crisis.
The president's press briefing on Monday came after Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita resigned on Friday.
On the same day, Sandu appointed her defense and security adviser, pro-Western economist Dorin Rechan, to succeed Gavrilita.
On Friday, after Moldovan authorities confirmed the missile incident, US State Department deputy spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters in Washington that "Russia has supported influence and destabilization campaigns in Moldova for years, which often involve the use of corruption as a weapon to achieve its goals."

Stories from the war: The Grandma with the Red Flag threw him away when she found out about Bucha.
An employee of the Center for Strategic Communications found the same woman.
A living symbol of the "Russian Ukraine", a female, in the version of Russian propaganda, "courageously resisted the nationalists", in fact, I am grateful to the Ukrainian military, who not only support it with products, but also protect it from the wrath of the Hereditary Harkians.
Anna Ivanovna explains that she went with a red flag to, as she thought, the Russian military, that they ‚Äú did not call into the country‚Äù .
And in the aggressor country, her motives have twisted, which is why she now feels like a "traitor", which is why she feels like a "traitor".
She is currently staying in one of the city hospitals in Kharkiv together with her husband.
In the military, they urge not to disrespect the young woman.
"Now that Anna Ivanovna has received a mine in her yard from the Russians, and help from the Ukrainians, her grandson is fleeing in Poland, when she learned about Bucha and everything else, she threw that red flag away, " says the platoon commander from the pseudo Cadet.

Weapons and military equipment removed from storage in the Western, Central, Eastern Military Districts and the Northern Fleet are being transferred by rail to the border areas with Ukraine.
Details: In the Volyn and Polissya directions, the enemy did not carry out active actions.
There have been no significant changes in the situation in these areas.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to cover the border in the Brest and Gamle regions.
There is still a threat of missile strikes by the enemy on military and civilian infrastructure throughout Ukraine from the territory of the Republic of Belarus, as well as provocations by the enemy on the specified section of the state border of Ukraine.
We abandon Soviet weapons and switch to NATO models  Zaluzhny  Zaluzhny
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhnyi held a telephone conversation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States General Mark Milley, during which he announced the transition to NATO weapons.
Source: General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Direct language of Zaluzhnyi: ‚Äú We also discussed with my American colleague a promising model of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Obviously, we are forced to abandon Soviet weapons and equipment and switch to NATO models.
And the sooner we start this process, the sooner we will complete it.
I also informed General Milley about the difficult situation in the east of our country, in particular in the Islamic and Severodonetsk directions, where the enemy has concentrated maximum efforts and the most combat-ready groups.
Despite all the complexity of the situation, we provide defense, keep occupied borders and positions."
‚Äú The one who invented this hellish summer was clearly out of his mind,‚Äù he said. complained Wild groom and stretched out her hands in front of her, as if she wanted to reach for the ghostly coolness.
"You say the same thing every time, " Varta remarked indifferently, stirring the ice in the cocktail, stirring the ice in the cocktail. "Autumn" because it rains and fogs, grasses rot.
In winter, because it is cold and the potion freezes out.
In the spring, because it rains again.
‚Äú I would sit in my Carpathians,‚Äù Varta twitched her shoulders indifferently.
Although she didn't particularly like the city either.
It dissolved all the beauty of its past in haste and bustle.
The girl liked to imagine familiar streets calm, quiet and greener, like a hundred years ago or even earlier.
But there is no such magic that would allow you to return to the past.
Phah, please don‚Äô t worry about it
You say that. The wild plant slapped her palm on the table,  and the vases with flowers shyly turned green. "I would sit for a week in the meadow with my grandmother Rutmer and her classmates, praying for every truck passing that you would only be taken away from there to any town or city."

Because of such films, most people think that women go into prostitution for a " beautiful" life, and that they like this kind of "job", that it is their conscious choice, and so on.
But if you start to really understand this topic, it becomes scary.
Now the problem of involvement of Ukrainian women in prostitution is particularly acute.
There is a problem.
Our current president even had the idea of legalizing prostitution.   that's why I didn't treat him very well
I think that it is necessary to adopt the experience of Sweden, there is a kind of" Swedish model" there.
At the same time, they do not order the woman, but the client, who is ordered.
Women are helped to get out of this "business", and to make it legal.
Legalization does not mean security and social guarantees at all.
I hope that the civilized world will support the Swedish model, because there is no hope for anything anymore.
Men should also think about what they buy - "pleasure" or violence.
There‚Äô s a need for something else,   you can see me where the nearest optics are with a doctor to write a prescription for glasses.
And you need to buy a high-quality frame.   I looked at some sites with frames, I was pleasantly impressed - it is cheaper here than in Ukraine.
I ordered glasses 2 years ago, paid about $300 for them, the frame was of an average level ( or even lower)
I don't know what frames are in stores, but prices in online stores are quite normal.
But, as for some cosmetics, I can say for sure that it is more expensive here.
A lot of shit.
Our multifocal lenses with glasses are very expensive ( this when compared to our average wages) .
Given the budget of our family ( especially the fact that it is necessary to rent housing), then $300 for glasses, then a rather high amount is quite high.
Doctors did not offer you an artificial multifocal crystal.
I used soft contact lenses for 10 years, then lens intolerance began, a year after that I wore hard lenses, a strong allergy to almost all cosmetics began.
I have been wearing glasses constantly for 4 years, I wear lenses very rarely, I rarely wear lenses.
Yes, I also read that covid affects vision.
Also, after 40 years, there is a need for reading glasses.
My mother was offered multifocal glasses, the price was more than 1000 dollars, so very expensive, then very expensive.
Yes, glasses are now fashionable.
I asked one doctor why he does not wear lenses or will not make a laser correction for himself, so he replied that glasses are stylish) .
For a pensioner with a pension of UAH 1, 500, this amount is unrealistic.
My glasses now mask wrinkles.
Yes, it is.
My mother has little work experience.
She worked little: first, small children who often get sick, then she took care of her grandmother.   so the state gave her a minimum pension
The father receives 3800 hryvnias, has 40 years of experience.
My salary was about 8000 hryvnias and all these funds had to be paid for renting housing.
In good times ( before Covid) there were premiums, but with the onset of quarantine, there were no orders for testing plant material from farmers.
Therefore, many Ukrainians go to work abroad to provide for their family or buy a map, but then they lose contact with their family.
Yes, there are advantages.

According to the order from the date of its official publication, the seaports of Berdyansk, Mariupol, Skadovsk, Kherson are closed until control over these seaports is restored.
It is indicated that the adoption of such a decision is due to the impossibility of servicing ships and passengers, ensuring an adequate level of navigation safety and environmental protection during Russia's military operations in these regions that pose a threat to human life and health.
The Russian Federation uses a troll factory to spread disinformation about the war in Ukraine and foreign politicians.
According to an URL correspondent, Reuters writes about it, referring to the statement of the British Foreign Ministry, citing the statement of the British Foreign Ministry.
The UK Foreign Office said on Sunday that Russia is using a troll factory to spread disinformation on social media about the war in Ukraine and politicians in certain countries, including: Great Britain and South Africa, " the article says.
It is noted that these conclusions were reached by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the basis of an expert study.
"The department said that this study revealed exactly how the Kremlin's disinformation campaign works, aimed at manipulating international public opinion on the invasion of Ukraine, strengthening its support and attracting new sympathizers, " writes Reuters.
According to the study, the troll factory "used Telegram to attract and coordinate new supporters, who subsequently acted against Kremlin critics, casting them with comments in support of President Putin and his war."
Among the targets of this factory were British ministers and other world leaders.
‚Äú Traces of the operation were found in eight social networks, including: Telegram, Twitter, Facebook and TikTok,‚Äù the message said.
British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said her government had already "warned international partners and will continue to work closely with allies and media platforms to disrupt Russian information operations ‚Äù
‚Äú We cannot allow the Kremlin and its shadow troll factories to invade our online spaces with lies about Putin's illegal war,‚Äù Truss concluded.
Ivanna, now I will explain to you,
You have such a hair structure that all hair is almost the same length.
There are very few short layers.
To achieve the smoothest possible result, you need to either do hair thinning.
But this will greatly affect the density of the hair.
That's why I didn't do that.
Or do staining the roots to make the transition smoother.
At your request, I also did not paint the roots.
Therefore, the transition can be a bit abrupt.
I can fuse the transition for you, but you will need to decorate the roots.
The roots will be dyed to your color, so when the hair grows back, you will not notice the difference.
Regarding the quality of the hair,
Unfortunately, any discoloration affects the quality of the hair.
Hair may become drier, that's normal because it's blonde.
Without loss of quality, it is impossible to make such a blonde.
If you do the right hair care, the condition of the hair will return to normal.
Please write what Matrix care you use.
Maybe he's too weak for a blonde for that.
We can sign up for free toning to make a smoother transition.
In this photo, the transition is also quite sharp.
Because a large percentage of blond hair is in the root zone.
Please write when you could drive up so I can take a look at it.
If we do toning, it will take about three hours for us.
There is a lot of positivity from what I do at my job.
I help people - this is the most important thing and I wanted it.
Let it be in this way, but this is a help to people whom almost no one in the world helps at all and will not say ‚Äú good day‚Äù with a smile of heart.
I found excellent basic lessons of learning Czech on the Internet today.
Here in the morning I clean the rooms where the homeless sleep, at this time I am alone and the doors to these 3 rooms are closed.
I listen to these lessons with headphones and repeat after the lecturer.
On the other hand, I speak to myself, but it's good that at this time no one sees or hears meüòÖ I think I can learn the language in such a way as to learn the language every day.
So another huge positive of this work is learning the language in headphones and in practice directly when communicating with colleagues üôÇ.
Over the past hundred years, Russia has conducted 31 military campaigns.
Its longest period of peace lasted 12 years: between the attack on Hungary in 1956 and the attack on Czechoslovakia in 1968-
Russia borders 14 countries.
She attacked 10 of them.
Most of the modern territory of Russia was once occupied by nomadic tribes, which significantly influenced the formation of the cultural background of Russians.
The cult of invasion and raids has been successful throughout Russia's history: in the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and then 20 years under Putin's regime.
These cultural features have shaped state institutions that cultivate the politics of hatred and imperialism.
Most Russians approve of wars of conquest because they believe that their country is the greatest and has the right to attack other states.
The Russians have not yet fully felt the consequences of economic sanctions.
Their standard of living has not deteriorated enough to provoke mass protest movements within the Russian Federation.
Therefore, demand tougher sanctions to encourage Russians to change their country from within.
Russia poses the threat of a new Chernobyl and Fukushima.
The Russian military is shelling and seizing nuclear power plants on the territory of Ukraine.
The Chernobyl nuclear power plant was de-energized.
They fired from tanks and took control of the Zaporizhzhia NPP, the largest in Europe, the largest in Europe.
Russian missiles were also recorded over the South Ukrainian NPP in the Mykolaiv region.
By its actions, Russia violates Article 15 of the Geneva Convention, which prohibits attacking nuclear power plants.
Hitting a missile, overheating of a reactor or spent fuel due to failures in the supply of electricity and water can lead to radiation leakage.
There are 15 nuclear reactors in Ukraine.
Russia does not have to press the ‚Äú red button‚Äù to cause a catastrophe on a planetary scale.
Support Ukraine  the Russian threat can only be overcome together.
Russians rob Ukrainian farmers and illegally export grain, fuel, agricultural machinery and first harvests from Ukraine.
Such cases were recorded in four regions of Ukraine temporarily occupied by the Russian Federation.
This is a conscious policy of Russia: for example, the local authorities of the Krasnoyarsk Territory decided to "expropriate surplus crops last and this year" from southern Ukraine.
The occupation authorities take away seed from farmers, but at the same time require them to successfully sow in order to then send new crops to Russia.
Prohibits paying taxes to the state budget of Ukraine.
In case of disagreement, threatens with physical violence.
Russia repeats the policy of the USSR of mass robbery of Ukrainian peasants in the late 1920s.
Thus began the Holodomor in 1932-33 and private property on Ukrainian lands was destroyed.
Under the guise of the "liberation War with the Nazis", Russia, in particular, provokes hunger in the occupied territories and destroys Ukraine as a competitor in the international food market.
Do not buy Russian goods.
And demand that your country renounce any cooperation with Russia.
Russian soldiers in the temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine take children hostage.
They force their mothers to visit the locations of the Ukrainian military, for refusal, they threaten to kill their children for refusal.
People are pushed to a tough choice: lose their children or become betrayals to the Motherland and be punished for this.
The Commissioner for Human Rights in Ukraine Lyudmila Denisova has repeatedly reported on the mass abduction of orphans by the aggressor state.
They are taken to the territory of Russia and given to Russian families.
Putin even initiated an amendment to the legislation "to organize an accelerated procedure for the adoption of children from Donbas."
Call on your authorities and the international community to prevent the abduction of Ukrainian children.
I would like Ukraine to join NATO, but I do not like their indecision.
Due to the fact that NATO does not close the sky over Ukraine, thousands are dying.
More than 50, 000 civilians have already been killed.
However, without Western weapons, we would be powerless, but I have to say that they come in insufficient numbers and late.
Nevertheless, we need to become a member of NATO for the sake of our future.
I think that this is beneficial for the alliance itself, because with NATO weapons and 9 years of experience in the war against Russia, our army is the most capable army in Europe.
You knew the Ukrainian was invented how to recharge the "disposable" nlaw anti-tank complex.
I think the Americans will shoot down these warheads at the launch stage.
The Russians deserve the worst and worst that can be imagined.
Therefore, to some extent, I am happy with what is happening.
Because this war has not been going on for 4 months, it began around the 15th century, I can't remember exactly now.
But all these hundreds of years there has been an attempt to make us our slaves.
No sooner does one generation die than another is born and takes the fight.
The Soviet Bolshevik regime was not punished and now they have returned to us again.
This story has already happened, but for the first time Ukraine has allies, so this is our chance to destroy Russia as a state.
In general, it is wild for me to understand that the enemies were right under my house and I saw them.
But because of the transience of events, I did not even have time to comprehend, to reflect on the very fact that there is a war going on and what it means to me.
It's great here, but you need to learn the language and go to work, I will not be able to sit on the maintenance of the Czech state, but the problem is that my husband does not want me to make constant quarrels for work. and it will be necessary to return to Ukraine or we could stay, but he will do everything to ensure that we go back. a very difficult situation.
He does not want us to live here, that's his answer.
Yes, he is glad that we are here, but in order to sit at home all the time, I myself took the children to school and to swim, I ask that we stay here after the war, and he says that we will immediately go home, he will not make us documents, he will not make us documents, he will not make us documents.
I probably will not be able to leave myself if he has a long time to do it, and he may not give permission to take the children to the Czech Republic.
Prolonged beating.
I want to learn to be a hairdresser when the war is over, and then I will tell him to take us to the Czech Republic, if he does not want to, then he will probably have to go to a lawyer. it's too early to do anything now. but here he clearly told us that after the war we immediately go home.
We will go home, but I already know that he will not take us to the Czech Republic, and when we lived in Ukraine, he said that he would take us away)) well, now I know the truth.
So thank you very much. we will get out of the situation, the main thing is that the war ends.   everything will be fine!
No, he doesn‚Äô t have one for sure at the moment, because he doesn‚Äô t have one. I think the reason is that children want a lot in the Czech Republic ask him for toys, then to go to Mac Donald's, scream, run around the house. and he is accustomed to calm down that no one bothers him and doesn't ask for lower ones. and here we came and he's all annoyed and we have to spend money on us and he's very economical and he's very economical. it is better for us to live in Ukraine.
Outside the window of the train, birch trees and fir trees sprinkled with black and white confetti forty, magazines of waterways and commodities were sprinkled, sprinkled with fine gray rain, birch trees and sprinkles.
Comrade Operationist Orlrv lay on the narrow Spartan bed he was accustomed to, for it was no different from the narrow Spartan bed he had at home.
He unwrapped a simple set of seconded people - rye bread and lard wrapped in a gray cloth wrapped in a gray cloth.
Comrade Orlov was unpretentious in food, and in life he was unpretentious, he had long forgotten how people enjoy life and have fun so simply, because he did only what was useful to the country and the world revolution.
Then he bent over the old ruined bag and carefully took out with two palms the crystal dome that glinted dimly in the gray light of the middle band.
‚Äú What do you have, comrade?‚Äù The young cadet, his neighbor, asked frightenedly.

I don't want to just sit around because housing won't be free for long.

A difficult road from Ukraine for three days and a big city where a foreign language scared me very much.
I did not come here to go to cafes and museums in Prague.
And to save lives.

Thank you for the letter, and I express my personal position, which does not always coincide with the opinion of other psychologists from Ukraine.
In my opinion, the issue of removing or not removing the association of Russian psychologists of European associations is very difficult.
Members of the organization may have different opinions about Russia's attack on Ukraine.
But in my opinion, the protection of basic human rights and the right to life is the main thing.
I will give an analogy.
If in the sandbox one child takes a toy from another child, then most likely adults watching the children will try to reconcile the children and after some time the game continues.
If one child in the sandbox begins to hit another in the face with a spatula, then such a child will be isolated for a long time, and no one will play with him.
I also liked the analogy of one Russian colleague-psychologist about the fact that when someone from a neighboring apartment kills someone, they don't put the whole apartment building in prison.
Among Ukrainian psychologists, there are many discussions on the topic of excluding Russian associations from European ones, many feel how much pain that communication with Russian psychologists cannot withstand.
Personally, I also feel a lot of pain and sadness about the war in Ukraine, but I am ready to continue to work with several psychologists from Russia whom I know and share knowledge in order to treat clients' injuries on both sides.
I know Russian psychologists and I have Russian clients who deeply condemn the attack of Russian troops on Ukraine, and who at their level are trying to do many things to develop universal values in Russia.
Therefore, I am definitely in favor of a differentiated approach to different people and different organizations.
I am convinced that in Russia the war is supported by 5-10% of the population, and other figures in opinion polls are drawn by propaganda.
My wife left her homeland Ukraine because there is a war going on there.
The wife had a good job and no matter how hard the war wasn't her, she never left her home.
In order not to sit on the neck in the Czech Republic, my wife is trying to earn money, because once in 2009 she received a certificate of completion of masseuse courses in Ukraine.
In the Czech Republic, too, everyone earns money as much as they can.
Now the only problem is to learn the Czech language.
The wife teaches and works languages and earns for herself and the child for food, kindergarten, bus ticket, mobile communication services for clothes, and earns for herself and the child for food, kindergarten, bus ticket, mobile services for clothes.
And at this time I am defending my homeland.
Thank you for supporting people who understand this.
I thank the Czech Republic for providing shelter to women and children from Ukraine in difficult times. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to advertise my wife's massage services in your community.
The wife earns money on her own because she does not want to live for the taxes of the Czech people.
Thanks.
Thank you very much.
It really helps my wife make money for her family.
Okay, I'll tell my wife.
I understand that many citizens do not understand the situation of Ukrainian people.
Some people smile at my wife's announcement, but my wife offers her services.
My wife in Ukraine was a nurse, I work in the police, but the war has separated us.
It is good that my wife wants to work and earn money and not wait for help from your republic.

Distance learning rules.
If this is not possible due to the introduction of an emergency measure or the introduction of quarantine, it is impossible to do so due to the introduction of an emergency measure.
personal presence of students at school, the school provides interested students with distance education.
If distance learning is ordered at school ( class), students are obliged to do so in this way.
The most important safety rules.
For school and school events, in particular, it is prohibited to bring things that threaten health and safety.
weapons ( including knives), drugs ( drugs), cigarettes and alcohol.
Schools and activities are prohibited from smoking and using alcohol or other drugs.
I really need a person who could act as a translator in a Czech insurance company.
On the way to the Czech Republic, when we were driving in Romania, our car was hit by a Romanian citizen's car.
So now we are dealing with an insurance company to fix the car.
Insurance invited a person who, during the technical inspection of the car, can translate from Czech into Ukrainian or Russian and vice versa.
Tell me, can you help me with a translator?
In particular, I have experience in writing a small scientific paper based on statistical analysis of body parameters of lizards of different ages and sexes in a separate population.
In addition, I also have experience in areas close to my specialty.
In 2020-2021, I participated in the research of the Kharkiv Bat Rehabilitation Center as a volunteer.
In this organization, I helped monitor bat populations in the Kharkiv region, as well as organize wintering for bats that were disturbed by people in the cold season.
In the fall of 2021, I also worked as a tour guide at the Kharkiv Zoo, where I improved my communication skills with the audience and learned to interest others in the topic of biodiversity conservation, which is important to me.
At the Ukrainian university, I also had the opportunity to get acquainted with scientific works on tardigrades, observe their livelihoods under a microscope, and communicate with scientists who study them.
So the option of a deeper study of these and other microscopic organisms also interests me.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed and why the EU does not pay for refugees  analysis from an expert from the EU
Poland and the Czech Republic do not receive assistance for refugees from the EU  this is the most discussed topic at the meetings of the presidents of these two countries.
Andrzej Duda visited the Czech Republic at the invitation of Milo≈° Zeman.
The President of the Czech Republic noted that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Poland has become the main defender of European values and has taken on the solution of many problems.
She provided shelter to 2 million Ukrainians, helped with housing and provided financial assistance.
Approximately 500, 000 people arrived in the Czech Republic.
Ukrainians will never forget such strong support from their neighbors  Poland and the Czech Republic  and will tirelessly thank them.
How Poland is experiencing an unexpected wave of refugees and financial burden, ProUkraine editors asked Yaroslav Kot, coordinator and translator of the Center for Refugees in Lublin.
He is also the founder of the Institute for Global and Regional Analytics, which has a representative office not only in Poland, but also in Canada, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
How Poland helps Ukrainians?
The Czech Republic accepted up to half a million Ukrainians and this significantly affected the life of the Czechs.
There are long queues in labor governments, a significant increase in prices in stores.
What is happening in Poland, where there are millions of Ukrainian refugees.
The Polish government organized itself exceptionally quickly and began to provide assistance when hostilities began.
This was foreseen.
Poland has said in recent months that there will be such a huge problem in Poland.
Even in Ukraine, there were fewer preparations for what would happen, while in Poland they were actively preparing for what would happen in Poland.
For example, in the border regions of Poland with Ukraine even before the start of the war, there were already certain plans where refugees from Ukraine would be accommodated.
In Ukraine, they did not even think that this could happen.
I heard that they were smiling about Poland's fear of refugees.
But it was very deliberate: to prepare for all these events before the start of the war on all these events.
I note that extremely large funds were allocated from the regional and state budgets to help Ukrainians fleeing the bombing, from the Russian aggressor.
First of all, assistance in logistics  movement through the territory of Poland.
There are special trains from Ukraine to Poland, including medical ones, for the wounded and sick, etc.
These are planes moving through the territory of Poland between cities, as well as charter flights to EU countries.
I had experience of cooperation with such flights to Portugal, France, Romania and Spain from Lublin.
Although the city of Lublin is similar in size to Lutsk, and not a millionaire, as some might think.
The transport issue remains extremely important.
In Poland, fare for Ukrainians has been canceled.
They can travel for free on trains and public transportation.
In addition, Poland agreed with German carriers to organize free trains to Germany from several Polish cities.
That is, refugees have the opportunity to get free of charge to the places where they plan to stay where they plan to stay.
The second issue is the accommodation of refugees in facilities provided by local governments.
For the most part, these are closed small school stadiums, complexes where temporary halls with beds are arranged.
It organizes free meals, free medical first aid, and free medical first aid.
Refugees have the opportunity to rest and stay for several days, and already there on the spot they are looking for opportunities to move to some more comfortable conditions.
Large cities of Warsaw, Gdansk, Wroclaw have become very active, where entire Ukrainian quarters have now been created.
The example of Warsaw in general is unique in the sense that they managed to take away from the Russian embassy objects that were abandoned by the residents of this embassy.
Large residential complexes have been in an abandoned state for decades, but the Russians did not let anyone in there, but they did not let anyone there.
Polish local authorities nationalized this, let's say, it was nationalized.
It was taken in favor of Ukrainians, Ukrainian families will live there.
These are apartment buildings that can accommodate 200-300 families at once.
Water and electricity will be supplied there, they are insulated.
In a week or two, refugees from Ukraine can already live there.
The third aspect is social assistance.
After February 24, Poland took a unique step  the Sejm passed, and the Senate approved, a law on fugitives from Ukraine.
According to it, Ukrainian citizens have the right to legally stay in Poland for 18 months for 18 months.
They have the right to work without a work permit, which is mandatory in all EU countries.
This law provides for medical care.
In addition, there is a private fund that has allocated ten million zlotys for free assistance for medicines to Ukrainians.
You just need to write an SMS, get a code to your phone,
And in terms of 5 thousand hryvnias, get free medicines in Poland for free.
Social assistance is three hundred zlotys, which are provided irrevocably to every refugee from Ukraine, regardless of age, regardless of age.
Various funds are distributed, including Caritas and the Red Cross, which provide packages with food, chemistry, clothing and other items.
As the Poles say: ‚Äú Niespotykana skala‚Äù
That is, ‚Äú an event that has no analogues‚Äù .
Such a huge openness.
For the Polish state, these are huge expenses.
To date, the European Union has not allocated a single euro to Poland.
In fact, this is an extremely big blow to the Polish budget.
What is the biggest problem in the adaptation of Ukrainians in Poland?
Language problem.
Questions start from polyclinics, where Ukrainians cannot cope without an interpreter.
Often with complex problems, diseases.
The second problem is schools, where especially high school students also do not give themselves advice at all at the beginning, they cannot understand the terminology.
I note that Ukrainian children often come with a level of knowledge much higher than in the corresponding class.
This often surprises Polish teachers.
Children not only have a good command of English, but in general their level is higher than the class they fall into.
This is also interesting.
That is, the Ukrainian education system is good.
And, in fact, children study well in Ukraine, if they are rated so highly here, they are rated here.
Of course, language is important during employment.
Unfortunately, an employee who worked as a doctor, accountant, lawyer in Ukraine, it is much more difficult to master this work here.
As a lawyer or accountant, I do not know such cases at all.
Doctors are now appearing in certain points, in particular in Lublin, the company has created its own small clinic with Ukrainian doctors.
This is a Polish initiative, where Ukrainian doctors have the opportunity to receive the same Ukrainians on a legal basis.
A language problem is often the reason that prompts families, after a few weeks of being here, to return home.
There are a lot of such cases.
In the last few weeks, we have a whole wave of refugees who fled in the first weeks of the war, now they are returning back.
These are Transcarpathia and the western regions of Ukraine, where there are no such active military actions.
Here they did not get used to it, did not find work, did not find a job.
Where they live, conditions do not meet their needs and, accordingly, they will be more comfortable returning home.
This is also one such problem that has arisen in recent weeks.
How the attitude towards Ukrainians has changed?
According to the Ambassador of Ukraine to the Czech Republic, significant changes have taken place.
If earlier Czech society considered Ukrainians exclusively labor migrants, now it is proud of the resilience of Ukrainians who defend their country.
How do Poles treat millions of Ukrainian refugees?
Poland has a similar situation.
Here, all television channels often quote the statement of the President of Poland Lech Kaczynski, who tragically died in Smolenskyi.
When Russia attacked Georgia, along with President Yushchenko and other heads of state, he was in Tbilisi.
There he said a significant phrase that Russian aggression probably will not stop in Georgia, and then there may be Ukraine.
Then there can be the Baltic countries, it can reach Poland as well.
That is, he would have foreseen it if he had foreseen it.
In fact, Ukrainians are now defending Poland with their blood, their devotion, their heroic deeds.
Poland and the Poles appreciate this, so they open their homes, help Ukrainian refugees so selflessly, and help Ukrainian refugees.
They see a threat in Poland.
Despite the fact that Poland is in NATO, despite the fact that there are American military bases here, there is a certain fear that the war may also knock on our door.
Therefore, the attitude has changed to a positive one.
The Ukrainian flag, Ukrainian anthem is now not a " song of nationalists" or any enemies in Poland.
Of course, there are small groups among the population that have not changed their views, they are in every country.
But, fortunately, the majority of citizens in society now think completely differently about Ukrainians than before.
The claim about nationalists in Ukraine is ridiculous.
Putin and other Russian politicians have consistently argued that there are nationalists in Ukraine who need to be eliminated.
In Poland, this is perceived simply with laughter, because these so-called "nationalists" turned out to be completely different people, they do not have any political undertones, they do not have any political overtones.
And this is certainly impressive, because this direct contact influenced the change in public opinion of those segments of society that still doubted some historical issues.
Now it turned out that these doubts were not confirmed.
Ukrainians are heroes.
Poles, when they begin to think that there may be a war, immediately begin to understand that they would not be able to resist and give their lives in the way that is happening now in Ukraine.
People from Mariupol, Bucha and other Ukrainian cities are constantly talked about here.
How Poland perceives Russia's threats.
Ukraine believes in victory, but is preparing for the worst scenario, because a terrible war continues.
But now Poland and the Czech Republic, which have already received threats, are seriously thinking about their own security.
Russia is afraid that it will strike with nuclear weapons as punishment for supporting Ukraine.
How the Polish authorities and society react?
If you want peace, prepare for war.
Actually, Poland does this, it has very good contacts with the United States and other NATO countries.
The military contingent has increased.
Currently, Poland is undergoing additional recruitment for territorial defense troops.
That is, such preparation for various military scenarios is taking place.
Citizens feel that the state is preparing for such events.
Among this, a new law on the defense of the homeland was recently adopted, where the budget has been significantly increased for the military needs of Poland.
The requirements for recruiting military personnel have been changed, many points that are actually related to a possible military threat.
I know you as a professional expert in future analytics.
Your predictions have become a reality in Syria, you have warned of a Russian attack.
What can you say from the analysis of the situation: when will Ukraine win and will the world be able to prevent a nuclear war?
This is the worst-case scenario.
As for a nuclear strike, I don't have much faith in it.
But there is such a scenario.
Such a nuclear strike should be more indicative for NATO countries, and Poland as well, too.
It could take place, according to various estimates, on the territory of the Volyn region.
Note, I wouldn't want that, but it's the worst-case scenario.
A blow of low power, but for all television channels to show this ‚Äú fungus‚Äù .
To be seen from Poland, the Baltic countries.
In this case, the Russians expect that NATO troops will flee and lose their combat capability.
Positive scenarios are related to the physical and financial exhaustion of the Russian army, the problems of Putin's entourage, the oligarchs who are now suffering greatly from financial problems, various regional problems in Russia.
We have facts of the fire at hydroelectric power plants in Sakhalin, some evidence that people are beginning to resent prices.
Such problems of a regional nature will affect the integrity of the Russian state.
In one of my predictions, I wrote that Russia would break up into 19 small countries.
We also have tendencies of peaceful settlement of war.
Various EU countries, in particular, Germany and Hungary, are determined to stop significant military aggression in Ukraine because of their needs for Russian energy resources.
As much as possible, this will be delayed until the end of this year.
How to live without Russian gas?
The Czech Republic is discussing a possible cessation of gas supply.
This will be a very tangible blow, because the Czech Republic is almost 100% dependent on Russian gas.
At the same time, Russia completely stopped gas supplies to Poland and Bulgaria.
How this affected Polish citizens?
Since I am an analyst, I predicted that.
I just turned off the gas in my house in advance.
My family will not suffer from the loss of this resource.
But there is a very huge number, millions of Polish families, who will feel the increase in prices.
Citizens will not feel this for the first few months, but definitely prices for all resources will begin to rise up.
Different avenues to certain alternative sources are now being sought.
In addition, we already have several companies that transport liquefied gas to Poland, there is a very huge port in Poland, there is a very huge port.
As for oil, we have a bright factor that the Hungarian Prime Minister is actually cooperating with Putin.
Now there will be a redemption of gas stations in Poland, in fact, by Hungarian companies that will operate Russian oil.
These are also very painful topics that touch on geopolitical and international problems.
If Europe abandoned Russian energy, it would be the loss of a source of funding for the Russian Federation's troops.
Even a schoolboy understands that without the sale of oil and gas, Russia will simply lose the possibility of existence and go bankrupt very quickly.
Ukraine in Polish media.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave an interview to Polish media.
What is told about this in the Polish media?
The rating of the President of Ukraine has greatly increased.
And this growth is estimated to be unprecedented.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanks for the help, talks about real things that are happening nearby, he is in the city that is in the war zone.
That is, the president's actions are assessed by politicians, analysts, and government officials as very active.
They indicate that the Ukrainian authorities are maximally focused to receive military and financial assistance in order to provide for refugees leaving Ukraine.
The media discuss these topics in a very positive context regarding the Ukrainian authorities.
There is no negativity that sometimes occurs in Ukrainian media regarding certain sabotage or regional problems.
This is not heard here.
And in my opinion, this is very good, because the image of Ukraine in the sense of heroism, endurance, ability to fight the enemy has grown very significantly.
It does not fade or fall.
This is the most important thing, that is, there are no image losses.
In fact, the image of Ukraine holds, and this is very important.
Good morning.
Sorry to bother you again with my problems.
I am very uncomfortable and ashamed to complain to you and complain to you.
Yesterday they tried to come up with something, but the attempt was in vain.
The mother-in-law's friend also joined the conflict, helping to find this apartment.
She said that she was not looking for her for us, and if something does not suit us, it is we who must leave and she will make sure that it is the mother-in-law, not us, who stays here to live.
Unfortunately, none of them think for a child who is used to this place, considers it his home, and in 3 months there are already 6 houses in the change.
I am very sorry, I could not have guessed that such a situation would happen.
Once again, I'm sorry to give you trouble.
And as for the bed, the situation looks strange.
My husband and I discussed this issue before I wrote to you that I did not need a bed.
He was coming here to see me and the baby and really wants to sleep and wake up with his family.
And the mother-in-law herself decided that he would sleep with her in the room and she wanted to spit on his opinion and desires.
I am very ashamed in front of you, your husband, Sharka and Ian, the owner of the apartment.
You tried so hard for us so much.
Understood.
I thought it was going on for a long time
How do you think it would be possible, given our situation and Andrii's treatment, to do this at least until the end of summer
Perhaps you need a certificate for Andrii that he is sick
In Ukraine, a disability would be prescribed with such a diagnosis.
And just as Inna does not go to kindergarten yet, I also do not have the opportunity to go to work, at least outside the home.
Understood, then it would be good to go tomorrow with you
I will make a barcode for myself and Andrew.
I am worried that they will stop providing humanitarian aid for him, and treatment and rehabilitation will take a lot of time.
Can you give me some advice?
I also wanted to ask if you received money for the medicines you bought for Andrii.
The handle mount falls out.
It is short, so you need to be very careful not to lose it.

He was an ordinary man who fought for the independence of Ukraine.
Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of independent Ukraine, said.
I believe that there was a dictatorship because people just left Russia and still could not really understand whether they like to be an independent country or they want to be an autonomous Republic of Russia.
when Ukraine was independent, there was already Kyiv, but still in the Soviet Union there was the city of Kharkiv from 1912 to 1934.
I can't say that there were any other interesting events, but if at first there was democracy, it would have been much better, and probably now we were in the European Union.
