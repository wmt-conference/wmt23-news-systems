Rabies cases increase in northeastern Thailand
Dr. Thawichai of the 9th Disease Prevention and Control Office revealed on February 9 that rabies infections have increased in northeastern Thailand over the past few months, with a total of 74 cases.
So far this fiscal year (October last year through September this year), a total of 74 people have tested positive for rabies, 67 and 7 in the northeastern provinces of Surin and Buriram, respectively.
All had received rabies vaccinations in the past.
He urges people to get rabies vaccinations for their pets and to avoid touching the saliva of animals suspected of being infected.
Rabies can be transmitted to humans not only from dogs but also from cats and bats.
When a person is infected and develops the disease, it is almost 100% fatal, but death can be prevented by vaccination before the onset of the disease.

These farms produced unusually high yields last year.

The business office was established in 2011 with the mission to send feed fisheries products to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
While over-enforcing the catch plan, in recent years the company has been supporting farms in Kiyotsu by procuring farming supplies.
However, the farm supported this time was not in Kiyotsu City, but in Kagamijo County, which is adjacent to the city.

FUJI Develops System to Prevent Accidents Involving Leaving a Child Behind
FUJI (headquartered in Chiryu City), which manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has begun developing a system to prevent "left behind" cases such as children being left behind in cars.
A motion sensor is installed in the car, and when it detects human movement, a notification is sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, the company is conducting a demonstration test using a courtesy vehicle at its own facility.
Protecting the safety of children in the midst of tragic accidents caused by leaving them behind.
Currently, the company is conducting a demonstration experiment using two vehicles to transport children to and from "teracoya THANK," an English conversation after-school for children operated by the company in Chiryu City.
Motion sensors, which detect human movement based on temperature differences between humans and the surrounding environment, are installed at three locations on the ceiling inside the car.
With the vehicle engine turned off and the doors closed, if human movement is detected after a certain period of time, a warning notification is automatically sent.
Linking information to engine and door status prevents false positives as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent out through the cloud.
In addition to calling a pre-registered number, the system will display the number in a chat on your computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered to ensure that no mistakes are made, such as missing an address.
The demonstration experiment will continue until the end of February.
Kazumitsu Kamiya, Manager of Section 2 of the Innovation Promotion Department, noted, "During the experiment, we also found peripheral issues other than the system.
For example, they were able to pick up on various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can concentrate on driving.
We hope to expand our solutions," he said.
The development of the anti-leaving system was triggered by a series of accidents in which shuttle buses were left behind across Japan.
An employee who has young children made a suggestion as to what could be done to keep them safe.
The company decided to develop this product to take advantage of its expertise in IoT (Internet of Things) and sensor-based information management, which it has cultivated through its factory automation (FA)-related business.
FUJI's anti-leaving system is easy to use.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
Since the system can be easily retrofitted to pick-up and drop-off vehicles, the company aims to lower the hurdles to its introduction and promote its widespread use.
In the future, the company will consider commercializing the product, seeking cooperation from nursery schools and kindergartens.
Editorial: The postponement of the start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tsuruga to Shin-Osaka, which was originally scheduled for the beginning of FY2023, has begun to affect urban planning west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture.
In Obama City, where the new station will be located, the detailed location of the station has not yet been indicated, and urban planning, including the development of the surrounding area, has stalled.
The plan is expected to take a long time to formulate and must be made public as soon as possible.
The planned Hokuriku Shinkansen station in Obama City will be the only new station west of Tsuruga.
In 2007, the Japan Railway Construction, Transport and Technology Agency indicated a rough station location of approximately 2.5 km radius around JR Higashi Obama Station.
The detailed station location and route were to be finalized in the winter of 2010.
In Obama City, projects related to the Shinkansen bullet train will begin in earnest in FY21 with a view to the opening of Tsuruga and then Obama.
In the FY2010 initial budget, the number of projects will be further increased to promote urban development in anticipation of the announcement of the location of the new station.
However, the detailed location of that new station is still not indicated.
The city has allocated 3 million yen in this year's budget for a project to study land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station and formulate a basic plan, but the project is not expected to be executed.
Urban planning centered on the new station "will take time due to consensus building among citizens" (city official).
Echizen City is an example of a new suburban station in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but there are indications that it will take considerable time to finalize the overall concept.
It is feared that the later the announcement is made, the shorter the preparation period before the opening will be and the more it will affect the development of the surrounding area.
Before the location of the new station, there is uncertainty about the extension west of Tsuruga.
Last October, a citizens' group in Kyoto City, which is on the route of the extension, submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism demanding a blanket withdrawal of the extension plan.
In response to the postponement of the start of construction, there have been calls in Ishikawa Prefecture's political circles for a reconsideration of the Yonehara route, and there have been a series of moves that seem to be returning the route setting to the drawing board, which had already been settled, making it difficult to say that the neighboring prefectures are monolithic.
Although Obama residents are relatively calm about the postponement of the start of construction, there are concerns that the location of the new station is unknown, and the timing of its opening remains uncertain, which could affect future momentum.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki intends to continue his efforts to request the national government for the early opening of the entire line, but the voices of the communities along the line calling for construction to begin as soon as possible will be indispensable.
The national government and neighboring prefectural governments cannot be swayed by the indifference of those who believe that a bullet train (west of Tsuruga) will someday pass through the area.
I want the enthusiasm to continue to raise my voice.
The chocolate department for Valentine's Day at the Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, where tastings have returned for the first time in three years.
As the price of chocolates rises in stores before Valentine's Day on February 14 due to the rising cost of raw materials and packaging, sales of high-priced chocolates for "treats" for oneself, family members, and friends are booming.
Retailers and confectioners in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that emphasize local color, luxury, and attention to ingredients.
Seibu Fukui Store (Fukui City) opened a special sales floor on the 6th floor on January 25.
Until the 14th, 450 varieties of about 40 brands, including 10 confectionery stores in the prefecture, are on sale.
Popular products include chocolates made with Fukui's local sake and sandwiches made with raw chocolate and other ingredients sandwiched between cookies.
According to the store's representative, many of the products' store prices have increased by about 10% over the previous year.
Regarding this year's trends, "There are many products with special characteristics, such as being particular about the ingredients and having a luxurious feel in the packaging. Consumers tend to buy products for themselves and their families and enjoy comparing them.
Even with the headwind of price hikes, sales in the higher price ranges are reportedly strong.
⇒Average increase of 25 yen per grain due to high prices
We are trying to create a sales floor where people can enjoy the Valentine's Day event itself," says a sales representative.
The store has been selling daily recommended sweets since January 26, and also resumed tastings for the first time in three years.
Western Confectionery Club (headquartered in Ichihondanaka, Maruokamachi, Sakai City), a Western confectionery manufacturer and seller, introduced its original chocolate "KISEKI" series, which was jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate maker at the end of last year, for the first time during the Valentine's Day sales season.
The cacao beans are carefully selected for their fruity flavor with low bitterness, and are sold for 1,000 yen for a pack of three or 3,000 yen for a pack of nine.
Ryuma Takakura, Director and General Manager of Purchasing Department of the company, said, "While the culture of "giri" (obligation) chocolate is gradually fading away, there is demand for a little luxury on Valentine's Day. We will strive to differentiate our products by increasing their added value.

An office worker in her 30s, who purchased giri chocolates, said, "It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolates, but since it is once a year, I want to give them to my family and people I usually take care of. However, I may give it to fewer people.

Ruins of Ushigahara Castle, said to have been built in preparation for a battle with Heisenji Temple = Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture
The Inuikagawa district of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, was once the site of a large Ushigahara manor.
Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built halfway up Mt. Nabedoko in the district in preparation for a battle with Heisenji Temple, which was in conflict with the manor in the Kamakura period.
It appears in the military story "Taiheiki".
Although there are no surviving documents concerning Ushigahara Castle, the following is written in "Echizen Ushigahara Jishin Jiken Jiken Jiken Jiken Jiken" in Taheiki Vol. XI.
Awakawa Ukyo Ryo Tokiji (Aikawa Ukyo Sukenosuke Tokiharu), an official of the Kamakura Shogunate, was sent to Ono as a local headman.
In 1333, Rokuhara Tetsugaku, which had been established in Kyoto to monitor the Imperial Court and control the western provinces, was overthrown by Ashikaga Takauji, and the Kamakura shogunate was destroyed by Nitta Yoshisada.
When Tokiji's retainers heard the news that Rokuhara Tetsugaku had been destroyed, they immediately fled, leaving only about 20 men.
Seizing the opportunity, Heisenji priests and others attacked.
Tokiji let his wife and two children enter the river, and then followed them to commit suicide.
⇒The castle is an impregnable castle where Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu all stood together.
The "Association for the Betterment of Qianside," made up of local residents, published "Qianside Historical Story" in 2014.
Tokiji's tragic story is presented in a manga format that is easy for even elementary school students to understand.
Masao Kitagawa, 75, who was involved in the publication, said, "I hope that local people will learn about the history around them and pass it on to future generations.

Roadside Station "Rennyo no Sato Awara" under construction in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture, will open on April 22.
With a view to the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen Ashihara-Onsen Station in the spring of 2024, the new facility is expected to serve as a new regional promotion and tourism base in the northern area of the city, attracting approximately 360,000 visitors per year.
The station's main food and beverage/retail facility is a steel-frame, one-story building with a total floor area of 975 square meters.
The total area of the roadside station, including the parking lot and Nagisa Children's Park, is 8137 square meters.
The facility will also include a rest area and tourist information center.
Electric bicycles are available for rent and there are shower rooms.
The two parking lots will accommodate a total of 66 small and large vehicles (including 3 for the disabled).
Mayor Noritsugu Mori revealed this at a regular press conference held on February 8.

The company will work to develop menus that use a variety of local products, such as egg rice with Fukuchi Jidori chicken and autumn/winter-only dishes using eel from Kitagata.
Approximately 60 businesses are currently members of the "Shippers' Council" of direct sellers.
The store will also offer a full lineup of processed foods such as boxed lunches and side dishes, as well as agricultural and horticultural products such as seedlings and plants.
The souvenir corner displays and sells works by resident artists of the Kanaz Forest of Creation Museum, as well as confections, sake, traditional crafts, and other items.

A cat-shaped catering robot installed at the "Rock Salt Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Branch.
The adorable expressions on the faces of the customers are said to be popular among families.
The restaurant industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is suffering from a labor shortage, is increasingly introducing catering robots that deliver food to customers.
In addition to being useful for reducing manpower in store operations and providing "non-contact" customer service to prevent new coronavirus infection, the robot's adorable facial expressions are popular with family customers.
Restaurant operators and others involved in the industry have commented that it is difficult for restaurants in rural areas to secure employees and part-time workers, and that catering robots will become even more popular.
Â "Gin, Gin, Genghis KhanÂ".
A robot with a cat's face displayed on the screen smoothly drives around the restaurant with food on it, while light music plays.
When he arrives at the customer's table, he speaks to the customer, saying something like, "I have brought the food you ordered, Meow.
Iwashio Aged Genghis Khan Bonta Fukui Ekimae Branch" in Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped food delivery robot in August 2022.
A robot waiting near the cooking area loads the food ordered by the customer and presses the table number on the screen, and the robot autonomously drives to the table and delivers the food to it.
It has a built-in AI (artificial intelligence) voice function and other features, reacts when customers touch it, and the cat face on the screen is rich in expression.
The Bonta Group, which operates this restaurant and others, has introduced meal delivery robots at two of its restaurants, including this one.
President Toshiyuki Saito emphasizes that the most important reason for the introduction of this system is the shortage of labor, and that it is part of the productivity improvement through labor saving and digital transformation (DX).
The ratio of labor costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but the company has been able to reduce this to 21-22% through the introduction of this system.
The robot is also responsible for collecting plates that customers have finished eating, leading to more efficient cleanup, and, he adds, "Families and children enjoy it, and it's also good for advertising.
Rokken Hoshiyama Fukui Branch, a yakiniku and horumonabe restaurant located in Arakishinbo-machi, Fukui City, also introduced a food delivery robot in August 2010.
Mr. Eifuku Hoshiyama, president of Songsan Shoten, the company that manages the store, said, "Even if we recruit employees and part-time workers, they don't come. I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage," he said.
The Fukui store operates by separating the robot delivery area from the zone where employees serve food.
The cost of leasing the robot is said to be equivalent to the wage of one part-time worker.
In order to save labor, the store is incorporating a tablet ordering system in addition to robots, and is also considering a self-checkout system.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, in December 2010, the effective ratio of job offers by job category was 6.94 times for "customer service" such as restaurants, an occupation with a high labor shortage.
A representative of Net System (2-chome, Takagi-chuo, Fukui City), a sales agent for catering robots, says, "Due in part to the Corona disaster, restaurants in the prefecture are facing a serious labor shortage, and we receive many inquiries about introducing robots.
President Hoshiyama analyzed, "It will be even more difficult to secure employees at suburban restaurants in rural areas in the future, and I think food delivery robots will become more popular.
Echizen Town has created an ending note and is distributing it to townspeople who wish to receive it.
The reason for this was that many people came to receive a copy of the "Ouemi Handbook," which covers the procedures necessary for the death of a family member, a list of legacies and a family tree, etc., and which was written in the year before last.
Courses on how to write an ending note and organize one's life are often held in various parts of the prefecture, and it seems that the "end-of-life" activity has become well established among the residents of the prefecture.
Echizen-cho's ending note is 35 pages.
The five chapters begin with a review of personal history, followed by a description of current health and asset conditions, future care, end-of-life care wishes, and requests regarding funerals and graves.
There is also a space to write what you want to do for the rest of your life or a message to your loved ones.
Thirty-five pages may seem daunting to write, but you don't have to fill every page.
What do you most want to leave behind in writing for your family and others around you?
The key is to be clear about the objective.
A wide variety of notebooks are available at bookstores for various purposes, and people should feel free to start writing wherever they can.
The term "end-of-life" was coined in 2009 as an analogy to job hunting.
Two years later, in 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that more and more people are preparing for their own final or terminal days as they witness the reality that "death comes suddenly.
It has been more than 10 years since then.
The new Corona disaster that has struck the world has not subsided.
Prices have risen due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and other factors, and this winter electricity prices jumped to unexpected levels.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current high cost of living, and many people are wondering what the future holds.
On the other hand, funeral, nursing care, and grave management costs used to be shared among siblings and relatives, but nowadays it is not uncommon to have an only child.
In addition, although life expectancy has greatly increased compared to a decade ago, the dilemma is that the older people get, the greater the risk of dementia and the need for nursing care.
It is important to keep in mind that this growing social anxiety is also behind the fact that end-of-life activities are not a passing phase, but have taken root.
At any rate, it is everyone's desire not to place an undue burden on their partners and children.
It seems that "making the last days your own" is another popular keyword for ending notes, but one should not be too self-absorbed.
We would like to discuss our hopes and requests with our families and others at least once, rather than writing them down secretly, so that we can be prepared for that moment peacefully.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (second from right) and Education Minister Keiko Nagaoka (third from right) pose for a commemorative photo with officials at the elementary school they visited.
In principle, it is not necessary for students and teachers to wear masks at graduation ceremonies in Toda City, Saitama Prefecture, on February 10.
On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology established a policy that students "should not wear masks" at graduation ceremonies.
The principal of a large junior high school said, "It is actually difficult to keep a wide space between students, and we are wondering how we should deal with this. Some students feel uneasy about removing their masks.
The topic has been brought up among faculty members in response to media reports about the wearing of masks at graduation ceremonies.
On the other hand, an elementary school principal commented, "If the government decides to do so, it will be in the form of not wearing the uniform. If the national government decides to exclude chorus singing, it may be realistically possible.
Some schools in the prefecture are seeking to ease their measures, such as allowing current students to participate in the graduation ceremony, which they had refrained from doing, and resuming the singing of the graduates' chorus.
In the prefecture, prefectural high schools are scheduled to hold their ceremonies in early March, and public elementary and junior high schools in the middle of the same month.
The prefectural and municipal boards of education will wait for an official notice from the Ministry of Education to determine how to respond.
Some were also cautious about the Ministry of Education's policy of not requiring the wearing of masks in all school educational activities from this spring's new school year.
The principal of the elementary school said, "Children will be confused if they are suddenly required to wear no masks on a certain day. The first step is to decide that the children are free to wear masks, and then it is natural for the number of children to gradually increase.

On February 10, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) decided that, in accordance with new government guidelines for wearing masks, from April, school educational activities will not require the wearing of masks.
As a rule, no masks shall be worn in choir and physical education classes and club activities.
During FY2022, infection control measures will be required according to the current hygiene management manual, and the Board of Education and school sites will be informed of the precautions to be taken after April.
Graduation ceremonies at elementary, junior high, and senior high schools and universities will be held even during FY2010, with ventilation and other measures in place, and graduates, faculty, staff, and current students who attend will not wear masks.
Yasushi Nagata cuts a student (left) with scissors that he prayed would help him pass the entrance exam.
Every year during the exam season at Hair Atelier Lim Lim, a hair salon in Tsukamachi, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, students are cut using scissors and other items that have been prayed for to help them pass the exam.
The students say that the program has been well received by them, saying that they "gained confidence" and "were able to approach the examinations calmly.
Yasushi Nagata, president of the salon, has seen and heard students open their textbooks while waiting for a cut, or reveal their anxiety about the entrance exam during the cut.
So, in 2014, he began cutting prayers for success, hoping that "even a little bit helps.

Self-published book by the non-profit organization "Heartfelt Writings and Editing Bureau" entitled "Dear Prime Minister, 'Breakwater of Life' from Tojinbo."
Dear Prime Minister, I have self-published my 10th book under this title, "From Tojinbo, the 'Breakwater of Life'.
Newspapers across the country have picked up the story, and many readers have sent in their impressions.
The purpose of this book is to share with you what we have heard directly from suicide attempters about the "social and structural" environmental problems that cause suicide in Japan, in the hope that you will help create a "comfortable society to live in".
We have been patrolling the water's edge of Tojinbo, Fukui Prefecture, known as a famous suicide spot, for 18 years and 10 months to prevent suicides, patrolling the rocky shoreline to find and protect suicide attempt victims and help them to start over.
This document is a compilation of the issues raised by the 784 people (as of 2/6) we have protected so far, and we have appealed to the Prime Minister for the following seven items regarding national measures needed to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) "Human rights violations" are piling up behind suicides.
(3) Suicides are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies treat citizens who live outside their jurisdiction as "strangers" and treat them coldly.
(5) Mentally ill people with depression and other mental disorders are medicated, and even if they commit suicide, it is treated as an "accident.
(6) The "duty of care" in high-risk areas for suicide has been forgotten and commercialism has taken over.
(7) The part of the doctrine of a new religious group that cannot be scientifically proven is deception, and the act of threatening a person by telling him of future hauntings and forcing him to provide money or goods is extortion.
Religious organizations that are committing this criminal act of "fraud and extortion" should be publicized and eliminated.

The man is Kenji Shimada, 38, an office worker who lives in the city.
In March 2021, the company began disseminating information on social networking sites (SNS).
Capybaras are one of the world's largest rodents and are good swimmers, with a paddle between their fingers.
Hapijan has kept three animals, one male and two females, since it opened in 2006, and visitors can observe and feed them up close.
Mr. Shimada first learned about capybaras five or six years ago.
He was shocked when he saw a video of the animal relaxing in a hot spring and said, "What is this animal?
I was drawn to their charming expressions and gestures as if they were human.
I was looking forward to seeing them up close when I heard that they would be kept in Hapijan afterwards.

Toba City Double Payment of Child Rearing Household Benefit Seeks Refund - Ise Shimbun

The city will apologize to the subject and explain the circumstances, as well as seek procedures for restitution.
According to the city, this was discovered on January 27, 2023, when a parent of one of the subject children pointed out that he had confirmed past payments.
A review of 182 individuals from 79 households who were eligible for benefits in the same fiscal year revealed that 12 individuals from 11 households had received duplicate payments of benefits that had been paid on July 20, 2021.
The city provides 50,000 yen per child as a benefit to high school students and younger from households exempt from residential tax.
The company claims that it received data from the outsourced computing company that selected eligible children, but that the staff member in charge mistakenly added the data to the data, which did not include high school students, resulting in the double payment.
A representative of the city's Child Rearing Support Office stated, "We take this matter very seriously and will do everything possible to prevent recurrence, including rechecking data, in order to regain trust.

2023.02.10 - Iwaki Minpo Co.
It is snowing again.
It seems to be not a cold wave from the north, but a south coast low pressure system moving eastward over the Japanese archipelago.
It is still too early to be on guard after the unusually cold weather of the 24th-26th of last month.
The building collapsed in an instant.
More than 20,000 people have been killed so far, including in neighboring Syria, and many are still left behind in the rubble.
It all started in 1890, when the Ottoman Empire dispatched the warship Ertugrul to Japan and the shipwreck occurred.
The fact that the residents of the town of Kushimoto, Wakayama Prefecture, where the accident occurred, rescued and cared for the crew has been introduced in movies and novels.
Those who experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this suffering.
We would like to keep this in mind until the situation settles down and recovery/restoration is complete.

Bellino Hotel Receives Illegal Subsidies from Prefectural and Municipal Government for Accommodation Support Programs
The prefectural government and Ichinoseki City announced on April 10 that Bellino Hotel Ichinoseki (Yamame, Ichinoseki City) had been improperly using subsidies to discount lodging rates for tourists for about a year from October 2021.
Discounts were being applied to stays by people who were not eligible for the discount, through name lending by employees and other means.
We also observed a number of overnight stays by employees that were not in line with the business objective of "stimulating tourism demand.
Including a voluntary investigation by the prefecture, the city, and the hotel, the full amount of 7,231,000 yen received due to improper use and other reasons was returned by the 6th of this month.
The subsidies were improperly received under the prefectural government's "Iwate Travel Support Project," a lodging discount program implemented in response to the spread of the new coronavirus, and the city government's "Ichinoseki Lodging Support Discount," a tourism lodging facility emergency measures program.
The period was from October 18, 2009 to October 10, 2010 (September 30, 2010 for Ichinoseki Accommodation Support Discount), and the results of the survey showed that there were 95 cases of inappropriate use that were not covered by the discount, such as being out of the target area or not being vaccinated, totaling 587,000 yen, and 1,239 cases of use not in accordance with the purpose and objectives of the program, totaling 664,000 yen The number of cases of use not in line with the purpose and objectives of the project amounted to 1,239, or 664,000 yen.
When the prefectural government's subcontractor was proceeding with the reimbursement procedures, it confirmed several situations in which the person who used the room rate and the person in charge at the hotel were the same person.
A detailed investigation by the prefectural government revealed the inappropriate use, and the city, which received this information, confirmed the facts.
The city's project has already been terminated, and its registration with the prefectural project was deleted on December 2, 2011.
In response to an interview, Michiaki Dobashi, representative director of Bellino, which manages the hotel, said, "We apologize to the local community, the prefecture, the city, and many other people for the inconvenience caused. We regret it very much. We would like to restart from scratch and work to regain the trust of the local community." He plans to hold another compliance workshop for all employees.
Takahito Chiba, Director of the Promotion Division of the Prefectural Tourism and Promotion Office, said, "This is truly regrettable. We would like to urge the establishment of compliance and adherence to the rules, and call for appropriate use of the facilities in accordance with the purpose of the project," he said.
Mayor Yoshihito Sato commented, "It is truly regrettable that there was inappropriate use of the business at lodging facilities in the city.

Many orders have been received since the first day, and the company will consider offering it on days other than Thursday in the future.
The road station will be closed from May 2021 to November 2010 due to the closure of Route 107.
During this period, the company operated an alternative restaurant, "Nishiki Ramen and Donburi Restaurant" in Kotsunagisawa, and will utilize its accumulated know-how.

Hayachimine, and introduces the footprints of those who were involved in the botanical research of Mt.
Botanical research on Mt. Hayachimine began with Carl Johann Maximovich (1827-91), a Russian botanical researcher who came to Japan at the end of the Edo period, and Naganosuke Sugawa (1842-1925) from Shiwa Town, who collected plants under Maximovich's guidance.
Maximowicz, who was not allowed to walk freely in Japan as a foreigner, asked Sugawa to collect and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa continued to support Maximowicz's research after his return to Japan, leading to the publication of the "Himekozakura," "Nambutouuchisou," and "Miyama-yamabukishouma" endemic to Hayachimine Mountain.
Later, Tomitaro Makino (1862-1957), a modern plant taxonomist, published "Nambuturano", "Kobanotsumekusa", and "Nambui nuna" in 1903 based on collections by local researchers, and "Katohakobe" in 2005, which he discovered and named after himself climbing Mt.
The exhibited materials show how many researchers have revealed valuable alpine plants.
Also introduced are Matsunosuke Sugimura (1874-1948), a botanical researcher and principal of Hanamaki Elementary School who accompanied the survey for the preservation of natural monuments in 1927, and Shichiro Tamagawa (1914-1988), a curator at the Osako Town Mountain Museum who was also involved in publishing "The Plants of Hayachibo.
Sohei Yoshida, curatorial researcher at the center, said, "Behind the names of the plants on Mt. We can trace the connections among researchers from the local area to the whole country," he said.
The exhibition consists of four chapters, with Chapter 1 focusing on the beliefs and history of Hayachibe, and Chapter 2 highlighting the characteristics of Mt. Hayachibe from a geological perspective, based on research by German geologist Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), who laid the foundation for Japanese geology, and others.

All committee members attended, including online.
The participants exchanged views on setting targets for decarbonization and the introduction of renewable energy sources, mainly solar power.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set an overall goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions at each airport by 46% or more (compared to FY13) by 30 years, in order to become "carbon neutral" and achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In response, the council held its first meeting last November, aiming to formulate a plan ahead of the other six remote island airports in the prefecture.
The second meeting was closed to the public, as was the first, except for the beginning of the meeting.
According to Chairman Ando, who was interviewed after the meeting, the meeting confirmed the airport's greenhouse gas emissions.

Sakasama Fudosan" Okinoerabu Branch Office Opens to Attract People to the Islands
Talk session and other events to deepen understanding of "Sakasama Real Estate" at the opening event on August 8, 2012, in Chimei Town.
The opening event of the Okinoerabu branch of "Sakasama Fudosan," a real estate web service that visualizes the thoughts of people who want to take on the challenge of renting vacant houses and stores, and recruits landlords, was held at the "entaku" community space in China, China Town, on August 8.
Through the talk session, the management company provided an overview of the service.
Masahiro Okubo, representative director of Tsuginova (Rishiri-gun, Hokkaido), which manages the branch office, said, "We hope that by implementing this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we can create a movement and flow that will attract people to the island as a whole.
Contrary to the usual real estate procedure, Sakashima Real Estate discloses the information of those who wish to rent, is contacted by the lender, and if an agreement is reached, each party signs a contract on their own.
(headquartered in Mie Prefecture) as a demonstration experiment responsible for discovering potential vacant houses and building relationships through vacant houses, and began service in June 2020.
This is the seventh branch office to be opened and the first in Kyushu.
The first in the nation on a remote island.
The event was attended by about 20 people, including On-Co and Tsuginova staff, Wadomari and Chona town hall officials, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background of the opening of the branch office, saying, "As the movement to attract people from outside the island becomes more active, I thought that if we could utilize vacant houses and stores, the town and the island could become more lively from there.
We want to connect people who have property on the island and who want to do something about it with us and help them advance their efforts, even if it's just one case," he said.
On-Co representative Takeshi Mizutani pointed out the importance of taking care of each vacant house and discussing with local residents what they want to do with the area, what kind of people they want to invite, and what criteria they use to select the houses.
The deeper the ties between people, the more information will be gathered," he said, calling on islanders to participate in discussions and cooperate in providing information.

However, it is more energetic after the engine is started, because the voltage increases.

Laptop.
In principle, as long as the pin layout, voltage, frequency, and other standards are the same, they can be used together.

This is the "split" in the hair caused by hairstyles.
If you continue to wear such hairstyles, you are more likely to have thinning hair if you comb or brush it incorrectly.

What fun is that?
I lived alone.
Until last year.
It was fun.
Humans are animals of habituation, so when a pleasant daily routine is followed, that condition becomes the norm.
Once fun becomes a routine, you will not be able to think of it as "fun" unless there is more fun.
I understand that, so I enjoy the "nothing routine".

I think it is.
I don't remember having the flu for more than 50 years since I entered the workforce, but five or six years ago, I had my antibody levels measured in the city and they were adequate.

It's been going on and on since about 1:30.

Spring thunder, isn't that what they call snow removal?
It won't take long.
I have been to several different dentists, and when I sit in that treatment chair, there is a doctor or dental hygienist who talks to me from slightly behind at an angle.
I am not sure if it is better to turn around, but I think it is hard to turn around all the time because of the tight posture, and on the other hand, I think it would be rude to keep facing forward.
Does anyone know?
How are you doing?
Not only dentists but also barbers and perm shops talk while facing the front.
Which material is cooler: 100 polyester or dry rayon?
Dry rayon is excellent and cool.
Tell me about it.
I'm a new hire from April.

The door surface plate of a washbasin has peeled off and I would like to request a repair, but to which store should I contact?
Please let us know.
I found a laminate at a home improvement center, so I measured the size, machined it, and repaired and replaced it myself.
When you go to the tax office to file your tax return, it doesn't have to be printed in color, does it?
Yes, sir.
When will the amount filed on my tax return at the beginning of the year be deposited into my account?
I thought it would take a couple of weeks for the money to be transferred.
You will receive a postcard notification that the money will be transferred to your bank account first, so when you receive it, please check your bankbook.
In the meantime, we have to wait for the postcard (notification).

Good evening.
JR West's "e5489" ticketless express tickets are paid by credit card.
Prepaid cards are not accepted.
It's way past the date, but do you think it's okay?
Vegetable juice.
It depends on how it is stored.
If it was kept refrigerated for a long time, it can be drunk after a few days, but if it was left outside or at room temperature, it is better to dispose of it.
It would be a disaster if there was something wrong with my body later on.

It's a simple story.
May I write, it is a story about escaping from monsters that feed on humans.

About Instagram.
I (an ordinary person) currently have about 10,000 followers. If a stranger sees this, do you think it is wow?
Or do you think nothing of it?
What is it like?
I think it is a tremendous thing.
In the general population, it is a miracle.
I think they were doing something special.
Failed due to problems
I bought this product to try to rely on the trendy Kaatsu inner wear because I can't find the time to exercise.
I am H175m W80kg and I bought a size L.
It is quite difficult to put on at first, but once you get used to it, you will be fine.
I used them for a few days, but I had a problem and now I use other pressure innerwear.
The problem is 1, if the arm circumference is not very slim, the tightness around the edge of the sleeve (just at the second arm) is too tight and makes it itchy and a little bit congested.
2. Loose in the lower abdomen. I stopped using it because of these two problems.
As for comfort, it is quite tight, but there is no problem sleeping with it on.
Good value for the right person.
Even at 158cm, 50kg, S was fine.
But it didn't fit my large, muscular frame.
The buttocks and other parts of the body are not made three-dimensionally, so there is a strange gap between the buttocks and they tend to fall down and do not fit properly.
I always felt like I had to pull it up.
It is good if you have a body shape like a stick.
In terms of thickness, would you say it is reassuringly thin?
It was not snug or teary, and I was able to boot it in even with tight-fitting knee-high boots and make it look sleek.
Lovely.
I was looking for something that didn't show too much skin on the upper body, but was also different from fitness swimsuits, and that's how I found it.
The top is fashionable with a knitted back and a one-point mark on the hem.
I'm glad I can choose to wear a bikini or a pair of shorts over it, or a 2-way undergarment as well (^.
^) I just received it and have only tried it on and not in the water so I don't know how durable it is or how it will feel when wet, but I thought it was a great deal for the beautiful sewing, solid fabric, and the price.
In the bust section, there was no wire, but when I touched it, there seemed to be a proper hard core at the bottom of the pad.
But it doesn't hurt when I wear it, and I think it looks good when I move because it follows the bust properly.
Did they change the model from no putt-putt to with putt-putt?
(^.
Thank you very much........
45kg 156cm size M is a little big.
The raincoat is made of thick fabric, so it feels hot and humid, but the manufacturing process is solid, so it can be used for a long period of time.
Two rain visors were included to keep my face dry.
The strength was not a problem and I was able to use the bike in a storm with no problems.
There was no tearing after use.
I carry it compactly in a compression bag.
Truly, the product exceeded my expectations for the price.
It was installed successfully.
I installed this on a 2016 CLA 180 Shooting Break.
The installation method can be done by an amateur by reading YOU tube and instructions.
Be careful not to loosen the Torx screws too much or the screws will fall into the car.
I let one fall and it went missing.
Also, when inserting the gray connector between the brown and red-green wires and tightening it, if you use a tapered tip such as radio pliers, the force will not be evenly distributed and the plastic will crack as shown in the photo, making it impossible to install the connector.
The company is very supportive and mailed me a new cable the next day after I called support.
When I tried again, I used wide pliers as shown in the photo in the instruction manual and squeezed it with force all at once, and it worked.
It took some finesse to stow the wires when putting the main unit back in the car at the end, but I managed to install it.
After installation, DVD, TV, and navigation can be viewed while driving without any problems.
It is a very cost-effective product, as it costs over 80,000 yen to order from a dealer and over 40,000 yen at a specialty store.
below the price
I'm not sure why it's so highly rated. First of all, the wadding inside is polyester, but it's been cut inside the cushion, so some parts are fluffy and some parts are scraggly. I think it's better to use the pillow and the cuddle pillow separately.
neither good nor bad
Arrival of goods.
I got to use it right away.
There is no problem with the feel of the milk and it can be milked properly.
However, I feel that the sound is a little annoying and the power button is sometimes not very responsive.
I don't mind because it works fine for me, but those who care may be bothered by it.
It's not super quiet 😅I might be a little cautious if I use it in the middle of the night.
Also, I was worried about whether the attached tube and the part that connects it to the machine would fit into the tube, but I was able to push it in 😂 It is lightweight, so I think it is easy to carry!
It takes a knack for whisking...
I am not sure if it is the worst match for my hair type or the performance of this shampoo, but it does not foam at all with normal usage.
(The shampoos I have used so far lather up fine even when used normally.
(At this point, there is no lather at the level where even a single bubble appears.) 2) Rinse the hair once, then take an appropriate amount of shampoo in your hand and blend it into your hair.
（The shampoo itself is quite small in volume, so the trick is to use as little shampoo as possible the first time... I am satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
Obviously I bought a shampoo that was so expensive, but I clearly had the sensation that my hair felt better.
However, in general, I can honestly say that I was not satisfied.
It's a shame, because the Quattro Botanico series has been my go-to for face wash products....
The capacity is low, but the cosmetics are not so good, forcing you to wash them twice.
Considering that the fragrance does not seem to be popular with everyone, I am going to be a little strict and give it 2 stars.
Difficult to evaluate.
There are negatives and positives, and it is difficult to evaluate.
It is only a blade cleaner and cleans the front side of the blade.
I think the razor is a good match for the original razor with good blade precision.
Positive: As intended, dirt on the blade such as sebum and soap scum can be removed.
(Only on the front side.) That dirt will make them last longer if they are not sharp enough.
Negative: The life of the smoother is drastically reduced.
Titanium-coated, ceramic-coated, or other coating on the cutting edge will easily peel off the coating.
(The coating will almost come off after 2~3 times of shaving, so it would be better to use this cleaner after that.
Be wary of razors that say do not wipe the cutting edge.
I heard that anti-tilt rubber (anti-vibration rubber) can be used as a substitute for furniture, etc., which is used as a preparation for earthquakes, so I am not sure about the cost performance.
*I'm talking about a 20-30% increase in razor life with my use.
It is difficult to determine when to discard razor blades, but I believe it is when shaving damages the blades and the tips become rattled.
In this sense, I think it is a good product because it prevents sharpness from being down due to dirt.
(It is only a cleaner and has no sharpening effect. Sometimes it feels like it is being sharpened, but that is supposed to be due to the removal of small rust particles.)
Lured by TV commercials...
I bought it after seeing a TV commercial that showed an elderly woman's face lifted after just one application.
I have actually used it, and the texture is a little firmer than a regular gel, and I use it after wiping it off with pre-lotion.
At first, it feels sticky and uncomfortable, but as you massage it into your skin, it goes into your skin surprisingly well.
After entering, there was very little stickiness and my skin felt like it was absorbing into my hands.
The lifting was still not as good as on TV.
The feeling of firmness was felt at once.
I have very dry skin, so this one is still not enough for me, and I have been using it after using a certain Moisture Surge 72 before this.
It just feels moisturizing.
I was hoping that it would also cover the sagging pores, but it does not.
I would like to try a bottle and see if it works, and if so, I would like to repeat it.
I know it must have been a lot of work to put it all together...
It is a labor of love, a compilation of statements made by politicians over the past several years in retrospect.
As I read it, I am somewhat convinced that that statement at that time was ah after all.
However, when considering the value of the book as a reading material, it is not clear that "fact-checking," as the authors call it, is all that is necessary and sufficient.
Frankly speaking, it is not interesting to read.
After giving it a lot of thought, I felt that the major flaw in the book was in the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "fact" here will forever be fact.
I wondered if they were aware of the fragility (or should I say disprovability?) of "fact-checking," and the way they wrote about it seemed quite suspicious to me.
It is a bit disheartening to see this level of awareness of "facts" among Japanese journalists today.
Many people seem to recommend it, but it may suit those who want some knowledge of what this book covers.
If, like the reviewer, you are interested in "fact-checking" by the current Japanese media, this book is not for you.
For those who do not improve their scores in the mock exams.
At my school, political economy was taught in a print-based format, which was really boring and made me feel like I was studying while being forced to do so, and before I knew it, I hated political economy.
I'll be honest, this reference saved my life.
He is currently a senior in high school and will be a center this year.
I chose this as my study partner for the hour to and from school after purchasing it in March.
First impressions can be summed up in one word: easy to understand.
You've reached the realm of the divine.
When I finished the first round and took the past exam, I was averaging 40 at the time, and I was 70.
I was surprised even by myself.
It stretches to the point where you wonder if you've eaten something strange.
I could feel that what I gained from this reference book was not only knowledge and information about politics and economics, but also my own ability and motivation to study.
Thank you so much for the opportunity to meet you.
prevention of crime
We have taken security measures after two attempted front door pickings 8 years ago.
This time we are replacing a camera we purchased 8 years ago.
We used to use a 30-meter infrared irradiation type (from another company).
This product can recognize faces at night at a distance of about 5m, as others have mentioned.
I agree with you.
We have just arrived and have not set up the camera, but are in the process of comparing how the camera looks & checking for problems.
The image quality is much better than that of an 8-year-old camera (of course).
I used a 32-inch monitor to display the image in 4 sections, but if you maximize the shooting size, there is no problem.
So far there have been no problems with the product.
For those who are considering this camera on the condition that it has a level of facial recognition other than security, it is top-of-the-line at this price, although they may be dissatisfied with the nighttime shooting in particular!
I am for security measures, but I do not require up to facial recognition.
This is because they will not recognize you if you are masked or wearing a mask (especially at night).
Professional burglars (thieves) have knowledge of security cameras.
They are able to identify high-performance cameras and recordings, even if they are small.
On the other hand, I'm having trouble being unprofessional.
However, since recent burglars are bold and sophisticated, we recommend using a variety of security goods in combination with the camera alone.
For example, white solar LED garden lights available at home centers for about 1,500 yen (the latest ones are very bright and have 6 units attached).
Since it is solar-powered, it does not require electricity, but in winter it does not come on until morning, so three 100V motion-sensitive LED sensor lights are also installed.
With this combination, a distance of 30 m was secured at which the human figure could be recognized.
In addition, those who feel that the camera's small size makes it less threatening during daytime security need to cover it with ingenuity.
I have a "24 hour security camera in operation" sticker.
It is an original product from a security camera manufacturer that I used to use.
The manufacturer's products are more effective than those sold at home centers.
The place to put it is the burglar's entry route, which would not be covered by the camera shot.
In that sense, I wish I had gotten the sticker this time!
The instruction manual for setting up the network was also difficult to understand, so I gave it a minus grade.
We will add any deficiencies after set up and configuration.
I sympathize so much that it's hard to read.
If you were born in 1982 in Japan, your social situation may be somewhat better than hers, but the situation is still far from equal, even though the Equal Employment Opportunity Law is now in effect.
As I read on, I felt suffocated as I recalled painful memories of living through discrimination as a member of society.
It depicts the suffering of all women, not only in Korea and Japan, but also in feudal societies, as they try to live not as women but as human beings.
Isn't it time to stop the emotional confrontation and stand shoulder to shoulder with this society, at least for women?
Drama that makes you think, "Men suck."
The story of the main character who was sexually abused as a child by her own father.
Naturally, even as an adult, he continues to carry those scars with him.
Every guy that comes out sucks.
The protagonist's husband, who seems mild-mannered and family-oriented, is also an asshole in a way.
The protagonist's sister ignores her husband's domestic violence even though she knows about it, and when her sister-in-law finally gets up the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, the protagonist's husband, a police officer, goes through with it, etc. The men are frustrating.
The protagonist's elderly mother, who pretends to be a blur, knows that her husband (the protagonist's biological father) was murdered by her daughter, but the daughter does not know this (officially, the biological father's death was a drug overdose).
In short, it seems that after the death of the rape dad, he never had his daughter seek counseling, so it is no wonder that the protagonist is going crazy.
And the fact that the protagonist's daughter wants to ask about her dead grandfather so badly?
Do you care so much about a dead old man at this young age?
In the drama? There is too much of it.
A few years ago, during the summer when a heat wave hit France, many elderly people died, and it was reported that the morgue in Paris was full because hospitals and institutions contacted their daughters and sons, but many French people said they could not take them in because they were on vacation.
These people are ""dry"".
When I saw my husband and daughter at the end of the drama, I knew they were "dry".
Although many French films are quite different from their American counterparts, and many vague parts give a good aftertaste, there were relatively many scenes that I thought should have been cut out.
Professional Boundaries
If an unexpected accident that was calculated meticulously and still unreadable was related to someone's life, he would have been prepared to risk himself, even if he had calculated it to some extent from the beginning.
The script was brilliant in embodying the subtle emotional turmoil and drama of her struggles and struggles, which she does not show in public, and the extent to which she deceives others in order to carry out her own beliefs.
On that note... Jessica's performance is really great.
There is no hassle in what you see.
This is truly the work of a professional.
Usage then malfunctioned.
I have used three of these products and this one broke down very quickly, in both good and bad ways.
The reason for choosing this product was that we used the first 2200 mA built-in vaporizer, but the battery ran out after 200 degrees, 5 minutes and 3 sessions.
Second USB port is defective.
Charging is not possible.
This time, this product was to solve the previous problem, but after about 15 times of reinserting the batteries (I was using the battery charger to prevent the USB port from breaking), it became difficult to turn on, as if the contact had gone bad.
Press down on the lid to turn on the power.
I'm sure some of you have experienced this as an Icos user.
It is that symptom.
As noted in the notes, batteries other than those supplied are not used.
The claws and catches seem to be machined, so there seems to be no bending or anything like that.
Therefore, the product was returned in about 10 days.
I bought the Starry without the logo at the same time I returned it and will describe how it compares to this one.
Appearance: The size is the same.
The chamber and draw are also the same.
LCD This one is cleaner.
Maybe newer than without logo.
Vibe This one is modest.
Looks like a phone vibrator.
Without the logo, the vibrations, or rather the sound of the vibrations, are too loud.
A cheap Chinese phone.
This product is also Chinese....
Attachments are slightly different.
This one comes with a case of liquid.
Without logo is a mass like steel wool.
That's roughly what it looks like.
Staley would have been better, but if it breaks down too soon, it will lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but the only option was to return it, so I proceeded with the procedure, although it was a hassle.
It's just an ear band, but it's an ear band
This flat rubber really doesn't hurt.
The best mask I have ever used in the same line of masks in terms of ear comfort.
Even with flat elastic, the twisted edge of the elastic can rub against the base of the ear, causing more pain than with round elastic, but this product is not only soft to the touch, but also has a length that is just right to prevent twisting.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is good, and not only does it fit well, but it also makes it difficult to feel breathless because there is a proper space in front of the mouth between the nose wire and the lower edge over the chin = in front of the mouth.
It may be because it fits the dimensions of your face.
I don't know if it will fit everyone the same way, but if you have tried other smaller sizes and think they are all not good enough, you should give it a try.
When you open the outer box, it is in plastic with a central slit like a box of tissues, but when you take out the first one, the ear elastic on both sides gets caught and makes it difficult to take out, so I deducted one star for that.
1 star for vendor response.
The price and taste are perfect, but I was distrustful of the vendor who ignored the date specified and sent it to me.
In addition to this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
I always buy from amazon, so I know the delivery person.
We tried to make the arrival date as close as possible, especially since they were going to carry heavy items up to the top, but it was ruined.
I know that the shipping companies are having a hard time because of Amazon, but I'm trying to do what I can to help.
I am disappointed in the arrogant vendor's response.
But the price is low.
If you are considering purchasing, disposal costs are included.
I don't think it will be available for long due to numerous complaints.
It is a good idea to consider including the cost of disposal.
For reference, some municipalities have centers that will accept bulky waste for free or at low cost if you bring it in.
[The seat tilts slightly to the left and wobbles further, making it very tiring to sit on.
The slightest movement produces a loud creaking noise.
It is too noisy to use at night.
This is my main concern and I feel that I cannot continue to use the product in this way.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions are only roughly pictorial.
There is a lack of information necessary for assembly, and there are many erroneous statements.
The orientation of the seat and the support stand when they are installed is not explained.
When properly installed, the lever for height adjustment faces backward on the right hand side and the dial for adjusting the direction of the spring on the back faces forward.
However, many people will install the height adjustment lever incorrectly because it is more natural to install it forward-facing.
The instruction manual does not include these basic precautions, and assembly is done by trial and error while looking at miscellaneous pictures.
The list of contents at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
Many buyers seem to be looking for the 8x20mm screws, which are included in the kit, because they cannot find them.
The 8x20mm screws are already inserted in the chair side, so care should be taken not to search in vain.
Due to the low precision of the workmanship, it seems that some combinations of the same screw holes and screws can be inserted, while others cannot.
In certain combinations, it is very difficult just to insert a screw into a screw hole.
Therefore, one can imagine that they are shipped with the screws inserted in this manner.
Also, the spare screw in the manual was not found.
[The black surface of the vinyl leather is unevenly colored and whitish in places, so do not expect it to be as beautiful as the product photo.
An explanation of the incompleteness of the instruction manual and supplementary instructions for the above installation method were sent to the e-mail address registered with amazon within 2 to 3 days of receipt of the product.
Essentially, these items should be issued immediately after the goods are shipped.
This is a completely meaningless practice because many purchasers have completed assembly within 2-3 days of receiving the product.
Hmmm..,
I am a big fan of Thermos and have been using Thermos straw type for over 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use among all the models I have used.
(1) The straw's mouthpiece is now made of a harder material, and the groove snaps into the body, so the straw's mouthpiece can no longer be removed from the body!
I'm so sorry! I tried so hard to get it off, but my fingernails broke.
(2) Only the tip of the drinking straw's mouth part is thinner than before, and the straw brush no longer fits.
(3) The mysterious part on the end of the straw, the valve, is thicker than the straw brush and dramatically harder to wash.
I'm a little shocked because I've been using the straw type until now and have never had any complaints.
It is really stressful to not be able to remove the drinking cup from the body.
The good thing is that it still has excellent cold retention.
I forgot to take it out of my bag and when I washed it the next day, there was still about 50% of the ice I put in the day before.
I don't drink Hot, so I will continue to be a straw type person.
Please improve it in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
This is my first review.
(This is my first time buying a doll from scratch and my first time wearing doll eyes, and my opinion is that of a less than knowledgeable amateur) The product arrived exactly as pictured.
I put it on my obitsu doll and it is very cute and light and I am very satisfied with it.
However, the entrance is a little stiff and you have to push hard to put it on.
I think I did it differently, but I put tweezers in the doll's eye hole and pushed them in.
About the shipping I had estimated three weeks as this was my first time shipping from out of the country, but it arrived sooner than I expected, in 8 days (Narita airport is close by).
But I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
I just looked at the Amazon shipping description and it is still listed as shipping.
There was no air on the damage and eyes, and the envelope was in a small sealed bag with lots of plastic wrap on the back, so I think it's safe to say that it was in one piece.
However, the phone number was printed on the envelope, so is it safe for personal information when it's mailed from out of the country?
I will give it a minus one because of my doubts.
The product is fine and the quantity for that price is a very good value.
Postscript Doll Eye 8mm Model iPhonese
A little small (small work area), badly charged
I ordered it after looking at the size chart, but it felt about two sizes smaller than I had imagined.
It is larger than A4 size, but the area usable for work is smaller than A4 because the periphery is grooved for parts stock.
I was planning to use it when repairing electronic equipment or making Gunpla, but it is indeed hard to use without B4 size.
If you use it only for soldering iron work and use another tray or mat for other work such as assembly and disassembly, you may be able to get away with it.
Place tools, parts, and more work within a magazine-sized area ... It is not possible to do this.
I thought about ordering another one to double the area, but I think it would be tough to continue using it because it is so heavily charged during work and all the dust and cut parts pieces are attracted to it.
Fatal flaw
After struggling to open the battery box lid, I finally opened the lid using a rubber non-slip sheet, but when I loaded the batteries and tried to close it, it would not close in any way.
At this point, you are out.
Highly rated!
Does the battery box lid close?
I might add that instead of a protective sticker on the product, there was a blobby little piece of Saran Wrap on it.
Could this be a used item?
The only explanation was written in English on a small piece of paper.
There are no illustrated explanations and none of the operating instructions are clear.
Maybe for another finger...
I found a good product!
I immediately bought it because I thought it would be a good idea.
I use it for a pinky ring, so I had to use a lot to get the right fit, and it was a bit lumpy.
But it is good for use on other fingers.
But I think he is a good idea merchant.
depending on the price
After all, you shouldn't expect quality from this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was smashed.
I put it on and the size is just right.
It may be tough for those with thick earlobes.
If anything, I probably should have bought the patternless one.
brothel madam
Nice design, but it's big on the hand. I wonder if putting it on the foot would diminish the effect?
In the cold winter months in the east of Hokkaido...
As other reviewers have mentioned, the electric heating wire is only 110 x 80 net and the placement is horizontal instead of vertical.
I bought it because I wanted to warm up the whole futon evenly, and although it was more expensive than the mattress type, it was better to buy a large one.
It can only be used in combination with hot water bottles and 0tori's N-warm.
By the way, the quality of the blankets is out of question.
Well done, but...
Small size and sufficient airflow.
Batteries can also be replaced with spare batteries.
If you want to place it on a desk and adjust the angle, it is better to do so as shown in the picture.
On a slippery desk top, it will blow away with its own wind force, but if you lay down a handkerchief, no problem.
The sound is not noticeable on "medium" if used outside/at a family restaurant, but in an office, even on "low" it is not loud enough.
It is necessary to divide it into two categories: those that accompany you when you are out and about, and those that are not.
Also, for office use, even "small" airflow is too much and cools too much.
It is ideal for situations where you are sweating profusely on the road and need to escape to a family restaurant to cool down at once with a "large" drink.
The only thing is that when you throw it in your bag, on rare occasions the power button is pressed and left to turn without your knowledge.
It would be nice if the buttons could be retracted slightly (recessed), or if the first weak press could be made to be long pressed.
In these days of life-threatening heat wave, it would be helpful if you could make a better one, as it is an essential item.
Multifunctional light speaker
I use it in my bedroom in the weakest warm color.
Better than I expected!
I am glad I bought it.
As for the light, it is touch-sensitive and light intensity and color can be adjusted.
The white color fits any room, and the colored lights are beautiful as they change in gradations.
Also, one touch at your favorite color will stop at your favorite color, so you can make it glow according to your mood!
Since it is LED type, long life can be expected.
As for the sound quality, to my amateur ears, it is more than satisfactory.
Also, the great thing about this light is that it is just so multifunctional.
A large speaker is attached to the top.
Bluetooth pairing with cell phones and other devices allows you to enjoy music wirelessly.
Pairing with a cell phone allows for hands-free calling.
The MicroSD support also allows the device to be used in conjunction with a PC and to play music as an mp3 player.
Striking and Piano Practice
At the age of 66, he started trying DTM to prevent blurring.
Purchased an audio interface and this unit.
At first, I was a typist, but I got hooked on playing the piano and spend most of my time practicing every day.
I downloaded the sound source from a commissioned CD, but the protection did not work, so I downloaded ASIO at first, but the free piano sound source sounds good, so I use it for piano practice.
I am very happy with my purchase.
I feel deceived by the appearance.
Is it a hit-or-miss product?
It is a long story.
The synthetic leather on our 4-5 year old Doshisha office chair (flip-up armrests) has deteriorated and fallen apart, so we are considering purchasing a chair with non-synthetic leather and flip-up armrests.
I ransacked home improvement and furniture stores but could not find anything suitable.
Although I was concerned about not being able to see the actual product, I compromised on the appearance of the design and the price and purchased this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screw.
Caution] Attached hexagonal wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I was in a hurry when oil got on the hexagonal wrench because the body is white and I didn't know if oil was sticking to the wrench.
Assembly completed in 40 minutes.
Completion and product confirmation.
The flip-up armrests have different hardness for raising and lowering on the left and right sides, the left side is heavy for raising and lowering, the right side is light, and the armrests are not easy to use (there is no way to adjust them).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weakly secured and quickly droops with a "click" sound.
The seat feels hard with non-regenerated high-density urethane foam and is not comfortable (weak elasticity?).
) The competition mesh in the backrest area is harder than other companies' mesh chairs and hurts my back if I wear light clothing.
The height from the seat to the ground was 530, not 550 (the seat height is important for tall people).
I put down a cushion that I bought separately and use a towelette on the mesh fabric part because it seems to deteriorate (get damaged) quickly.
I am 186cm 80kg and only the fit in the back was good for me, but other than that, I think the product is not satisfactory, and I feel it is a hit or miss product.
After all, it might be better to purchase an office chair after sitting in the actual chair.
I got an Amazon email from the manufacturer with a purchase greeting, so do I inquire about the armrests and headrests?
Under consideration.
Well, is this how it is?
I purchased a Pixela 4K tuner, which was inexpensive, without much expectation, because my home environment and apparently right-turn BS4K could be viewed.
As an experiment, we are able to watch NHK BS4K and other right turn free-of-charge broadcasts, and we are able to view them beautifully on the Panasonic 4K TV that we purchased at the same time.
(Sometimes the picture is choppy.) An update came soon after purchase, and since it is now compatible with recording, I have made some reservation recordings and am watching them, but I wonder if there is some influence from the external 2.5 inch HDD, but the picture only stops on playback, or frame skipping occurs.
The user interface is also not complimentary, and it can be dismissed as a "4K broadcast viewing" system.
Incidentally, while recording a scheduled program, it is only possible to play back the program that is being recorded, and I accept this as an added feature of being able to record in 4K on the HDD.
Do not expect too much, as you may be disappointed if you purchase the product with a lot of expectations.
Hopefully this will be improved in the update.
Heat retention function is OK
I have only used the keep-warm function, but when I filled two 500ml PET bottles, they became warm in about 2 hours and hot in 2.5 hours.
The fan noise is noticeable when the car is off idling, but not noticeable at all when the car is running.
The smell like chemicals emitted by the fans was bothersome, perhaps because they were still new, and I had to open the windows periodically to ventilate the room.
As another reviewer mentioned, the burrs on the shoulder strap threads are terrible, so you need to use a flathead screwdriver or something to break the burrs.
Really fragile.
Today, after 2 months of use, it suddenly broke.
I liked the feel and size of the keys, but it would be useless if it broke.
I use my PC all day long for work processing video, and the volume goes to 100% on its own.
If it goes down, it returns to 100% in an instant.
Earphones are too loud to use because of ear pain, and it is uncomfortable to use the PC at night.
It seems to be sending a signal every few seconds and the volume display keeps appearing and disappearing on the computer screen.
Furthermore, the keyboard interferes with mouse instructions, so the mouse cannot be used freely unless the keyboard is turned off each time.
The enter and backspace keys also stopped responding.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it's in the $1,000s, you might give it a try.
If you are lucky, it will work for about six months.
This is a 6 month warranty compared to the 1 to 3 year warranties of other companies in the same price range.
The short warranty period speaks volumes about the fragility of the product.
Great product, terrible packaging.
The products are my favorite and I love them in different colors.
I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a food stocker!
However, there were enough gaps in the large cardboard boxes to make them rumble and roll, and the packaging was terrible, with no delivery note included.
The lid was also off when the box was opened.
I would recommend the product, but you may be better off buying elsewhere.
I'm worried about the strength, but anyway.
I bought it because when I replaced the lid, the support was no longer secure.
The lid is a delicate plastic product, however, and if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it will make a nasty sound like "mekimeki, mekimeki (about to break)".
Care should be taken when purchasing the lid, as it must be chosen to fit the thickness of the lid.
Cute paw paw back
I have a canine and was looking for a bag to take out with me and was attracted to this stylish gray colored bag.
It was assembled and when I held it, it was surprisingly light, so it didn't feel that heavy to hold.
The zipper runs smoothly and there is no snagging.
It looks easy to travel for long periods of time.
It is very compact and easy to fold.
Even when folded, the paw design can be seen, and it is cute even when placed.
Light and comfortable!
Pulley is also comfortable to use.
First of all, I fell in love at first sight with its appearance and low price! I bought it.
The TSA lock has been my favorite for a few years now, and I have several others, but it is very convenient.
And as for the master of forgotten or lost keys, number locks are recommended.
But to be honest, lightness is the most important point for me, so it's fine. If I wanted sturdiness and security, I would have to go around the zipper for a week, and since it's cloth, I would have to use a knife! If it were cut, it would break in an instant.
Also, the zippers are sweet at the joints, so I would like to see a way to make them overlap.
Recommended for carry-on baggage if you are overseas.
At any rate, I used it on a bullet train trip and it was comfortable.
Difficult to choose the size....
I have a hard time buying shoes because of my wide width.
Converse and Vans wear 24cm.
MRL996 is also 24cm.
At first I thought it was too tight. But once I got used to it, I was fine with it.
This time, my sister said that the ML574 was tight in 24.5cm, and when she let me try them on, they were indeed tight.
It felt like my pinky finger was hitting the floor.
That is why I bought the 25cm.
When I received it and opened it, it was big...
When I tried them on, they were a little loose even with socks on.
I was worried about returning them, but I decided to keep them at 25 with insoles because it would be a hassle if they were too tight at 24.5.
I purchased the team red and it is a very nice bright red!
I wear a lot of black and white monotone outfits, so these brighten them up!
165 cm, 40s male
I ordered a size L as appropriate, but would recommend a size M if you are similar to the following specs
Height: 165 cm Weight: 60 kg Waist: 81 cm Navel circumference: 100 cm I have a typical metabolic belly.
＜In the water, the rash guard comes up, perhaps because the waist part is loose.
I am swimming while fixing the turned up part.
If you are careless, especially in the Jacuzzi, you will be able to see your metabolic syndrome in full view.
Also, walking with vigorous up-and-down motion will still cause the bottom of the foot to turn up.
＜The fabric is sturdy and not too thin, so there is no worry about nipples becoming transparent.
I am satisfied with this price and the quality of the product, but I think it would fit better if you buy a smaller size.
It still leaked gas, but...
The silver Colt 25 was still leaking gas, and when I replaced the valve, I had a problem with a part of the tank missing, but after sealing the tank with Bath Bond Q and greasing it up, I was able to shoot fine. The only way to get a good result is to get someone who can disassemble and reassemble it for you, and if you don't have the confidence to disassemble it while taking digital photos, I wouldn't recommend it. When I disassembled it, I first removed the grip, unscrewed the safety, pulled out the safety, unscrewed the two screws on the left side of the body, and removed the end of the barrel with pliers, making sure not to damage it. Then you can disassemble it by slowly removing the left side of the barrel, which has a monaca structure.
I wondered what kind of quality that $188 was.
It can be used for fast turning and when torque is needed.
It is light, small, and above all, simple without any pretense.
There is no rattling when the bits are installed, and I thought this was an amazing cosmetics product for 188 yen.
Now we just need to see how durable it is.
It may not be used that often, but it is a good thing to have in your toolbox.
I bought this along with the "1/4" hex shank magnetic quick release screwdriver knurled bit holder 60/100/150 mm" from the same vendor.
No problems here either, or rather, it was quite good for the price.
Controller stops working.
The machine moves on its own and cannot be operated.
Once the cable is reconnected, the device can be operated, but after a few minutes, the device moves in the wrong direction and cannot be operated.
You should not buy this product.
Just a warning to everyone.
It is a terrible product.
It is wired, but we recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It is reliable and has not yet broken down after a long period of use.
It can also be used for PC games.
・・・・・・ added I was able to return the product as defective within a month and get a refund for the Amazon gift certificate, so I am happy about that.
Will this improve my calculation skills?
I think it is suitable for children who understand calculations.
It would have to be a child who understands some of the calculations.
The problem is difficult to solve.
Also, when I give a tool to the master, I have to slide my finger up the tool on the screen, but it doesn't go smoothly no matter how many times I do it.
In short, it may be easy to slip it to someone who is used to DS?
I don't like the illustrations of the cartoon characters either. I mean, I think some people go into DS and other games because of the fun of the screen, but... for some reason, I can't get familiar with them.
The calculation method is also a time-competitive method, for example, how many questions can be answered correctly in how many minutes.
I understand the feeling of rushing them through exams and such... but doesn't that make them rush and do the math?
For some reason I don't like the fact that the bell rings when it is over.
We're working hard, but can't we make it sound more pleasant?
I feel like I lost some money for 6,200 yen for this.
I can understand if the price is half of this one.
Sorry, this is why I gave it 2 Stars.
I still like Persona's music!
Persona 3 reached the ED.
5 played until halfway through.
Persona 4 has already been toro-completed on vita.
What we can do has not changed from the previous Persona 4.
The lack of a storyline makes it seem shorter than the previous film.
The songs are still cool!
Just listening to it lifts my spirits!
The Persona 3 characters were the first HD versions, so I was very impressed when I saw them for the first time.
Somehow Jumpei looked handsome lol Persona 5 is beautiful from the original, so it's not fresh ...... so 3 seems like a better deal when you think about it.
As a sound game, I found 5 easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 is mainly blue, but it was difficult to see when the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors such as red and yellow, so it is easy to see even if covered by the background.
The rich assist functions make it possible for even those who are not good at playing sound games to play.
Sound game experts may find the game more challenging if the challenge function is turned on.
The triple pack comes with the soundtrack, but it is a solid 4-disc set, not just a bonus, so if you like Persona songs, this is the one for you.
What a pity.
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the picture, but the actual product has a bluish tint to it, but it's closer to black or charcoal gray.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
That's why I was thinking of buying gold, but I'm holding off for now. I guess I can give up now that the price is so low.
P.S. After the review was posted, I received an email from the seller apologizing and stating that they would exchange the product for a new one.
Subsequent processing was also prompt.
I think the response was very good despite the inexpensive product.
4 stars for the support. Added I then also bought gold.
The colors are almost exactly as shown in the picture and I think they are very beautiful.
But still, the buckle is not double-locked, and the difference from the description photo is obvious.
That's the only disappointment.
Evenings become very heavy.
I used it on my SIM free iPhone 7s.
I didn't know how to do the first setup after I arrived in Korea and pointed the SIM, so I asked the lady at the SK counter at Gimpo airport to show me how to do it (go to Settings > Mobile Communications > Communications Options and turn on Data Roaming) and I was able to do it successfully.
I don't think the instructions that came with the product had much to do with it...?
However, the signal was poor around Gimpo Airport, or maybe I was grabbing 3G all the time.
When we went out into the city, we went to 4G.
Communication sometimes became very heavy in the evenings and at night, but in hindsight, I may have reached the maximum daily limit of hundreds of MB.
Better than expected.
I used a Softbank Z4 for 2 years, went sim free and used it with Ymobile, and then my Z4 started to go bad, so I was looking for a used Xperia.
I was worried about whether it would work properly since I was using Mobile Suica, but it was no problem at all.
The size, weight, and silver color I bought gives the impression of an iPhone 6?
The processing speed is also the same as Z4 because it does not do GAME, but I have the impression that it is a little faster. In the review, it was said that fingerprint recognition is slow, but I have the impression that it takes a little time to be recognized.
It looks like an iPhone and I think it's great. I've also upgraded my Android to Ver9 and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
I have not tested the water resistance.
