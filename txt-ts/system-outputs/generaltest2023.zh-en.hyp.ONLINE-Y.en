4.4 four-byte portion
The four-byte section includes 66 CJK unified Chinese characters (9FA6 one 9FEF, not including the 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB) in GB/T 13000 other than the double-byte characters described above, CJK unified Chinese characters expanded A, CJK unified Chinese characters expanded BCJK unified kanji expanded C, CJK unified kanji expanded DCJK unified kanji expanded C, CJK unified kanji expanded DCJK unified kanji under DCJK unified kanji expansion F and characters already coded in GB/G13000.
The characters in the four-byte part are specified in Appendix C.
5 Overall structure
In the main text, any representation marked with 0x before a number is in hexadecimal, and anything not marked with 0x is in decimal.
All codes in the appendix are expressed in hexadecimal, and all other numbers are expressed in decimal.
The single-byte portion uses the GB/T 11383 1989 coding structure, using 0x00~0x7F code bits.
The double glyph section uses two 8-bit binary bit strings to represent a character. The first byte is 0x81 one 0xFE, and the last byte is 0x40 one 0x7E and 0x80 one 0xFE, respectively.
The four-byte portion uses 0x30 one 0x39, which was not used in GB/work 11383 one 1989, as a suffix to double byte coding. The coding range is 0x81308130 one 0xFE39FE39.
The first character code range of the four-byte character is 0x81 one 0xFE; the second character code range is 0x30 one 0x39; the third byte code range is 0x81 one 0xFE; and the fourth character code range is 0x30 one 0x39. Namely: 0x81308130 one 0x81308139; 0x81308230 one 0x81308239 0x8130fe30 0x8130fe39; 0x81318130 one 0x81318139; oo2duolag0c “0uro23061393 0xFE39FE30 one 0xFE39FE39.

There is no other option, such as updating the Info file and updating the man manual at the same time, since other tasks to maintain Gnu cc don't leave us time to do this.

DESCRIPTION (DESCRIPTION) The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They all process the input files in one or more of the four steps: preprocessing (preprocessing), Hii (assembly), (assembly), and (assembly) MERE (linking).
The subname of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the last name controls the default settings:
gcc believes that the preprocessed file (.i) is a c file, and establishes a c-form connection,
g++ considers the preprocessed file (.i) to be a C++ file, and establishes a c++-style connection.
The subname of the source file indicates the type of language and later actions:
.c C source program; preprocessing, compilation, compilation
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, compiling
. CXX C++ source programs; preprocessing, compiling, compiling
.m Objective-C source program; preprocessing, compilation, assembly
.i Preprocessed c files; compilation, compilation
.ii preprocessed c++ files; compilation, compilation
.s assembly language source program; compilation
assembly language source program; preprocessing, assembly
.h preprocessor files; files that do not usually appear on the command line by other suffixes are passed to the connector (Linker). This usually includes:
.0 object file (Object file)
.a archive file (Archive file)
Unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used (or a compilation error prevents the full process), connecting is always the last step.
In the connection phase, all the.e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognized file names (including the specified.o H label files and.a library files) are passed to the connector options (OPTIONS) in the order in the command line
The options must be given separately: de 'is completely different from `-d -r'.
Most of the `-=E: and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno- name).
Only formats that are not default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in later sections.
Code Generation Option (Code Generation Option)
Overall Option
Make it clear that the language of the next input file is language (not the default choice obtained from the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next `-x' option.language option is selected
Close any explicit language specification, so post-process the following file according to the file name (RE AS E '-x' option).
If you're only operating part of the four stages (preprocessing, compilation, assembly, connection), you can use the '-x' option (or Ah after the file name) to tell geo where to start, use the `~-c', or `-E' option to tell geo where to end. Note, some combination of options (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compiles or assembles the source file, ETER. By default ERA ATI, GCC uses' .o 'Tsai to replace the source file name with a suffix of' .ec 'for the file name. You can choose a different name using the -o option. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option, Wimber -S F, whatever.
The target file is ready.
Once compiled, it stops; no assembly is carried out.
Pipelines rather than temporary files are used to work between the different stages of the compilation process, since those systems' assemblers can't read data from pipes. The GNU assembler doesn't have this problem. The assembler can accept the C “dialect”: supports C programs that conform to ANSI standards.
This will turn off some feature keywords in GNU Cc that aren't compatible with ANSI Cc, as well as ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, which indicate that they are popular and rarely used, as well as disabling (note: all standard libraries are available in the hosted environment (hosted environment), and the function returns an int value for almost every program other than the kernel. The typical example is almost every program other than the kernel. The corresponding independent environment (f£) (Reestanding environment) There is no standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main. The most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, see recent information on the GCC website)
Function declarations with no arguments, such as `int foo (); ', are treated in C style --- that is, the number or type of parameters is not specified. (For C++ only).
Under normal circumstances, a function like this foo in C++ means that the parameter is empty.
The list of sections has been removed from here to some aspects that attempt to support the traditional C compiler.
See the NU c manual for details; we've removed the details so that when the content is out of date, people won't be HERI.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option has an added effect, allowing values to be assigned to this.
It has the same effect as the '-ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support some aspects of the traditional CC preprocessor.
In particular, what is mentioned above about preprocessors is not included, but the other effects of the `-traditional' option are not included.
-fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the '$' character in identifiers (for C++ only).
You can specify the `"-efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly disallow the use of the '$' character.
(GNU C++ allows the '$' character by default on some target systems, but not all systems.)
-fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion of ant types to enumerated types (enumeration) (MEF c++).
Under normal circumstances, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int; the reverse is not possible.
-fexternal-—templates generates smaller code (c++ only) for template declarations (template declarations) by generating a copy of each template function (template function) only where they are defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark either `#pragma implementation tatio' (definition) or `#Pragma interface' (statement) in all files using the template.
When a program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instantiations (template instantiations) are external types. You must make the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved through typedef, which refers to every instance required.
Correspondence, if the default option `-fno-exteznal-templates' is used at compile time, all template instances are explicitly set as built-in.
All member functions (with the exception of constructor subfunctions and the mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class in which they belong.
This doesn't indicate that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; at this point, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the types of the second and third parameters of the conditional expression to not match.
The value of this type of expression is Void. -fthis-—is-variable allows assigning values to this (for c++ only).
Incorporating a user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++ makes the “this” that can be assigned a value seem out of place.
Therefore, by default, assigning a value to this from within a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backwards compatibility, you can make this operation effective with the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
-funsigned-char defines a char as an unsigned type, just like an unsigned char.
Every machine has its own default char type. It could be either an unsigned char or a signed char.
Ideally, when relying on the symbolic nature of the data, a portable program should always use signed char or unsigned chaz.
But many programs have been written using only a simple char, and the expectation street is a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine that wrote the program).
This option, and its antonym, makes such programs work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be clearly defined as signed char or unsigned char, even if it represents exactly one of them.
If no 'signed' or “unsigned” modifiers are explicitly stated, these options are used to define a signed bitfield (bitfield) or an unsigned bitfield.
By default, bitfields are signed, since the basic integer types they inherit, such as int, are signed numbers; however, if the `-traditional' option is specified, the bitfields are always unsigned numbers.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in a writable data section without any special treatment.
This is to be compatible with some old programs; their calculation of string constants is a very bad idea, and the '-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive summary
The impact of COVID-19 on the drug market
The impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, the disease has left health-care institutions too poor to handle and has nearly collapsed, and restrictions imposed by governments have caused serious disruptions in the global economy.
As for the drug market, the impact of the pandemic is unclear and difficult to predict, but it is likely to have far-reaching effects.
Some producers may be forced to find new ways to manufacture drugs, as both movement restrictions limit access to precursors and essential chemicals.
Traffickers are unable to cross the border due to travel restrictions and may have to find new routes and methods.
Patterns of drug use and delivery may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hampered.
The transformation brought about by COVID-19 is unprecedented, but we can still learn some lessons from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began searching for cheaper synthetic substances and switched their usage pattern to injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments have cut drug-related budgets.
If governments respond in the same way to the current economic downturn, interventions to prevent drug use and related risk behaviors and drug treatment services could be hit hard.
Furthermore, interdiction operations and international cooperation may be given less priority, making it easier for traffickers to act.
A number of countries have large amounts of drugs smuggled through commercial flights, and drug trafficking activities in these countries are expected to be the most directly affected.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in carry-on backpacks or in personal luggage, sometimes in large quantities. As restrictions on air passenger traffic are imposed almost everywhere, activities using commercial air travel to supply drugs may be completely interrupted.
Although the international postal supply chain has also been disrupted, the use of the dark web and the mailing of goods for trafficking is likely to increase.
In the long run, the economic downturn and associated lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment and lack of opportunities, poor and vulnerable people will be more likely to use drugs in harmful ways, develop drug addiction disorders, and switch to illegal drug-related activities, whether production or transportation.
Drug cartels may take advantage of this situation to provide services to vulnerable people and recruit new members to grow their ranks.
As the government's ability to respond declines, these changes are likely to quickly take root and become a new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market growth
The population growth pattern partly explains the reasons for market expansion
Drug use has been increasing all over the world, both in terms of overall numbers and in terms of the proportion of drug users in the world population.
In 2009, there were an estimated 210 million drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, while the estimated number of drug users in 2018 was 269 million, accounting for 5.3% of this population.
Over the past two decades, drug use in developing countries has grown far faster than developed countries.
This partly reflects the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but it also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Adolescents and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population of this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while the population of this age group in developed countries declined by 10%.
1 Urbanization is a driver of current and future drug markets
In both developed and developing countries, there is more drug use in urban areas than in rural areas.
The overall increase in drug use is partly due to the large-scale movement of people from rural to urban1 Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization may be a key factor in the future dynamics of drug markets, particularly in developing countries where urbanization trends are more pronounced.
Increased wealth is linked to increased drug use, yet the poorest people bear the greatest burden of disease worldwide, and drug use is more common in developed countries than in developing countries.
Drugs such as cocaine are even more strongly linked to the wealthiest regions of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the affluent sectors of society.
However, those with lower socioeconomic status have a higher rate of conversion to drug addiction.
Data from a few countries suggest a link between harmful drug use patterns and illness and low income.
These patterns seem to be less common in the more affluent social classes.
The economic constraints caused by the global COVID-19 crisis are likely to heighten the risks of the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment, have been linked to increased drug use in the past, and the pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people around the world to lose their jobs.
COVID-19 may cause the drug market to expand further. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause more farmers to increase or engage in illegal crop cultivation, or because of reduced control capacity of national authorities, or because more people may have to take risks and engage in illegal activities under the economic crisis.
The restrictions associated with COVID-19 have led to a reduction in air and land traffic, and maritime trafficking may have increased as a result. The risk of interception at sea is low, and there is more volume than air or land smuggling.
There have been recent reports of cocaine shipments directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Increased complexity
The emergence of substances not under international control is stable, but potentially harmful novel opioid types are increasing, and the drug market is becoming increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. Non-medical use of pharmaceuticals is also rapidly increasing.
Member States' domestic markets have around 500 novel active substances each year.
Currently, most of them are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid agonists and small amounts of opioids.
Although the overall amount of novel psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
Novel opioid psychoactive substances accounted for only 2% of the total number of novel psychoactive substances identified in 2014, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the novel opioid psychoactive substances are fentanyl analogues. Their efficacy and harm have been proven to have caused overdose deaths in North America, as well as in other regions, but to a lesser extent.
In North America, some fentanyl is used as a doping agent for heroin and other drugs, including cocaine and methamphetamine, while others are used to make counterfeit pharmaceutical opioids.
Some evidence suggests that Europe also has the phenomenon of doping with novel psychoactive substances: a study on the residues of abandoned syringes in six European cities found that many syringes contained novel psychoactive substances with stimulatory effects.”
2 The use of novel psychoactive substances may gradually become entrenched in vulnerable groups
A single class of novel psychoactive substances has almost never formed a large market.
But evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among marginalized groups such as homeless people and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported on the use of novel psychoactive substances in prisons, most of which identified synthetic cannabinoids as a major challenge.
Control of precursor chemicals forces drug makers to innovate Many of the chemicals most commonly used as precursors to synthesize drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and “ecstasy” have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and drug producers are always looking for alternatives, not only less controlled substances, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade control, so-called “special precursors.”
Restrictive measures aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug makers that rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests this is already a reality: in March 2020, a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia reportedly prompted a rise in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the US.
The market is changing rapidly
Synthetic drugs replace opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation
The opiates market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The number of opiates intercepted by Russian authorities has dropped by about 80 per cent, while the number of people receiving treatment for opioid use has been drastically reduced.
But the doping market seems to be booming.
There is evidence that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methephedrone and a-pyrrolidinylphenylpentanone, are now ubiquitous in the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities report that the number of recently seized clandestine processing sites that manufacture various illegal drugs has risen sharply, more than doubled in two years, to 152 processing sites in 2018.
Growth in methamphetamine markets in Afghanistan and Iraq
As early as 2012, surveys of personnel in hospitals, prisons and other institutions had revealed the importance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another worrisome major drug other than “fennethalin” and tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users saying marijuana is harder to obtain than “fennethalin” or methamphetamine.
Recently, the Iraqi authorities discovered multiple methamphetamine processing sites, and the Board has expressed concern over the massive import of pseudoephedrine preparations using these agents as precursors at a methamphetamine processing site.
In Afghanistan, methamphetamine production appears to have started in 2014.
Since then, there has been a steady rise in methamphetamine seizures.
But the amount seized in the first half of 2019 was 1,^657 kg — a sharp increase from the previous year.
Large amounts of methamphetamine believed to have originated in Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, which also indicates that the country's production is rising rapidly.
Policy changes and changing trends
Most of the jurisdictions that have legalized the non-medical use of marijuana have a trend of increasing marijuana use
Eleven jurisdictions in Canada, Uruguay, and the United States allow the manufacture of cannabis products for non-medical use.
Cannabis use has increased in most of these jurisdictions since legalization, although similar trends have been observed in other jurisdictions that have not legalized non-medical use of marijuana.
In Colorado and Washington, the first two states to pass legislation in the US, there has been an increase in non-medical use of marijuana among adults, particularly over the past month and the increase in daily or almost daily use, which has surpassed the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that cannabis use in Uruguay has increased since 2011, almost doubling last month.
This indicates that the increase is mainly due to the frequent and frequent use of marijuana.
Canada's short-term data also shows that while the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.
However, 40% of cannabis users still obtained certain products from illegal sources in 2019.
Is the reason behind the sharp drop in global cannabis herb seizures the legalization of marijuana?
In 2018, global cannabis herb seizures fell to their lowest level in 20 years due to declining seizures in North America, which fell 84% over the past 10 years.
By contrast, the volume of seizures in other parts of the world almost doubled during the same period. Seizure patterns suggest that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
The regulation of novel psychoactive substances appears to have a curbing effect. It is still difficult to evaluate the effects of domestic regulation of novel psychoactive substances.
Some countries with different regulatory systems for novel psychoactive substances have shown different prevalence rates of novel psychoactive substance use.
In other countries, there has been a decrease in the use of novel psychoactive substances after the adoption of domestic legislation.
Vulnerable groups face damage from the legal and illegal drug markets. Medicinal opioids used for pain management and palliative treatment mainly provide pain relievers in high-income countries and are unevenly distributed across regions.
In 2018, over 90% of all pharmaceutical opioids available for medical consumption were in high-income countries.
About 50% are in North America, 40% are in Europe, and 2% are in Oceania.
These countries account for about 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that low- and middle-income countries make up 88% of the global population, yet consume less than 10% of pharmaceutical opioids.
Barriers to access to medicinal opioids are linked to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescription practices.
Poorer people are at greater risk of developing drug addiction disorders. In 2018, about 35.6 million people had drug addiction conditions.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug use diseases and exacerbate their consequences. Studies from high-income countries confirm this. In these studies, an individual's unfavorable socio-economic trajectory is not only related to their condition at a certain point in time, but also to the risk of drug addiction symptoms.
Drug addiction also deepens socio-economic disadvantages and further increases the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These results may also be related to abusive attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, sexually diverse groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural settings may also be disproportionately affected by drug use or have problems accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability-Adjusted Life Span (DALY) index, which estimates the number of years of healthy life expectancy lost due to disability and premature death, the impact of harmful drug use on a wider range of societies has worsened over the past 10 years.
Between 2007 and 2018, there was a 17 per cent increase in global disability-adjusted life expectancy due to drug use.
Liver cancer associated with untreated hepatitis C, which is common among injecting drug users, increased the number of years of life expectancy was particularly high — up to 40%.
The complex relationship between drugs and violence makes it difficult to determine all the causal relationships between psychoactive substance use and violence.
Limited data from around the world suggest that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.
But alcohol appears to play a greater role than drugs in violent incidents.
Although drug use may lead to crime, in some cases this link may be due in part to a variety of mediating factors, such as socio-economic disadvantages and other types of adversity caused by personal risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The link between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized crime, including international drug trafficking, is likely to be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the existence and extent of violence depends not so much on the amount of trafficking as on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power among organized criminal groups, such as changes in the size of illegal markets, the death or imprisonment of well-known criminals, and enforcement measures that make one group weaker than another.
The latest trends
Drug use of marijuana is the most commonly used substance, and opioids are the most harmful
It is estimated that 192 million people used marijuana in 2018, making it the most used drug in the world.
By contrast, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the harms associated with opioids have been ignored due to fewer users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths associated with drug use conditions in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and 50% of the 21 million years of life believed to have been lost due to disability or premature death due to drug use were caused by these substances.
Non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, it is tramadol that is exacerbating the opioid crisis; in North America it is fentanyl. The two regions have little in common in terms of economies, demographics, or general drug use patterns, yet they are struggling to fight the opioid crisis fueled by substances that are easily available and low in production costs.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids such as fentanyl has led to an increase in the number of deaths due to opioid overdose over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the US involved fentanyl.
Canada also reported similar results, but the numbers were lower.
Part of the cause of fentanyl overdose deaths is the unpredictable efficacy of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the market for non-medical use of tramadol has grown significantly.
In this region, more and more patients with tramadol use conditions are being treated.
In 2017, the majority of trout horses intercepted worldwide increased significantly, reaching a peak value of over 125 tons.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating tramadol, global seizures fell to 32 tons.
What contributed to the crisis in these two places was the simplicity of manufacture and low production costs, in addition to the lack of international regulation of tramadol and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
What worsens the crisis in both places is that these substances are available in both drug markets and illegal markets, making it more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.
Stimulant use continues to increase
The stimulants sector is dominated by cocaine and methamphetamine, both of which are increasing in use in their main markets.
About 19 million people used cocaine in 2018 because of its popularity in North America and Western Europe.
About 27 million people used amphetamines in the same year, with methamphetamine being the most used amphetamine-type stimulant in South-East Asia and North America.
According to most of the available indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has continued to expand over the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes replacing each other. As the usage of one drug increases, the use of another drug decreases, sometimes simultaneously increasing and decreasing to meet the needs of the same market.
COVID-19 increases the risk of injecting drug users
According to estimates, there were about 11.3 million injecting drug users in 2018, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drug use.
More than 1 million people are infected with HIV among injecting drug users, and 5.5 million people are infected with hepatitis C.
In 2017, about 585,000 people died from drug addiction. Half of them died from liver disease caused by hepatitis C, yet most of those injecting drug users still have not been treated for hepatitis C.
5 Opioid shortages due to COVID-19 restrictions may cause users to replace more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injections or inject more frequently, more harmful uses may occur.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU officials: The acceptance process is a bottleneck step by step. -Xinhua
EU summit bickers over refugee policy. EU official: There are bottlenecks at every step of the acceptance process
[Niu Ruifei, Special Correspondent of the Global Times in Belgium] According to an AFP report on February 10, at the latest EU summit on the same day, European Commission President von der Leyen said that EU leaders agreed to introduce stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to expel illegal immigrants.
According to reports, the EU's move is a response to Europe's growing concerns about illegal immigration. Today, the EU's core problem is that the number of illegal immigrants who can eventually be deported is very small.
According to the summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to “immediately mobilize large amounts of EU funds” to strengthen the external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and member states continue to quarrel over issues such as payment of fence fees.
Von der Leyen has stated time and again that EU funds will not pay the relevant expenses.
However, diplomats from some member states say that if the EU can share the part of installing cameras, observation towers, and other infrastructure along the external border, this will free up national budgets for countries and thus speed up the construction process.
According to the European Euractiv website, EU officials acknowledge that there are bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process. Limited acceptance capacity and the overburdened immigration authorities of member states cannot prevent refugees from submitting “countless” asylum applications in EU countries, and that the EU refugee reception system is in an almost “permanent crisis.”
According to European Commission estimates, EU Schengen countries received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, an increase of nearly half over the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded more than 330,000 illegal entries last year.
In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on a “principle” that EU countries can return illegal immigrants to their country based on another member state's court decision.
Furthermore, the report said that EU leaders also agreed to “increase the use of the concept of a secure country,” which will pave the way for the EU to draw up a common list.

America's escalation of the “chip war” hits the global semiconductor industry-Sinomine.com
Recently, the US “chip war” against China has escalated — first, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on exports of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China under pressure from the US; foreign media later reported that the US government was considering cutting off all ties between US suppliers and Huawei and prohibiting US suppliers from supplying any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to issue an executive order restricting US investment in the sensitive Chinese technology industry... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US continued to make bad moves to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the US has never stopped cracking down on China's “core” development. While accurately suppressing the semiconductor production supply chain to China, it is building a “de-Chinesized” semiconductor industry chain alliance in an attempt to completely “throw out” China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it is winning over South Korea to establish a “technology alliance,” or establishing a “quadripartite alliance” for chips with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or using mechanisms such as the “quadripartite mechanism” and “Indo-Pacific economic framework” between the US, Japan, India, and Australia, or the “Indo-Pacific Economic Framework” to establish a “small circle” in the semiconductor industry chain, the US has introduced politicized, camped, and weaponized means in an attempt to establish a closed production and supply chain cycle dominated by the US to make up for its shortcomings in the chip manufacturing field and maintain its dominant position in the global chip industry.
However, America's “core tactic” against China with great fanfare is also “injuring 1,000 enemies and causing 800 self-damage.”
Recently, Fanlin Group, a well-known American chip manufacturing equipment supplier, announced that due to the latest round of chip manufacturing equipment export bans to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography giant Dutch Asmarck Holding Company recently warned that a ban on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to a rise in semiconductor prices.
According to US media analysis, after the US government imposed an outrageous crackdown on China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies suffered greatly, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.
America's so-called crackdown on China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and has already formed a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain.
According to expert estimates, based on a specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products requires crossing the borders of various countries more than 70 times, reaching 100 days.
Although the US semiconductor industry has a strong foundation, manufacturing capacity, especially advanced manufacturing technology, is weak, and it relies heavily on the East Asian region.
Even if the US makes every effort to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain to a “small circle” dominated by the US, it is difficult to change the regional distribution and interdependence of semiconductor-related industries around the world.
The United States has strongly “reshaped” and “de-Chinized” the semiconductor industry chain, severely impacting the global semiconductor industry.
Chips are the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry is inseparable from the participation of countries around the world.
In recent years, the US has taken a series of unilateral actions to successively introduce the “Innovation and Competition Act”, “2022 US Competition Act” and “Chip and Science Act” to use technological hegemony to consolidate the country's technological leadership; “win and win” on allies to induce chip manufacturers such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the US to try to ensure America's global leadership position in the chip field.
In the short term, the US has indeed caused trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, and has reaped real benefits.
However, in the long run, the US's hysterical crackdown has forced the Chinese chip industry to make continuous breakthroughs, causing itself to lose the huge Chinese market. Ultimately, it will greatly weaken the will and ability of American technology companies to innovate, and damage the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products can only be held for 360 days at the earliest. -Sinomine.com
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products went on sale
You can choose from 7 products from the agency and hold them for as little as 360 days
Personal pension wealth management products are finally online.
On February 10, China Wealth Management Network released the list of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products. Seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, Agricultural Bank Wealth Management, and China Post Wealth Management were officially released.
At this point, the “shelf” of personal pension accounts has finally gathered four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension financial management, personal pension insurance, and personal pension public funds.
According to reports, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products were all publicly funded net worth open products, including 5 new products and 2 surviving products. Except for 1 product, which is a hybrid product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income products.
A Beijing Youth Daily reporter saw that 4 of the 5 new products were from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which were fixed income products. The minimum holding periods were 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, respectively. The corresponding performance comparison benchmarks (annualized) were 3.70 percent - 4.20 percent, 4.10 percent - 4.60 percent, 4.40 percent - 4.90 percent, and 5.75 percent, respectively.
The remaining new product is “Post Bank Wealth Tianyi Hongjin holds as little as 1,095 days 1”. It is also a fixed income product. The fundraising began on February 10 and ended on February 19. The risk level is level 2.
Of the two surviving products, one is Agricultural Bank Wealth Management's “Agricultural Bank Concentric and Smart” 360-day technology innovates RMB wealth management products. The investment nature is mixed, and the risk level is level 3.
Another surviving product is “Post Bank Wealth Tianyi Hongjin Holds 365 Days 1”, a fixed income type. The fundraising began on December 30 last year. It officially went into operation on January 4 this year, with a cumulative net worth of 1.0011 on February 8.
According to the “Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Promoting the Development of Personal Pensions”, financial products that can be invested in personal pension fund account funds include bank financial management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, public funds, etc.
The release of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marks that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November of last year, the Banking Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the “Interim Measures on the Administration of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies”.
The “Measures” stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension products such as personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public fund products through personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the three departments of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Administration of Taxation issued notices clarifying that the personal pension system will be implemented in Beijing, Tianjin, and 36 pioneering cities and regions, including Shijiazhuang and Xiong'an New District in Hebei, and Jincheng in Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, the number of individual pension participants was 19.54 million, and the number of contributors was 6.13 million, with a total contribution amount of 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, banks participating in the pilot had listed only three types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension insurance products, and personal pension public funds.
Now that personal pension wealth management products are also available, how should investors choose?
Experts from the BOCOM Wealth Management Product Research and Development Department said that compared to other personal pension products, the pilot phase of the pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products all have three characteristics.
The first is prudence. The risk management mechanism is more complete, investment strategies and ideas are more stable, and independent hosting is implemented by a third party other than the parent bank.
Second, they are long-term. The term of all pension wealth management products in the pilot phase is 5 years or more. The minimum holding period for personal pension wealth management products to be issued in the next step is 1 year in principle, and holdings of at least 3 years are encouraged.
Third, inclusiveness. The purchase threshold for products is low. The starting point of purchase is generally 1 yuan, and some are as low as 0.01 yuan. The rates for product hosting fees, management fees, etc. are even more favorable.
Experts pointed out that investors should choose according to product characteristics and their risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long terms, high interest rates, and high safety, and are suitable for people with poor risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection and are more suitable for people who cannot bear investment risks and can accept stable returns; while personal pension wealth management products and public fund products do not protect capital or income, have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are high, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and high risk bearing ability.

The fitness industry should get rid of the crisis of trust-Sinomine.com
Another big gym “thunderstorm”?
Recently, the issue of rights protection for members of Zhongjian Fitness, a well-known fitness institution, attracted public attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members discovered that their stores were not operating normally. Afterwards, rumors about the agency going out of business caused members to panic, causing public security and social affairs departments to intervene.
Finally, the relevant person in charge of the agency came forward to respond, promising that efforts would be made to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members before the storm was brought to an end.
Some stores of individual fitness institutions have had business problems and are temporarily closed. Consumers could have been calm and wait for the problem to be solved. Why is the first reaction of so many members “big things not good”?
Behind the fitness club members' rights protection storm is the deep-seated issue of the industry's trust crisis.
Traditional gyms in China generally adopt a prepaid model, and “making money users don't get” is the underlying logic of their development.
Obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores seems to be able to cycle back and forth. In fact, Yin eats food and is unable to form a stable profit model.
Negative information from gyms and other industries is frequently coming out, which has had a strong impact on consumer confidence.
Judging from market prospects, gyms can of course be considered a good business with “money.”
Despite the ups and downs of fitness tracks, they have always received capital attention.
According to various data, the popularity of fields such as cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, and the market continues to pick up.
Specifically with regard to the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the concept of a healthy lifestyle, the fitness industry has great potential for development.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after consumption has recovered. Having just emerged from the crisis, they are also sounding the trumpet of opening up land, investing all of their financing funds into the construction of new stores.
It is undeniable that due to the impact of the epidemic in recent years, many institutions have withdrawn, and the industry has been reshuffled. At this time, powerful enterprises have selectively stepped up their acquisition efforts and restructured. Failure to explore this is not a new opportunity.
However, if the fitness market is to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on the steady and far-reaching Kangzhuang Avenue, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.
Only by working steadily and re-establishing consumers' trust and sense of security can we truly win the market and win the future.
Compared to building a new store to seize the market, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to calm down to optimize services and use high-quality development to stabilize users.
First, it's up to the service to retain users.
Gyms belong to the service industry. Their essence is to adhere to “user orientation”, focus closely on user needs, and focus operations on improving service quality and upgrading.
Second, it is up to digital transformation to improve the user experience.
For example, the current popular internet gym model allows users to pay per time and choose the venue.
At the same time, physical data and exercise data can be effectively utilized to meet social needs and achieve a closed loop of complete services from online to offline.
Without private education promotions and huge annual passes, users' concerns about fitness institutions “running” have been reduced, and their sense of trust has also increased.
Furthermore, it is also necessary to actively explore diverse business formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from a single service to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become new consumers. Peripheral products such as exercise supplements and fitness equipment required for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with richer choices.

Nanjing property market reproduces “price difference compensation” -Sinomine.com
Yangzi Evening News (Reporter Ma Zuobo) The Yangzi Evening News/Ziniu News reporter discovered in an interview on the 10th that the “insurance price agreement” that had not been seen in more than 10 years had returned to the Nanjing property market. A property located in the Jiangbei New Area claimed “price difference compensation.” The discount on other properties was greater than the previous discount before the house was handed over, and the developers were willing to exchange and refund the difference in price for the buyer.
There are quite a few “insurance agreement” conditions
The name of this property in the Jiangbei New Area is Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. The housekeeper, Mr. Sun, told the reporter that he discovered a “statement” while visiting the property last weekend.
The picture he sent to the reporter showed that the developer of the property promised that anyone who purchased the property between February 1 and February 28 from the date the two parties signed the purchase and sale contract until the delivery of the corresponding property, if the preferential discount for other properties in the project is greater than the discount previously enjoyed by the purchase of the house (limited to other unsold commercial properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type as the commercial property), the developer can exchange the house for the buyer and refund the difference in price.
Mr. Sun said that the real estate consultant said that this is actually an “insured price agreement”. The purpose is to reassure the buyer and not worry about the development company's price reduction promotion. “Now I'm afraid that the price will drop once I've bought it. There's no time to go to the sales office; if you don't make a fuss, I'm really worried.”
There are also quite a few buyers who think that although the “insurance price agreement” is a “reassurance pill” for buyers, the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who is planning to buy a house she just needed in Jiangbei, said that the first thing to insured property is to have the same apartment type; it also has to be in the same building and unit. There are few properties that buyers can compare prices, so the “threshold” is still quite high.
There are also buyers who think that due to asymmetric information and additional concessions are not ruled out when selling, it is not too difficult for buyers to “defend their rights.”
Whether it can keep buyers remains to be seen
The reporter inquired online real estate in Nanjing and learned that in November of last year, the property led the sale of a total of 252 units in the two buildings. The apartment area was 105 square meters, 114 square meters, 129 square meters, etc., and the average price of the fully furnished license was 39,843 yuan/㎡.
However, more than two months have passed, and online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this property is currently 157, accounting for 62.3%. Of these, Building 8 has a total of 128 units, and the number of unsold units has reached 113. Of the 124 units in Building 7, 44 units are also unsold. The total number of units sold for the project is only 33, accounting for only 13%.
According to market sources, “insurance price agreements” also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, in order to attract the attention of buyers, Hengtang Xiyuan, a real estate on Huangshan Road in Hexi, launched the “Price Insurance Plan”. The details were “The company solemnly promises that if the project discount margin expands within one year, the difference resulting from this will be refunded to the old owners.”
Since then, in 2011/4, 9 properties in Nanjing also offered part of their listings and promised to “pay the difference in price.”
“The property market is picking up, and a 'strength agent' is needed even more at this time.
Mr. Shen, a senior trader in the Nanjing real estate industry, said that “insured price agreements” are also one of the marketing methods for housing enterprises.
He believes that development companies now need more confidence than buyers; the introduction of an “insured price agreement” is actually encouraging them.
As to whether buyers can be retained, he said that this depends on the influence of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, so it remains to be seen.
Multiple data decline, Taiwan's economy did not perform well at the beginning of the year.-Sinomine.com
Xinhua News Agency report of February 11 from Taipei (by staff reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) - Export trade volume has been “in a row”, the manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) has been tightening for 7 consecutive months, and the consumer price index (CPI) has also seen “3 letters”... Recently, the Taiwanese authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
According to expert analysis, Taiwan's economy did not perform well at the beginning of the year, and the pressure on growth was not small.
According to an announcement from the financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities, Taiwan exported 31.51 billion US dollars in January this year, a decrease of 21.2% per year, for the 5th consecutive month of negative growth.
Compared with the same period last year, the export value of 11 major export categories all experienced a decline.
Plastic rubber, its products, and optical equipment saw the deepest decline, with annual declines of 37.6% and 35.7%, respectively.
Exports of electronic components fell 20.1% a year, the biggest decline in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits declined by 18.3% per year, the biggest decline in 14 years.
The department's statistics director, Choi Mei Na, said that this shows that the effects of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry are spreading, and that the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that Taiwan's imports and exports both fell in January, and the excess amount was only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in the past 3 years.
The financial affairs department of the Taiwan authorities believes that global demand for terminals has declined, industrial adjustments have curbed manufacturers' willingness to buy materials, that the decline in exports is unlikely to improve in the short term, and that Taiwan's export decline in the first quarter of this year is likely to be higher than expected.
According to the release of Taiwan's Chinese Economic Research Institute, Taiwan's manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) for January this year was 40.4% after seasonal adjustment, down 3.3 percentage points from December last year, and contracted for 7 consecutive months.
In the economic monitoring index system, the PMI uses 50% as the boom and bust line, and the index is greater than 50%, representing economic expansion, and conversely, contraction.
Among the five components of Taiwan's PMI in January, new orders were added, production and manpower employment were tightened, supplier delivery times declined, and inventories were tight.
All six major industries reported PMI tightening, with the power and mechanical equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optics industry (35.2%), chemical and biotechnology medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation industry (42.6%), and food and textile industry (45.7%) according to the rate of tightening.
On the price side, the Taiwan administration's “General Comptroller's Office” announced that Taiwan's CPI had an annual increase of 3.04% in January this year, breaking through 3% again since July last year.
Among them, vegetable prices soared 28.25% to a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, special member of Taiwan's “General Comptroller's Office”, admits that the increase in food prices did exceed expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI for January and February this year should be close to 2.71% of December last year. Inflationary pressure still exists, and it is still at a high point.
Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, according to reports from the island's media such as “United Daily” and “Yahoo Finance,” experts expressed pessimism.
Wu Daren, professor of economics at Taiwan's “Chung-Ang University”, analyzed that the decline in exports may cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing companies, and the risk of debt default increases.
At the same time, fewer orders have caused manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impacted consumption capacity.
Qiu Dasheng, a researcher at the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, believes that the inflation situation in Europe and the US is unresolved this year, demand continues to shrink, and it is estimated that Taiwan's export decline will continue until the first half of the year.
Since Taiwan's economy is supported by exports and is affected by the slump in exports, the annual economic growth performance will not be as good as last year.
“An important engine for global recovery” -.com
“In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has shown strong resilience.
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
Julio Rios, a well-known Spanish expert on China and an honorary adviser to the China Policy Watch Network, said in an interview with this newspaper reporter a few days ago that China's epidemic prevention and control has now entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further unleashed.
Rios said that in the face of the impact of various factors exceeding expectations, China has responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is unswervingly expanding its openness to the outside world, the endogenous dynamics of economic development are constantly increasing, and state-owned enterprises and private enterprises are developing collaboratively.
Every year, China's National Two Conferences are held. Delegates and members discuss national development plans, discuss hot issues of people's livelihood, forge broad consensus, gather people's hearts and minds, and gather wisdom to add strength to China's development.
“Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and has now entered a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to China's wisdom and China's solutions, and expects China's development to bring new opportunities to the world.
Rios said that at present, China is making every effort to promote scientific and technological innovation and inject new impetus into economic and social development. “Capital investment, talent development, and policy incentives make China continue to be full of vitality in the new five-year plan.”
In Rios's view, reforming the economic system is a difficult task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China leverages not only the strengths of the market economy but also the superiority of the socialist system and takes proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting the development of private enterprises, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing industries, insisting on innovative development, promoting employment, raising the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meeting people's multi-level diversified consumption needs... China fully, accurately and comprehensively implements the new development concept, focuses on promoting high-quality development, and constructing a new development pattern will bring more opportunities for growth to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the joint “Belt and Road” initiative.
“Steady economic recovery after the pandemic is a common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world and become an important engine for global recovery.
Rios said he looks forward to the joint establishment of “Belt and Road” cooperation to continue to play its important role in improving infrastructure levels in various fields and strengthening connectivity in various fields, and continue to unleash greater momentum.

Henan Province regulates the price of integrated dental implant medical services-Sinomine.com
CCTV News: Dental implants are an ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the price of each tooth has always discouraged many patients.
Since this year, with the accelerated implementation of dental implant collection, various regions have also put dental implant price reductions on the agenda.
Starting February 10, the price of a single conventional dental implant medical service in Henan Province is 4,300 yuan, and the cost of the whole process of a single routine dental implant is not higher than 97% of the regulation target.
Dental implants refer to a missing tooth repair method that supports and fixes the upper tooth restoration body based on a lower structure implanted in bone tissue.
The reporter learned from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University that, taking a single routine implant as an example, the price from implantation to final restoration is roughly 167,000 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that in my situation it was about 8,000 yuan, less than 10,000 yuan, which is basically half the savings.
On the basis of current projects, Henan Province has also integrated and determined 15 dental implant medical service price items, including “implant implants (single tablet),” uniformly formulated prices and medical insurance payment categories for public medical institutions managed by the province, and cancelled or adjusted 20 medical service price items such as dental implant implants.
Li Yunjie, Director of the Pharmaceutical Prices and Bidding and Procurement Department of the Zhengzhou Municipal Medical Security Bureau: The main beneficiaries are medical insurance; medical insurance expenses are less; patients will increase appropriately when the pressure on hospitals is less; suppliers get a market; for our patients, it is the side that benefits the most; for our patients, the cost of implanting a tooth may have to be halved or even more.

“New variables” have emerged in the e-commerce industry in China. How can delivery achieve “content is king”?
-.com
China News Network, Feb. 11: “New variables” have emerged in China's e-commerce industry. How can delivery achieve “content is king”?
Sino-Singapore Finance Reporter Xia Bin
“It was too late for us to enter e-commerce, but we realized from the beginning that if we want to stand out from the tens of millions of stores, content is important.
” Fang Fang, a “post-90s” girl from Guangdong, now runs a nutritional food store on Douyin e-commerce, making an offline store with a history of more than 30 years “blossom” online.
Imitating the tunes of old Hong Kong movies with classic Cantonese songs, open @芳芳一人食抖音账号. The beautiful videos are refreshing.
At the Douyin e-commerce “Find Peers · Quality Content Sharing Session” held recently, Fang Fang spoke as a representative of quality creators and introduced her daily creative experiences and experiences.
She said on the scene, “The carefully polished video has garnered a lot of attention from netizens. Many people are interested in our ingredients and want to cook food with them, and sales channels have opened up all of a sudden.
”
Fang Fang relied on the soup cooking video to make more people fall in love with the “taste of old people”. A live broadcast sold up to 300,000 pieces of nutritional ingredients, saving his family's old store that was on the verge of going out of business.
“No content, no e-commerce”. With the continuous development of short video and live e-commerce, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early days of live streaming delivery, live broadcast rooms often used low price discounts to attract users, and the price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been phenomenal figures such as Liu Yihong and Oriental Selection, as well as many unwell-known experts and merchants that have emerged in vertical segments. They have enhanced long-term business efficiency by continuously creating high-quality content that matches their brand tone.
Gao Yaxuan, head of operation of Douyin E-Commerce Star Author, explained that in the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized content through Douyin e-commerce. Their content creation volume has increased by 252%, and the total turnover has more than doubled.
“Behind these numbers, we can feel a thriving, vibrant author ecosystem.
” Gao Yaxuan said.
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the “E-commerce Industry Content Ecological Health Index (ECHI) Report”, which analyzed the “new variable” in the current e-commerce industry — the importance of high-quality content — from a data perspective, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the e-commerce industry content ecological health index ranking of the above report, Douyin e-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and Jingdong rank in the top five.
According to the report, the e-commerce industry's content ecosystem is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce with content, but not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (professional production content) and UGC (user original content) are high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the consumption and promotion scenarios, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, and the stronger the commercial value.
On the scene, Yu Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University and chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Committee, gave an analysis and interpretation of the “Report.”
He said that as far as content value is concerned, the e-commerce industry has now transitioned from “consumption accessibility” to the “consumption quality” stage. High-quality, professional, and differentiated content is the “hard currency” of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and starting point of the new stage of e-commerce development, and PGC content such as knowledge payments, professional knowledge, and KOLs (key opinion leaders) are beginning to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking forward to the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming put forward two suggestions.
One is to promote the overall improvement of the ecological health and quality of e-commerce content from the perspective of improving the content structure, establish positive content creation and management standards, and achieve a balance between the e-commerce industry's content ecological health system index and dynamics.
The other is that from the perspective of the external ecology, it is necessary to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and value collaboration and co-creation of the external environment.
“The future e-commerce industry also needs more data and artificial intelligence support to predict future development stability; in addition, it provides merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, realizes value synergy between enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and co-creates a healthy content ecosystem.

Xinhua News Agency report of February 11 from Beijing: Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project - Four discussions on deeply understanding General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the seminar on studying and implementing the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Party
Commentator of Xinhua News Agency
“Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires an integrated approach, systematic planning, and overall promotion to properly handle a series of major relationships between top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and strategy, integrity and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and self-improvement, and openness to the outside world.
” At the opening ceremony of the seminar for new members of the Central Committee, alternate members and leading cadres at the provincial ministry level to study and implement Xi Jinping's ideology of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era and the spirit of the 20th National Congress of the Party, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the rules of modernization and thoroughly and systematically clarified a series of major relationships that need to be handled in practice, providing us with a scientific methodology for vigorously advancing Chinese-style modernization.
Promoting Chinese-style modernization involves various fields such as the economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization. It is related to all aspects of governing the Party, the country, and the military, internal affairs, diplomacy, and national defense. It is necessary not only to do a good job in systematic planning, but also to be brave in reform and innovation to continuously achieve overall progress.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to have deep insight into the general development trend of the world, accurately grasp the common wishes of the masses, and thoroughly explore the laws of economic and social development, so that the formulated plans and policy systems reflect the times, grasp regularity, and be creative, so as to achieve integration between near and far, vertical integration, and content coordination.
Advancing Chinese-style modernization is an exploratory undertaking. There are also many uncharted fields. It requires bold exploration in practice to promote career development through reform and innovation. We must not carve out a sword or wait for the rabbit.
The strategic issue is a fundamental issue for a political party and a country.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to enhance the forward-looking nature of the strategy, anticipate the future and lead the future with a scientific strategy; it is necessary to enhance the overall nature of the strategy, focus on solving major issues relating to the rise and fall of the cause of the Party and the state and move the whole body; to enhance the stability of the strategy. Once the strategy is formed, it is necessary to persevere for a long time, grasp it to the end, and make good achievements.
It is necessary to scientifically grasp the dialectical unification relationship between strategy and strategy, organically combine the principles of strategy with the flexibility of strategy, be flexible, adapt randomly, make ad hoc decisions, and grasp strategic initiative in adapting to local conditions, moving according to the situation, and following the trend.
The Chinese nation is an honest and innovative nation.
To handle the relationship between integrity and innovation, it is necessary not only to protect the origin, roots and soul of Chinese-style modernization, unswervingly adhere to the Chinese characteristics, essential requirements and major principles of Chinese modernization to ensure the correct direction of Chinese-style modernization, but also place innovation in a prominent position in the overall development of the country, conform to the development requirements of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively recognize change and seek change, and vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously shape the new advantages of development energy, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation of fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only create higher efficiency than capitalism, but also maintain social fairness more effectively, so as to better balance, promote, and unify efficiency and fairness.
Handle the relationship between efficiency and fairness, and continuously achieve development for the people, development depends on the people, and the results of development are shared by the people, so that the achievements of the modernization drive benefit all people more and more fairly.
To advance Chinese-style modernization, it is necessary to handle the relationship between vitality and order, so that society is both full of vitality and stability and order.
It is necessary to coordinate the two major issues of development and security, implement the overall national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to maintain national security, and firmly safeguard the country's regime security, institutional security, ideological security, and security in key areas.
It not only takes more account of security factors in development, enhances national security strength through development, and uses development achievements to consolidate the foundation of national security, but is also good at creating a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, continuously stimulating development vitality, and achieving healthy interaction between high-quality development and a high level of security.
To promote Chinese-style modernization, we must not only stick to our own path, but also expand our vision of the world, insist on opening up to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of Chinese-style modernization.
We must insist on independence, self-reliance and self-improvement, insist on placing the development of the country and nation on the basis of our own strength, and insist on firmly grasping the fate of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
It is necessary to continuously expand a high level of opening-up to the outside world, participate deeply in the division of labor and cooperation in global industries, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space for Chinese-style modernization, share development opportunities in mutual benefit and win-win situation, and create a better future together.
You can only get far by following the path.
Under the strong leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core and under the guidance of Xi Jinping's ideology and science of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, let us grasp the rules, give full play to our enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity, properly handle a series of major relationships, work hard on the new journey of comprehensively building a modern socialist country, and continue to open up new horizons of Chinese-style modernization.
(Deutsche Welle Chinese.com) This Friday (February 10), the Biden administration blacklisted 6 Chinese entities suspected of participating in the spy balloon program.
The US Department of Commerce said that these 5 Chinese companies and 1 research institute helped modernize the Chinese military, especially aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
It is difficult for blacklisted companies to obtain US technology exports.
The list is called an “entity list” (entity list), and listed companies will not be able to purchase technology or goods from US suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the US Department of Commerce.
The blacklisted companies are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., 48th Research Institute of China Electronics Technology Group, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to that, the White House said it was considering more extensive measures to “uncover and deal with” China's larger surveillance activities threatening US national security.
The balloon incident triggered further tension between China and the US, and US Secretary of State Brinken cancelled his visit to China.
The US shot down the balloon on February 4. The Chinese government made serious representations to the US Embassy in China, criticizing the US for seriously impacting and damaging the efforts and progress of the two sides to stabilize Sino-US relations.
From existing evidence of the wreckage and information from the Chinese military's procurement platform, the US government has concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon “has a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army” and that it is a supplier approved by the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Mao Ning said at a press conference on Friday that China has explained the situation and clarified its position on the accident where a Chinese airship with no people mistakenly entered US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, she added that the relevant US congressional resolution was pure political manipulation and hype.
The Chinese side is strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed to this.
Matthew Axelrod (Matthew Axelrod), Assistant Secretary of Commerce in charge of export enforcement at the US Department of Commerce, said: “Today's action shows that we have identified and stopped China's joint efforts to use spy balloons. These balloons have violated the airspace of the United States and more than 40 countries.
”
Reuters reports that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. said he was unaware of the sanctions and declined to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the US has yet to comment on this information.

(Deutsche Welle Chinese.com) A few days have passed since the earthquakes occurred in Turkey and parts of Syria, and hopes of finding survivors are getting slimmer. However, a family of five rescued on Saturday made search and rescue personnel extremely happy.
According to the Associated Press, in the hardest-hit town of Nurdai in Gaziantep province, this family of five was successfully rescued after being stranded under ruins for more than five days.
Search and rescue personnel first pulled the mother and daughter out of the rubble, then found the father, but he insisted that his son and another daughter be saved first.
When they had all been rescued, there was cheering in the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, under severe cold weather conditions, a 16-year-old teenager and a 70-year-old elder were also successfully rescued.
“What day is it today?
” — This teenager, who has been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours, asked the rescuers who rescued him after being brought back to the ground.

The miraculous successful rescue case brought a glimmer of light to the already hopeless search and rescue work, yet at the same time, the number of victims continued to rise.
Currently, according to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has killed more than 20,000 people in Turkey, and the death toll in neighboring Syria is estimated to be over 3,500.
Although experts say people can survive for at most a week or more after being trapped in ruins, hopes of finding more survivors have become increasingly slim.
Rescuers are still using thermal imagers to search for signs of life under the rubble.
Meanwhile, the focus of rescue efforts began to shift to helping survivors in desperate need of help.

The stock price of the parent company of Google's AI chatbot “answered the wrong question” evaporated by 100 billion US dollars
(Comprehensive report from the 11th)
Google's newly launched artificial intelligence chatbot, Bard, was at a disadvantage. It “answered the wrong question” in the promotional video, causing the stock price of Google's parent company Alphabet to plummet 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark, and the market capitalization evaporated by 110 billion US dollars (about RM476.5 billion). As of Friday's market closing report was 94.57 US dollars.
The market is worried that Alphabet will fall short of rival Microsoft.
According to the “Reuters” report, Google posted a promotional video for the AI chatbot Bard on social media earlier. In the video, someone asked Bard: “Can I tell my 9-year-old child what new discoveries about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have been discovered?
” In response, Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first picture of a planet outside our solar system.
However, according to NASA data, the first picture of a planet outside the solar system was taken by the European Southern Observatory's “Very Large Telescope” in 2004.
“Reuters” also reported on the title “Alphabet's stock price plummeted after Bard gave a wrong answer.”
On the other hand, Google notes that Bard's response “highlights the importance of a rigorous testing process” and will combine external feedback with his own internal testing to ensure that Bard's response “meets high standards based on quality, security, and real information.”
Singapore's tourism industry is recovering strongly, and the number of inbound visitors increased 19 times over 2021
(Comprehensive report of the 11th) The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that it expects the number of international visitors to Singapore to reach 12 million to 14 million in 2023, bringing in about 18 billion to 21 billion Singapore dollars in tourism revenue; the number of visitors and tourism revenue will return to the level of about 67% to 75% before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019; and there is a high possibility that the tourism industry will fully recover in 2024.
The Singapore travel market will gradually restart and recover in 2022.
According to the latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board, the number of inbound visitors in 2022 increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million, surpassing the MGTO's earlier estimate of 4 million to 6 million, and visitors have recovered to the level of 33% before the pandemic.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled S$8.96 billion. It is estimated that tourism revenue for the full year of 2022 will reach S$13.8 billion to S$14.3 billion, an increase of 6 to 7 times over S$1.89 billion in 2021. It has returned to the level of about 50% to 52% before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken a number of measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced an allocation of nearly S$500 million to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The MGTO announced a few days ago that it plans to allocate S$110 million from this budget over the next two years to launch more commercial and leisure activities to attract travelers back.
In order to make health and wellness one of Singapore's tourist highlights, the Singapore Tourism Board announced a call for intentions on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists have placed physical health at the top of all considerations.
The development of a health and wellness attraction in the Binhai South Area, which has Gardens by the Bay and the Waterfront Embankment, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism and economy, allowing visitors to spend and stay in Singapore longer.
Singapore Tourism Board Director Chan Kin-lung said that in the next few years, health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
To this end, the Tourism Board has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board hosted the first Health and Wellness Festival, providing the public with more than 130 health activities and experiences of all kinds.
Singapore will continue to provide visitors with new travel experiences.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, Sentosa Central Beach Market, the Sentosa Central Beach Market, and the new “Exploring New Frontiers” exhibition hall at the Art and Science Museum, the MGTO will support the development and renewal of projects such as Wantai Wildlife World's Bird Park, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will set relevant industry standards for conferences, exhibitions and incentives for the sustainable development of the tourism industry within 2023, and focus on improving the two major issues of waste treatment and carbon emissions to further optimize the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry has accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
According to the data, as of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Changi Airport has recovered strongly. It has received 150,000 passengers every day, about 1 million passengers per week, which is equivalent to about 75% of what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of employees working in the aviation industry has also returned to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
According to the data, from January to October 2022, Singapore has received 23.6 million visitors, equivalent to 42% before the COVID-19 pandemic. The number of flights taking off and landing was 170,000, which is 53% of what it was before the pandemic.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry has also driven the pace of recovery in industries such as accommodation, transportation, catering and shopping.
The Singapore government and the tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
Ke Shudan, Assistant Director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, said that according to a survey by a Chinese travel platform, Singapore's safety index ranks in the top three in the world. This is also one of the reasons why Singapore is loved by Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, China traveled to Singapore every year for about 3.6 million vacations.
As China relaxes its border policy, the number of Chinese tourists is expected to return to 30% to 60% of 2019 this year.
Ko Shudan pointed out that next, the MGTO will pay close attention to further signals released by China regarding outbound travel policies to cope with changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board will actively prepare to welcome Chinese tourists in response to the new trends emerging in travel outside of China.
Looking ahead to the 2023 travel market, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that as long as there is no significant recession in the global economy affecting public revenue and there are no new large-scale fatal outbreaks, the pace of tourism recovery will be faster than expected.
Kim Jong-un's father and daughter interacted with his close wife were snubbed
(General report of 11th) On the evening of the 8th, North Korea held a military parade for the 75th anniversary of Army Day. Kim Ju-ae, the daughter of leader Kim Jong-un, not only attended, but also stood on the podium with her father.
North Korea's official media released a video on the 9th. Kim Ju-ae snuggled up to her father, looked at her father warmly and whispered several times. She patted her father's cheek with her hands and even touched her father's chest. The interactive footage of the father and daughter was broadcast all over the country.
However, the first lady Li Xuezhu was only able to back off.
According to reports from South Korea's “North Korea News” and other reports, in the official group photo of Kim Jong-un and Lee Seok-joo attending the dinner on the 7th with their daughter Kim Joo Ae, Kim Joo Ae not only rarely sits in C position in the middle of her parents; at the military parade on the 75th anniversary of Army Day the next night, she also appeared on the podium with Kim Jong-un.
The North Korean official media “North Korea Central Television” later released a military parade video, which revealed more images of the father and daughter being affectionate.
Kim Jong-un confronted her daughter several times on the podium. The smiles on their faces never went back. They also kept quiet messages in each other's ears. At one point, Kim Joo-ae picked up her dad's cheeks with both hands, and Kim Jong-un also responded with a big smile.
Other official media footage also showed that when Kim Joo Ae and Kim Jong-un were sitting on an indoor sofa chair, they constantly touched her father's face with her hands; while she walked hand in hand with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hands.
However, the first lady, Li Xuezhu, can only walk or sit on the side the whole time; she is always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
South Korean media pointed out that since Kim Joo Ae first made a public appearance on November 18 last year to test the Mars 17 missile, the exposure rate has been getting higher and higher over the past 3 months, and it is now the 5th time she has appeared on the official scene.
North Korea's official media mentioned that Kim Joo Ae used the dearest child and honorable child of Kim Joo Ae in the stands, and also broadcast a clip of Kim Joo Ai repeatedly shouting and swearing to death to support the Baekdu lineage while watching the military parade in the stands.
These signs have made outsiders doubt whether Kim Joo-ae has been internally designated as the heir to the Kim administration. The “Washington Post” analyzed that “this is a sign that Kim Jong-un has promoted her middle school daughter to the position of successor,” but there are also opinions that it is still too early to make such a judgment. In a situation where Kim Jong-un has a son under her, all possibilities are still open.
Chongyang Q&A | How do you view the US non-farm payrolls data for January exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Watch － A professional financial news website
Q: May I ask Chongyang Investment, what do you think of the US non-farm payrolls data for January exceeding expectations and future trends?
A: On February 3, the US Department of Labor released non-farm payrolls data for January 2023, adding 517,000 new non-farm payrolls, significantly higher than market expectations of 189,000; the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%, the lowest level in nearly 50 years; hourly wages grew 4.4% year on year and 0.3% month on month, a slight slowdown.
In terms of total volume, there are many one-time and technical disturbances in this data, such as faculty and staff on strike and returning to work, revisions to survey statistics, and updates to seasonal factors. There may be future revisions (see the addition of 504,000 non-farmers in January 2022, downgraded from 504,000 to 364,000 people). Non-farm payrolls may not be as strong as reflected in the data.
From a structural point of view, the impact of layoffs in high-tech enterprises is still there, but the share is relatively low; new jobs in high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and health care have rebounded sharply, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
Combined with the service sector PMI that far exceeded expectations, the recovery in job vacancies and labor gap data, and the strength of consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector ushered in a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that it is difficult to improve tight supply and demand in the US job market without going through a recession.
Currently, there is still a supply gap of more than 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly. In particular, the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds is already close to the high before the epidemic.
In addition to this, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the job market due to excess savings of American residents and strong consumer credit.
Continued tight supply and demand in the US job market will be the undertone of the US economy in 2023.
The superposition is now nearing the end of interest rate hikes, and inflation expectations are repeated over and over again. We are not optimistic about the continued decline in wage growth.
Prior to the release of this data, the expectations of the US stock and bond foreign exchange market on the Fed's interest rate hike path were too optimistic.
As inflation data continues to improve, while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes, the Fed continues to maintain the weak balance of market inflation expectations. However, the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish statement. It not only expects an early cessation of interest rate hikes, but also expects two interest rate cuts at the end of the year.
In a situation where supply and demand in the labor market are tight and the impact of austerity policies is unclear, we believe that the Fed's guidance on raising interest rates at the end of the year is relatively reasonable, and that adjustments to extreme market expectations and the congestion of transactions may cause some damage to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of the wage growth rate is difficult to reverse the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the year-on-year negative M2 data and the gradual improvement of leading indicators in various CPI segments, the US CPI data has moved to a stage of rapid decline since October. The stubbornness of the wage growth rate will only underpin future inflation data. Current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of the game after the next inflation data is released.
Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan, passed away due to a sudden heart disease and led the transformation of the first line of clothing in China - Economic Watch － A professional financial news website
On February 11, Zheng Jixin, a reporter from the Economic Watch Network, published an obituary on the WeChat account of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “Shanshan Holdings”). Zheng Yonggang, founder of Shanshan Enterprise and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings, died on February 10, 2023 at the age of 65 due to ineffective treatment for a sudden heart disease.
In the 80s of the last century, Zheng Yonggang was the factory manager of a state-owned cotton spinning factory. Following his transfer, Zheng Yonggang became the factory manager of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Co., Ltd. in 1989.
In December 2022, at the 20th Annual Conference of Chinese Business Leaders and the 22nd Annual Conference of Chinese Business Future Stars, Zheng Yonggang said in his speech that in the Chinese suit market in the 90s of the last century, the market share of the Shanshan brand was as high as 37 percent.
In 1996, Shanshan Co., Ltd. (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in the Chinese garment industry.
Just when the clothing business was in full swing, the Shanshan Group began to transform because Zheng Yonggang realized, “Once the market is liberalized, Chinese brands will naturally form an echelon brand market. Shanshan Western clothing has always dominated the style, and it is unlikely that it will become the national uniform of the Chinese people for a long time.”
In 1999, Shan Shan began studying enterprise transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled that year, “We came to Shanghai to find out exactly what to do with the transformation. We specifically sought out many experts and scholars, and held continuous meetings and seminars.
Finally, we set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials; the other is that big health has a future”.
After the strategic direction was determined, Shanshan began to seek cooperation. At that time, the Carbon Research Institute supporting Angang Steel of the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute was working on the national 863 project, and research funding was insufficient, so Shan Shan signed a cooperation agreement with the Anshan Thermal Energy Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 “intermediate phase carbon microsphere” project, engage in R&D, production and sales of anode materials, and achieve commercial promotion of anode materials domestically.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. achieved large-scale production of intermediate-phase carbon microspheres and began localized replacement, replacing Japan as the main domestic supplier of intermediate-phase carbon microspheres.
This is the first lithium ion battery anode material manufacturer in China, and has achieved localization of lithium ion battery anode materials.
With the rapid spread of the application of lithium batteries, the lithium battery business of Shanshan Co., Ltd. began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery materials business was included as the main business of Shanshan Co., Ltd., and the revenue share of the clothing business declined year by year. Until 2013, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s lithium battery materials business revenue completely surpassed the clothing business.
In February 2021, Sugisan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chemical's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Sugikin Optoelectronics. The technical content in this field is relatively high. Sugisan's main competitors are the world's top 500 competitors, such as South Korea's Samsung, Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his post-investment management experience, “Chinese private enterprises acquire some international high-tech enterprises, and the probability of success is relatively low. Why did those acquisitions fail?
Because everyone thinks about it, I've spent so much money, so I have to send someone to manage it.” But Zheng Yonggang is different. On the day Shanshan's acquisition was successful, Zheng Yonggang went to Shanjin Optoelectronics to publicly announce that Shanshan, as Shanjin's majority shareholder, decided to implement one enterprise, two systems. Except for Zheng Yonggang as the chairman, the people of Shanshan Enterprise did not send Shanjin. The original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models remained unchanged.
According to the 2022 negative electrode data released by ICC Xinyi Information, Shanshan anode's shipments in 2022 exceeded 200,000 tons, an increase of 100 percent over the previous year, a market share of 16 percent, and the shipment volume of artificial graphite anode materials topped the list.
In terms of the polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that Sugikin Optoelectronics, a subsidiary of the company, has a global market share of 29% in 2022, and is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Co., Ltd. had revenue of 15.841 billion yuan and net profit of 2,313 billion yuan. On February 10, the stock price of Shanshan Co., Ltd. was 19.24 yuan/share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9, Shanshan Co., Ltd. said on an interactive platform that at the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity was about 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project was still climbing.
According to Wande, Zheng Yonggang is currently still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan Co., Ltd.
According to the Tianyan survey, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1 percent of the total shares of Shanshan Holdings Co., Ltd.
The general manager of Shanshan Co., Ltd. is Li Zhihua, born in 1968. He has served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Material Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.
On February 10, Shanshan Co., Ltd. stated on the investor interactive platform that the company's senior management has no family relationship with the actual controller of the company.
“Fund E Account” is here: the Securities Regulatory Commission authorizes the development of all funds under investors' names to collect and search - Economic Watch － A professional financial news website
Economic Watch Network reporter Chen Shan has complicated fund purchase channels, making it difficult to collect account information?
Always forget the “little treasury”?
The problems of the citizens of the community are about to be solved.
On February 10, the Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the “Fund E Account” app was launched on various mobile app stores and launched a public trial run.
According to the introduction, “Fund E Account” provides individual investors with a “one-stop” inquiry service for public fund account and share information. The aim is to solve industry service pain points such as the vast majority of small to medium investors forgetting accounts and making complicated inquiries.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, with a fund management scale of about 26 trillion yuan; 167 public fund share registration agencies and 411 public fund sales agencies.
The account systems of each share registration agency are independent of each other, and there is no unified search channel for the industry.
Some people in the industry said that at the end of 2021, there were more than 720 million fund investors in China. In other words, half of the people in the country invested in fund products.
Previously, investors needed to check the purchase situation through different sales agencies, but they could check the purchase situation through all sales channels through the “Fund E Account”, so the status of fund holdings was clear at a glance.
What is the “Fund E Account” app?
According to relevant documents, the “Fund E Account” app is a public fund industry portal mobile application developed and built by China Settlement with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with a one-stop inquiry on OTC share holdings of public fund products throughout the market.
Through the “Fund E Account”, investors can easily and quickly grasp the OTC share of public fund products owned by various fund managers purchased through various sales channels throughout the market, improving overall inquiry efficiency.
Specifically, information that investors can find through “fund E accounts” includes fund account information opened by various public fund managers throughout the market, transaction account information opened by public fund sales agencies, and OTC share holdings of products including publicly raised securities investment funds and pooled asset management plans where the number of investors established and managed by securities companies is not limited to 200 people.
Liu Yiqian, head of business at the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told the reporter of the Economic Watch Network that investors can use the “Fund E Account” app to know all of their OTC public fund holdings in one stop to help them recover “forgotten assets”. More importantly, it has collected full account information on the investment status of comprehensive funds for customers, helping customers to better grasp their investment situation in a timely, accurate and complete manner, so as to better optimize their own fund portfolio allocations and better plan their own financial arrangements.
How do I sign up for use?
The reporter noticed that currently, the “Fund E Account” app has been launched on mobile app stores such as Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, and vivo, but the app is still in the public trial stage. Registration requires filling in an invitation code. Investors can obtain it by contacting the fund manager of the fund they hold.
The customer service staff of a medium to large public fund in Shanghai provided a 6-digit invitation code to the reporter of the Economic Watch Network and told the reporter, “During the trial operation of the app, China Settlement provided each fund manager with a certain number of invitation codes. Investors called to obtain them, and we would all provide them.
Once the trial run is over, there is no need for an invitation code to open user registration.
”
The reporter registered the account and completed the inquiry according to the relevant documents of the “Fund E Account” download and usage instructions published on the official website of the Securities Regulatory Commission. The entire process only took a few minutes. It was mainly divided into four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiries.
After passing the real-name authentication step, click the “Asset” fund binding button. All fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are displayed in the binding options list (can be bound to accounts). After completing the binding, you can visually see the total assets of the invested funds and start using the search function.
It is worth noting that the “Fund E Account” only provides inquiry services for investors, and cannot conduct redemption transactions.
The data date displayed on the “Fund E Account” is generally pushed forward three trading days from the date the user made an inquiry (T-day).
For example, if you open a “Fund E Account” on February 10, the dates corresponding to total assets, fund shares, and fund net worth displayed on the asset page are pushed forward three trading days from that date, that is, February 7.

Combating the CCP, the US, Japan, and the Philippines reached a defense agreement
ASIA — On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos (Bongbong Marcos) visited Japan for talks with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
The two sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's invasion of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, Philippine and Japanese leaders issued a joint statement stating that they would sign a trilateral defense agreement with the US to conduct substantive defense exchanges and oppose the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes to use this meeting to help Japan and the Philippines establish policies to deal with the Taiwan Strait crisis.
Marcos Jr., visited China at the beginning of January this year and obtained an agreement worth 20 billion US dollars.
However, since then, Sino-Philippine relations have not only not improved; on the contrary, they have declined.
At the beginning of this month, the Philippines and the US signed an agreement to open more bases for the US military to ensure the security of the South China Sea.
The newly added base is 300 kilometers from Taiwan and is also the closest location to China.
If there is a crisis in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations at bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines are now forming an axis with the US to build an “arc of confrontation with the CCP” in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan conveys Song Tao's words during her visit: Green Camp is welcome to the mainland under the 1992 consensus
Xia Liyan, vice-chairman of Taiwan's Chinese Kuomintang, met with Song Tao, head of the Taiwan Affairs Office of China, and Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee during her current visit to China.
Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the Kuomintang's official agency, the State Administration Foundation, was interviewed by Taiwan's Central News Agency last night to positively evaluate what Song Tao said to Xia Liyan. As long as they agree with the “1992 Consensus” and anti-Taiwan independence, China welcomes members of the Green Camp to the mainland.
The Kuomintang side's assessment is that it is a new thing.
There was no mention of this statement in the news of the day Xia Liyan met Song Tao earlier.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party has made it clear over the past few days that it rejects the “1992 consensus.”
According to the Central News Agency today, Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan led a delegation to the mainland. While in Beijing, they met separately with Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the newly appointed director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee.
In her meeting with Song Tao, Xia Liyan talked about the “1992 Consensus” and anti-Taiwan independence, while Zhao Chunshan, a senior adviser to the Kuomintang State Administration Foundation, said during the meeting that the Kuomintang's “1992 Consensus” was the original “1992 Consensus.”
According to Zhao Chunshan's analysis, this is different from the previous meetings he has attended.
The recent video discussions with mainland academics, and this discussion, did not hear Taiwan-related scholars talk about military unification and the “anti-secession law.” Instead, they resumed exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that soldiers on both sides of the Strait are in danger of fighting, and mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the People's Communist Party, the other side is still willing to do a good job with the Taiwanese people, which means they don't want cross-strait relations to be ruined.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning also personally gave instructions to Song Tao, saying, “You must implement the demands made by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen).” If a comprehensive settlement is not possible, they must also be handled on a case-by-case basis.
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang people visiting the mainland directly mentioned the daily turbulence of Chinese military aircraft and warships, agricultural and fishing issues in Taiwan's few counties and cities, and whether the Central News Agency reporter asked such questions during interviews.
The Legal Trade Union once again mobilizes a parade of anti-government retirement reform plans
On Saturday (February 11), French trade unions once again launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's draft pension reform, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This is the fourth day of action against the current social trend against the government's draft pension system reform.
And how many people respond to the call for a rally may affect the trade union groups' next action plan.
This is the fourth time since this month that France's eight major trade union groups have jointly initiated a nationwide mobilization. It is also the first time this protest has scheduled a rally for Saturday.
Given that for most French people, Saturday is a public holiday and they don't have to choose between participating in demonstrations and protests or going on a wage strike, trade union groups therefore hope that today's rally will attract more people to participate.
The bus system, the subway, and the trade unions of the public railway companies did not call for a strike by employees today. The bus system should operate normally. Citizens can go to the meeting place by car. At the same time, in areas where schools have begun winter vacations, people can take normal vacations.
Trade union groups hope that more than 1 million people will attend the rally today, while the police expect that the number of participants nationwide may be between 600,000 and 800,000, and that 90,000 to 120,000 people may gather in downtown Paris.
Since the beginning of this anti-government pension reform protest, although polls show that most French people do not support measures to postpone the statutory retirement age from the current age of 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in the march has gradually declined.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 attracted 1.27 million to 2.5 million people across the country.
However, the number of demonstrators this Tuesday (February 7) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
This pension reform plan is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
Opposition parties, particularly opposition parties led by the radical left, submitted numerous proposals for amendments, to the extent that the review process progressed very slowly.
Meanwhile, the dispute between the opposition and the opposition is becoming increasingly intense.
A member of parliament from the radical left-wing French Unyielding Party recently uploaded a picture of himself stepping on a balloon with the head of the Minister of Labor printed on it on social media, triggering protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly finally announced a ban on this member of parliament from participating in parliamentary activities for 15 days as a punishment for this kind of behavior.
Although this reform plan has triggered the biggest social trend in France in more than 20 years, until now, although the government has made slight adjustments to the draft, it has not made any major concessions.
The trade unions are already preparing to launch another operation next Thursday, the 16th. On March 7, when the draft reform is submitted to the Senate for discussion, the trade union also plans to organize demonstrations.
China encourages raising fertility rates to colleges and universities to solicit high quality standards of sperm donation
China's Yunnan Provincial Human Sperm Bank issued a campaign on the 9th asking students with college degree or above to donate sperm. Successful donations of 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of RMB 4,500.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the news hit Weibo on the same day and triggered follow-up initiatives in Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, and Beijing.
According to a report signed by the Liberty Times, China encourages college students to donate sperm.
Among colleges and universities around the world, Beijing has the highest sperm donation threshold. In addition to academic qualifications, they are also required to be at least 170 centimeters tall, have good facial features, no obvious hair loss, and no degree of myopia higher than 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Provincial Human Sperm Bank pointed out that sperm donors can receive a full set of male medical examinations worth 1,000 yuan. “In particular, semen and chromosome tests. Most people have never done them, which is of great significance in understanding their fertility status.”
The conditions for sperm donors include those with a height of 165 cm or above, college degree or above, no color blindness, color weakness, genetic diseases and infectious diseases such as hepatitis B.
The report quoted China Tianmu News as saying that the Shaanxi Provincial Human Sperm Bank printed a “Paid Sperm Donation, Infinite Honor” promotional poster calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to retweet relevant information and “let love pass it on.”
The price code in Shaanxi Province is higher than in Yunnan. Eligible applicants can receive RMB 300 in cash each time, and those who have completed a certain number of sperm donations can receive a subsidy of RMB 5,000.
Currently, Beijing is known to have the highest price code, with a maximum subsidy of 5,150 yuan.
The last communist prime minister of East Germany died today
The successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement from the party, “Hans Modrow (Hans Modrow) left us last night at the age of 95.
As a result, our party lost an important leader.
”
On November 13, 1989, four days after the opening of the Berlin Wall that separated East Berlin from West Berlin for 28 years, Modro said he would help turn East Germany into a democracy.
At the time, communist leaders were forced to step down due to protesters from all over East Germany demanding democracy and freedom.
Mikhail Gorbachev (Mikhail Gorbachev) called for changes in Eastern Europe dominated by the Soviet Union after the Soviet Union came to power.
In March 1990, Modro announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
As a result of the election, he ceased to be Prime Minister.
Despite Modro's reforms, opponents accuse him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that took place in October 1990.
He has also been criticized for trying to reinvent rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modro was convicted of election fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but was not jailed.
Allegations are that these accusations are politically motivated.
Modro continued to serve in the German Parliament from 1990 to 1994, and was a member of the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
Modro sees himself as a reformer and wants to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he didn't want the old East Germany to return, but said that East Germany's achievements should be recognized.
Modro was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica, Poland) and was trained as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a youth fire brigade platoon leader and became a member of the Nazi militia group Volkssturm near the end of the conflict, which recruited men between the ages of 16 and 60 to fight in the final struggle of the war.
At age 17, Modro was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a staunch communist.
In 1949, the year East Germany was founded, he found a job as a mechanic after returning home, continued his studies in social science and economics, and obtained a doctorate degree.
Modelo was a member of the Free German Youth Movement. Almost all young people from East Germany joined the movement and was promoted to the presidency of the Dresden Regional Party through the ruling Social Unionist Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in East Germany's parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modro became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest national position.
Hackers supporting protests commemorating the anniversary of Iran's revolution hacked the president's television speech
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to mark the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ibrahim Lacey's television speech.
The president's live television speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, and a group of anti-Iranian government hackers appeared on the screen. Their names were “Edalat Ali (Ali Justice).”
There was also a voice shouting “The Islamic Republic of the Islamic Republic dies.”
According to a Reuters report today, Iran commemorated the anniversary of the revolution, and hackers interrupted coverage on national television.
Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian revolution. Lacey's hardline government faces the boldest challenge posed by the young protesters demanding that they step down, yet Lacey still calls for “deceived youth” to repent so that they can be pardoned by Iran's supreme leader.
Nationwide protests continue to engulf Iran after Mahsa Amini, 22, died in the custody of the country's ethics police in September.
The deadly crackdown on protests by Iran's security forces is one of the strongest challenges facing the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution overthrew the 2,500-year-old monarchy.
As part of an amnesty commemorating the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities released imprisoned dissident Farhad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adekha on a hunger strike on Friday.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (Ayatollah Ali Khamenei) issued an amnesty order that included some prisoners arrested during recent anti-government protests.
As of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors, according to the human rights organization HRANA, according to reports from the human rights organization HRANA.
A further 70 government security personnel have been killed, according to reports.
As many as 19,763 protesters are believed to have been arrested.
For weeks, Iran's leaders and official media have been calling for a vote at a rally on Saturday to show opposition to the protests and support for the government.
On the night of the anniversary of Iran's revolution on Friday night, the official media displayed fireworks as part of government-sponsored festivities, with people chanting “Allahu Akbar!
(God is the greatest!)”.
However, many people can also be heard at the rally shouting “The dictator dies!
” and the “death of the Islamic Republic” in a video posted on social media.
On Saturday, government television broadcast live footage of official rallies in various states across the country.
In Tehran, domestic anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers and other military equipment were shown as part of the official festivities.
President Lacey's speeches are often interrupted by the slogan “America dies” — an iconic slogan at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted “Israel dies.”
According to Reuters, Adelkhah, who has been in jail since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the worsening relationship between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison for national security charges in 2020.
They later placed her under house arrest, but in January she went back to jail.
Adelkhah denied the allegations.
Meanwhile, a week before Mesami was released, supporters warned that he was at risk of death due to his hunger strike.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the mandatory wearing of headscarves.
The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to Adelkhah's release on Friday, calling for the restoration of her freedom “including that she should be allowed to return to France if she wishes.

Did the balloon incident polish America's eyes even more?
Strengthening restrictions on technology exports to China
According to a Wall Street Journal report today, after the balloon incident, the US is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China.
Current and former security officials said the balloon incident highlighted the national security threat posed by China and will seek more political support to strengthen US technology protection.
The US said the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior US Central Intelligence Agency official who currently works at the Washington think-tank New American Security Center.
“This certainly added fuel to the fire and supported the views of the hardliners on China.”
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre (Karine Jean-Pierre) told reporters on Thursday, “We will also consider taking broader actions to uncover and respond to China's larger surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security and our allies and partners.
US officials said they have informed the governments of more than 30 countries about the balloon incident, and international coordination is critical to dealing with the Chinese threat.
Emily Benso, a senior researcher at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established Special Committee on Strategic Competition between the US and the Chinese Communist Party in the US House of Representatives may also pressure the US to take tougher measures to slow China's development.
She said that members of Congress will feel more and more pressure to adopt tougher positions, which in turn may force the White House to adopt tougher policies.
According to the Wall Street Journal, many advocates of stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government is also developing a foreign investment review plan to examine whether US investment abroad poses a potential national security threat from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to launch the plan faster.
Earthquake relief in Turkey and Syria day in and day out
Since the earthquake struck Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have worked hard day and night in the ruins of thousands of destroyed buildings to rescue survivors buried under the rubble.
In the cold temperatures, they often call for silence as they struggle to hear any sound of life from their dilapidated concrete piles.
According to a Reuters report today, two more women were rescued after surviving in the ruins of the earthquake for a few days.
However, the death toll from the earthquake climbed to 24,150.
The death toll in Turkey is 20,665, and the death toll in Syria is over 3,500.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday continued to have several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria. It was the seventh-deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and close to the death of 31,000 people caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighboring Iran.
More than 17,000 people died as a result of a similar earthquake in northwestern Turkey in 1999.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were trapped 122 hours after the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years, and rescuers rescued the two women from the rubble of a collapsed building in Turkey.
Another injured 55-year-old man has been identified as Masallah Cicek, rescued from the ruins of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the cold temperatures, rescuers often called for silence as they tried their best to hear any sound of life from the dilapidated concrete heap.
In Turkey's Samandag district, rescuers crouched under concrete slabs and whispered “Inshallah” — “God bless” — they carefully stuck their hands into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old newborn.
He opened his eyes, and the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warm blanket and carried to the field hospital.
Video images show that first responders also took his mother. She was dizzy and pale on a stretcher, but she was awake.
Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay (Fuat Oktay) told reporters overnight that in the past 24 hours, 67 people had been rescued from the rubble, and a total of 31,000 rescuers were used in the affected areas.
He said that about 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, while 1.05 million were homeless as a result of the earthquake, and they were huddled in temporary shelters.
As many people lack food in the cold winter conditions, people are increasingly questioning the response of the leaders of the two countries to the disaster relief.
According to Syrian state media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (Bashar al-Assad) went to a hospital in Aleppo (Aleppo) with his wife Asma (Asma). According to reports, this was his first trip to the affected area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme said it was running out of stocks in rebel-controlled northwestern Syria due to the state of war complicating rescue efforts.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Turkey's Adiyaman province where he admitted that the government's response was not as fast as expected.
Opponents have seized the issue and attacked Erdogan, who will run for re-election in a vote to be held on May 14, but may be postponed due to the disaster.
According to Reuters, anger over delays in aid delivery and the launch of rescue work may affect the election.
Even before the earthquake, voting was seen as Erdogan's most serious challenge in 20 years in power.
Erdogan called for unity and denounced what he called a “negative campaign for political gain.”
Turkey's main opposition leader Kemal Kiridaroglu criticized the government's reaction.
The critic said, “The earthquake was huge, but what was worse than the earthquake was lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence.

Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi — Vietnam News Agency's special correspondent reports that during their visit to Brunei Darussalam, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh and his wife visited Brunei Darussalam University (UBD, “University of Brunei” for short) on the morning of February 11.
The University of Brunei is Brunei's largest higher education and scientific research center, ranking third in the region's university rankings.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei in education and training.
The University of Brunei officially established a cooperative relationship with Vietnam's FPT University in July 2013. The main area of cooperation is English language training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, moral education, Japanese, and Korean, the University of Brunei also incorporates Vietnamese into the curriculum.
While visiting the University of Brunei, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh and his wife exchanged views with students in the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh is happy that more and more foreigners like to learn the Vietnamese language, thereby making a positive contribution to promoting Vietnamese cultural characteristics and customs to the rest of the world.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh expressed his belief and hope that the Vietnamese language teaching staff at the University of Brunei will grow stronger; the students in the Vietnamese language class are increasingly interested in Vietnamese, study hard, be able to use fluent Vietnamese as soon as possible, and become messengers of the friendly and cooperative relationship between Vietnam and the two countries.
Taking advantage of this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh also communicated via video with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Da Nang City to learn about their studies, particularly during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh believes that the cooperative relationship between Vietnam's FPT University and the University of Brunei, in particular the FPT-UBD Global Center, is a vivid symbol of the education cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
At the same time, I hope that the students at the center will make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly and cooperative relations between Vietnam and Wenwen.
In discussions with the Minister of Education of Brunei and leaders of the University of Brunei, Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh spoke highly of the results achieved by the two countries in education cooperation, including the cooperation between FPT University and the University of Brunei, and the University of Brunei's initiative to incorporate Vietnamese into the curriculum.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh hopes that the University of Brunei will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expanding the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh also highly praised the positive results achieved by the cooperation between the two countries based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Education Cooperation signed in April 2014. He suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Program (Global Discovery Program) and the Year of Discovery (Year of Discovery).
Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh highly appreciates the establishment of the University of Brunei's first branch in Southeast Asia in Vietnam; he believes that the scale of development of the university in the region and the world is getting stronger; and further expanding cooperative relationships with Vietnamese institutions of higher learning.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng and his wife planted a memorial tree on the University of Brunei campus and left comments on the memorial book.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh wishes the University of Brunei continued to develop, contribute more and more to education in Brunei, and develop deeper and wider cooperation with various Vietnamese education and training institutions.

Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi — Vietnam News Agency's special correspondent reports that Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh and his wife's official visits to Singapore and Brunei have been a complete success, with comprehensive, practical and concrete results.
During his three days in Singapore and Brunei, Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh participated in more than 30 different events.
The results achieved have injected new impetus into the continuous development of the strategic partnership between Vietnam and New Zealand and the comprehensive partnership between Vietnam and Vietnam in a deeper, broader and more effective direction.
During his visits to the two countries, Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh continued to reaffirm the external line of the Vietnamese Party and country, which is independence, diversification, and change, and is willing to be a good friend and reliable partner of all countries, as well as a responsible member of the international community.
Strengthening the relationship with Singapore and Brunei is the need of their respective countries. They are committed to improving the welfare of their people and to the peace, stability and development of the region and the world.
At various meetings and peace talks, Prime Minister Pham Minh Thanh and the leaders of Singapore and Brunei all agreed to continuously enhance mutual political trust with Vietnam through the exchange of visits between high-level delegations, the effective implementation of various bilateral cooperation mechanisms, and various important cooperation agreements.
A number of cooperation documents were signed during the visit.
Among them, the “Memorandum of Understanding on the Green and Digital Economy Partnership” signed with Singapore and the “Action Plan to Strengthen the Comprehensive Partnership between Vietnam and the Russian Language for the period 2023-2027” signed with Brunei are two major highlights.

What exactly is the “object” that was shot down over Alaska?
Confused and speculated
On Friday afternoon (2/10), the US military once again used America's most advanced stealth fighter F-22 to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska in the US.
The shooting site was ten miles off the Alaskan coast.
This is the second time in less than a week that the US military has shot down a flying object in the air.
On Saturday, a spy balloon from China drifted over US airspace for a few days before being destroyed over the US coast of South Carolina.
The Pentagon said the second object that was shot down first entered US airspace on Thursday night and was tracked by the US military as it moved over northeastern Alaska. It flew at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet). It was about the size of a small car, much smaller than the Chinese spy balloon that had been shot down previously.
The Pentagon also believes that there is currently no indication that this object can be manipulated.
White House National Security Council strategic communications coordinator John Bryant said on Friday that although the exact appearance of this high-altitude object is unclear, it “poses a reasonable threat to the safety of civil aviation aircraft.”
Bryant said that unlike the spy balloon discovered in the US, there was no “payload” suspended on it.
Bryant said, “We call it an 'object' the best description we can make right now.”
President Biden listened to the Pentagon's advice before ordering the object to be shot down. He was “very careful” in making this decision, Bryant added.
The US official description of this object can be roughly summed up as the size of a small car, with no joystick, no suspension, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters.
However, this information cannot answer basic questions, such as what kind of thing this object actually is, what country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.
Currently, many online analyses and speculations suggest that this may be another Chinese balloon.
It probably came from China just like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America; they carried out some kind of mission at different locations.
There are also people who have linked this “object” in Alaska to a “UFO” (UFO).
The US Newsweek report quoted former US Congressman Peter Meijer (Peter Meijer) on Twitter on Friday as saying, “I really hope this' UFO 'is also a spy balloon, not a legal UFO.”
“The irony of mixing an alien spacecraft with a weather balloon is surprising, but it's not worth triggering an interstellar clash,” Major said.
Major tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek said that it was not only Major who suspected that the object was a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Congressman Tim Burchett (Tim Burchett) criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month and asked the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release a report on “UFOs.”
Amazon's customer service attitude is hard to believe
I don't think many people have seen this place, but I'd like to talk a little bit about it.
This dress was a zippered hoodie when we bought it, and it was actually a short-sleeved dress for me at the end.
As soon as I received the clothes, I got in touch with Amazon customer service. It was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock at the time. I asked for a replacement. The customer service said they would fix it, then I immediately saw that the product name had changed to short sleeve. It turned out that the link I had bought was removed from the shelves.
The customer service then told them to either keep the item in compensation for a certain amount or return the item.
Is this how Amazon handles it?
It's really unbelievable. The wrong clothing itself wasn't my problem. As a consumer, I asked for the products I should get, and I didn't make any exaggerated claims, but Amazon changed the name and said it was out of stock.
This is my first long review and hopefully it won't be my last.
Incomprehensible sleeves
Speaking of cowhide, it's really hard, but if you look closely, there are many small cracks in the area, so it's hard to tell if it's genuine. Also, the sleeves of this dress are really incomprehensible. Normally, the sleeves of a jacket are a bit longer than the hem, but usually it's only 1-2 cm. This dress is 5 cm long, so the arms should naturally hang down at the base of the palm of the hand, but the sleeves of this dress all cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and so is returning them.
But I really don't know when to get my money back?
The garment was made very well, I had to return it because the fit was too small, but it's been over a week since I returned it, and I haven't received a refund yet?
Also, the buyer must contact Quanfeng Express, which is not very honest. This is the worst shopping since buying an Amazon item!
However, the store is pretty good. They are actively cooperating with the courier to urge the courier to refund the money in a timely manner, but the actual work of Quanfeng Express is quite infuriating. It delays the refund for about half a month. This kind of partner wants to drag Amazon back. The work efficiency is poor, and there is no sense of service!
More suitable for young people
Killed in 99 seconds.
The sweater has good workmanship, color, and feel, soft/thin, and has no kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the version is slim and is more suitable for young people.
3XL, flat waist circumference 2 feet 5, maximum stretch size 4 feet. 1.79/80 kg is a bit tight when worn at 1.79/80 kg.
There doesn't seem to be an elastic band around the waist, so it's quite difficult to loosen the waistline.
Also, it's not comfortable to wear close.
Very good, the color is not very bright
Just bought it and it went up more than 200. What kind of situation is this.
The first time I used Amazon's partner Tiantian Express, it wasn't at home for the first time. Later, I took the initiative to schedule two delivery times with the courier. The courier didn't deliver it, but later returned it directly to me. This damn courier didn't have any integrity, and I strongly recommend not to use the Tiantian Express anymore.
Another t-shirt was also returned to me this time, and the price went up by more than 100 yuan even after shooting again.
Amazon is self-operated and this kind of product should not appear
I bought it when the product was on sale. The price is not low, and it's also a great product to read reviews.
I was dumbfounded when I actually received the product. The surface of the product had extensive wear and tear, and there were many other areas of wear and tear. It was either defective or used, as pictured later.
I requested a return. After seeing the picture, the manufacturer said it was due to shipping. Isn't that nonsense?
How can the inside of the product wear out?
There are only two possibilities: either the defective product is used, or I intentionally damaged the item and then took it back and returned it.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I didn't damage the product, but in terms of my Amazon shopping credit history, I don't think this kind of product should appear in Amazon's own products. Customers choose Amazon's own management is trust. Customer win, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone works together to improve it, thank you.
I've been using this product for less than a year and have had two E2s, I don't know what to do with them?
I bought this product on July 30, 2015, but red E2 often appeared on the right side of the receiver in March 2016. There must be a problem with the transmitter module. This is probably not in line with the transmitter module described on the Amazon website. I can't find any after-sales service on the Amazon website. Now I don't know what to do?
Is it OK
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel like new.
The label on the box was torn off, and the label on the fuselage was also broken.
And it's always a white screen.
It will be fine after the replacement.
The replacement was very quick. It's a bit blurry at night. The field of view isn't very broad, but it's enough for normal household use.
The downside is that I don't have a card; I bought one myself, and I've bought a cell phone on Amazon before.
There will be a sticker on the package to prevent the package from being opened. Not this time. When I bought the phone, there was also a sticker like a sticker, which can be attached to the warranty card, but not this time.
I don't know if the stuff is cheap, so I'm very confused.
Waiting for a response from the supplier
There was no logo on the package. I called the supplier directly and said that the answer was that the product was genuine. If I suspected that I could use scraps to mail it to Johnson & Johnson for inspection, and also left my license plate number and phone number, promising that I would send a text message to enter my information into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card. Haven't I received a text message until now?
The engine oil was received in the morning and replaced in the afternoon.
Second purchase.
Amazon's own products are still very reassuring.
The master who changed the oil said the oil was bright; it was indeed a good oil.
Because it's the second time I've bought it.
So it's still very reassuring.
The express delivery was fast, and there were no impeccable packaging. After using this oil, the engine sound dropped significantly.
The cost performance ratio is good; it's hard to find synthetic engine oil under 200.
Support the Crown of Stars, support winning cards, and effectively protect the car.
Buyers' interests have been seriously damaged by Amazon Japan due to customer service issues (8c caterpillars are shipped as 8cm caterpillars) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c)
It admits mistakes, but continues to push back, always emphasizes that the goods are third parties and that third parties cannot be bound.
Order ID: 503-4265464-1830254.
The page size options I originally purchased were 7c, 8,9c. At the time, I thought this was a trap. I called Japanese and Asian Chinese customer service and made it clear that 8 was 8c, but I only discovered it when the product came back to China. It was only 8cm. I think this was entirely a deliberate trap to trick Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service), but I don't have this option to view the page now.
Chinese customer service: I'm very sorry for the loss caused to you. We will give you two paths:
1. You return the item and the buyer is responsible for all shipping costs.
2. If you don't return the item, we will reimburse you 1,000 yen.
(Let me do the math. The shoes are over 4,000 yen, calculated as 200rmb. Option 1, I don't have shoes, and I lost 200 yuan.
Option 2. I have shoes. In the end, I was compensated 2,000 yen, and the final loss was 150RMB customer service: We have recorded it, we will handle it carefully. I replied to an email the next day saying that I would not accept the mediation from the Chinese customer service, and that's it.
I suggested: When the page I bought was a confusing option like 7c, 8, and 9c, the Chinese customer service helped me tell me that commonly used Japanese codes don't include c, similar to 140, but did you go to any other Caterpillar pages to read them?
They all have US sizes, and there is a situation where Japanese sizes are mixed.
Also, why do you put 8cm between 7c and 9c, clearly the smallest size, what do you mean by putting it there.
Chinese customer service: We provide Chinese service, but we don't know if you want to ship back home, so we won't pay for your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic either. I'm Japanese, and I also need Chinese customer service. Chinese people living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service either. Tourists to Japan don't have that effort to play international long distance, so the question is, who needs to call Amazon to buy Chinese phone numbers overseas is nothing more than someone like me.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just convenient for our Haitao people?
Not very satisfied with this purchase
This is the second time I've bought Pampabao's diapers from Amazon. I bought a box of diapers imported from Europe when my baby was 2 months old and chose paper diapers imported from Europe. I was quite satisfied with my first purchase experience. Babies use a diaper all night long, and it is indeed enough for 12 hours without changing diapers.
However, when I bought L size diapers this time, there were 2 packs separately packed in one box. After opening, I felt that the paper was relatively loose. It was clearly different from imported Pampers. After using them for the baby, it was quite OK. There were no urine loss or signs of redness.
However, when it came to the second pack of diapers, the baby immediately developed a rash on the inside of the thigh after starting to use it, and it hasn't gone away yet.
I doubt the quality of the 2 packs in 1 box is not the same.
I probably won't continue to buy it in the future!
I want to pay attention to the shipping protection of my package
This is the worst package I've seen in shopping online for so long. There are no protective measures at all, no cushioning foam, package buffer material, etc., nothing.
It's just a deformed case.
Also, the soft plastic box inside the card case was squeezed open and pressed to the point where it was deformed.
I hope the quality of the genuine product is guaranteed; I won't dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.
I'd rather be half as expensive at home and have guaranteed points.
Also, there is a product packaging issue. I read the reviews in 2016 that someone has reviewed it. As of now, 19 years ago, it's still the same.
It shows that Amazon doesn't pay attention to service feedback at all; it's far worse than JD, Tmall, etc. in China.
Nice, but a bit of a pity
I really like the color of the whole cup. It's orange red. Even though I have a baby boy, I still think the orange red with yellow is very bright.
It's a little smaller than I thought, but I used it to take it outside, so it's acceptable.
I took it home last night and tried it out. After the cap was pushed open, the distance between the straw and the lid was too close. Since the position of the straw is vertical, my son always has to keep the bulge on the lid in drinking water. I wonder if this area can be improved.
It seems that the inclination of the straws of other brands of sippy cups still makes sense. When it comes to kids' things, they really care about safety and comfort.
Lightweight and high capacity
I like that it's lightweight and has a large opening, but the two separate dividers are a bit superfluous for me, and I don't know what to pack.
After buying it, I discovered that there was another brand very similar to the one I bought overseas; it was less than 200 yuan.
Fakes, fakes are particularly bad
Amazon sells fake goods, so I am convinced.
The customer service said it couldn't be returned because it was used; I had no use how could I know it was a fake.
I'm sad because of trust. After all, it's a face-wiping product. You should actually buy it at a physical store; I agree it's a little more expensive.
I didn't read the comments because it was a flash sale. I've already submitted it to the e-commerce platform of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce. Let's defend our rights together.
Broken?
Fake?
Tragic in any case.
When I used the second tablet, I chose the one with fine pores, but I thought it was normal, because I hadn't used this one and then applied it to my face, I couldn't stand it. It had a very strong flavor. It was indescribable. I immediately coughed out when I smoked it. My eyes also hurt and shed tears. I immediately took it off and washed my face.
If you don't believe in evil, I bought another one of the same type. It doesn't have that heavy flavor anymore; I'm applying it now.
Reminiscent of the smell a bit like poor quality perm water in a hair salon.
It's unimaginable. Is it really that Amazon's own skincare products will have to be avoided from now on?
A traitor
When I bought it at the time, the event page said that they would give away the “Complete Three Body Collection” for over 99 yuan. They called customer service and said they wanted to show them screenshots of the event at the time. The question was who bought things and saved screenshots of the website. The activities you did yourself still need help from customers. All buyers should keep a close eye on it next time and save the evidence.
Feelings after use
The first time I bought something on Amazon, I had a few different feelings. First, let's talk about the experience of using the product. The first one is really painless and doesn't have a pungent taste. Overall, it's very good. Wipe it off after about 8 minutes, but there will be a small amount of sweat residue on it, and you won't be able to see it if you don't take a close look, so overall it's good. As for the rest, you'll have to keep watching until you keep using it.
Anyways, I think this stuff is really nice.
Second, I placed the order on the 27th and received the item on the 12th. It took a total of 15 days or half a month. Amazon's delivery service attitude was also very good.
Third, don't believe anything on Amazon's Black Friday. I placed an order on Friday and waited 2 days and it was close to 12 yuan cheaper. That is, I bought over 170 (plus shipping or something). There is a feeling that if you do an activity, you raise the price.
What kind of price fluctuation did the customer service say? I've been paying attention to the price for more than 10 days. The price is just like this; it doesn't fluctuate much.
Affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, with pellets, definitely bought back!
There are particles in the paste, and the feeling of freshness is just right. The teeth are smooth after use. They say they are imported, but many of them don't have Chinese labels, so I don't know where they are sold from.
In the future, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to a second-hand store.
Here's a suggestion, why can't I post a list on the Amazon app sometimes? I hope some apps can be improved, and they'll do better and better!
Over the years of excellence, it's getting worse and worse, and there's no quality of service to speak of at all!
The garbage excellency does not take into account customer needs. The special delivery time is 19:00-22:00.
Since there are elderly people at home who cannot be easily bedridden after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages at night.
As a result, it was actually delivered directly to the door at 12:00 noon, and they didn't call in advance.
If the delivery time is whatever your courier wants it to be delivered at whatever time they want, why pretend to let the customer choose the time?
If your logistics can't guarantee service, then don't do e-commerce at all!
To get an old man with 3 wounds on his body to get out of bed and open the door to receive the package, he still has to find change to pay!
There is clearly a contact number on the order!
From the beginning, no one even called to give me an explanation!
Excellence Network's so-called complaint customer service is a bunch of outsiders pretending to be there, misleading your complaint and then giving you a so-called response.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I've run into issues like this before with incorrect delivery times, so I can't bear it, but this time it's unbearable; it's just too much!
When I bought a new book, the cover and back cover were actually reversed after the pre-sale arrived. This clearly caused the quality problem, so they closed their eyes and sent the book to the customer?
Leave a bad review and no one will contact you.
Over the years of excellence, it's getting worse and worse, and there's no quality of service to speak of at all!
You won't spend another dime on excellence.
The picture quality is really not acceptable
As a title like “Ancient Atlas,” the book's selection, layout, and printing of the images is really difficult to accept. Some of the images even have mosaics, so blurry that they are unrecognizable.
Even if this book isn't a professional atlas, even if it's a small frame illustration, it should be worthy of the ancient documents left by our ancestors in the catalogue!
(Moreover, many images can be obtained from clear original documents from relevant industry resources), what is the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using images?
! I am sorry for this academic spirit.
There are no reviews in terms of writing; each member of the Fang family has their own differences.
Overall 2 stars.
When I was in my sophomore year of high school, I read this book with the mentality of just reading and having fun. I think I probably wouldn't be addicted to this kind of book myself. After all, the starting online article wasn't very appealing to me in the past.
Then... it fell into the pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the first part, when Ye Xiu was still in an online game, even if it was an intriguing fight between guilds, it wasn't heavy at all because he was often bloodshot by Ye Shen Gou.
As for the competition section, I wrote about the changing times and the alternation of old and new, a bit sad (I'm probably sentimental).
Reading the whole book took me a lot of time studying in my sophomore year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full time portrayal of characters and feelings is amazing. Some characters have only been taken occasionally, and they also leave a deep influence on people. For example, Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mu Cheng, the characters that are not in the writing center, such as Jiang Botao, Chu Yunxiu, etc. are also very popular. In a cool e-sports article, it's hard to find a person who is extremely annoying. This is a success in character portrayal on full time.
However, on the emotional side, the 30 million harem beauty that has been criticized by the average online article is either beautiful or corrupt. Full article What everyone has in common is that they love this game of glory, and most of them want to win in a dignified manner.
There was a small amount but no big conspiracy; everyone looked so simple and cute.
That's probably why there aren't any annoying characters full time.
The full time IP is huge, and this is also due to that.
Leaving aside the cultural phenomenon of online writing, a full time job is a great book.
How much does he really give people some passion, a little bit of emotion.
I want to animate my full time in April this year.
It's actually been a long time since I wanted to buy all of these books. Since my wallet wasn't thick enough, I discovered that fakes are rampant on TB. In fact, I recently released another version full time. I really like the cover picture, but I'm still planning to buy the old version first, so I just looked at it on Amazon and bought one set in one go.
Next, let's talk briefly about the condition of the goods.
●The fourth book doesn't have plastic wrap, but the book is new.
●The seventeenth plastic cover was, however, opened, and the texture of the book was also very strange, and it didn't feel any other hard material.
●The 23rd book is in the same situation as the 17th one, but it's also harder than the 17th one, but it's quite old.
●The publishing houses for a few books are different; it seems that No. 23 and No. 17 are the same publishing house, which is different from the others.
●Overall, I am quite satisfied. I am very satisfied with 24 books in a big box.
Lonely little lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as “The Lost Corner,” but it turned out there was still a lot of text!
I read it three times before I finished reading this book for my kids. It's a little lion that can shoot, a little lion that loves fruit juice and gummies.
When I saw the story of the lion eating the hunter, I felt a little uncomfortable. Modern urban people are a bit unreceptive to this arrangement of being eaten by animals.
Seeing at the end of the day, this little lion, who has succeeded in human society, has lost himself. He is no longer a complete lion, nor a complete person.
In the end, there was only the back of the little lion; I don't know where he went.
Perhaps many years from now, the image of this little lion still remains in the impression of a grown child. Being reminded of her when she was carelessly one day may have moved or inspired her.
A very cost-effective portfolio of works
1. I didn't know about TASCHEN before. I bought quite a few of their books recently. The reason is that they are too aggressive, whether it's the topic selection or the production itself.
There have been 3 editions of this work. The biggest version, like the complete Michelangelo collection, is close to 50 cm long and 34 cm wide; the medium version is about 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; while this edition is the smallest, two-volume edition with a bookcase.
I personally think it's also acceptable. First, the price is cheap, and the 700-plus pages are split into two, making it easy to read as a paperback book; secondly, unlike the Michelangelo Complete Collection, paintings are the main body; Leonardo da Vinci's black and white manuscript accounts for most of the time. For readers with limited budgets and non-art professionals, this edition is the most cost-effective for readers who appreciate paintings and manuscripts.
2. The explanation of the painting section is excellent. There is composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as the last dinner), but I don't know if it's printing or book size issues. Some of the shadows are too deep in some counties, so I can't see the details. It's a bit of a pity.
3. Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Leonardo da Vinci's manuscripts are much richer in content.
The former is already a genius; the latter has a wide range of fields and high achievements, which is not enough to be described as a genius.
If I had only seen paintings before I could only experience half of Leonardo da Vinci, I would be completely speechless after reading the manuscript.
Garbage, who buys who regrets it!
I've never given a bad review. This is really rubbish and a waste of money, just give me a reason!
1. The walking time was not accurate. Suddenly it became January 1st, and the time went back to zero.
2. The poor quality straps are not silicone, and they are blistering on the wrist due to allergies.
3. I often can't connect to my phone.
4. The battery life is only five days.
5. The sleep test does not show up, the time is 0.
6. Not waterproof.
7. Others.
Logistics is too slow
It shows that it arrived on October 16, but the results were only received on the 21st. Bad review!
Courier delivery is so bad. Buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfaction
I was worried about the camera's packaging at the beginning. This time it's fine. There's an inflatable bag inside. The camera's size 3 is the same, and you can also register on the official website. The number of shutters is 0, so the rest can only be tested in time.
The delivery was pretty fast. I'm complaining about the courier here. Valuable items were placed in the porch. He walked so fast that I couldn't unpack and inspect them in front of him. I was really speechless about this.
The merchant did it for the customer's sake before shipping:)
The merchant is quite responsible. They specifically call to ask about the screen size of the camera they are using, which is really for the customer's sake.
The shipping was also fast.
The diamond film is also very suitable and effective when applied.
Battery charge is not satisfied
The machine is really nice. I want to know why it doesn't charge enough the first time it's charged. The charging indicator is always red
There is currently no official Amazon feedback channel, so you can only give feedback in product reviews
1. On March 29, I purchased this book for 31 yuan through the pre-order channel, showing that it will be delivered to devices on March 31. At this time, it is not possible to preview the book on Amazon's official website (because it hasn't been published yet);
2. The book was delivered to the device on March 31. The content is blank, just stay tuned, but the price of the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan;
3. After two days of repeated attempts to delete the blank book I downloaded on my device and synced it again, I was unable to obtain the electronic version of “The Essence of Business” with actual content, but I saw that it was already possible to preview the book on Amazon's official website.
How many thoughts do I have at the moment
1. The price issue isn't actually the most important one; the key is how to replace the blank book on the Kindle with the actual content now, rather than the “stay tuned” if you download it forever
2. You probably won't buy the book you pre-ordered in the future. After all, if you skip your ticket and download another book with empty content, the procedure seems very complicated;
3. I hope Amazon will provide a normal channel for feedback on such issues. If you have questions about the download or use of e-books, you can have local feedback (work orders, online customer service are all OK, you can refer to how to do it on the official Microsoft store)
I don't really recommend reading
I read it a long time ago, and I just happened to see how I felt after reading it from my memory.
This book is not so much a collection of short stories as it is a collection of fragments of love from life.
The pen tone of this book is extremely bland. It is as bland as plain as plain water. The wording takes simplicity to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and bland as the street on a summer afternoon.
Every short story is a snapshot of a short period of time in an ordinary life. There is no beginning, no end.
Finally, they were collected together and titled “What Do We Talk About When We Talk About Love”.
I think this collection of novels, and its title, is like a form of performance art. What the author wants to express is that love is not only the sorrow and joy of the stage; the sea is rotten and stony in urban legends; love is not only the above nor should it be represented by the above; love is also a life as plain as water. Every day is boring and tasteless, there is also a sense of frustration with life, an escape from reality, and the future is at a loss.
As you read this book, you may think of the quarrelsome couples bickering around you, the boring marriages of people you know, and unsatisfying feelings.
This is the reason I don't recommend reading it. From an aesthetic point of view, the writing and plot of this book are completely tasteless. Unless your life is turbulent or as sweet as living in a candy castle, the feeling you have to read is that it's not weird or boring.
However, in terms of depth of thought, the daily plot did not brighten people's eyes or expand one's thoughts and horizons (this is different from Marquez's “Love in the Time of Cholera”), nor did the short clip discuss any issues, such as what kind of mistakes caused the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the main character's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book; it doesn't make much sense if you don't read it.
The author expressed his ideas more through techniques and genres than the storyline, which is also the reason for the poor reading experience of this book.
Good for rough reading; don't look closely.
The logic of this book is good, but the content isn't full enough.
It explains what many sales theories are and why, but they are very weak in how to do it; they only indicate the direction but do not give specific practices.
Plus, the book feels like a piece of work.
Examples include those at home and abroad; well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople, and famous unknown people.
I don't know if the story was written for examples; it would be more convincing if I gave examples from the author's own experiences.
It changed over and over in terms of whether it was a customer or a customer.
It's still a customer in the title, but it becomes a customer in the main text.
E-books also have typos, missing punctuation marks, and incorrect numbering issues.
Anyway, this book is a good introduction to theory, but it's not suitable for people who already work in sales and want to improve their sales standards.
A guide book to quickly understand internet finance
This book is very short. It can be said that it is just an introductory course. It can help you quickly understand the full picture of internet finance, but if you want to understand it in depth, you still have to follow the map and dig deeper on your own.
Also, the book was written quite early. The later Alipay WeChat subsidy war to cultivate user habits hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm afraid the current share of third-party payments isn't as small as stated in the book.
Now many people just need to bring a cell phone when they go out to eat, and merchants are abandoning UnionPay because bank turnover is too high.
However, I am very grateful to the author for this introductory book. It can be seen that the author has at least many years of financial observation experience and is very familiar with the history of financial development at home and abroad, which is why the content is so easy to understand.
It's easy to write high in the sky; the hard part is that it's easy to understand in plain language.
I appreciate you and want to let you know more!
The first factor that determines a person's job satisfaction is not the salary, but whether they receive enough attention and recognition at work.
According to Maslow's hierarchical theory of needs, after a person's basic survival needs are satisfied, the most urgent thing is to satisfy their psychological needs — the desire to be understood, acknowledged, and appreciated.
Indeed, for Chinese people, most of them are “I love you and it's hard to open your heart”; even if they have love, gratitude, and appreciation, they keep silent and don't say it in their hearts.
The author describes the five languages of appreciation in this book: affirmative words, careful moments, acts of service, satisfying gifts, and physical contact.
What I think is important is not that you know exactly what the five languages of appreciation are, but that you can use these five languages from the heart to appreciate and thank the people around you, whether family, friends, or colleagues.
In fact, the closer we are, the more we need appreciation and gratitude, so our lives will be better.
Learn to appreciate that companies can also retain talents to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thank you to the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and the world.
Due to the cultural background of China and the West, there will be more or less differences between languages. If I had the chance to see the author's original, I believe I would gain more.
Thanks again to the authors, translators, and editors for all their hard work!
Suspected to be a counterfeit product, please review it strictly by Amazon
The quality is super poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, not even as much as a roadside stall product. There is no weight, no bar code, and the ten-bag package is loose and broken, which is not a characteristic of a qualified product at all; it is the worst shopping experience on Amazon; it is entirely a quality issue; the merchant is advised to polish their eyes and reject poor quality products; additional: I also bought Heart Print. The supermarket is 23 yuan/10 rolls, and several comparison photos have been added to further verify the hypocrisy of this product. In order to give consumers a clearer reference and avoid financial losses and unrelenting feelings Hurry up!
Once again, we expect Amazon to be meticulous and strictly control the origin of products.
A sloppy product that is far from what is expected
Advantages:
1. Big brands, cheap prices.
Advantage 2: The motor and blade are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and it's OK to use, but there's a gap with my expectations.
Cons:
1. There is no indicator for charging. This is the most basic power indicator for you. It is estimated that customers who buy 300 yuan products are also charity and have no respect in the eyes of Panasonic.
2. There is a strong smell when charging, even after only 10 minutes of charging, you can smell the strong smell of burning plastic.
The office was tested for 1 day, and the whole house smelled like this kind of plastic.
Compared to the Philips PHILIPS I've used before at the same price, it has more blades, but the quality of this Panasonic product is really sorry for consumers.
small package
As soon as I received the courier and read the e-commerce version on it, I knew it had fallen into the hole again. It's better than the one I bought at the supermarket. It's probably M. It's not the same packaging as the picture on the product description. It's called the new version.
The three stars are blaming you for not being able to read the product specifications clearly. I have no opinion if you sell the M size e-commerce version. What do you mean by the wrong edition?
The e-commerce routine is deep, so I went to the supermarket to buy it when I had time.
Just the sauce is purple.
I don't like the taste
Kids really don't like the smell of toothpaste. They say it spicy every time. Maybe it's more appropriate to use other words to describe it. For the time being, this is the only word in children's thesaurus.
I bought it when I was at an event. It's very cheap, so I'm too embarrassed to give it a bad review. 4 stars, but I won't buy it again.
Genuine, well packaged
The package is very complete, with an inflatable bag inside. The only thing that has no online reviews is the product that looks like a bare bald product.
There is also a layer of plastic film on the outer packaging of the bottle as described in the picture, and the courier was also fast. It arrived the next day after shooting.
It's a genuine product, but it's out of stock. I don't know when it will be on the shelves again.
A bad shopping experience
The order was placed at the time of the Black Friday. As a result, I had waited a long time for the package to be signed. When I asked my colleagues around me, they all said they didn't help. They quickly contacted the courier company, but they said they needed the sender to initiate the inquiry, contacted Amazon customer service, and waited for more than 10 days. Finally, it became clear that the courier had been mistakenly delivered to someone else, and I didn't know it had been overused. Overall, it's pretty bad
Wrong picture
I thought I could get headphones like Figure 1, but I didn't expect to get headphones like Figure 2. Forget the inconsistent pictures. What does the difference in volume between the left and right earphones mean?
Although the names are all the same, I hope everyone can pay careful attention. Also, please ask the person in charge of Amazon to change the correct images in a timely manner. Thank you very much.
The operating system is average
I've been using it for a while. Overall, the picture is OK, and I don't feel any difference. The system is clearly a bit slow to boot, and I can't make any good settings. There's even no need to comment on the software that comes with it. The response speed is even more average. Compared to my colleagues, that's not an order of magnitude.
I read the reviews saying that the design is very user-friendly. I haven't found anything user-friendly. The position of the remote control, the commonly used up, down, left, left, and right, return button design is really unflattering.
So, let's just use it as a TV, plus something like a TV box.
The price reduction is too great
The price drop is so great that over 100 is now 99!
I've accumulated a lot of unrated orders on Amazon, so I've always used a copied passage as review content.
If I use this passage to review, it means that this product has at least 85 points.
However, I would never be too lazy to copy and paste reviews of poor products, so other consumers will use them as a reference when purchasing, and merchants will improve product quality as a result.
Good line at a low price, that's enough if you don't have a fever!
It's such a cheap cable, but it must have met the HDMI certification standards. Compared to the domestic Akihabara dog crap (they are all twice as expensive), the wire is thick and relatively soft. There is no noise in the 7-meter transmission. There is no noise in the 7-meter transmission, so I will think twice about the low price line in the future!
The stuff is OK, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites
After placing the order, I discovered that there was an error, but I couldn't cancel the order. The website kept showing an error link when contacting online customer service, and I couldn't get in touch.
The delivery person called me after it arrived. I said I didn't want it anymore. If I wanted to cancel the order, the delivery person took it back and said I would sign for it first and let me apply for a return.
When I applied for a return, I was only told that once the food item was signed for, there was no way to call Amazon customer service. It's also a similar statement; the order cannot be returned.
I've bought items that cannot be returned by JD and Suning before, including milk, diapers, etc. I contacted customer service and they all returned them. Moreover, JD's diapers taste too bad after opening and I still contacted customer service to return them; it won't work when I arrived at your Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive. Contact your customer service. How do you handle it?
Tell me I'll either take it for myself or let the delivery person buy it themselves. It's not easy for them to be a delivery person. Why should I make someone pay to buy something they didn't buy?
OK, I'm not going to give it back either. I took it myself, but I have to rate your service 1 point
Advise everyone not to spend money in vain
First of all, I'm looking forward to buying it. I think the Dole brand's one shouldn't be too bad. After I received it, I think it's OK. It's pretty good, but one of the boxes is basically soft, and I can't see it on the outside. If you eat it, it doesn't taste at all, it's light and tasteless. If you bite off the dark yellow color of the pulp, it's just bad. It's not even one-third of what you can eat. It's not cheap, the quality is so bad!
Once you eat it, you'll never buy fruit on e-commerce again!
Where is the product security label
The bottom of the bottle has a severe indentation, which must have been caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging, the extent of the damage is worrisome. After all, the food packaging is too simple, and it's also purchased internationally. I haven't seen any obvious anti-counterfeiting signs. The point is that the layer of honey inside the lid comes directly out of the inside, and the opening has almost no adhesiveness. Are all foreign products like this?
Being born in China, I don't understand it.
It's supposed to be a genuine product, right?
Also, when I took the picture, I was prompted to arrive on the 20th. I received this on the 14th. My first overseas purchase here. I just wrote down my doubts. Maybe this is all normal?
Pickup service needs to be improved
I bought a total of 5 delivery vouchers. At the time of collection, I made an appointment to pick up 3 copies for the first time. After multiple communication, it was confirmed that they had been omitted and that they needed to be reissued after approval; the second reservation, just in time for a day off, the website and WeChat didn't prompt me to make an appointment on a weekday, causing unnecessary panic and suggested improvements later.
Nice shopping
The stuff was well received!
I still trust Amazon's own products. Now it's very convenient after buying overseas. The logistics time for buying back from abroad is only a few days longer than at home. I have to say that Amazon's customs clearance ability from overseas purchases to domestic ones is still very strong. It's much faster than transit, so now a lot of things are bought overseas.
I hope the quality and price of domestic products will be better. Many things are made domestically, but going out and buying them back is cheaper than at home, so I hope for improvements.
garbage
Seeing a package like this, let's ask everyone: Do you think it's roadside trash?
A plastic package that is fragile is sent from so-called Germany in a plastic bag. Is this kind of packaging responsible?
I think this kind of packaging is like garbage. When I bought this product, the packaging was rudimentary. There were no measures to prevent damage. It was just a simple plastic bag. When I got it, the package was completely deformed, and the items inside were also damaged.
If I only came across one like this, I agree. I bought a few of them all like this. When I called Amazon customer service, the customer service said it was refundable, but the shipping fee was paid in advance, and then the shipping fee was returned to me in the form of a gift card.
Let me just ask, I used cash to pay for shipping, and you gave me back the gift card. If I had to buy your gift card myself, go ahead and mail the product to a German warehouse. This isn't a crime for buying a product!
And I've always said to customer service, who is responsible for this kind of problem, but the customer service doesn't say it's their responsibility; they don't even dare to take on half a sentence of responsibility. What guarantees are there for this kind of after-sales service? In a word: I don't know how to plant it! But I don't think Amazon will give me a chance to publish my review and just delete it!
The quality is very good 5 stars, the logistics are very poor
1. Very good quality, super cheap, affordable, great value for money.
2. Strong, sufficient material, firm solder joints, proper surface treatment, and good color.
3. The logistics were difficult. The order was placed on the 3rd and arrived on the 11th.
4. If Amazon doesn't indicate that the estimated delivery time is February 7, I would probably be satisfied.
5. However, marking the expected delivery time is equivalent to giving the user a promise. When the promise cannot be fulfilled, the user feels very bad.
6. If you're not sure about giving a promise, don't make a promise.
7. Actually, I really care about the promises made by merchants.
8. So, I gave a low score.
The gold thread will fade
The effect is still there, but whether it feels obvious depends on the individual or psychological effect.
One thing that's not very good is the gold thread. It was originally designed to look good, but in reality, this gold thread will fade and be placed on the car. If you hold it a few times, there will be some gold powder on your hands and on the car.
Hope the product can be improved.
This kind of square one doesn't have any decorative effect, so don't use gold lines to remove it; it's still troublesome to fall off the car and stain the car.
The item is in good condition, the speed is OK, in 2 packages and in different packages
The speed for 8 days was pretty fast, but the packaging was not the same. Obviously, one was too shockproof. The thick cardboard was attached, sealed with a layer of plastic, and the outer packaging was easy to remove. One was like a domestic courier box; just putting in a few buffer air bags was fine; it felt a bit perfunctory.
The Yalan mattress is really nice
The 34cm mattress is not usually thick, so you can sleep directly on the mattress without the bed.
The quality is very good, it's very soft on both the front and back, very comfortable to sleep, and I fell asleep quickly when lying on it.
After receiving the mattress, there were two stains due to the violent shipping of the courier. The Yalan customer service was very responsible and contacted very efficiently to solve the problem.
It's not a self-operated product; Amazon is shameless
The page clearly states that it is self-operated. In fact, it is delivered by the supplier. The supplier is responsible for after-sales service. Contact the supplier yourself if there is any problem.
If you want to cancel the order, I'm sorry, the order information has been sent to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you want to return the item, you have successfully applied for a return on Amazon. Sorry, no one cares about you; you need to contact the supplier to return the item yourself.
What kind of product is Nima's own business.
The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon is not responsible after the sale. The customer service actually said “I'll help you contact the supplier,” but they also claim that they are self-employed. It's so shameless. It's blatantly shameless, and blatantly defrauded consumers!
A depressing experience
The filter I bought online before from another company had a good filtration effect, and there was no limescale even if I used it for an additional day or two after 28 days.
Since everything I've always bought on Amazon is of good quality, this time I wanted to buy a filter on Amazon. The first time I bought a filter on Amazon, I didn't feel very good. Not only did I start to have water stains early on, but the filter will also have suspended little black toner until the 28th day. I really don't know if I'm going to keep using it or just throw it away. I'm very depressing~
It's not as good as I thought
Compared to the cable boards I've used in the past, the exterior workmanship is average, and I can see how the interior is not taken apart. Hopefully, as described by the store, from the point of view of ease of use, there is no indication of whether each independent unit is energized
The packaging is damaged, wait a while to check the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is seriously damaged. The box inside seems to be new, but the instructions don't seem to be new. It was only renovated in September. I'm stocking up. I hope it won't be bad by then. Please Amazon explain why several customers have mentioned that the packaging is damaged, yet you can handle it safely. Thank you!
Overall good, a bit of a minor problem
When I bought a water filter bottle for the first time, I read a few reviews of LAICA and chose this one. When I received the product and installed the filter according to the instructions, I tried it. Overall, it felt good, but when I poured water, it seemed like the raw water would mix with the treated water from the spout (the original water tank was not sealed too tightly).
When you use it, be sure to wait until all the water has been filtered before you pour it out!
The picture is incomplete
The picture doesn't show the details on the side. The details on the side don't match the style of the main body, and there is a big difference; this is the second; there is no indication of the texture, which is the third; when I bought them in the UK, it was clear that each item had its own box. Here is only a simple plastic bag, and there's no product logo on the beads. How can I tell if it's real or fake.
Be careful when buying, especially if you buy things from Hong Kong.
Amazon customer service really sucks
The order was placed two days ago, and I found that it had dropped by 40 yuan when I received it today. It took a long time to find customer service. The customer service said they couldn't make up the price difference; they could buy it again and return it.
This kind of customer experience and service is actually ten thousand times worse than Mubao Mudong.
OK, as a newbie, it's worth starting
It's in excellent condition. It's not comparable to Extreme King Kong. I've seen the prices in shopping malls before, hundreds to say the least. This is my first time playing King Kong, so it's OK.
Nice stuff
The stuff was really nice. It was delivered to my girlfriend, but I was a little unhappy when I wasn't delivering in Canada at noon. The logistics company sent me an email and sent me a verification text message without receiving it, which caused me to take two trips.
But the baby is really nice.
It's worth buying
The little monkey is cute. The Amazon discount is really strong. It ships directly from Chow Shengsheng's official website. The order was placed the night before yesterday, and I received it this afternoon. It was really fast.
Postal couriers are also very responsible.
awesome!
A customer's confession
1 When you receive such a defective product, Amazon customer service tells you not to be in a hurry; we will contact you in about 54 hours.
2 Then you contact the customer service staff. They will tell you that the issue will be handled by a specialist, and he will let you know the results.
You'll never be able to voluntarily contact this specialist, don't know her job number, and don't have a direct contact number; that is, you can't get in touch with her; only she can contact you.
3 Tragically, after almost 3 days of waiting, this specialist contacted me, left my phone for a while, and didn't get a call from this specialist.
I waited 2 hours without a call from that specialist. During that time, I took the initiative to contact Amazon customer service and sent an email from customer service asking her to call me back.
4 It's been almost 3 days, and I still don't know what the treatment results will be for the Amazon coffee machine that I received as a defective product!
5 There is no problem with Amazon products in the US. Buying overseas is a good way to shop, but it's far worse than the service in the US and Asia.
6 For me I can only keep waiting...
The bottom is not flat
Because everything I read in the reviews is very good, I'm looking forward to this pot, and I like it when I get my hands on it. It's very lightweight, but I noticed a problem when I opened the pot. The bottom of the pot was not flat. The center was raised, the periphery was recessed, and the oil had all gone to the periphery. The fat meat I bought on purpose couldn't cover the center area. It's sticky, and I can't even open the pot.
I don't know if I'm unlucky; I just got a pot with an uneven bottom. Thankfully, Amazon offered a one-month return service, and I decided to return it.
I brushed the pot clean and returned it, and Bai had been busy for half a day.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve
This is a product with a very simple design style.
In the shape of a cube, the designer treated the top as a slightly curved surface.
It was supposed to be a very smooth line.
Unfortunately, the final effect was not achieved.
Because there are two parts on the top, the control panel on the front and the top cover of the water tank on the back.
The curvature of the top cover was actually inconsistent with the curvature of the control panel. There was a maximum height difference of about 2mm after splicing.
Looks like a pretty small gap though.
But it can be said that it destroyed the whole sense of design.
I'm a little upset with the product designer.
It seems that Midea's product managers are not yet capable of creating products of this standard.
(Of course, I can't ask for too much feedback from the after-sales lady, but when I heard the aftersales say that all the individuals on this product were like this, not the only one I bought had a problem, her disbelief and honest burden made me understand that it wasn't too high for beauty.) The 2019-7-7 pump failed with little water output. It had been repaired for the second time, and it was broken two weeks after the first repair.
Very good deal after the discount, Amazon's fake offer is very sad
I bought it one week after the baby was born, and it has excellent insulation.
The outside of the pot doesn't touch a hint of heat, so even if you're not afraid of getting burned, it can effectively protect the temperature from scattering.
After a night, the air conditioning room can still maintain a very high temperature.
Amazon said there were 320 major discounts for the annual event. I later discovered that everyone had 249,289,299. I instantly felt deceived, but after going to the supermarket and comparing them, it was still much cheaper than all kinds of miscellaneous goods at the same price. You can carry them with your car when you go out in the future.
Vitamix Vitamix 6300
I've been watching for a long time. Seeing a discount on the Meiya 6300 and Central Asia's overseas purchases at the same price, I quickly started.
The order was placed on September 2. It is expected to arrive on the 21st. As a result, it will arrive on the 12th. It was almost 10 days ahead of schedule. It was really fast!
The box isn't big; I used Vitamix's original packaging directly, and Amazon isn't afraid it will break when it crosses the ocean!
The machine looked brand new and had all the accessories, even though the cup shook so much when placed on the base, I was afraid that the cup would fly out when I started it!
I asked a friend who is 5,200 years old and asked him to describe it as if it wasn't as relaxed as mine.
The recipes that are randomly attached are all in English. I'm tired of reading them, and I can't find the Chinese version online. This is a problem!
I bought a transformer as soon as I received it. I think it will arrive in 3 days, and I'll have a lot more time to toss around when the time comes!
Too small, no umbrella cover, average material.
It's not big at all!
The second pair of Totes, 1. This one doesn't have an umbrella cover 2. The handle material is average 3. Clearly write Large. It's actually a convenient umbrella for one person; it's probably enough for two people.
Instead, the one I bought in the US before can be used by three people without pressure.
I don't feel very good
First, the case isn't very strong; if you press it flat, it doesn't work; secondly, the ABS on the back design doesn't work to prevent the surface of the box from being scratched; the other is that the inside of the case is just a cloth wrapped in a rag that sticks out... etc., I'm not satisfied with all kinds of things, and finally the zipper isn't smooth.
PS: The wheels feel really good
It's OK
Advantages: This backpack is delicate and looks durable.
Cons: The QR code on the card can't be scanned (what the hell), I can't put down my 15.6 inch laptop (can't put down a little longer), the zipper of this backpack can be locked, but it doesn't provide a lock for the buyer; service doesn't come first.
The whole thing is OK, I don't know if it's genuine
The overall feeling is OK. I don't know if it's genuine, so I can't evaluate it blindly.
It can hold A4 format documents. Over 80 pages thick, but box-shaped objects that are too thick and too hard (cannot be deformed) probably won't fit.
The bag is very soft, and the inner pocket dividers are quite user-friendly, which is quite nice.
It's just that the one I got has a small trachoma on the bottom. I don't know if I'm in bad shape or not?
Too lazy to go back and forth to exchange goods; bear with it.
An overall rating of 4 stars is worth it.
ForRoyal's most popular camera strap SLR strap
This strap is scientifically designed; it hangs over two shoulders; it is practical, and the chest is secured and protected with soft material. It doesn't use screws to fix the bottom of the camera like other fast shooters, and it's also easy to take off for photography.
Garbage after-sales
The piano I bought a month and a half ago was missing a part. After informing Amazon, they gave me an after-sales call. After many conversations, I haven't received the parts yet. Please tell me how efficient this is!
I think the repair will be more troublesome if there is a problem later. Hoping that after the sale, friends should take a detour. Too bothersome!
There are minor flaws, the sound is good
The piano head is defective. One horn is missing. It looks like it's a defective product, and there aren't any free gifts, but the price is good, and the sound of the piano is also good.
OK, the first batch of noodles
I've been using it for a long time, and apart from not being able to get the bass out, overall it's pretty good.
However, the workmanship wasn't as perfect as I had imagined.
When I first bought it, there was a problem with the item. All the lights were blinking and I couldn't use it.
I asked for a replacement. As a result, it's been three days since it arrived in Shanghai, and it hasn't been delivered yet.
Delivery phone calls are also not answered.
The courier said they only had that contact method.
Amazon can't find a place to complain.
In the absence of a request and a delay in delivery, the delivery was inexplicably delayed at my request - I received an SMS like this.
I'll talk about transit issues later.
Despite the extremely poor shopping experience, I began to doubt the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics system and control system.
I don't think I'll be able to get it today either.
The label has poor adhesiveness and is not waterproof
Although the Bluetooth connection is very convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not coated; moreover, the adhesive of the label is very poor, so it doesn't work at all for cable labels; it falls off very easily. If you buy it to organize cables, you should pay attention.
The pen is OK, but the package is too simple. It's just a paper box; there are no protective measures, and the box that holds the pen is attached with a large piece of transparent glue, so if you remove the glue, it's all on the box.
The 600 yuan item was treated like this. It was a very disappointing shopping trip.
But the pen is fine.
Hope there are more improvements to the packaging in the future!
Not to mention the quality; when it comes to writing, it's not as good as 925-25
First, let's praise Tiantian Express. The airfares are super fast and the service is very good!
I've been using the 925-25. It's great. I just received the 925-85. Not to mention the quality of the pen, the style is also very beautiful. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the pen is a bit heavy and not suitable for fast writing. The cap shakes a bit when adjusting the length of the lead core. My personal opinion: 925-25 is easier than 85.
As a result, I became an Amazon die-hard fan
I bought it at a super bargain price. As a result, kids don't like reading pens.
It's been unwrapped. I tried applying for a return, but it's actually free to pick up the package at your door.
That's awesome.
Returns are not encouraged, but this is the only service in China.
Hope it's not misused.
All future books have moved to this place to buy them.
The headphone is biased, and there is also noise
This headphone is really rubbish. I don't know if it's a problem with my ears, or if this headphone is really not as good as it used to be.
I bought a blue one from Someyi two years ago. The sound quality is pretty good, there's no noise or bass, and I'm planning to buy another one (urbeats) after using it for over 2 years. After all, it feels pretty good.
I also saw a pretty purple one. As a result, I bought this one today and only heard it didn't feel right. While it was loud, it was quiet.
At first I thought it was because of the sound effects of that song, but after listening to it for half a day, I discovered that the problem was serious. Not only was the sound polarized, the bass effect didn't sound as good as I had before. There was also a bit of noise. Is it only the purple one I bought that has this phenomenon? Or is the current headphone manufacturing process really not working?
Quite a bad review, very disappointing.
Be sure to return it tomorrow during the day.
PS looks good
This AV amplifier has complicated settings, rough appearance, and high heat generation.
I'll have to wait a while for the sound to review!
On August 14, the German version of the DN1081. 1 looks pretty bad at first glance.
1. The front panel and knobs are all plastic.
2. The audio input jack and speaker output terminals on the back panel are all very poor. Just looking for a 1000-2000 all-in-one CD amplifier is much better than this one.
3. The top cover is relatively thin, and the side of my transformer is still dented. As a last resort, I opened the box and restored it with my hands. The top cover and front panel came loose.
4. The center of gravity of the whole machine is deflected to the transformer end, which is very awkward when moving.
It feels like a Sony entry-level machine; just the workmanship, made in Malaysia.
I feel like Sony's OEM in China would be much better than the pony.
5. The machine heats up a lot. The two channels used to watch the movie are 40-50℃ when you touch the top cover with your hands. I don't know if the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.
Now that we use a lot of switching power supplies, this stupid transformer is estimated to be 4 kg.
Sony should use a silent fan with active cooling in the machine. After unpacking, you can only see the large aluminum heatsink on the tube.

Never taken apart
The battery is working.
I'd love to have an autopsy to see what it really is in its stomach.
When I think about it later, if you are very disappointed after unpacking it, it would be a mistake to spend that much money; if you are satisfied after unpacking it, it will be difficult to put it back on, and it won't be nice to use it.
Forget it, even if Sony uses good batteries.
As for the detailed explanation of the amount of electricity, the average person feels lost when they look at it.
I'm fine. I've worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I'm also half a battery engineer, so I can handle it.
overjoyed
I really had no idea before I bought it, and I felt great until I opened the package!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cable, it felt so flexible. The quality was so good that I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone to turn on QQ music.
I was stunned; the sound quality was 3D surround!
I asked about it at a physical communication store. It's about 30, but it's definitely not Pinsheng's brand; it's miscellaneous, so even though this Pinsheng is 27 yuan, it's definitely worth owning for money!
The worst online shopping experience
After the order was placed on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped. As a result, the goods were not received until October 12.
Check the status of the Amazon order. The seller did not provide a tracking number, so I can't find out where the order is.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide a tracking number, but there was no response after 2 days.
In desperation, I called Amazon customer service. The customer service told me the seller's mobile phone number, and I called the store again. After a few calls, the phone went through and I was told that the courier had lost the package, so I could send another one right away.
I'm really angry, but since I need a computer urgently, I didn't say much to the seller; just send it to me right away.
As a result, I called the next day and asked, was it shipped?
The seller said it hasn't been released yet; it will only be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon to ask. The seller said it would be delivered after 5 or 6 p.m.; as a result, when I called at 7 p.m., no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again and asked if the goods had been shipped?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said it wasn't delivered, and told me if I was in a hurry let me order from someone else; if I could wait, it would be sent in the afternoon.
There's no choice. I'll have to wait a long time to order from another company.
You can only ask the seller to ship it quickly.
I finally received my computer on October 16 after countless phone calls.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know, since I bought it for someone else, I'll add a comment later.
I just bought it for half a year and haven't used it a few times. Now it's not in good contact. I'm asking if it can be repaired?
Since I have a desktop, I haven't used it many times since I bought it.
I only use it a few times in my fashion bag when I'm on a business trip.
I recently discovered that when connected to a power source, it doesn't charge; you need to hold the charger and cable connection a few times with your hand to charge the battery.
The suspicion is that the interface is not in good contact. I wonder if it can still be repaired now?
I highly recommend Amazon discontinue EMS!
Five stars for products, one star for logistics, three stars for the average.
I don't understand why Amazon sends EMS; the industry admits that it's unreliable. OK, computers are also valuable items!
After the purchase, the order showed that it was expected to be delivered on the 20th, so the family waited at home for three days!
Why is it four or five days to ship from Xiamen to Fuzhou!
The logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou on the morning of the 22nd, ready to be happy to receive the goods. As a result, I checked the logistics in the evening without receiving any phone calls or text messages, but it was actually signed for at noon. It also showed that I signed for it!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I actually buy this computer?
I just doubt life, OK!
Finally, I took a trip to the collection point before I moved my computer back.
Simply put, the specific reason is that the courier boy reversed the two ticket numbers. Fortunately, if you don't lose the item, forget it.
I strongly recommend Amazon not to use EMS. If Amazon uses EMS for express delivery in the future, I definitely won't buy it again.
The goods are pretty good
First of all, I found a price drop just a few days after I bought it. The review is pretty good. It's cost-effective. The CPU and video card are good enough for mainstream online games and quite a few large stand-alone computers. The cooling is very good, but the screen is a bit leaking (common problem with IPS screens), the sound quality is not good, and the hard drive isn't good (I recommend spending some money to add a solid state). I took it yesterday and tested the hardware after the sale. There are no problems. The win8.1 that comes with it is not easy to use. I recommend upgrading to 10. The seller shipped it very fast. The questions were answered very quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I got it on the computer. Nice, but unfortunately it's a free gift None at all.
(By the way, don't go to a certain Bao store called E-Ku Digital Center to buy keyboard stickers. Delivery is slow and the quality is poor, there are no returns or exchanges if there are any problems with the product, and the boss is still full of foul language. Please make a special revelation)
The stuff is very good, the platform bureaucracy is still the same
The hard drive is of very good quality, and is definitely cost-effective. It's cheaper than buying it in Hong Kong. If you're not in a hurry or can endure the logistics, I definitely recommend buying it.
But I have to say that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform is still the same. There were no improvements when I swore a few years ago that I would never use it. You'll never be able to check the actual logistics situation, the information will always arrive a few weeks later, and you can never file a complaint. That's just the bureaucracy!
It's been a few days since you received the item, and the logistics information is still about 10 days before you receive it!
Unworry-free logistics
It came out looking like this. Not only was the package flattened, but the electrical appliance package was also opened, and I don't know if the package had been adjusted.
FYI
I haven't tried it yet. I've always trusted Philips, and I hope the battery lasts longer than other brands.
I checked it on the internet. It's probably a common problem with water ingress, and there's no warranty.
Depressed!
Now wrap it in plastic wrap and keep using it. I don't know how long it will last?
Bought one that someone else has taken apart
The tax on more than 300 machines that cost more than 100 is actually quite high. It seems that now more than 600 machines have a much more balanced mind.
When I received it, the sealing tape looked very wrong. It looked like it had been unpacked. I quickly took a picture. Sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. The cardboard inside was still damaged after opening. I was worried that someone else had returned it. I quickly tried it on my husband before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no electricity at all. Fortunately, there was no scum on the knife head. How can I go back if it's not too old!
Whether it's easy to use or whether there will be any problems in the short term is still unknown. As in the previous review, what they send when they are out of stock is really unreliable!
Higher level of experience
It's almost top-level electric. There are many modes for cleaning teeth, but few people switch between different modes of brushing every day.
I haven't had any problems after using it for half a year. I brush it every day, and I wash it almost every Monday.
Brush accessories are just as cheap to buy on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use. Other than changing the colors, are there any other compatibility issues that seem to be the reason for the overseas version?
Those who want to learn Dafa.
Very cost-effective
Have used it 3-4 times.
1. The packaging is intact.
2. Very easy to use and easy to clean.
3. It's completely possible to DIY haircuts, saving money.
All in all, a very successful purchase.
There are fakes
The last time I bought two packs, they are actually two different versions. Originally, the letters in the lower left corner of the package were green, but it turned out that it wasn't; it was white; as a result, cats had diarrhea when they ate them.
I'm not sure if the Amazon supply is fake or if the package was dropped by an employee at the time of delivery.
I'll buy it again; if it's still a fake, I'll have to go to your relevant people to account.
It's a horizontal bar!
The Amazon image has slashes, but the results sent me are horizontal bars. Isn't that a lie?
The effect is OK
Cats love to eat, that's the point.
It's also really effective.
Tight, narrow, hoop the foot, polish the back of the foot.
NOT RECOMMENDED.
1.un is Clarks's most comfortable series, but unfortunately this one is so bad.
Added: Today I compared the previous UN series insoles (leave the padding on the shoes). The material is much worse than before. They are not as elastic as before, and they are not as breathable as before, but they are fake and soft.
2. The back of my foot isn't that tall. The buttuckles are about 3 cm forward from the highest point on the back of the foot.
3. I bought three pairs of Clarks overseas; only one pair is suitable.
I was so scared that I deleted all the music from my wishlist.
Go back and try Rockport. If not, you can only go to the ECCO physical store.
Secondary charging is good, quality control is not good
First of all, what is worth affirming is that Prime is very effective in buying Ups overseas. The order placed on the 31st was received on the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is slightly larger. The 25 feet are 10.5 wide at 7.5W. The upper foot is slightly loose, but I usually like to wear looser ones; a pair of insoles is just right.
Second, the quality control of this shoe is really unflattering. The sole of one shoe is damaged, the other has various scratches and a needle eye. The rubber strip at the connection between the upper and the sole is misplaced, and the clearly marked one can be refilled again!
I regret it a bit!
I bought it for 280 yuan to do activities. It's quite a bargain to buy an Asics at this price. Of course, there are lower prices based on reviews.
Now let's talk about shoes. Advantages: They are very light, very comfortable to run, fit quite well, and don't come loose.
They look great, but the drawbacks are obvious: I usually wear 40's shoes, and the 40.5 ones I bought this time are about 1 thumb away from the front end of the shoes, but this doesn't affect anything.
These shoes are very “narrow,” and although there is still distance between the front, they feel tight.
Also, the shoes may not be very breathable, and I feel that my feet are very hot when I wear them.
Press the back of the foot
First of all, the shoes are very well made and worth the price.
My feet are very standard. I've bought a few pairs of running shoes uk7.5, eu41.5, leather shoes uk6.5, and Amazon's Aibou, and I've never seen them fit, but I read the reviews. I bought one size larger uk7. After the upper foot was one size larger, they were clearly too long, but because the insole was too thick, they still put a lot of pressure on the back of the foot. In addition, the hiking shoes are very hard, making the upper foot very uncomfortable.
If you don't have particularly thin feet, I don't recommend buying this one.
If you have to buy it, changing the insole will solve it, but the original insole looks very classy, so it's a pity not to use it.
A perfect shopping trip!
Very satisfied, I like it very much. Amazon's overseas purchases are all genuine products, the quality is also very good, the price is reasonable, the after-sales service is very thoughtful, the customer service is very kind, patient and efficient in handling problems, and perfectly solves worries. The supporting express delivery is very convenient and secure. The delivery master is very attentive to the customer. Every time, I promptly remind Amazon to pick up the goods from the courier cabinet. Thank you Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
Anyway, our whole family loves shopping overseas on Amazon!
Absolutely bad review!
Really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Even though it's been a long time, I'm still going to talk about it.
I bought it in a flash in the winter. It's less than 200, and it's useless to keep it at home for a few months.
When I needed to use it in the spring, I discovered that it couldn't connect to the bracelet. Both device manuals indicated support for each other, but I later discovered that it was probably a heart rate band problem because I still couldn't connect to other devices.
I called Amazon and asked me to contact the agency, which asked me to send the equipment to Shanghai for testing at my own expense.
After almost half a month, the item was sent back in its original form; even the delivery box was the one I used when I sent it back!
No replies or receipts or test reports!
Just tell me, is it a good thing or a bad one!
Call and ask and say that sending it back like this means there is no problem with the device. That's fine.
But why can't I connect? The agency answered: That's not their thing.
I'm unlucky; I'm too lazy to be tossed around by you for something worth 200 yuan.
The item is seriously out of order.
Unavailable goods are out of stock.
The headband is made of very good material.
Much better than Nike.
The breathability is also very good.
It's just the hat on the front.
Very fine.
Are you trying to make fun of me?!
It doesn't block the sun at all.
It's not being returned because it works great as a headband.
It doesn't cover the sun when worn upwards, though.
But it's different from other headband styles.
Use it for retention.
The quality of the product is good, Amazon lacks a contractual spirit, and the delivery staff are nice.
I'm requesting delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon rules do not allow delivery on Saturdays and Sundays.
It hurt me and drove 200 kilometers back from abroad to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery guy was very positive and welcoming.
Give it a thumbs up!
Product, just tried it, it's pretty good.
But I haven't bought a similar product before, so I can't compare prices!
Size logistics
The workmanship is OK, but the logistics are too slow. All of the shoes used to be DHL, but this time Apex is really... I've bought a lot of UA domestically, and the price isn't low. I think the one made is higher grade than NIKE ADIDAS?
Actually, they're all just as good, so sea bream.
Size: I'm 176CM, 68KG, I have wide shoulders and I usually wear 180 clothes. The M I bought had a slightly long hem. The others are perfect to wear. I think I recommend a size S. Are you that slim? Still prefer a tight fit? I think a looser hoodie would be better.
Just the right size
I had a bust circumference of 99, a height of 184, and a weight of 84 kg. Before purchasing, I consulted customer service and was told that I should buy the XXL one, then I read the reviews and decided to buy the L one. After receiving the item, I discovered that the size was just right, so I almost got hit.
The price of Double Eleven is quite a bit more expensive than Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is excellent.
The problem with Z's affordable products is very troublesome!
The order was placed on the 18th, the goods were only received on the 25th. The speed of snails from Guangzhou to Beijing!
I bought an affordable Z product. There were scratches in the instructions, but I found that 4 screws and nuts were missing after receiving the item!
The kid didn't want to return the item, so I thought it wasn't a big problem, but the kid's grandpa went to several nearby hardware stores and didn't buy it!
Grandpa stuck it on at the end!
Seems like I won't be able to buy Z's affordable products in the future!
The processing quality of toys is not good
Most of the bolt holes aren't aligned. It's very hard to get the bolt on. You can see that the processing quality is not good, and I don't know how long I can play, because it's something I promised my kids, so it won't go back.
Other reviews say it's not a hassle to install; is this the only one I bought that has a problem?
Very average
Am I unlucky?
The packaging is too old to work; the workmanship is average; there is only one type of music and is only 8 seconds long and then repeated over and over; the movement is just shaking the head and moving forward, no change.
Not worth the price.
If you use it urgently, you won't return it.
The toy is of good quality, I'm going to complain about the packaging
I received the courier yesterday. I bought it on Amazon. The one marked EMS delivery was, and finally the one delivered by Tmall. How many turns did this take? Is the relationship between Amazon and Tmall pretty good?
Also, speaking of the packaging, there are a few layers of plastic wrap. There isn't even a plastic bubble paper inside. Once you open it, all the parts are in an empty box. Fortunately, the toy is of good quality. There are no broken parts, but it's too small than I had imagined. Because it doesn't come with a battery, it often derails when pushed by hand. It feels like the gap on both sides of the track is too large and the design is unreasonable.
Good quality, fun
Very fun, the components are very accurate, the workmanship is exquisite, the quality is about the same as LEGO, and the price is very reasonable when doing activities.
The assembly process was very fun. I'll do the hard work. My 5 year old son is here to play, which is great.
He had a lot of fun and was amazed; he will probably continue to buy toys of this brand in the future.
The machine is new, Haitao is good
I took a look at it for Christmas. The one I bought before was 150 yuan expensive, but it was shipped a little slower now.
The machines are pretty good; they are all very new.
Built-in Pikachu.
If you then connect to the Elf Ball, it will send you a dream.
It's pretty good to play, more portable than ps4.
I already bought Zelda, wait for the game and try it again.
They produced bad goods and sold bad goods. As a result, the bad goods service bought six watches to send to children. The quick numbers on the first one were not fully displayed; the time for the six yuan was not consistent; the difference ranged from about ten hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if there is a check time for the watch when it is in storage? They replied “Yes,” so why is there such a time difference? That must be because the watch doesn't have accuracy. Simply put, it's an aquatic product. It's not that I'm saying it's hard to hear. Look, they all have obvious quality issues (numbers are not fully displayed) and sold. Are they junk?
I contacted the seller, who gave a bunch of reasons and complained about things they shouldn't have bought in the first place, products like this, sellers like this, and after-sales service like this, who would dare to buy anything on Amazon in the future.
Anyway, I recommend not buying anything from this seller; buying it is also junk.
Amazon shipping issues
After receiving the goods, the inspection revealed:
1. The watch packaging is seriously dilapidated.
2. The manual on the watch has serious usage wrinkles.
3. The watch does not go away, the desk lamp does not charge and is unusable, and the time cannot be adjusted.
4. Contact Amazon customer service separately. You can only mail to the US at your own expense, and pay for postage later.
The reason for 5 or 2 points is that the customer service is pretty good.
I can only say that it fits
The time isn't very accurate. It's about one second faster every day; it's been over two minutes after only a few months of use.
I've used a piece of Nishitetsu City before, and I feel like it won't be a few seconds away in a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is pretty good. The timing function is a bit lacking. Basically, I can't use it. Occasionally, I mistakenly touch it to enter the timing mode.
solar sports watch
Advantages: Solar charging doesn't have to worry about changing batteries, has world time, multiple alarms, and full reminders.
Disadvantage: The mirror surface is easily scratched and dusty.
Cost-effective ratio: The average domestic price is between 220-300, and more than 180 are purchased overseas (it takes about 1 week).
Very satisfied with the watch
It must be a genuine product. I went to the counter to inspect the product. The watch looks very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it also has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It is unmatched by those 3,400 so-called mechanical watches. This is a genuine product.
The watch's timing is very accurate, and the error is within an acceptable range. There is a jewelry certification in the package of the watch. The 12 characters on the dial are real diamonds. It's perfect to wear on yourself, and it also looks great when you send it out as a gift.
Bentley watches are really nice.
The worst shopping experience ever
My wife's phone fell on the night of September 23. Out of her heart, she ordered an 8p one from Amazon. It was in stock but it wasn't self-operated and there was no price increase (I'm happy). Since it's not self-operated, the system says it is expected to arrive until September 27 at the latest.
My wife was so upset that she didn't have a cell phone. At 6:00 a.m. the next morning, she told me to think of a solution. Later, when I went to JD to see that the 256G was in stock and that it could be delivered the same day, I had to order another one right away.
I made a new purchase and wanted to cancel my Amazon order right away.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it is impossible to receive the delivery early in the morning. Call customer service after 7 o'clock to cancel the order. The customer service replied that it had already been cancelled, please wait for an SMS notification.
OK, I just waited patiently. At noon, I took a look on my phone. The order was still in status and still unshipped, so I immediately contacted customer service to request a quick cancellation. The customer service replied that the operation was OK.
When I checked the order on my phone at 3 p.m., I had no choice but to contact customer service again to clearly let them know that it had already been called for the third time. Please cancel the order and tell the seller not to ship it!
The customer service contacted the seller on the spot at my request and told me that the seller was not familiar with the system and that they had to wait until they were familiar with the system before canceling the order.
But don't worry if you tell me clearly that the seller already knows and will never ship it.
I waited until Monday to read the order and it turned out that it had already been shipped, and I was speechless.
Since it is not possible to contact the seller directly, it is only possible to call customer service again.
The rest of the processing was just speechless. Basically, I said one step before the customer service moved on.
The order has so far been declined for delivery and is preparing to be delivered again!
Wouldn't Amazon take the initiative to follow up?
It doesn't matter if the seller company takes the money anyway and doesn't follow up.
To sum it up, I'll never pay for big items in advance; this is so bothersome.
It looks beautiful
I liked this camera a long time ago, but I didn't buy it because there were other reasons other than the price. This time I bought it because of the free shipping and the price is OK.
After I bought it, there was no problem with anything else. Even when the software connected, I couldn't connect to it. My family is a TP router. After searching the internet, I found that many people have this problem. It took more than two hours to change the router settings. Finally, I used 360 WIFI as a medium to get it done. I called Xiaomi customer service during the period. They had no solution to this problem, so I just asked me to contact Amazon for after-sales service.
Another thing worth noting is that I read comments from users on the internet saying that the minimum memory card supported by this camera is 8G, so I can't recognize it if the storage capacity is smaller. I hope everyone will pay attention to this.
It feels OK to use. The picture is acceptable, but the sound quality is very poor. The machine heats up to a certain extent. If you keep it on, I feel that this level of heat is a bit difficult for people to accept.
In summary, there are still many shortcomings in this product, so I hope everyone should be careful when buying it.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I bought it for the first love of my life. I've been in a relationship for almost 3 years, and left me like this last year until now.
The reason I gave it 3 stars is because I bought it for my first love in life. Now I don't know how much I've used it; I probably threw it away!
I've been in a relationship for almost 3 years. This is how I left me last year. As soon as I think of her, I want to leave this world with heartache. The first woman in my life brought me shadows and heartache for the rest of my life, and I haven't been able to walk out yet.
When I bought this phone, I think about how the two of them felt at the time and were still able to share the same hardships together, but now I can't look back. Maybe life is like this. Some people don't want to experience it for the rest of their lives, and some things they don't want to know for the rest of their lives, but what are some ways?
As many times as I saw this Samsung phone, I thought of her. That kind of pain filled my whole body. I never bothered to use a phone that cost more than 2,000 yuan, but when I bought it for her, I didn't hesitate to be nice to one person, but one day when she changed her mind, all the Mountain League vows would dissipate.
The best products from domestic brands
Huawei is a fine product among domestic products.
Low-profile bosses and companies rely on technology and quality to win customers. This is quite different from the current business culture of using advertising operations to increase popularity!
It's impossible for a company without power to do this, and they don't dare to do it!
It is for this reason that I chose Huawei.
I bought it and used it for over half a year, and it always feels great, very nice.
The reason I didn't give it a perfect score was because there was one time when I was using it to navigate offline, and I didn't find out the reason in the end; other times it was fine.
Moreover, it enters the destination online, and automatically designs the route after searching. After leaving WiFi, its automatic offline navigation function is very practical. It doesn't need to run traffic; it directly talks to the satellite to achieve positioning and navigation, which is great!

This parameter is only available on Pentium III processors that use the core code names KatMai and Coppermine. The processor serial number is a unique 96-bit long binary number (actually using only 64 bits). Each processor only corresponds to one serial number. The serial number can be used to track the entire process of the processor from production to sales and use. Intel claims that the reason it introduced this function is “to improve e-commerce security, such as using only a certain bank card on a certain computer,” but it has caused strong privacy in many countries and regions such as China, the US, and Europe There is controversy over national security issues. The public believes that this function infringes on users' right to privacy. People with bad intentions can use this function to track other people's computers, and once Intel's serial number database is leaked, it will cause immeasurable losses. National security agencies in many countries believe that intelligence services in hostile countries can easily record and analyze computer activity. Under market pressure, Intel has disabled this function since the Pentium III processor with the core code Tulatin, and has never used this function on subsequent products such as the Pentium 4 and Core processors.

< Butter >< Butter >“ Billboard” magazine pointed out in an article published in August 2021 that the group's fans “exploited the flaws in the rankings through bright and honest means” and raised the rankings of other singles in the US, helping the song rank at the top of the 100 singles list for several weeks. Although the top 100 singles list performance usually depends on streaming media and broadcasts, the list performance mainly comes from sales promotion (most of which comes from BTS's online store, which allows fans to buy multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) Fan-led crowdfunding campaigns (including the use of funds raised from a global fan base to make purchases that only count towards US sales on services such as PayPal); however, an article in the “Korea Times” refutes claims about ranking manipulation, which argues that fan groups of other singers such as Justin Little and Ariana Grande have also adopted similar promotional measures. These measures are neither illegal nor immoral; the fans participating in these measures are simply “smart consumers leading global trends.”
Basically, it is certain that the last common ancestor had a gene and genetic code, and their genes were probably composed of DNA, so the last common ancestor appeared after the RNA world; in the presence of DNA, its DNA code uses the same four nucleotides as today, namely adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T); its DNA maintains a double helix structure based on an enzyme such as DNA polymerase, and its DNA polymerase may belong to the D-family polymerase; and the integrity of its DNA polymerase structure is probably a D-family polymerase; and the integrity of its DNA polymerase is probably a group D polymerase; however, its DNA polymerase may belong to the D-family polymerase; however, its DNA polymerase may belong to the D-family polymerase; however, its DNA polymerase may belong to the D-family polymerase; however, its DNA polymerase may belong to the D-family polymerase; however, its DNA polymerase may belong to the D-family polymerase; however, its structural integrity Then rely on a class that includes DNA expansion Enzymes that maintain and repair the structure of DNA, including paroisomerase; furthermore, if the genetic coding basis is DNA, then these codes will be expressed through a single strand of RNA as an intermediary, and its RNA will be generated through RNA polymerase that relies on DNA, and the coding of its RNA will use riboglycine similar to DNA, but thymidine in the DNA will be replaced by uracil; in addition, this type of organism will contain a variety of tissue protein folding proteins.

However, the activation of the achievement system also requires characters to reach an adventure level of 10 or higher to be used. After the official launch of the latest documentary The Shadow Odyssey (The Shadow Odyssey, TSO for short) in November 2008, the achievement system was divided into three types of achievement systems: a class-only system, a branch career system, and a TSO career system. Among them, the TSO career achievement system added by Shadows Odyssey is roughly divided into basic career lines, four major professional branch lines (fighter, mage, priest, rebuke), segmented career lines (warriors, knights, and knights), monk, witch doctor, priest, Drew Yi, Poet, Wanderer, Thief, Warlock, Summoner, Conjurer, Illusionist), each branch line must reach 10 points before continuing on to the next branch line. Other than the basic career line, which has no special moves, other branches have special moves, and they all require that branch line has 10 points to score big moves. At the end, each of them has 2 major moves. After clicking, each of them will give players a title.
Even if this amendment comes into effect, public holidays that overlap with Saturday can theoretically reach 5 days a year, but this situation only occurred in 1999 (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd day of the Lunar New Year and the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival in that year did not overlap with Sunday, and there were no cases where holidays were taken on Saturdays, but there were still as many as 5 days of public holidays that overlapped with Saturday, respectively, the day after Good Friday, Labor Day, Buddha's Day, Christmas Day), the 36-year holiday period from 2011 to 2046, with the public period heavy on Saturday, a maximum of 4 days per year, an average of 2.78 days, see table below (2024 and Subsequent public holidays have not yet been announced, based on the assumption that the Public Holidays Ordinance has not been revised until 2046; since the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997, the one-country, two-system, 50-year fixed period will expire on July 1, 2047, and the laws and systems implemented in Hong Kong thereafter are still unknown, so 2047 and beyond will not be calculated).
This paradox suggests that there are no defined limitless measures that can be added on a sphere, whose values are equal to all subsets that are equal to each other (Hausdorf also proved that there are no measurable measurements that can be defined on all subsets), and that the structure of the group formed by the rotation of the ball plays a key role in this - and this statement does not hold true on a plane or line segment; in fact, Bannach later proved that for all bounded subsets on the Euclidean plane, a definition makes all subsets equal in size of each other Possible (this point holds the same for the length of a real number line); however This is only limited additivity, so it's not a measurement in the full sense of the word, but for the nature of “making all subsets equal to each other have equal measurements,” this measure is equal to Loeberg's measurement, which means that two equi-deconstructible (equi-decomposable) sets on a plane or in real numbers have the same area.
After exploring, New Sam discovered the three interferers and recorded their location coordinates. When he returned to the base, old Sam just discovered the secret room where the replicator was placed. The secret room was located underground next to the sleeping box. Since he only came here when he had to go back, they were never discovered.

Some people may think that “corporal punishment causes children to have more bad behavior” reverses cause and effect; the real causal relationship should be “children's more bad behavior leads to more corporal punishment”; however, research shows that the relationship between corporal punishment and misbehavior is indeed “corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior by children,” not “children's more bad behavior leads to more corporal punishment,” and “corporal punishment causes children to have more bad behavior” is supported by post-analytical support; furthermore, even after controlling various factors that may affect children, such as the social status of parents, “corporal punishment leads to more corporal punishment” The point of “more bad behavior” still holds true, that is, corporal punishment itself does cause more bad behavior in children, and its adverse effects cannot be explained by any other possible reason. There are also studies that suggest that education strategies that place equal emphasis on care and supervision can effectively reduce the incidence of bullying incidents, while exclusion, laissez-faire, and corporal punishment are positively correlated with the incidence of bullying.

In 1818, Sir Raffles was appointed as the lieutenant governor of the British colony Bencoolen (Bencoolen). He was convinced that Britain must find a strategic location that could surpass the hegemon of the Netherlands at the time. At the time, trade lines linked China, Britain, and India, especially trade with China, required a base. Furthermore, the Netherlands stifled British trade in the region and prohibited the sale of British goods in Dutch-controlled ports, especially in Dutch Batavia. The challenge Raffles faced at the time was to establish a new port within the power of the Netherlands, but Britain had to establish a new port within the influence of the Netherlands. None of the ports are suitable as trade centers. They are all too far from the Malacca Strait. As long as large ships trade with Indochina and pass through this point, they must enter from the neighboring Indian Ocean; otherwise, they will have to enter from the farther Sunda Strait, but they are too far from major trade hubs, and other locations have to return to their original problem - too close to the Netherlands, or other problems.

According to the current official timeline, the earliest work in history is “Sword of the Heavenly Sword,” and the most recent one is “Kingdom Tears” (although Nintendo has yet to combine this work with “Breath of the Wilderness” into the three timelines mentioned above), but in order to meet the needs of the deep expansion of the worldview and timeline in game production, most of the plot settings in this series will be completed or revised in different works by retroactively revising them; take the 1998 “The Flute of Time” work as an example. The Spacetime Gate, until the release of “Imperial Sword” in 2011 The story only explains the origin of the Temple and the Spacetime Gate, and the time interval between the two films has been released for 13 years; this method of reversing the plot timeline effectively analyzes, expands and reinforces Zarda's worldview over and over again, and gradually unravels the plot mysteries of previous works.

Since then, the civilization and technology on Earth have gradually lost their connection with the Elf Realm that was built into the Moon.

Most digital libraries will provide a window that allows resources to be searched. These materials are typical resources hidden deep on the Internet (or few or few on the Internet). These materials hidden in the Internet are often not found by people using search engines, so in some digital libraries they create special pages or sites that allow most search engines to find all of their data. Many digital libraries will often use the information in other digital libraries to display their later data in other digital libraries There are many search engines in China, such as Google Scholar, Google, and Yahoo! Scirus can also use OAI-PMH to find this information hidden in the Internet, so through this agreement, whether it's a search engine or a digital library, they can benefit, make them more closely related to each other, and achieve the goal of strengthening the characteristics of their own website itself.

In the end, TNT only ordered more than 100 units of TNT, the scarce production made the factory refuse to start construction, and these subscribers couldn't get the goods. Some media people commented that this was also a fundamental problem with hammers: Lo Wing-ho was extremely proud and had big dreams but didn't seem to have the same huge capital pool and technological innovation power. At first, it relied on a “Chinese artisan craftsmanship dream” ideology and words to cater to the rebellion of young people on the Internet. These iron powders are somewhat capable of being employees, but other consumer ideologies have become customers. There's always a day to burn out the final market that will test your technical hard power. Currently, the hammer is the only one at best The ability to create or rewrite an app is still a brand factory that assembles stock from an upstream supplier. The craftsmanship is reflected in the construction of the case. However, there are actually very few changes that can be made to the phone case. Now automated processing technology also allows each manufacturer to actually not have much difference in case process, so there is no guarantee that “unscrupulous workers” will go anywhere.
Before 2021, China's application launch ads had problems such as invisibility of pop-up information, extremely small closing buttons, disguising pages, and inducing clicks.

Ads evade rectification by treating users as “shaking” to agree to view ads; during the “Double Eleven” and “Double Twelve” periods at the end of the year, some apps launched shake and shake ads. Although their push was random, not everyone or every time they opened the software, it once caused many complaints because the trigger was too sensitive.

Kodiff now knows that the German army is breaking through, so he is infuriated and determined not to let any “Hitler elements” or “fascists” escape from the encirclement circle against Stalin, but Soviet intelligence agencies overestimated the armor strength of the German 3rd Armored Army at this point, so Kochev made every effort. At this point, the tank brigade under the Soviet 20th Tank Army brought a new type of Joseph Stalin heavy tank to the Colson battlefield. Kodiv ordered all armored vehicles and vehicles that could be used Artillery fired on the breakout forces, cutting off and dispersing the arched enemy.

The design work on the Kirov class cruiser officially began in 1968, codenamed the 1144.1 project. The initial plan was 8,000 tons, but Brezhnev and the other Soviet leaders at the time seemed to prefer everyone. Since the general environment was conducive to vigorous development of the navy, Gorshkov, the founder of the Soviet Navy, was determined, and senior Navy officials were also able to move effectively at the Council of Ministers, as evidenced by the ambition of Peter the Great, the Russian emperor back then. Therefore, the tonnage for this class ship was 8,000 tons, with a range of 6-8 A kilometer missile, but this is the same gram as what was being built at the time The difference between the Lesta II class cruiser is inorganic, and there is also a larger tonnage under development, using the Kara class of gas turbines. Such specifications make it impossible to load a nuclear reactor according to established plans, nor can it pass a high-level review that has a special penchant for everyone. Therefore, after several revisions, the full load displacement was finally raised to 15,000 tons to 20,000 tons, and finally fixed at 24,300 tons.

The front and weapon compartment are also made of steel bars and are covered with aluminum alloy. Inside are two 23 mm caliber Madson guns, plus two 7.92 mm caliber Madson machine guns. These two machine guns can swing left and right, but they were changed to a fixed 8-support 7.92 mm Bailangning M36 machine gun. The cockpit is a bomb bay that can carry 400 kg bombs. It usually carries a 400kg bomb or 2 200kg bombs or 10 26kg small bombs. The bombs are dropped by observers Responsibly, when he drops a bomb, he targets everything. In addition, he also has to operate a radio station and an air camera. In addition, if necessary, he also operates a defense machine gun, so there is a suggestion to change it to a three-seat seat, that is, place another seat between the pilot and the observer to share the work of the observers.

When additional energy is injected into an energy level system in the form of electric fields, photons, chemistry, etc. and absorbed into it, it can cause electrons to transition from a lower energy level to a higher energy level. When photons generated by spontaneous radiation hit these electrons that jump to a higher energy level due to additional energy, these high-energy electrons will move to a lower energy level due to induction and release photons (so-called stimulated radiation). All optical characteristics of the stimulated radiation include: frequency, phase, advance, etc. Yes, when these stimulated photons hit other electrons that leap to a higher energy level due to additional energy, they will produce more For the same photons, the intensity of the light is increasing at the end (that is, the light energy is amplified), but unlike ordinary light, all photons have the same frequency, phase (homotonicity), and direction of travel.
After the two arrive at the warehouse auction hall, they often encounter opponents who are also warehouse bidders at the entrance. They will try to say hello to each other as a simple social hug, and ask the other party if there are any local bidders they should pay attention to. Some venues often have bidders who are willing to spend a lot of money to grab everything under the bid regardless of cost. This type of bidder is usually divided into two types. One is that the large bidder has a deep pocket amount of money. This kind of large warehouse often has a monopoly on the warehouse at this venue. For a long time, they didn't want outsiders to enter the auction to bid, so they specifically raised the settlement amount regardless of cost and tried to drive them away Another type of bidder from abroad is a new bidder. They don't know how to set bid limits. Their random bid shouts have caused some warehouses that originally cost very low to be shouted out. Other bidders often give up bidding because the bid prices are too high, and the newbies themselves lose money as a result of not being able to make ends meet.
On November 6, 1983, an ND2 internal combustion locomotive in the Nanjing locomotive section of the Shanghai Railway Administration led 155 passenger trains from Sankeshu Station to Shanghai Railway Station, which was in charge of the Harbin Railway Administration, traveled east of Nanjing Railway Station to the main departure signal station. Due to poor visibility on foggy days, the driver stopped the identification signal. At this time, 773 freight trains ran to the 5th entry-way traffic light. When the driver saw that it continued to run until the 6th entry-way traffic signal, the driver saw that it continued to run until the 6th entry-way traffic signal terminal, saw the No. 6 entry-way traffic signal station. The signal showed a red light, but the crew mistook it for the locomotive after pressing on the track circuit The changed red light passed through the red light and continued operation. There was a rear-end collision with the 155 passenger trains that had just started. As a result, 1 cargo operator on the 773 freight train died, 1 passenger on the 155 passenger train was seriously injured, and 30 people were slightly injured. The operation was interrupted for 5 hours 57 minutes, and the outbound front line was interrupted at 84:19.

After the leaves of olive trees wither, after collecting them and cooking and soaking, they can be used as so-called black water in aquariums to enhance the estrus of Thai betta fish and improve fertility. In particular, it can be verified that in Thai betta breeding, because olive leaves release pigments; tannic acid makes the water color darker, increases the color of the water, simulates the environmental conditions of black water, stabilizes the fish's mood, relieves urgency as soon as possible, adapts to poor adaptation, enhances body improvement; the color of the tail and back reduces PH value (increase the PH value); Folic acid, etc., can adjust the pH value of water. The effect of softening water can make the water slightly soft, but you also have to see The softness and hardness of raw water, if hard, requires soaking more leaves to achieve the same effect. There are fish tanks soaked in large-leaved olive leaves, and there are organisms that mold relatively late after death, so it is inferred that large-leaf olive leaves should have more or less antiseptic properties that inhibit mold growth.
On the eve of World War II, German gun engineers conducted research on assault rifles and concluded that although the current 8 mm Mauser rifle had a range of more than 800 meters, it was difficult to perform a long range in actual combat. Scopes were not popular equipment, and most soldiers did not have the same gun style as snipers, and their high rate of fire could suppress the enemy in close combat, but the existing rifles were too powerful. Although they were too powerful, they also had too much rear seat strength. If they were to be used for fully automatic firing, it would be difficult to hold and use a stable grip for fully automatic shooting Hold, the hit rate during rapid fire is so low that it's not practical, so there is a reduction in the amount of ammunition for existing 8 mm Mauser rifles The idea is that by shortening the length of the ammunition, it is possible not only to reduce rear seat strength, but also to reduce weight, so this shortened version of the 8 mm Mauser rifle was introduced in 1938. The bullet size remained 7.92 mm, and the length was only about half that of the previous Mauser rifle.
Also, there are dances used on special occasions, such as the “victory dance” for celebrating victory in war and praising merit, the “friendship dance” for social activities between neighbors or friends, etc., there are also “ghost dances” that call for the ancestors to fight with the souls of dead warriors after contact with white people and war, the “corn dance” danced during harvest or the “The Booger Dance (The Booger) Dance (The Booger) Dance (The Booger) Dance” to pray for the expulsion of disease or white people. What people think of as the devil, Boog's dance is usually indoors, and some invited people wear it The snake mask symbolizes Boog (the devil's horn was added after coming into contact with white people), and the pseudonym indicates that they (Boog) were not to harm humans but to dance, and after dancing, they peacefully invited Boog away.
Cat litter box toilets were first promoted in the Denver School District of Colorado, where there have been many school shootings. When an emergency situation such as a shooting occurs at the school, the police will ask teachers and students to hide in classrooms until the police have checked the campus and confirmed safety before they come out. Jefferson County Public Schools safety director John McDonald (John McDonald) said the idea was proposed a few years ago. At the time, a school in the area was blocked for several hours after threatening shootings, so much so that students who needed to use the toilet had to use the trash Bag and trash can solution, at Following the shooting threat in April 2019, the school district began equipping classrooms with portable toilets based on cat litter. Diana Wilson (Diana Wilson), a spokeswoman for the district's public schools, said most teachers supported the decision, and that cat litter box toilets had already been added to Denver's teachers' rations list along with items such as pop-up tents and first aid kits.
After the fall of Ballariulu, the location of the tribe became a place where people from the Haocha tribe grew multigrain. Today, you can still see the relevant ruins of the ancient city, but the whereabouts of their survivors are completely unknown. On the other hand, although the Karihi tribe regained their independence and rebuilt their homes, they also perished under a landslide and major flood caused by heavy rain, only in the current Wutai Tribe (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township) claim to be descendants of the Khalehi; in addition, they lead the tribe After the war, the Dalapathan family (Dalapathan, a descendant of Berlem, is also known as (Druluane and the transliteration “Lu Luan”) is also known as the “military leader”. It has the highest point of the Omomos of the old tea tribe (meaning “easy to fog up”), which is tied to the original leader family, the Kadrangilan (Kadrangilan) family, and the family of the original leader, the Kadrangilan (Kadrangilan) family, joined the family of the two leaders.
The initial infection group caused by flight attendants at the end of December 2021 was the Omicron variant virus. The genetic ranking of the virus showed that they all appeared earlier as the Omicron variant virus strain BA.1 subtype, while the group of infections caused by quarantine hotels in early January 2022 was the Omicron variant virus strain BA.2 subtype. Although the two belong to the same Omicron mutated virus, there are 10 different mutations in the spike proteins of the two. Preliminary studies in the UK and Denmark have shown that the BA.2 subtype is more contagious than the BA.1 subtype. Asia As a result, people who have already received two and three doses of the vaccine have a higher rate of breakthrough infections, but those who have been vaccinated may reduce the chance of transmission to others, while the first-generation transmission in the quarantine hotel group has already been 12 people, indicating that the Omicron mutated virus strain BA.2 subtype is more contagious than the virus strain previously discovered in Hong Kong, making it more difficult to stop its widespread spread.

In his later years under Anastasius's reign, he realized that he didn't come to Japan much, and that he also had three living relatives, but Anastasius didn't know who was the most suitable heir, so he invited the three relatives to a room with three sofas. There was a letter underneath one of them, so the person who chose the right sofa was eligible to be the heir. However, two of the relatives sat on the same sofa, and the other one sat on the other sofa, but no one chose the sofa with the envelope. At this point, Anastasius thought of another idea. Whoever is the next person to walk in is The heir, the person who came in as a result, was Justin, the captain of his guard army. Although Anastasius did not expect Justine to become the heir, he was also very satisfied with this result, and Justin became emperor as a result.
The Japanese Navy had already been ordered to block Hong Kong waters at the time. When the British torpedo boats sailed to the waters east of the Lam Tong Strait, they were discovered by the Japanese fir-class destroyer and the giant torpedo boat Magpie. Since there was a huge firepower gap between the two sides, Chen Tse then instructed the torpedo boats to line up and welcome the Japanese ships at high speed, pretending they were about to launch a torpedo attack on the Japanese ship. In fact, the torpedo boats at the time were to reduce their weight and carry as many people as possible, and to prevent them from being hit by torpedo boats There was a risk of an explosion, so they didn't carry torpedoes, but when the Japanese ships saw a menacing torpedo boat team, they were fooled and took evasive actions. As a result, the torpedo boats Escaping interception by Japanese ships, the fleet passed through the Guozhou Islands and then turned to Dapeng Bay. Finally, Chen Tse and over 70 others landed ashore in South Australia on the Dapeng Peninsula. Afterwards, Chinese and British personnel quickly sank all torpedo boats to prevent the landing site from being discovered and tracked by the Japanese army, then fled to Huizhou, Guangdong by land.
Buddhism opposes some views of Brahmanism. For example, in the “Honshen Sutra,” the Bodhisattva questioned why Brahma allowed pain and sin to run rampant. Similar to the problem of evil, some Buddhists also denied the existence of the god Boraga on a rational level, so Buddhism did not believe that the meaning of life came from King Brahma, a celestial person still trapped in reincarnation. Furthermore, Buddhism also denied that the Great Brahma was the origin of everything in India, so the Ministry of Buddhism later denied that the Great Brahma was the origin of everything in India. Some theologians accuse Buddhism of promoting nihilism, but Buddhism refutes this statement, believing that the root of everything is “empty.” It is emptiness that allows everything to appear and change, and meaning continues to arise and die out with its origin, so not everything in the world is meaningless, but because of impermanence, meaning cannot last forever in the world.
In addition to inheriting Dai Jin's style of painting, he was also taught by Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, focusing on freehand drawing figures such as Li Gonglin and Gu Kaizhi, while also studying paintings by Leung Kai, Wu Daozi, Liu Songnian, etc. The images were more relaxed, simple, grand, and energetic. At this time, Wu Wei was famous in Beijing, and was later called into the palace. However, due to his unruly nature and unaccustomed to life in the palace, he was even less accustomed to feisty and imitation in the palace. The upper echelons of society then resigned from the Academy of Fine Arts, causing a huge change in their mentality. Contrary to the idea of pursuing fame and fortune and standing out from the crowd as a teenager, they had a more liberal personality Relaxation and indulgence were also related to drunkenness at the time. At this time, there were few paintings. “Real Portraits of Beihai,” “Snow River Fishing Map,” and “Song and Dance Map,” reflected the artist's true feelings of spiritual portrayals and observations of life.
Camel fighter jets were developed from the same company's puppy fighter. The name of this aircraft was originally “big dog” because of the larger, heavier, and more horsepower air-cooled radial engines that raised camel-like power from 80 to 130 horsepower. Of course, it also used with a shooting synchronization system modeled after the German fire synchronization system. In order to prevent the machine gun from being stuck due to the cold at high altitude, it was originally called “big dog,” but the name of this aircraft was “big dog” due to the convex outer shape of the mask It was renamed a “camel,” which made the head of the aircraft heavier but the horizontal rear wing did not increase the area. This made it camel-like The aircraft has a slight tendency to be aggressive during flight and becomes unstable. This makes it difficult for new camel-like pilots to drive, but veteran pilots can make good use of this instability to increase camel-like flexibility in air combat.
After more than 20 years of brilliant results, the rapid decline in the national team's subsequent results made many fans unable to accept it, partly because the fans couldn't accept the country's sudden decline. The Greek national basketball team lost fiercely in the 1999 and 2001 European Championships, and also lost their qualifications to advance to the Sydney Olympics and 2002 World Championships. The poor record also caused problems in the relationship between the team and the Greek Basketball Association. In the end, the Greek national basketball team made adjustments within the team before the 2003 European Championship and hired a new coach. LONITIS ( Ioannidis) and the addition of a new group of young players. This adjustment attempt was partially successful. At the 2003 European Championships, the Greek team finally achieved 5th place, but the public is still not very satisfied, because 5th place is still quite a long way from success.

Japan surrendered unconditionally in August 1945. He went back to his hometown to run a watch shop and study photography techniques on his own. Later, he often went to Hiroshima to photograph surviving “atomic bombing victims” (atomic bombing victims), filmed 43-year-old fisherman Sugimatsu Nakamura (Sugimatsu Nakamura, 1909-1967) for over 10 years from 1952, and published the photo book “The Record of an Atomic Bomb Victim”, which received a special award from the Japan Photographic Critics Association; after that, he continued to shoot various anti-security protests at the time (anti-security campaigns) Narita Incidents such as the “Sanrizuka Struggle” in the construction of an airport, Minamata disease, the Women's Liberation Movement, etc.) infiltrated the Self-Defense Forces to uncover the truth about the development of a new type of arms.

The eastern part is an undulating loess plateau, 1,500-2000 meters above sea level, the Yellow River and its tributaries, the Weihe River, Taohe River, etc., rich in hydraulic resources. The climate is warm and humid, with dense vegetation, and annual rainfall of about 500 mm; west of Wushaoling in the west, it is the Hexi Corridor formed by the confrontation between the mountains of the south and north. The mountains are mostly high, mostly over 3,000 to 4,000 meters, with lower mountains in the north, mostly lower mountains. The northern mountains are mostly low, with the lower mountains in the north being Mount Longshou., Mount Heli, etc. The rivers in the region are inland systems. Most of them flow from south to north, including the Shule River and weak water, among which are weak water basins It has the largest area, an arid climate, with an annual rainfall of about 150 mm, mainly semi-desert and desert. Due to melting snow and irrigation in the Qilian Mountains, alluvial fans form at the foot of the mountains, and places with rivers in the corridors form connected oases. It is a granary of Gansu, and the outside is mountainous and desert.
However, after the observatory changed the No. 1 signal, Liufu Mountain and Tsing Yi measured an average wind speed of 43 kilometers per hour from 2:20 a.m. to 2:50 a.m. and 3:40 a.m. to 3:46 a.m. on August 15, respectively. This was the first time that strong winds were measured during these two storm stations, and also the highest wind speed during these two storm stations; at the same time, the southwest of Hong Kong (Lantau Island and nearby areas, such as Cheung Chau, Airport, etc.) remained high and continued to be affected by strong winds for almost the whole day until 2:45 a.m. on August 3. During the 45 minute period, 8 designated automatic weather stations reappeared, and 4 of them were recorded The strong wind situation met the requirements of the No. 3 signal, causing some members of the public to think that the time for the observatory to switch to signal No. 1 was also too early, even more than 18 hours before the Macao Meteorological Service removed wind balloon No. 3.
The meteorological agencies in Hong Kong and Macau have different opinions about the time and location of Tien Ge's closest to Macau — the Macau Meteorological Service said that Tien Ge was closest to Macau at 1 p.m., passing about 40 km southwest of the Meteorological Service headquarters. However, the Hong Kong Observatory's post-incident report and the Macau Meteorology and Astronomy location showed that at 12:00 noon, Tien Ge passed only 20 km southwest of the headquarters of the Macau Meteorological Service. Some members of the public questioned whether there was a mistake in the Meteorological Service's positioning. At the time, the Tien Ge structure was complete and tight, and there was no reorganization of the circulation center. There should be less chance of a positioning error; comparison can be made from radar maps In 2012, Typhoon Vicente hit Macau. The Bureau of Meteorology's position was also 40 kilometers, and typhoon Vicente and Tien Ge's eye were also 50 kilometers in diameter, but the center of Tiange is clearly closer to Macau than Vicente, and the actual distance of Tien Ge is probably only 20 kilometers.
In 2009, in line with the cityscape and environment improvement action plan of Luohu District of Shenzhen, Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Co., Ltd. invested more than 17 million yuan to carry out comprehensive environmental remediation along the Shenzhen section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Line and the remediation of the Shenzhen Railway Station and the surrounding environment.

The mechanical mule weighs less than 567 kg, but it can carry 181 kg objects and walk more than 32 kilometers at a speed of 16 km/h, and can work continuously for more than 24 hours. Currently, the mechanical mule is still in the testing stage. Its speed has reached 11 km/h, which is double the average walking speed of 5 km/h for humans. Its power is a 15 horsepower water-cooled engine. The body has a built-in global positioning system. All four mechanical feet have springs to absorb impact force when landing on the ground, which is equivalent to a foot sensor. Coupled with the gyroscope, it can be controlled by a computer Due to its balance, the actuator on the foot (equivalent to a leg muscle) can turn the power generated by the engine into mechanical action to move it forward.
After the Edo period, most of the region became territory with the Fukui Domain, and there are also a small number of regions belonging to the Obama Domain, Hatamoto, and Shogunate directly under the Shogunate. After the Meiji Restoration at the end of the 19th century, the territories that originally belonged to the shogunate and hatamoto were classified into the newly established Honpo Prefecture in 1871. After the abolition of feudal feudal domain in 1871, the rest of the territories that originally belonged to each domain were transferred to Sabae Prefecture, Fukui Prefecture, and Kobama Prefecture. However, in the first prefectural consolidation carried out by Dunton at the end of the same year, all regions were integrated into Tsuruga Prefecture. Ka Prefecture was abolished in 1876, and Imadate County, located north of it, was incorporated into Ishikawa Prefecture until 1881. Originally, the jurisdiction of Tsuruga Prefecture has been restored to the establishment of prefectures, but the reestablished prefecture is named Fukui Prefecture because the prefectural office is located in Fukui.

The other is Dwayne Wade, the greatest star in the history of the Miami Heat.
However, some people think this is a controversial period of history. Nobutakatsu is named “Dansho Tadashi,” a name that can only be received by the head of the Imagawa family, while Nobunaga was named Sosuke, the head of the Imagawa family. It can be seen that Nobunaga's strange behavior before the military uniform did not receive the trust of the show and his vassals. The Oda family's main castle was Kudu Castle. In order to prevent the Mikawa offensive, they built a new city in Suemori and moved the main city to Suemori instead of retreating in Suemori. Instead, the chief is the owner of the branch city. As for Nobunaga's victory related to Masahide Hirate and Mino's Olympic aid, it is difficult to give an answer on who actually betrayed whose history. Furthermore, the Mino side should have support forces. Under the historical view of the Three Heroes of the Warring States as the main axis, they will definitely be hidden.

The triggering leukemia system is a complex incidental mechanism. It is a multi-stage evolutionary process. This is also the key to its cancer incidence rate of only 5%. In this process, the virus first binds to CD4+ cells and activates infected cells. The cell membrane expresses the IL-2 receptor, which then forms viral DNA through the reverse transcriptase of the virus and integrates into the host cell's chromosome formation precursor virus; under the influence of the virus tax gene, genes of the CD4+ cell IL-2 and its receptor begin to be expressed abnormally, causing infected cells to proliferate massively. Diverse Sex is converted into different cell replications, and as cells continue to proliferate, the DNA of a certain replicated cell mutates and evolves into a leukemia cell, which in turn forms leukemia cell replication.
The Zhendan University campus is currently the Luwan Campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Huangpu District, Shanghai. It is divided into two parts by a north-south viaduct.

Up to now, more than 1,400 films have used the SDDS sound effects format. Only about 97 films are actually recorded with a complete eight channel mix (mix, including dubbing, soundtrack, and other sound effects production and editing, etc.). The vast majority of sound effects studios still use six (5.1) channel system equipment instead of eight (7.1) channels for editing and production. Furthermore, SDDS's eight-channel recording equipment is quite expensive. This also makes it impossible for many studios to buy or add new equipment. This also makes future developments more anticipated. The calculation and production space is large An eight-channel recording system can only be used in studios that allow more production and broadcasting equipment.
The first thing in the history of value engineering development was the asbestos incident at the US General Electric (GE) company. During World War II, the supply of raw materials in the US market was very tight, and GE urgently needed asbestos board, but the supply of this product was unstable and expensive. At the time, GE engineers began to study the material substitution problem. Through analyzing the function of the company's use of asbestos board, they discovered that its use was placed on workshop floors where paint can be painted to avoid fires. Later, Miles also found a type of fireproof paper on the market. It has the above effect Also, the cost is low, easy to buy, and has excellent economic benefits. This is the earliest application case of value engineering.
The technique of lithograph printing was first invented by Czech-German Alois Senefelder (Alois Senefelder) in 1798. At that time, limestone produced in Bavaria was used as the material for engraving prints because copperplate printing was too expensive, and the stone version was the tool he transferred to ink. By chance, his mother asked him to write down a laundry list, but the paper and ink around him ran out, so he had to write it down with the correction liquid he prepared (composed of yellow wax, soap, black paint, and water) On the lithograph, some nitric acid was later poured onto it out of curiosity; due to correction fluid With anti-corrosion ingredients, the handwriting becomes raised, which is the beginning of printing on slate.
This is usually because some village councils in inland provinces are still dominated by older people with older ideas, and they think that matters relating to family property should be mainly inherited from the paternal lineage, and that if there is something under a woman's name, it will also be a strange idea such as “someone else's,” so unmarried women who don't act in accordance with the regulations, and are not easily “guarded” by the village committee, and many rural women also have no legal view and don't know how to complain about their rights and interests. In fact, as stipulated in section 32 of the Women's Rights Protection Law, women Rural land contract management, income distribution of collective economic organizations, land expropriation or expropriation compensation They enjoy equal rights with men in terms of use and use of homesteads, etc., and both men and women are members of rural collective economic organizations.
Spain once again faced their group rival Italy in the finals. The two teams tied in the group stage, but in the final, the Spanish team played the “no front line” as “all team players”, and their attack power increased dramatically. In addition, Italy's backward defense was injured, so much so that Spain repeatedly tore the Italian line of defense. In the end, with the four players David Schwarr, Jodie Abba, Ferrando Torres, and Mada, each scored one goal and defeated Italy 4-0. This score was also the most suspended European National Cup finals in history. Great score, and Spain became the first team to successfully defend the UEFA Cup; in terms of individual awards, Ennista won the tournament The best player award was won by Toris by scoring three goals in less time in the game.
MOMO 3, which has a total length of 10 meters, a diameter of 50 cm, weighs 1 metric ton, and can carry 20 kg, was originally scheduled to launch on April 30 and May 2 and 3, 2019, but due to airframe failure and high altitude wind delays, respectively, it stayed for 4 minutes in a zero-gravity environment at a maximum altitude of 113.4 km after being launched from the Taiki base in Hokkaido at 5:45 a.m. on May 4.

On January 6, 2004, the 12th South Asia Summit held in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, first proposed the concept of a South Asian free trade zone. The concept of a free trade zone includes a total of 1.4 billion people in South Asia, including Bhutan, Nepal, India, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, advocated implementing zero tariffs on all goods in the South Asia Free Trade Zone by 2016. This free trade agreement will be recognized by seven South Asian countries in January 2006. Developing countries in South Asia need this free trade agreement. In 2007, the first step was to reduce tariffs by 20% each year, until reaching zero tariffs in 2012. Undeveloped countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Nepal can delay the reduction to zero tariffs for three years. India and Pakistan have signed but not yet approved this agreement.

Established in 1971, Hong Kong Shue Yan College was later registered as Hong Kong Shue Yan College under the Higher Education Ordinance in 1976. However, since Shue Yan College did not follow the government's three-year university system and continued to maintain a four-year bachelor's degree program, it was unable to receive government funding such as Baptist College and Lingnan College, which were restructured in accordance with government requirements. Since then, the development of the university has been greatly restricted. It can only award honorary diplomas without official degrees until the Hong Kong government supports the development of a four-year private university system after 2000, and plans to implement a three-year undergraduate program. After that, Shue Yan College was approved to establish an accredited bachelor's degree The course then passed the subject scope review. Hong Kong Shue Yan College was approved by the government as Hong Kong Shue Yan University in December 2006, becoming the first private university in Hong Kong. Shue Yan University remained the only private university in Hong Kong until October 2018.

There aren't many myths left about Lulu'an. I only know that according to legend, he may have first come from the Piuma tribe (Piuma, located in present-day Taiwu Township, some say from the East Beninan people) and was one of the four ancestors of the Biyuma tribe (the other three were Ngarhangarhan, Taiung, and Kaitjang, all his older brothers). Later, for unknown reasons, he left the area with his wife Rhugilinganan and headed west to find another place to live, and finally arrived at a place known as ancient times ( The Kurasa/Kurasaru) region founded a tribe and gave birth to four children with his wife there: Alisu (Alisu), Drumetj, Ljemedj, and Dravai.
The Next Generation Patrol Vessel (NGPV), originally proposed by Malaysia in the early 1990s, was approved by Germany (Keda-class frigate, MEKO 100 RMN). The two sides originally agreed that the first 2 ships were shipped to Malaysia's Penang Shipbuilding Industry Company for assembly after completing the segments and modules in Germany. The successor ships were built by Brome Fox with assistance from the Penang Shipbuilding Industries Company. The contract was changed two years later. The first 2 ships were transferred to the Royal Malaysian Navy after construction was completed in Germany. It is estimated to cost RM24.3 billion, 27 ships will be purchased in batches within 20 years, and the construction of the next 21 ships will be cancelled and re-tendered due to continuous progress delays and overspending. The name of the plan was also changed to 2nd Generation Patrol Ship/Littoral Combat Ship (Second Generation Patrol Vessels/Littoral Combat Ship, SGPV/LCS), winning the Mahala Jalilah class derived from the French Wind-Chasing class frigate design.
A year after the resistance successfully escaped from being hunted by the First Army, when Kairo Shinobi, the supreme leader of the First Army, led the army to continue suppressing resistance from other planets, he realized through the Sith pathfinder he found that a huge force of darkness lurked deep in the “unknown region”. He followed the clues and finally found the source of this dark force in a dark and huge building on Exegol (Exegol) deep in the “unknown field”: it was supposed to die for more than 30 years Bai Boting, the emperor of the Galactic Empire. Since then, the emperor of the Galactic Empire has officially announced to the whole galaxy that he is still alive, Kairo Shinobu An agreement was then reached with him until Kairo Shinobi killed the last Jedi, the “Final Army” of the Sith Fleet hidden on the planet, under the First Army, and Kairo Ninja became the emperor of the New Galactic Empire.
The Zeng Wenxi Basin, where Zeng Wen Reservoir is located, has a total length of 138.47 kilometers and a basin area of 1,176 square kilometers. It is the fourth largest river in Taiwan, with an average annual flow of 1.6 billion cubic meters, and the dam site location has an average annual flow of 1,064 billion cubic meters. The early design of the Japanese engineer Hatta Yoichi from Dazhenshi, used the upper reaches of Guantian Creek, a tributary of Zeng Wenxi, to build the Wushantou Reservoir for agricultural irrigation in the Jianan region, but its water supply to agricultural fields in the Jianan region is used. The rate is only 25% of the total flow rate (according to Zeng Wen Reservoir Construction Chronicles, Zeng Wen Reservoir was built (Previously, Wushantou Reservoir originally used 330 million cubic meters of water), so if you build a dam directly at Dapu Creek, the main stream of Zeng Wenxi, and operate in tandem with Wushantou Reservoir, you can increase the amount of irrigation. Therefore, in 1939, Hatta Yui proposed to build a dam on the current dam site, but it failed due to the war.
In 2006, he hit the triple crown with a batting average of 0.336, 26 home runs, and 88 points, making it another player to hit the triple crown after Lee Man-soo of the Samsung Lions in 1984, but lost to Yoo Hyun-jin, who also won the triple crown as pitcher in the MVP of the year.

They won the triple batting crown again that year, making it Korea's professional baseball The first player in history to hit the triple crown twice and won next year's MVP.
“Select Zhe” is Zhang Xinzhe's 20th solo album, launched in April 1998. It is a selection of Zhang Xinzhe's country and English, released by EMI about a year after leaving Science and Technology. The songs he chose were also the highlights of his time in EMI less than 3 years. Although he didn't stay in Baidai for a long time, this period was the peak of his singing career. In particular, he won the Golden Melody Award for Best Mandarin Male Singer in 1996. These three years were also the three years in which Zhang Xinzhe sang the most talented singer in Cantonese, not Mandarin or Cantonese. It's still the right merit of being able to pick up English songs, but “Don't talk to him ”, “Over Fire,” “I Want to Love You Too Much,” “I'm Real,” “Feeling,” and “Guilty,” etc. have all become classics that have been widely sung.
From 1948 to 1952, Dalian University brought in nearly 100 scholars from home and abroad, including Wang Ganchang (famous nuclear physicist, father of China's atomic bomb), Wang Daheng (famous optician, founder of Chinese optics), Zhang Dayu (famous physical chemist, one of the founders of Chinese catalytic science), Qian Lingxi (educator, founder of computational mechanics in China), Wu Shishu (theoretical physicist), Bi Dexian (electronic scientist, founder of Chinese radar technology), Yang Shaoyuan (ship engineering expert) Yi (petrochemist, catalytic scientist), Hou Yufen (dye chemist) Famous scholars such as (home), Wang Xiji (physicist), and Lin Jifang (chemical expert) have established eight departments, including the Department of Mathematics, the Department of Physics, the Department of Telecommunications, the Department of Electrical Engineering, the Department of Water Resources, the Department of Chemistry, the Department of Shipbuilding, the Department of Mechanics, the Department of Metallurgy, etc., as well as institutions such as scientific research institutes.
The space monster that fought Topless until now was originally evolved from an automatic defense system left over from their predecessor, but the alien Buster crew is the real space monster. Topless is only a type of human mutation. “La Luque” became self-deprecating after learning the truth and clashed with Nono. Afterwards, under Nono's leadership, the Space Force went to explore a giant, real cosmic monster sealed in a black hole, but at this point the real cosmic monster broke out of the black hole. Before a real cosmic monster the size of a planet, Nono and “La Luque” None of the attacks were half damaging. Just as “La Luque” was preparing to create another black hole with Nono to carry out a suicide attack on a real cosmic monster, Nono suddenly left behind a stunned “La Luque.”
Unlike the State Duma, it is a department under the administration of a political party. The committee clearly shows that no political party exists in the upper house. In 2001, about 100 members of the upper house formed a relatively loose party group, which supported almost all of the policies of then-President Putin. However, what is even more disheartening in 2002 is that Mironov disbanded all party groups after winning the election as chairman. Although the most important thing in a democratic country is not consensus, it is difficult for the Federal Committee, which acts as the upper house of the National Assembly, to forge a considerable consensus, making it difficult to pass any resolution. The bill is instead debated by the chairman or various committees Easy to pass However, lawmakers themselves were asked not to reflect the party's original ideology and force it into deliberations. After the 2000 reform, the committee clearly had to move closer to the Kremlin authorities, making it easy to pass important laws to meet the requirements of the Kremlin.
In 985 AD, an Arab geographer wrote records relating to inns and hotels for travelers to rest in the Palestinian region of Greater Syria at the time. Makedis mentioned in the literature: “The taxes levied in Syria are not heavy, but the taxes levied at caravan post stations are an exception. Travellers inside post stations will be subject to extremely high taxes...” The taxes mentioned here refer to tariffs imposed by local government officials on imported goods and goods. Normally, traveling livestock merchants will be responsible for carrying the goods they carry with them. Stay at the post station or take a break, and Every gate in the post station would be guarded to ensure that merchants entering and leaving would fully pay taxes on the goods they carried. The imposition of tariffs on goods was one of the main sources of revenue for the Fatimid dynasty at the time.

Traditional digital modulation and division of labor use frequency division of labor to transmit different information through different bands. OFDM divides an entire band into several sub-carriers (sub-carriers), and allows each subcarrier to be orthogonal to each other, so that they do not overlap with each other on the spectrum and can reduce interference. The operation method is to place the signal on the transmission side in the frequency domain (frequency domain), convert it to a time domain (time domain) through inverse Fourier transform (IDFT), and by adding a cyclic prefix (cyclic prefix) prefix) is then transmitted out, while the receiver removes the loop prefix from the signal and then transfers the time domain signal back to the frequency domain through Fourier Transform (DFT) to solve the original transmission signal.

This company has created value in Japan for this period.
Since the roads connecting the areas on both sides of the Coastal Mountains are Guangfeng Highway (Taiwan 11A), Ruigang Highway (Hua64), and Dongfu Highway (Taiwan 23), and Taiwan 11.

The early description of cryptomycetes was that organisms parasitized on the surface of host cells, lacked cell walls, and had a morphology similar to those of pochomycetes. However, this taxonomy has many shortcomings. The word “hidden” means that such organisms have been ignored by researchers for a long time, and the mystery was not unraveled until the rise of molecular sequence analysis. However, this characteristic applies to many other eukaryotes. It is not a patent for cryptomycetes. There is still little room for discussion about whether the genus Rhodes is representative, because there is still little room for discussion about the life history of hidden fungi It is unclear whether most species can have cell surfaces at the same time There are two lifestyles, parasitism and intracellular parasitism, so the morphology and life history of Rhizococcus bacteria are not necessarily atypical.

A lawyer may defend anyone, even if the person being defended is extremely heinous and the criminal evidence is accurate. All persons charged with a criminal offense have the right to request the assistance of a lawyer, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or whether the evidence of the crime is clear; however, it cannot be determined on this basis that lawyers are inherently evil and lack moral conscience because this is part of the lawyers' duties; however, due to the image of some of the people defended by the lawyer, the arguments used in the defense process, and the many acts of some lawyers that are oblivious to reason, have no principles and high fees, make society target lawyers A culture of jokes and sarcasm; and some lawyers use it in defense The argument is more likely to involve the issue of accusing victims. In Japan, there have even been people who have initiated a petition to punish defense team lawyers because of the content of the defense used by the defendant lawyers in the murder case.

Mo Chun-yin looked and discovered that Chan Man-yee had met another man (probably Hu Huaqiang) and was in a relationship, so he questioned why Chan Man-yee had deceived him.

Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the deletion of 25-28 genes in the long arm of the 7th pair of chromosomes. This condition is usually an incidental event that occurs during egg or sperm formation; in a few cases, Williams syndrome is a genetic self-dominant parent (dominant genetic disorder); the patient's special facial features (wide mouth, nose, medium length, narrow, small chin, bubble eyes, ears, neck, slanted shoulders, etc.) are often thought to be based on a lack of specific genes.

Also, using plant-based materials, the biggest difference between the ancient Egyptian shrew straw paper and Chinese paper is that safflower paper is made of sea-straw flakes bonded together, and the fiber arrangement still retains its natural order. The uniformity and weight of the fiber arrangement is not conducive to writing, folding, and drying. Furthermore, the raw material salsa is only found in the Nile River Basin; the fibers in Chinese paper are not only different from the ordered arrangement of fibers in the plant world, but also different from the geometric arrangement of textiles. Instead, they are simply arranged in an unregulated manner. Appropriate bonding and bonding form a material that is both light and thin, strong and absorbent, so it can be used to store data for a long time. The raw materials are also very diverse. Plants from all environments can be used, and eventually spread all over the world.
Since most fantasy novels come from online writers and are published on the Internet at the same time they are written, and they often change their style during the serialization process to suit the audience (more like viewers rather than readers because they have the possibility of immediate comments), these changes may make the content of the novel often have contradictions before and after, but as long as the plot arrangement is exquisite and reasonable, there is no need to deliberately differentiate the categories of the work, and the chapter subject weight can also be used as a distinction, if the fictional world is covered in the scope of each chapter and only a few other non-traditional plots are added, Classified as a fantasy novel; if the chapters revolve around martial arts or sci-fi Magic, on the other hand, is used only as an embellishment, and is more commonly regarded as a fantasy novel.

Whenever there is a large-scale disaster (such as an epidemic), rolled toilet paper is extremely easy to be sold out. Some analysts believe that since Western countries or regions that promote Western civilization will consume quite a bit of toilet paper; since the future development of the disaster is uncertain (including the government's response to the disaster, the spread of rumors, etc.), it may lead to long-term isolation, causing people to increase the amount of paper stocked up on various materials; Rolled hygiene is an item that takes up a lot of space and is conspicuous in stores, and excessive rush to clean empty shelves can easily lead to empty shelves It will further intensify people's fear of material shortages And the mentality of fear of missing out ultimately makes it difficult for stores to keep up with the speed at which people rush to buy.
This is unreasonable, because a good pen tip is often a high-grade pen and has a certain weight. Second, when writing, you need to press the tip of the pen hard to create a thick effect, but ballpoint pens can also write on soft materials. Ballpoint pens often work better on hard pen calligraphy and have more space to play, but they need to have a certain level of understanding of different text writing techniques, which requires more observation from the writer. Pen calligraphy requires speed, because ink tip writing requires speed when writing with an ink tip It's been too long. This alone is far less lightweight than a ballpoint pen. The only advantage of a pen The ink color is brighter than a ballpoint pen.
U-type submarines driven by diesel engines do not have high surface speed and can only catch up with some slow merchant ships, while the maximum speed underwater is less than 10 knots, generally about 4 knots (except for the XXI type, because it is equipped with a 600-ton high-energy battery pack and streamlined hull design, it can continue to fight at an unprecedented high speed of 17 knots underwater for an hour). In contrast, the destroyer has a maximum speed of 30 knots. The speed is generally still 10-15 knots, and the U-type submarine faces the enemy underwater Destroyer deep-water bombs are difficult to evade; lack of mobility is a fatal drawback of U-type submarines.
Taoism is the native religion of China. Its ideas first originated from the Huangdi (the Huangdi school), and the earliest forms of the Taoist Order were Taoist Taoist Buddhism (Tianshi Dao) founded by Ji and the Wudoumi religion (Tianshi Dao) founded by Zhang Daoling, worshiping Taoist Laozi as Taoist ancestors. The earliest dates can be traced back to the feudal festivals, ancestral sacrifices, and witchcraft worship activities of the Chinese people during the Spring and Autumn Warring States period. Thoughts such as “yin and yang” merged to form the Huangdi School, formed Huanglaodao in the middle to late Han Dynasty, through religious reforms during the Northern and Southern Dynasties, and the Yuan and Ming dynasties The sectarian integration of the period gradually evolved into the current Taoism.

CHAPTER I
Hao Ren, as his name suggests, is a nice person.
His family lives in a small town in the north that is unknown. If Beijing plans to build a 20th ring and 30th ring, it can barely be considered the foot of the heavens. If the cards of good people all over the world are calculated on his head, he is reluctantly famous all over the world. No one knows him when walking along the road. After 20 years or so, the goal of life is to be a good person. Other than that, this is him.
Although the weather in the north is a bit cooler, walking on the road in the face of the sun makes people feel very irritable during the day, so you can see all kinds of cars rushing around in the busy city center, but you can't see how many pedestrians are walking outside. The tall young man wearing white T-shirts, gray pants, and an average looking tall young man is just one of these few pedestrians.
Hao Ren feels that the students of this age are becoming less and less dedicated. When he first worked outside to send leaflets, he never could tell at a glance that it was his bachelorette grandparents putting this kind of thing in their hands, but no matter what, this kind of hard folding fan is quite appropriate.
“The last two, if they don't work, forget it.” Hao Ren stuttered at the last two job advertisements in his hand. Fortunately, they were both next to each other. He was able to quickly complete today's “tasks,” and one of them was right in front of him. It's an advertising agency that definitely doesn't have much power from the outside, but the sign on their doorstep is loud: Galaxy Media Pan-Cultural Development and Promotion Company. When I hear this name, it's a product that must be lost within half a year. Hao Ren came up with this name at the time. The main purpose was not to apply; he just wanted to see companies that can think up amazing names What a strange person.
He walked hundreds of meters with great interest to get around the barrier on the road, then ran to the front of this advertising agency with a particularly strong name of X in the face of the big sun, and was surprised to discover - the company had gone out of business, the sign at the entrance was still hanging, but the glass door had a notice about closing the door. The date was two days ago, and the recruitment notice in his hand was four days ago... This is really a rapidly changing world. Two days before the company went out of business this year, they had to overwhelm two new employees. Are you surprised?
Hao Ren looked down at the advertising agency's recruitment notice and threw it into the trash bin on the side of the road. Hao Ren looked down at the last one and rubbed it into the same place two seconds later. By the way, he reflected on whether he was blind when he screened this item two days ago — the bus company recruits an office clerk, requiring people aged 25 to 40, who can work hard, and understand computers, is preferred.
He came to the city center with this thing with great interest, just to see how bright the glass doors of an advertising agency that had been busy recruiting workers for two days before it went out of business were simply full of support.
Hao Ren, male gender, likes women, 25 years old, has no ** hobbies. The advantage is that he is not picky eaters. Currently single, he doesn't have many family or friends. He lives alone in an old house left by his parents in the old town of Seongnam. Like most young men, his life goal is to earn over 10,000 a month at age 25 and marry a beautiful daughter-in-law. If possible, it's best to have a car. There's no way for parents to be filial, so at least he has to live well enough to not be considered a family member. Now he has completed one-third of this series of life goals: It's been 25 this year.
This is a really sad story.
He came to the city today to find a job, but he personally doesn't have any urgent needs in terms of living: as mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lives in an old house left by his parents and should be grateful for the family businesses left behind by the older generation. At least the house is quite big — it's a two-story old house, which has been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
Over the years, Hao Ren has relied on renting a house outside to make ends meet, but only because the place he lives is so remote that he is even so remote that he probably has to plan for several decades to wait for the old house to be demolished.
To be fair, with this kind of stable income, Hao Ren doesn't need to go out and find a job, but he is a bit pretentious when he has been idle for too long. He always feels that he should work a little harder to carve out a path in life, plus the more important reason — his old house is actually too biased, to the point where they quickly left human civilization. Since the last migrant worker couple moved out of their rental house, no one had come to rent a house for less than half a year. Looking at Ren's empty two-story “apartment” for several months on end, Hao's heart I realized one thing: unless the municipal plan is skewed towards him, you have to think If I stay alive, I'm afraid the only thing I can do is go out and find a job.
After studying the three-day city plan at home, Hao Ren thought it was really unlikely that the area around his home would become a commercial center overnight. Considering that he couldn't waste himself as an old man, he finally decided to find a job first, and at least make ends meet.
How can I say that back then, I was also a good, hardworking man who worked to earn tuition fees; Lang Lang Kun Kun was still able to starve himself to death?
However, fate doesn't depend on people's will; his first day of running blind outside is basically... all that's left is running blind.
There was no use thinking about it so much. Hao Ren stretched out and decided to rest under a tree-shaded bench in a small roadside park, waited the hottest hour at noon before going to a small hotel to fill up his stomach, and then went home by car.
Even though the economy is developing quite fast, it is still able to keep a small place relaxed and bright. He found a piece of paper and wiped the bench clean, then lay flat, covered his face with the Women's Hospital logo and the beautiful girl's folding page to cover his face from the sun, and just took a break.
But just as he had just been lying down as if it hadn't been a minute, the sunlight shining through the edge of the leaflet had dimmed; it seemed like someone had come next to him. Hao Ren unexpectedly revealed her face unexpectedly and was stunned to discover that the sun was already setting in the sky, and that a petite and thin woman was standing next to her. This figure just blocked the already sinking sunset. Because she couldn't see the woman's appearance clearly due to the reverse light, she could only confirm through a dark outline that the other person was a slender girl with short hair.
“Yo, are you awake?”
At this point, the strange girl seemed to have finally realized that her standing in the backlit position made it difficult for people to see what she looked like, so she grinned and turned over her slightly so that the other person could see what she looked like.
A very beautiful girl - this is Hao Ren's first impression.
This mature girl has short shawl hair. She probably likes sports. Her skin is slightly wheat-colored, healthy and full of sunshine. Her appearance is beautiful and beautiful. What is most noticeable is her big, dynamic eyes. They are more vibrant than any pair of eyes Hao Ren has ever seen, as if the whole person's energy comes out of these eyes.
Behind her was a large suitcase that looked quite heavy.
Looking at Hao Ren, the beautiful girl with short hair smiled like never before (although it seemed a bit inappropriate to say that, but Hao Ren did think it was a silly laugh). Her smile was clean and pure. Now this year it seems like it's rare to see it on the face of a girl of the same age. The other party spent half a day working hard in her small bag, and finally figured out a wrinkled piece of paper and handed it to Hao Ren: “Hard driving, do you know where this is?”
Hao Ren patted her face to wake herself up. First, no matter what happened to this reckless girl, she looked down at the address on the paper... Wow, wasn't this my home?
CHAPTER 1
The glimmer of early morning pierced the dark blue sky, the sky was vast, and the fish's belly was white.
In the middle of a mountain forest in Senhu County, Martial Arts School, a skinny teenager wearing a loose martial arts robe squats on a double plate, holding the tip of his tongue against his teeth, concentrating all his strength on his left and right punches, hitting a thick tree.
The boxing style is smooth, easy to put in, full of energy without throwing up, and soft in the middle. It's been a bit hot.
The boy's name is Su Yu. He is 14 years old. He is beautiful and handsome, has an upright posture, and is childish.
Her dark hair was light, and her eyes were as vast as the stars and deep as the starry sky from time immemorial, showing wisdom that was not appropriate for her age.
Three hours later, the sun was hanging high.
Su Yu stopped punching, looked down at her blood-stained punches, and sighed softly: “I tried twice as hard as others. The results I got were less than half of those with the best qualifications.”
“Coming to another world, I really don't know. Is it a blessing or a curse?”
Two months ago, Su Yu was on a plane. Unfortunately, there was an air crash. As soon as he woke up, he discovered that he had traveled to a world called the mainland of the Shenyue.
Become a student at a martial arts academy in mainland China.
It took him two full months to digest his original owner's memories.
On the mainland of the Moon, martial arts are respected, the weak eat the strong, and cruel and strict.

Martial arts are divided into nine classes, each with three levels: Xiaosei, Daisheng, and Pinnacle.
As soon as he surpassed the nine martial arts and shackles and broke the shackles, he became a mythical figure, and is known as the “Holy King of the World.”
The realm of the Holy King of the Earth is the ultimate martial arts, the limit sought by hundreds of millions of people.
Rumor has it that the Holy King of the Earth can move mountains to reclaim the sea, drive clouds, drive fog, and do everything.
A holy king of the human world, enough to change the fortune of a dynasty for 100 years, is like a god.
However, why is it so difficult to practice in the world?
Su Yu is the greatest genius in Aoyama Town, under the jurisdiction of Xianyu County. At only 14 years old, she practiced martial arts to the pinnacle of martial arts and became a century-old genius in the minds of everyone in Aoyama Town.
However, it was only after he was included in Senwa County, the martial arts academy that is above everything else, that Su Yu discovered what kind of underground frog she used to be.
Martial Arts Academy searches for all the geniuses of Sembu County and enrolls them once a year.
And of all the geniuses at the Wuzong Academy, he is only at the bottom!
Wuzong University divides students into three categories according to their qualifications.
Golden students, outstanding geniuses, are often the best geniuses in a city. The top geniuses that suppress the rest of the geniuses in the city will be nurtured by the Wu Zong University.
Baiyin students, high-potential geniuses, have superior talents in a small town. If they work a little harder, they may be hopeful.
Su Yu is a Baiyin student. He knows very well. In fact, Baiyin trainee is a type of person who has no hope of practicing until the end, but it's a pity to give up. It's a pity that the food is tasteless; it's like a chicken rib.
Baiyin students are not favored. The training resources given by the university are very limited, and the chances of getting ahead are close to zero.
“Su Yu, go back to school quickly, Qin Guogong summons you!” There was an urgent sound breaking through the mountains and forests. A middle-aged man in blue was out of breath and ran up the mountain. There was a bit of anxiety on his face.
” Can you slow down, Qin Guo Gong? Come with me!” The middle-aged man in blue was impatient. She stepped forward and grabbed Su Yu by the shoulder, slimmed down her body despite the pain, and grabbed him down the mountain quickly.
Su Yu gnawed her teeth, endured severe shoulder pain, and kept silent.
The middle-aged man in blue is the school deacon and manages daily student activities. In the words of Earth School, he is the teaching director.
After half a cup of tea.
The college, a luxurious, elegant, and refined lounge like a dream.
Only core students, senior academics, and dignitaries can rest here. Other than that, gold students and silver students are not eligible.
Su Yu is also visiting the luxury lounge for the first time. If an ordinary poor kid comes here, they may be nervous. However, Su Yu was a business elite in her past life. She was also a regular guest at five-star hotels, presidential suites, and luxury dance parties. She had a calm mentality and was not humiliated.
There were three people in the lounge, a pair of young men and women, a man with a noble temperament and extraordinary prestige.
Su Yu paused for a moment when she glanced past the fourteen-year-old girl.
She was a beautiful, elf-looking woman. Her jade was as exquisite as a sculpture, and her skin was as white as the snow of Yang Chunzhi. She had an exquisite figure and was dressed in a dust-free white coat. She looked like a fox fairy. She was very beautiful.
However, she looked at Su Yu, which was nonchalant and complicated.
Next to him was a sixteen-year-old young man, handsome and powerful, and indescribable.
“Hehe, I'm Qin Guogong, so happy to meet you.” Qin Guogong was one of the three princely princes of the Fenglin Empire. At this time, he had no pride. Instead, he was extremely kind and jokingly asked Su Yu to sit down.
Su Yu shook her head coldly in her heart and was not at all moved by her kindness.
People in high positions have attracted the attention of hundreds of millions of people, so they pay great attention to their own recuperation and self-image.
Just like a politician on Earth, it was clear that they didn't accept it, but after they met, they still shook hands and smiled, only stabbed a knife under the stage and got out of the dark hand.
“I'm Qin Feng's father. This time, I'm here because of his relationship with Ching Er.” Qin Guogong had a handsome face and a warm smile. “I've heard Feng Er say everything. As Feng Er's father, I apologize to you for this.”
Bitterness flashed through Su Yu's heart; it was another bitterness of Su Yu's soul. The girl in front of me, named Jiang Xueqing, is a genius who came out of Qingshan Town with Su Yu. She was also listed as a student at the Wu Zong University.
They are a pair made in heaven, two young people, no guesses, a golden boy and a jade girl.
However, after entering Wu Zong University, Jiang Xueqing from {a small village, was shocked by the huge and bustling world and gradually fell in love with the flashy world.
As beautiful as a fox fairy, it's hard to avoid being sought after by young, powerful, and handsome geniuses.
At first, she was able to convince herself to stick to her heart and spend her first year with Su Yu.
However, gradually, she understood the cruelty of the world. She gradually changed from a naive little girl, knowing that Su Yu would have no future in the future. Following her, she is likely to suffer and become a subordinate.
At last, her inner line of defense waned.
Two months ago, she completely broke off contacts with Su Yu and became the son of Qin Guogong and partner of Qin Feng, the younger duke of the country.
Although Jiang Xueqing strictly abides by her role as a girl in a good family and has never harshed relationships between men and women, since then, the two have often accompanied each other, are inseparable, and have become an envious fairy couple in everyone's eyes.
Su Yu, on the other hand, became a laughing stock at Wu Zong University.
Su Yu was hit hard. She repeatedly pleaded with Jiang Xueqing to change her mind. She did not hesitate to kneel down and plead. She lost her face, but they were all coldly rejected by Jiang Xueqing.
Su Yu couldn't bear the misery and downfall of her life and killed herself. It just so happened that Su Yu on Earth had an air crash, and her soul passed through to him, a sad and poor weak person.
When Qin Guogong saw Su Yu lose his friendship with Jiang Xueqing, he sighed, “Feng Er is young and unsensible. I am willing to pay compensation for his faults. What do you want, no matter what you mention, as a father, I want you to become Quan Feng Er. He is serious about Xueqing's girl.”
Listening to Qin Guogong's words that seemed to come from her heart, Su Yu shook her head secretly in her heart. It's OK to trick ordinary people with this trick; it's of no use to him.
Stole my girlfriend and still keep me full? Where did this come from to apologize; it is clearly using force to suppress people!
Qin Guogong seemed to have a gentle attitude; in fact, it was full of blatant insults.
May I ask, if the woman of the monarch is the woman of the emperor and is favored by his son, he is the Qin Guogong, would the king of the country dare to let the monarch cede his woman to Qin Feng? He doesn't dare, because he can't beat the monarch; he can only incite civilians like Su Yu!
Su Yu shook her head slightly and got up and wanted to leave. He had no intention of being nostalgic for a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing. Even if Qin Guogong didn't use his power to suppress others, he had no plans to compete with her.
As for Qin Guogong's so-called compensation, although Su Yu lacks training resources, even though she is poor, she has nothing. However, he still has a will not accept defeat, and has not yet fallen to the point where he has been given alms.
Jiang Xueqing understood the personality of “Su Yu” and was stubborn and didn't accept defeat. Seeing him wanted to leave, only when he still wouldn't give up, bitten his silver teeth gently, his lotus steps moved lightly, and his eyes looked like a cold moon: “Su Yu! Please respect my choice!”
“Now that I've reached this point, I'm going to put my words completely out of my heart.” The ruthlessness flashed through Jiang Xueqing's eyes.
“Qin Fenggui is a small national government. He must be the backbone of the empire in the future. He can give me glory and wealth. Can you give it to me if you are a poor kid in a mountain village?”
“Qin Feng is honored as a Golden Student. In the future, he pursues the King of the Earth and stands above hundreds of millions of people. It gives me a sense of security. Are you a Silver Student, can you get it?”
“Su Yu, accept reality. I don't deny it. You used to be my favorite person. You were the brightest genius in my mind, but that was because I was too young, too simple, the real world, cruel and real, I had no choice!”
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last glimmer of concern in her eyes and stared at Su Yu, as if looking at a stranger and sighing softly: “Brother Feng is great. As long as you promise not to come to me in the future, he will try his best to compensate you, give you a few Reinling Baodan, and promote your career. Your strength will improve, and your days at school will be much better.”
After thinking about it, Jiang Xueqing took out a slap-sized statue of a woman carved in crystal from her sleeve.
It is crystal clear, and shimmers with splendid depth. The most beautiful thing is that the woman in the crystal statue is ethereal and beautiful, like a fox fairy, as beautiful as an immortal, and so fascinating.
The statue looked like a woman and was lifelike. It was like the owner holding it, Jiang Xueqing.
“This is a sweet gift you gave me. Now, give it back to you. We don't owe anything to you ever since.” Jiang Xueqing ruthlessly stuffed the statue into Su Yu's hands, turned back to Qin Feng's side, looked out into the sky, stopped looking at Su Yu, and was cold and desperate.
“Chi Yao, I treat you like a loved one; why would you kill me?”
Zhang Ruochen yelled and wanted to hit the front, “giggle” on the gilt cast bed, and suddenly sat up.
The discovery was just a dream, and Zhang Ruochen took a long breath and dried the sweat on his forehead with his sleeve.
No!
That's not a dream!
How could everything that happened with him and Princess Chi Yao be a dream?
Zhang Ruochen was originally the only son of the “Ming Emperor” of the Kunlun Realm {one of the nine emperors and monarchs. At the age of 16, he went against the sky and practiced until the Celestial Realm came to a successful conclusion.
However, when he became the first member of the younger generation in the Kunlun community, he died at the hands of his famous fiancee, Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chi Yao is the daughter of “Qing Emperor”, one of the nine emperors.
Emperor Ming and Emperor Qing had the best relationship. Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao even got married. They grew up together and practiced together from an early age.
A heroic and beautiful person, who can be called the Golden Boy and the Jade Girl, could have been a great story in the training world. Zhang Ruochen couldn't have anticipated that Princess Chi Yao would actually shoot at him!
After her death at the hands of Princess Chi Yao, when Zhang Ruochen woke up again, she discovered that she was 800 years later.
The former Princess Chi Yao settled the Rebellion of the Nine Emperors, unified the nine countries, established the first central empire, and became the master of the entire Kunlun world — Empress Chi Yao.
800 years ago, the nine emperors of the Kunlun Realm completely became a thing of the past and disappeared into the long course of history.
The Nine Emperors are dead, and the Queen is in office.
In this era, there was only one emperor, Empress Chi Yao, who ruled the world and stood out in all directions.
“Why would she kill me?
How can her heart be so ruthless, or is a woman's heart so ruthless?” Zhang Ruochen's eyes are sharp, his heart is deep, and his stomach is full of questions. However, there was no one to help him answer it.
800 years have passed, and the ocean has already turned into a mulberry field. Other than Empress Chi Yao, who was immortal in the world, she is still young and immortal.
All of those who died in the past have been turned into loess and turned into white bones. Even the majestic nine emperors of that year were all extinct from the world, leaving only one piece of splendid story that would be passed on for generations to come.
“Squeaky!”
A weak, beautiful woman in a palace dress came in from outside, looked at Zhang Ruochen sitting on her bed, and looked concerned, “Dust, are you having nightmares again?”
The beautiful woman in front of her is the princess of the King of Yunwu County and the daughter of Zhang Ruochen, Lin Fei.
The original owner of this body died of illness in bed three days ago due to his frailty and illness.
After being killed by Princess Chi Yao, Zhang Ruochen woke up again and appeared in this body, bringing back to life the teenager who had originally died of illness.
What is even more coincidence is that the original owner of this body is also called Zhang Ruochen. When Zhang Ruochen first woke up, she still repulsed Lin Fei.
After all, in Zhang Ruochen's eyes, Lin Fei is just a stranger. However, after three days of contact, Zhang Ruochen gradually discovered that Lin Fei really cared about him. Seeing Zhang Ruochen's nightmare woke up, even more so despite the cold and freezing, she immediately rushed to Zhang Ruochen's room.
In her last life, Zhang Ruochen never met her birth mother. It is said that she died when she was born!
Unexpectedly, his rebirth in this body after being killed by Princess Chi Yao actually made him feel the warmth of motherly love. “Maybe she doesn't know yet. Her dust died of illness three days ago!”
If she were to tell her the truth, she might not be able to withstand this terrible news.
Zhang Ruochen looked at the beautiful woman in front of her. Her eyes softened and smiled slightly: “Mom, don't worry about me; it's just a dream.”
Lin Fei, wearing a maroon hooded mink on her thin body, sat at Zhang Ruochen's bedside, caressed Zhang Ruochen's forehead and said with concern, “It's been three nights. You're always woken up by nightmares. You always call her 'Chi Yao' every time. Who the hell is she?”
Naturally, it is impossible for Fei Lin to associate the name “Chi Yao” with the empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after Empress Chi Yao unified the Kunlun border and established the First Central Empire, she became known as the “Empress of Great Deity,” and usually no one dared to mention the word “Chi Yao.”
It's a taboo offense. Zhang Ruochen said, “Nothing, mother, you heard it wrong!”
Lin Fei sighed and said, “Never call out the word 'Chi Yao' directly in the future, not even in a dream; that's the Queen's name. Calling the queen out loud is disrespectful; once heard by an interested person, she will be executed.”
Zhang Ruochen nodded, pinched his finger tightly, and said in a deep way, “Absolutely not! ”
From now on, I'll be her nightmare.
Lin Fei looked at Zhang Ruochen, who was thin and pale, and sighed softly. Her heart was extremely sour.
Although he was born into the County King's family, he has been frail and sick since childhood. He is 16 years old, and he still only has to lie in bed all year round. I'm afraid this is the only way he will live his whole life!
Outside, there was a messy sound of footsteps.
“What are you guys doing?
A good-looking handmaiden wanted to stop Hachioji from breaking in, but she was gently pushed by Hachioji and fell more than ten meters away. Hachioji was a warrior. In the late stages of reaching the Yellow Jikjing, a single slap was enough to knock a 300-kilogram stone pan ten feet away, let alone just a 1010-kg handmaid?
With the flick of a finger, you can bounce her out.
The handmaiden screamed, fell heavily to the ground, and her left arm was broken.
Hachioji was wearing a cloak with a jade band wrapped around his waist. He was in good health, had slender arms, and a steady pace. He walked into the Tamashu Palace and looked coldly at the handmaiden. “Even a slave dared to block the Prince's path; it was really a death hunt.”
Behind Hachioji, there are six bodyguards wearing thick skin armor. They are tall and have a tight back. Obviously, they are all martial arts monks with strong combat power and belong to the royal palace guard.
After hearing the movement from outside and calming Zhang Ruochen's mood, Lin Fei closed the door and walked out.
She stared at Hachioji standing outside and frowned slightly, saying, “Your Highness Hachioji, this is the Tamashu Palace. Even if you're a prince, you can't break in!”
Zhang Ji of Hachioji looked up and stared at Lin Fei and said loudly, “The Queen ordered that Lin Fei's wife and her ninth brother's sleeping house be changed to 'Ziyi Homedan'. The future owner of the Tamasu Palace will be Prince Ben's biological mother, Miss Xiao Fei.”
Lin Fei's face changed slightly. She had anticipated that day would come, but she didn't expect it to come so soon.
Lin Fei smiled bitterly and said, “Is the Queen going to kick our mother and son out of the Yushu Palace so soon? OK!
Her mother said that she wants to stay in the Yushu Palace tonight. Please move away from Fei-niang Lin now!”
Hachioji smiled coldly and was not at all kind: “Miss Lin, there are so many poor people in this world, but not everyone is worthy of pity. Since the nine brothers are frail and sick, why are they still alive in the world?”
“He's your ninth brother!”
What else did Fei Lin want to say. Suddenly, the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruochen's health is weak, and he can barely stand by holding the doorpost with his hands, staring at Hachioji, which is not far away.
Seemingly weak and imbued with an indomitable will, he said, “Don't ask them, let's move out now.”
“Dust, why did you get out of bed? It's cold outside, so I won't go back yet.” Lin Fei hurriedly stepped forward to support Zhang Ruochen, fearing that he would catch the wind chill.
Lin Fei looked at Zhang Ruochen's firm eyes and seemed to be infected by his emotions. She nodded in tears.
Lin Fei and Shen Zhang Ruochen supported her and walked out of the Yushu Palace step by step, except for the handmaiden who was pushed to break her arm by the Hachioji Prince.
None of the other servants left the Tamasugu Palace with them. As everyone can see, Lin Fei and Prince Kowloon have completely lost power, and it is difficult for them to have a foothold in the County Wangfu.
Originally, they were servants of the Tamasugu Palace, but now they are naturally wise in choosing to stay in the Tamasugu Palace; they all go to please the new owner of Hachioji.
Ziyi's side temple is usually a place where the lost princess lives. It's very remote, full of fallen leaves, and it seems like no one has lived there for a long time.
The night was deep, and the wind was cold and bleak.
Sitting on a cold stone bench, Zhang Ruochen's thin body was wrapped in a coat, yet she still felt cold.
“This body is too weak. Only by practicing martial arts can you gradually strengthen your body.
Otherwise, even if I were the son of the king of the county now, I would still only be at the mercy of others.” A secret thought in Zhang Ruochen's heart.
800 years have passed, and Zhang Ruochen doesn't know where he can go now?
Since heaven arranged for him to be reborn in this body, whether to avenge Empress Chi Yao in the future or for the sake of that mother who took great care of her, he must be strong. The humiliation and cold treatment I experienced today was entirely because I was too weak, unable to resist, unable to control my own destiny, and even where I lived was taken over by others.
If you want to be respected by others and have a warm and comfortable living environment, you must become a warrior and prove your abilities.
In the Kunlun Realm, if you want to be a warrior, you must first activate the “Imprint of the Divine Warrior.”
The so-called “Imprint of Jinmu” is a qualification given to humans by the gods to practice martial arts.
A person who hasn't started “The Imprint of Jinmu” will never be able to practice and become a strong person between heaven and earth. Zhang Ruochen is 16 years old and still hasn't started “The Imprint of Jinwu.”
After 16, you miss the best age to practice martial arts. Even if you start “The Imprint of Jinwu,” you can't achieve much.
They are also all sons of King Unmu County, so why is Hachioji superior to others? Can Zhang Ruochen and Lin Fei be evicted from the Yu Shu Palace?
This is because Hachioji started “The Imprint of Jinmu” when he was 10 years old, and is now a young warrior from the late Yellow Jikjing era.
“As long as I open the 'Imprint of Jinmu, 'I can practice the “Nine Days of Ming Di Jing.”
With the subtlety of the “Nine Days of Ming Di Jing,” even if I have missed my best training age, I may still be able to catch up with other geniuses and become a martial arts master again.” The “Nine Days of Ming Di Jing” is the ultimate treasure of the Ming Emperor's practice. Other than the Ming Emperor, only Zhang Ruochen knows the complete practice law of the “Nine Days of Ming Di Jing.”
“Tomorrow is a sacrifice ceremony. I hope to be recognized by the gods to launch the 'Imprint of Jinmu. '”
Zhang Ruochen clenched his fists and was full of desire to launch “The Imprint of Jinwu.”
After Lin Fei had tidied up her room, she came over to help Zhang Ruochen, “Dust, take a break early! Tomorrow, I'm also going to attend the sacrifice ceremony.”
“My mother can rest assured that I will definitely be able to launch the 'Imprint of Jinmu” tomorrow! ' Zhang Ruochen said.
“Hmm!
Lin Fei took a deep look at Zhang Ruochen and sighed softly.
CHAPTER I
At the same time, a rust-stained iron gate was opened, and the aftersound of the iron gate was blocked by the surrounding ancient buildings, and there was endless rumbling.
After about a dozen breaths, a young man with his head pulled by his arm was dragged by two prison guards and dragged out of the iron gate. This young man with his head seemed to be out of breath, and even his arms were thin, with only bones left. It can be seen from his blood-stained, shattered clothes on his body what kind of destruction and torture this young man was subjected to.
“Fung,” a thin man, was thrown on the ground by two prison guards, splashed some dust, and then became motionless.
“Should this kid die?” A chunky prison guard stared at the unmoved young man on the ground and asked a question.
Another prison guard shouted, “It must have been dead. Who made him unaware of his life or death dared to be disrespectful to Miss Jane. It's better now. Not only has Ningfu been destroyed, but he himself is also liberated; he deserves it.”
“Old friend, be careful, let's drag him out and handle it before we talk about it.” The chunky prison guard hurriedly gave a word of warning.
Hearing the words of this chunky and fat prison guard, on top of that, the old prison guard, couldn't help but roll up the man who had no breath on the ground and was ready to drag him away.
At this point, a slightly weak voice shouted, “Big brothers, I want to take my husband, Junjun, away.”
Only then did the two talking prison guards see a woman wearing a thick cloth linen coat standing beside her. Although this woman was wearing a thick cloth linen, she could still vaguely see her unflattering demeanor. The only regret is that her face has been disfigured and covered by slightly unruly hair, making people reluctant to look at her a second time.
Both prison guards have identified who this woman is. This is one of the only two surviving members of the Ning family.
Ning Gao is the housekeeper of Ningfu. When Ning Fu was raided, something happened when he left the country of Cangqin, so he escaped a robbery. However, this woman is the daughter-in-law of Ningfu, and the wife of this thin man who has just been thrown out of prison. Her name is Gi Luofei.
She escaped a robbery because she stayed at the Cangqin Two Star Academy. Of course, this is also because Gui Luofei doesn't have much to do with the Ning family. The reason she married the Ning family is because the Ning family and the Ji family are from the World Health, and she became close friends with Ning Cheng since childhood. It's just that the Ji family didn't fall down in the most inexplicable way; in the end, there was only one disfigured Girofey left.
Even so, Ning Hong-chang, the grandfather of Ning Cheng, still took Ji Luofei into the government. Be prepared to wait until Ningcheng really gets together before the two become families.
“OK, OK, drag it away, it's so unsightly to put it here.” The chunky prison guard put away the silver coins and waved impatiently.
They were supposed to dispose of the dead body in Ningcheng, but they couldn't imagine anyone coming to dispose of it and giving them back the silver coins. Of course they wouldn't refuse this kind of good thing.
When Princess Giro heard this, she quickly turned Ning Cheng on her back, sped up, and soon disappeared from the prison entrance.
“Had it not been disfigured, this Princess would also be a beautiful embryo.” Looking at the back of Lady Giroufé, another prison guard threw away the silver coin in her hand and spoke in a judgmental tone.
“Stop talking nonsense. Well, Gui Luofei is also from the Cangqin Two Star Academy. No matter how ugly they are, it's not our turn.” The chunky prison guard patted the talking prison guard on the shoulder and pulled him back into the Iron Gate.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled a very nice scent. The first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a white neck. The next moment, Ning Xiaocheng reacted. He was being carried by a woman, and the fragrance came from the woman carrying him.
No, he remembers that after being rejected by Tian Muwan, he was in a very bad mood. As a result, he took the wrong path and walked up the overpass alone. Then a yellow light from the sky hit him, and then there was no follow.
Does that mean he's not dead yet? What the hell is going on with this?
Ning Xiaocheng just thought about this. All kinds of information flooded into his mind, and he was actually born again.
What shocked Ning Xiaocheng was that his reborn body was originally called Ning Cheng. The reason he was shocked was because his original name was Ning Cheng.
It's just because he often has a nightmare where he sees himself in an extremely strange place, jailed for mental arithmetic, and then tortured to death. Although it was just a dream, Ning Cheng still changed her name to Ning Xiaocheng.
Unexpected to go back and forth, he still called Ning Cheng, and was actually reborn in the same environment of his dreams.
Ning Xiaocheng wanted to lift her hands and wipe the cold sweat off her forehead, but the woman carrying him looked back and didn't say much.
“Sorry, I don't have the strength to walk.” Seeing this woman look back at herself, Ning Xiaocheng said with some apologies.
“The Ning family is gone; we are so lucky to be alive.” This woman has a calm tone. It seems that even if Ning Xiaocheng actually died, she had this kind of calm attitude.
Ning Xiaocheng fell silent. He had just sorted out some fragmented information. Now he should have called back Ningcheng again. He is the sole member of Cang Qin Guoning's family.
Ning Cheng's parents went to the Mango Sea to search for creatures when they were very young, and never came back. Ning Cheng has always lived with his grandfather Ning Hongchang in Cangle City, the capital of the Cangqin State. Although Ningfu is big, there aren't many people.
Of course, Ningcheng also became the first person in Ningfu; Ning Hongchang never even cared about Ningcheng. Ning Hongchang took responsibility for all the bad things Ningcheng did in Cangle City. Cangle City is full of Wang Gong's relatives. Although Ning Hongchang is also a veteran of the Cang and Qin dynasties, it's still a bit worse than the royal family.
Finally, one day, Ning Cheng lost a basket he couldn't even carry. He actually offended Jian Sujie, the pearl of the Jian family in Cang Qin Guo. Let's not say that the Jian family couldn't be provoked by the Ning family; it was Jian Sujie's fiance, Qiu Yingguang, and the Ning family couldn't do it either.
Ning Cheng sighed when he thought about this. The result he couldn't have provoked was, of course, being imprisoned. Grandpa Ning Hongchang exhausted his contacts and family finances in order to save him. As a result, he was not saved; instead, the entire Ning family was taken in. His predecessor also learned this news from the prison guard; it can be said that the Ning family was also destroyed because of him.
After Ning Cheng clarified these matters, his heart sighed once again. There is no reason to say that there is no reason to speak of this world; whoever has the biggest fist is the truth.
At the same time, he also understood who the person carrying him was. This disfigured woman is his fiancee, called Princess Girofey. Some of it is similar to the nurturing daughter-in-law on Earth.
After that, inexplicably, the Ji family never left; there was only one disfigured Girofey left. However, Ning Hongchang, the grandfather of Ning Cheng, took Ji Luofei to the Ning family and was ready to wait until Ning Cheng got together to help the two complete their marriage.
Ning Hongchang condoned Ning Cheng on other matters, but he never gave up when it came to marrying Ji Luofei as his wife. Originally, Ning Cheng was very dissatisfied with the disfigured Ji Luo Fei. She often scolded at the same time. Fortunately, Ji Luofei did the opposite and never objected to Ning Cheng. Moreover, Guilofi is different from Ning Cheng. She has qualifications and can train.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he also entered the Cangqin Two Star Academy, and is already a three-level master. In the Cang and Qin countries, anyone who can practice is called a monk.
At this point, Princess Giraffe had already carried him into an extremely low black stone house. Although the Black Stone House is low, the area is not very small; at least it has everything it should have. There's even a small courtyard with a deep well in the yard.
Even if it has to do with him himself, Ning Cheng must figure this out. Although he speculated that the Jian family and the Qiu family did it, he must ask something to understand.
“Why do you have to ask me what you did yourself?” After giving a simple answer, Gui Luofei let go of Ning Cheng.
After speaking, she poured another glass of clean water to feed Ningcheng, then said, “I'm going to boil water to bathe you, and I've forgotten some things. You know it's not good for you.”
Ning Cheng watched as Gi Luofei went in to boil water, and didn't continue to ask questions. He understood what she meant. With his powers, the more he knows, the sooner he dies.
I don't know if Princess Giraffe added anything to that glass of water. Ning Cheng felt that after drinking this glass of water, the whole person had recovered some strength.
Ning Cheng was sitting on an old wooden bed. For a moment, she thought about her current situation, and for a while she thought about her younger sister Ning Ruolan. At the same time, he really didn't understand why Tian Mu-wan treated him like that. According to what he knew about Tian Mu-wan, Tian Mu-wan was definitely not that kind of snobbish girl.
CHAPTER 1
Chu Li sailed on the lake. The lake was breezy and refreshing.
The Gongfu of Yikuo has a huge lake of 10,000 hectares and 99 islands. The martial arts hall he wants to visit is 18 miles from the East Garden.
On top of the boat, he was of medium stature, and his blue shirt fluttered. He looked normal yet quite heroic. Looking at the vast lake, his thoughts drifted far away.
Two months and three days in '19; it's already two months and three days in '19!
An imposing high-energy physics researcher, a student with a bright future, a great scientist of the future, made a small mistake in the experiment. After the explosion, he came to this world and reincarnated as a human again!
“BANG!” The muffled sound broke his contemplation, and he turned his head, and a shiny carp kept beating on the boat.
Chu Li shook her head and bent over to throw the carp back into the lake. Standing straight up, a tall building caught his eye.
The 100-meter-high building, shimmering in bronze light, is heavy and strict, showing the prestige of the State Commune.
This tall bronze building is a martial arts hall!
In front of the martial arts hall is an open martial arts arena, covered with red clay. Hundreds of people are practicing, either practicing swords, fighting, or fighting with each other. It is very lively.
Chu Li boarded a boat ashore and set foot on the martial arts field without walking a few steps. Suddenly, a handsome young man appeared, with a face like a crown and jade, eyebrows like a sword, and a brilliant figure.
He was tall. Gao Chu stood one head away, hugged his shoulder and looked down at him: “The one with the last name Chu, why are you here? !”
Chu Li frowned: “Get away, good dogs can't get in the way!”
The handsome young man laughed, “Can't it be that you want to practice martial arts?”
Chu Li suddenly smiled and continued on: “Zhuo Feiyang, I fell to the ground and screamed. Believe it or not, you won't be able to eat and walk around?”
Government guards are prohibited from fighting privately, and killing each other is not allowed. Government guards are divided into guards and bodyguards. Private fighting between the two is particularly strictly prohibited. If it is light, it will be reduced, and if it is severe, it will be evicted from the government.
Chu Li is an unpurchased bodyguard, while Zhuo Feiyang is an eight-pin guard. The guard abuses the bodyguard. He falls to the ground and screams; no matter how genius Zhuo Feiyang is, no matter how genius he is, will be severely punished.
Zhuo Feiyang's brow furrowed: “The one with the last name Chu, OK, shameless enough!” Chu Li continued to move forward.
Zhuo Feiyang stepped aside and gave way, making a gloomy and handsome face: “The last name is Chu, you can only use these little tricks!”
Chu Li laughed: “To deal with idiots like you, little things are enough!”
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him to death, clenching his fist tighter and tighter, as if it were waving the next moment. Chu Li looked at him lazily and stunned.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly had a bright smile and raised her hand vigorously: “Sister Zhao!”
A beautiful, graceful girl from afar walked by. Her skin was racing against the snow, her eyes were thin, and her temperament was as gentle as water.
Chu Li's face changed slightly. Zhao Ying went to the house at the same time as them. Beautiful, kind, and gentle, she was the kind of woman men would love when they saw them.
“Brother Zhuo?” When Zhao Ying walked over lightly, she said in surprise, “Brother Chu?”
Chu Li smelled the faint fragrance she brought and smiled: “Sister Zhao, I haven't seen her in a long time.”
Since he was assigned to the East Garden, he has spent most of his time at the library building, hoping to use his knowledge to change his fate; he has rarely performed at the Martial Arts Hall.
I'm at the martial arts hall this time, and I'm having trouble practicing Little Vein Washing Tips. I'd like to take a look at the tips and practice notes related to Little Vein Washing Tips.
Zhao Ying laughed, “Brother Chu, congratulations. East Garden is a poor beauty.”
Chu Li smiled and nodded, “Not bad.”
East Garden belongs directly to Miss Three's Yu Qi's Yuqi Island. There are only him and Li Yue's two bodyguards. Not only are they laid-back and comfortable, but they also have a chance to meet Miss Three. Once they are blinded by Miss Three, it's just around the corner.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath. This guy had great luck; on the other hand, he went into East Garden. God couldn't open his eyes; he had to clean him up!
“Sister Zhao, get rid of this waste. I just learned how to use arrogant swords yesterday. Why don't we talk about it?”
Zhao Ying raised her eyebrows and thought it was hard to hear Zhuo Feiyang speak.
“OK, not to mention his waste!” Zhuo Feiyang hurriedly laughed and glanced at Li: “Even though he's just a waste!”
Zhao Ying stared disgruntled.
“Sister Zhao, it's fine,” Chu Li smiled. “There's no need to think about this arrogant idiot.”
“Brother Chu!” Zhao Yingping said.
Chu Li reached out and surrendered: “Sister Zhao, let's have fun in East Garden. The scenery is beautiful, and Brother Li's cooking skills are also excellent.”
“Huh, there's anything to see!” Zhuo Feiyang said, “But it's just flowers and plants. If you have that time, it's better to practice martial arts. Play with things and lose your will!” “Like you said, the three young ladies and the grandson are all playful and demoralized, aren't you better?” Chu Li is laughing or not. The West Garden belongs to Grand Duke Xiao Tieying.
Zhuo Fei and Yang Jun blushed and laughed repeatedly, and decided not to fight with him.
“Brother Zhuo! Brother Chu!” Zhao Ying said with dissatisfaction: “Why don't you stop for a while! ... Brother Chu, I'll go play; get busy before you have anything.”
Chu Li took a deep look at her: “Sister Zhao, some people have a nice pair of skin bags. You can only see people's hearts over time. Sister, don't trust others easily!”
“The one with the last name Chu, what do you mean!”
Chu Li ignored him, smiled and hugged Zhao Ying.
Zhao Ying turned away.
Zhuo Feiyang was in a hurry to catch up. As she left, taking advantage of Zhao Ying's lack of attention, she suddenly reached out.
He almost slapped Chu Li in the face. He was very confident that Chu would be too late to avoid it. Seemingly he didn't pay attention, but he used his internal strength and was extremely fast.
Chu Li gently touched the side of her head, and Zhuo Feiyang's fingertips touched her cheeks. She could feel the breeze. The strength of this palm was not too strong.
“Hehe!”
A clear, loud slap in the face sounded.
Chu Li slapped her face with her left palm. It was clear and loud, didn't use much force, made a loud voice, and then quickly stopped.
Zhao Ying hurriedly turned her head and looked. Chu Li's look didn't change, as if this slap wasn't on her face.
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him with a gloomy face. Chu Li smiled and touched her face: “What a great effort, I admire it!”
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him to death.
“Brother Zhuo...!” Zhao Ying sank a jade face.
“I'm sorry, right, I really didn't mean it.” Zhuo Feiyang gnawed her teeth, and the sound squeezed out of the gap between her teeth, coldly saying, “Maybe Brother Chu wouldn't care, right, Master Chu?”
Chu Li turned her head and laughed, “Forget it, Sister Zhao.”
Zhao Ying looked at him with embarrassment, hurriedly dragged Zhuo Feiyang away, and stayed longer. The two had no choice but to fight!
Chu Li stared at Zhao Yingjina's back motionless, touched her hot left face, and activated Dadayuan Jingzhi to suppress her mood swings.
Had it not been for Dayuan Jingzhi, it would have been calculated mentally by Zhuo Feiyang!
He was very moved by the fact that the world honors martial arts. From an early age, Zhao Ying was gentle and kind, and protected herself clearly and secretly.
But as a man, he needs the protection of a woman. As a man, it's just unbearable!
He walked through the crowd at the martial arts field and entered the martial arts hall.
Remove the wooden card around his waist and hand it to the young man in front of the temple. The young man looked like electricity, swiped, and signaled that he could go in.
He saw a row of bookshelves. He stopped by accident, reached over a book, quickly turned it over, put it back and continued walking, then stopped, and then drew another book over.
In one hour, he turned 22 books.
It seemed like he knew the location of these books a long time ago; it would be fine if he just pulled them out. In fact, this is his first time here; the tip for washing his veins was in the library.
The entire martial arts theater came to his mind. Every row of bookshelves and the name of every book was clear and familiar.
He walked to the second floor, went directly to the third row of bookshelves, pulled out the paranoid sword score on the second floor, turned it over, and then drew out seven more tips. This is his practice experience of delusional sword scores.
When he left the martial arts hall, his mind was already imprinted on his mind 30 tips, 22 small bloodwashing practice notes, a book of delusional sword scores, and seven perversive sword practice experiences.
He sailed on the lake in a small boat. The breeze came slowly, and his original raging anger had already dissipated.
The 30 secrets in my mind began to blend together.
The midday sun was burning, and he sailed back to East Garden.
East Garden is a small island with a radius of two. It is divided into flower gardens one by one. Each flower is a rare flower, and the scent of flowers floats throughout the island.
There was only one small courtyard on the island. Chu Li pushed the door into the hospital, and a cool air came through. A big tree covered half of the yard and drove away the heat.
He went into the West Wing room, picked up a Qing Feng sword, and swung it slowly like a tai chi sword in the center of the courtyard. In a moment, he began to sweat and his forehead brightened.
He never forgot, and the tricks he read were imprinted on his mind. The arrogant sword techniques he had just learned at the Martial Arts Hall were astonishing, but they were also extremely labor-intensive.
“Squeaky...” A strong young man walked out of the main hall with a big round face and small eyes.
He shook and shook like a black bear, stretched out his back and even yawned, only to say lazily, “Brother, have you been back this early?”
Chu Li focused on practicing his sword, only sighed. Li Yue, a Jiupin bodyguard, is responsible for the East Garden together. They have a good appetite, excellent cooking skills, and good martial arts skills, yet they are afraid of death and won't break into Jiupinlou; they are willing to be bodyguards.
The bodyguards and guards in the state office are divided into nine categories; the difference in salary is ten times.
The wages of bodyguards are low, and their grades require qualifications. Three years nine products, ten years eight products, twenty seven products, forty six products, seventy five products. Defend and upgrade products, regardless of whether they only look at martial arts, break through the Jiupin Tower and go through one floor to upgrade one product.
They pay a lot of money, can often leave the house to do tasks, and work in a variety of ways. Unlike bodyguards, they can only stay in their homes to wait for people, but anyone with the slightest ability works as a guard.
Li Yue shook her neck, extended her legs, and made a string of crackling sounds at her joints. Afterwards, she started practicing with her fists. Her punches were like meteors, exhaling the wind.
“Dude, don't practice sword fighting, practice boxing with me!”
Chu Li spit out two words, a layer of soya sweat on her forehead.
Martial arts flourish in this world, and martial arts practice starts with dolls.
After the age of eight to eighteen, once the meridians are shaped, no matter how amazing the mind works, it takes several times more time to build a foundation.
Before he was 18 years old, he struggled with the Daichido Hongenkyo Sutra at Akihaji Temple, where he grew up, and missed out on building the foundation. Twice as energetic as normal people, and strong in spirit.
In addition to the fact that he was a high-energy physics researcher in his past life, his knowledge of the world is far from comparable.
It was only when the two came together that he finally developed the original sutra of Dazhidu and achieved the power of the Great Circle of Wisdom.
He has a strong spirit. The duration of his practice is far greater than that of ordinary people. He is full of magic and observation. Therefore, he is progressing very fast in his little veins, and he can build a foundation in five years.
“Hehe... even with your sword, you can't kill a chicken, what are you still doing?”
Chu Li suddenly withdrew his sword and hummed, “Bibi?”
He was out of breath, covered in a soft body, and only held up his body by throwing his sword to the ground. The deceptive sword method was too strenuous.
1. Chapter 1
In the quaint room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
This is an instinctive reaction of a good special forces unit!
As soon as my hand fell, the soreness of an electric shock came from it, and I felt weak for a while.
Ling Tian opened her eyes.
There was a gentle female voice in my ear.
Ling Tian saw a delicate face and looked at him with care.
This is a classically beautiful woman. Her beauty is suffocating; it is entirely possible to describe her by the love of the country.
Ling Tian, a native of China.
He served in China's best special operations force in the Langya Special Operations Force. During his service, he made numerous achievements.
He has participated in the world-class special forces competition, won the personal honor of being number one in individual combat ability, and is recognized as the “King of Soldiers”!
Later, during a multinational SSS mission, one of his comrades died due to his minor personal negligence.
Under his own blame, he chose to retire and left Langtang.
After retiring, he stayed silent for a while and chose to go abroad, becoming the trump card of one of the most famous mercenary organizations in the world.
As long as it's a mission he takes on, the success rate is 100% unprecedented!
Although he retired from the Wolf Tear for many years, he is still deeply attached to China.
As long as the mission is unfavorable to China, not only will he not pick up the person who issued the mission, he will also carry out inhumane massacres.
Over time, he became a stab in the eyes and a thorn in the flesh of all countries other than China.
In the eyes of other countries, he's just a time bomb.
However, as the killers evaporated from person to person, Ling Tian became more alive and moisturized, and no killer dared to take on this “death mission.”
Killing Ling Tian is tantamount to finding your own dead end. This is a statement recognized by the world's mercenary community and the killer community.
Throughout the Earth, it's rare to see an opponent, not a single defeat!
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from her most trusted agent.
Country R has created a colorless and tasteless biochemical weapon with the intention of transporting it into China to carry out a horrendous conspiracy.
Of course, Ling Tian won't sit idly by and ignore this.
He took action!
With the help of an agent, I found out where the batch of biological and chemical weapons was located.
Just when he killed a bloodline and went into an underground research room preparing to destroy that batch of biological and chemical weapons. The underground lab suddenly sinks, trapping him in a fully enclosed cage.
When I saw R Chinese people carrying all kinds of guns one by one, they appeared outside their cages. Ling Tian understood.
I've been betrayed by the person I trust the most!
Otherwise, with his shrewdness, the plot of the R Chinese people will not succeed.
Ling Tian couldn't figure it out until she was shot and killed.
“Oh my god, what happened to you, don't scare your wife.”
There was a gentle voice, full of anxiety.
He's pretty sure he doesn't know this woman.
However, the woman now looks like she is looking at her closest family. There is no hypocrisy; it is full of sincerity.
Just when Ling Tian was preparing to theorize with this beautiful woman.
If Ling Tian was struck by lightning, she stayed completely, as if she had been hit by a cave.
The only thing that satisfied Ling Tian was that this guy, also called Ling Tian, had the full name 'Duan Lingtian'.
Duan Lingtian, 15.
A child whose last name is Li's family in Qingfeng Town.
Her mother, “Li Rou,” is Elder Lee Ka-jeou.
His father... in his memory, he doesn't have a father at all.
In the process of blending this strange memory, Ling Tian also learned the reason Duan Lingtian was seriously injured in bed.
Early this morning, “Li Xin,” the youngest son of Elder Li Jiaqi, scolded Duan Lingtian as a wild breed with a mother and no father.
It's just that he hasn't even finished his body hardening. How can he be an opponent of Li Xin, who is in a double state of hardening. He was directly seriously injured by Li Xin and dying of death.
After merging all the strange memories, Ling Tian sighed in her heart.
He knows that from this moment on, he will integrate into this strange world as Duan Lingtian.
From now on, he is Duan Lingtian, and Duan Lingtian is him.
“Ma'am, the landlord asked someone to deliver medicine.”
There was a sound coming from my ear, and Duan Lingtian looked up.
A girl hurried in from outside the house and handed the exquisite box in her hand to Li Rou.
The box was opened. Immediately, the medicinal scent wafted away.
“Oh my god, come take an elixir, your mother will heal your wounds.”
Li Rou took a dark elixir from the inside and handed it to Duan Lingtian's mouth.
Taking a deep breath, Duan Lingtian opened his mouth and swallowed the elixir.
The elixir melted in the mouth, turned into a warm current, and entered his body.
Then, Duan Lingtian saw it again.
A cold stream of air came into his body, discharging the warm current of the elixir, and healing his wounds.
An hour later, Li Rou quit.
Duan Lingtian discovered that most of the soreness in her body had disappeared, and there was no burden left.
What he just took didn't work?
At this point, Duan Lingtian discovered that Li Rou's face was pale and that his forehead was still sweaty. Obviously, it had cost him a lot of energy to heal his wounds.
“Ma'am, are you alright?”
Duan Lingtian's heart was warm.
This' maiden 'sound was affectionately called; there was nothing unnatural about it.
“Mother is fine, just take a break.”
Li Rou smiled and shook her head.
For my son, it's nothing to consume that much energy.
“He and the seven elders are still waiting in the prison.” Half an hour later, the girl walked into the room again and spoke softly.
“Release? Go talk to the person sent by the landlord, and I'll handle this myself.”
Li Rou's affectionate face was completely empty; her face was cold.
“Ma'am, what elixir did you just take for me. I feel that my injuries are almost as good.”
Duan Ling got out of bed and stretched her body slightly.
“It was 'Bapin Jin Chuangdan'.”
It turns out that even Li's family in Qingfeng Town only had two of these eight-pin Jinchuangdan, but now they use one on his son, a child with a foreign surname.
Obviously, his wife's status in the Li family is not low.
“Oh my god, the family is still waiting, let's go.”
Li Rou took Duan Ling Tian to the spacious courtyard of the Li family's residence.
This is where the Li family enforces family law. The penal court!
It was noon, and the hot sun was in the air.
The area around the prison was full of people, all children of the Li family watching the lively scene.
In the courtyard, a teenager was tied to Xing Zhu and exposed to the sun. There were still two middle-aged people standing beside him.
The middle-aged man with cockfighting eyes on the right looked angry when he saw Duan Lingtian's mother and son.
“Duan Lingtian is here too... The family's treasured Bapin Jinchuang elixir is really effective!” “Yes, I also saw Duan Lingtian when he was carried back. It was half dead and not alive.”
“Li Xin, too. If you bully Duan Lingtian at will, let go. Elder Jiu doesn't say anything, but this time he actually made such a heavy hand and almost killed Duan Lingtian. It's only strange that Elder Jiu doesn't freak out.”
One by one, the children of the Li family saw Li Rou and Duan Lingtian arrive, whispering.
Li Rou marched to the middle-aged person on the left with Duan Lingtian.
“Elder Jiu, my son Li Xin made a mistake today, but now that you're fine, I've been exposed to the sun all morning. Can I put him down?”
At the moment, the cock-eyed middle-aged man, “Li Kun,” the elder of the Li family, has a hazy face.
Who knows, Li Rou didn't take care of him at all.
Instead, he brought Duan Lingtian to Li Xin, who had been tied up.
“Oh my god, how did he hurt you in the morning; now, you'll pay him back all of his 1510!” CHAPTER 1
When Gu Xijiu woke up, he discovered a fatal problem. Her surroundings have changed and she doesn't know her at all!
Looking out through the gap in the corridor, the moon hangs in the air with bright stars all over the sky, and she is lying on her side and being carried forward by others.
She was a bit flabberish, couldn't help but move, and then discovered an even more fatal problem -- she's naked! Her body was only wrapped in a thin silk quilt, which wrapped her tightly from head to toe, leaving only one pair of eyes open.
Her cold eyes first fell on the two big men looking up at her.
Kong Wu is strong, has strong muscles, and is dressed as a samurai in costume. Even though he is carrying people while walking, he is quiet and silent. At first glance, it looks like he is practicing his family, and his martial arts are not poor.
Gu Xijiu's fingers clenched in the quilt!
She is the king of modern killers. She is ruthless and aggressive. She doesn't expect to run into the mental calculations of the person she trusts the most. That person's name is Long Xi. She is her former instructor and doctor. She doesn't trust anyone; she only trusts him, even likes him, and wants to marry him.
She was already dead; she didn't expect to go to Grandpa Hades for tea; she came here inexplicably.
Naturally, at this point, she didn't think she had arrived at any filming location.
She made it through!
Passing over this body, they were wrapped like rice dumplings and carried to a very luxurious hall.
“Ah... ah... save your life... save your life... ah, ah, don't...” The woman's delicate and painful scream came out in an instant, evoking back Gu Xijiu's thoughts. Her gaze swiftly swooped, slightly curdled! The furnishings inside the main hall are naturally beautiful. Whether it's the rosewood tables and chairs, or the tortoiseshell screens of flowers, birds, and shellfish, they all show two words — luxurious!
The man above had a beautiful appearance. At the age of 278, he had long hair and a blue jade hairpin, scattered randomly over his shoulders, had smooth muscle texture, and was strong and powerful in their movements. He had slightly crooked lips and a hint of a cold smile. He was considered a cool and handsome man.
Below is a young girl. She looks very young and has clear eyebrows. It's different from the expression the man enjoyed. The little girl's face was white, her small mouth was slightly thin, her throat was already hoarse, sobbed, and the cold sweat had soaked her hair. Obviously, the pain had reached the extreme. Gu Xijiu's face changed slightly!
This bastard is strong and the seedlings are strong! Who is he really?
The two big men carried Gu Xijiu in, which didn't bother the man's interest; his movements were faster and more intense!
At last, the little girl couldn't help but stop screaming a few times. Her eyes turned over, her head was crooked, and she couldn't move.
“Clean up!” The man shouted a curse and turned over. Since getting off the girl, he followed the trend and kicked the girl out of bed like he had kicked garbage.
The girl didn't move. Her little face had turned waxy yellow, and blood lines were flowing down the corners of her lips. I don't know if it's dead or alive.
“This is also a bit useless. Carry it to the mass graves to feed the dogs!” The man's tone was full of dissatisfied anger.
Flagstaff, also known as Flagstaff, is a small town in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in northern Arizona on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. It is close to the casino Las Vegas to the west and the famous Colorado Grand Canyon to the east.
The US, Arizona, the Colorado Grand Canyon, and Las Vegas. Many Chinese people have heard these four names, but I don't think many people know about the flagship city wrapped in the middle of these four regions.
Half a year ago, Li Du was one of those “few” until he came to study in Flagship City.
Flagpole City isn't famous at home, nor is it famous in the US, but it does have some good universities, such as the University of Arizona and the American College in Flagstaff.
The name of the school Lee Doo studied at is Flagstaff National College. There is only one word difference between Flagstaff American College, but there is a huge difference between these words!
Flagstaff American College is a branch of the American College. It is a very good private university that provides undergraduate, junior, and preparatory education.
This is a Pheasant University, and Lee Du was completely tricked into graduate school.
As a result, he paid his tuition fees and research funds for the first half year. The school was blocked. The school board of directors and admissions department got news ahead of time and ran away, leaving behind a group of international students who were forced to leave the school by the police.
Li Dou was lucky. Because school accommodation was so messy, he found an apartment to rent in order to study quietly without a dormitory. Now he has a place to stay. Those of his classmates who have paid accommodation fees to stay at school will be wandering around the streets.
However, his situation is not much better than that of his classmates. Now at the end of January, his rent has already expired. If he doesn't pay his rent in time, then he will probably have to go to the streets.
The sad thing is that this means he won't have any money!
Of course, he can borrow money from his parents and classmates at home, but that presupposes that he is studying abroad. Now that the school has been banned, he definitely can't get through as a graduate student. Where else is he looking for his elderly parents to ask for money? As for finding classmates and friends?
Sitting at the entrance of the small building with a sad face, the pinewood door behind Li Du was pushed open, and a blond girl came forward and said, “Hi, Lee, are you here?”
This girl is his landlord, Hannah Fox. The house is an inheritance left by her parents who died in a car accident. It belongs to her and her older brother Hans Fox.
However, Hans claims to be “busy with a big business” and doesn't stay for a few days at the end of the year. The empty bedroom is rented out by Hannah to generate income.
Hearing the greeting, Lee got up and said, “Oh yeah, Hannah, what's wrong?”
The girl shrugged and smiled, and a pear vortex appeared on her beautiful face: “When I was cleaning the refrigerator, I saw a few cans of beer; they must have been left by Hans. I remember you liked wort beer, why don't you drink it?”
She was carrying half a dozen bottles of beer in her hand. It was packaged in a very common wooden box with a very obvious Budweiser logo on it.
Seeing these beers, Li Du also smiled. There is only one small refrigerator in the apartment, and he opens and closes it every day. What kind of beer is inside?
Also, speaking of Ehans' temper, if he had real beer, he definitely wouldn't stay; this guy is addicted to alcohol.
According to his speculations, this beer was bought by Hannah to comfort him. After learning that their school had been blocked, Hannah had already comforted him many times, which made him very moved.
However, Hannah didn't have much of a routine to comfort him; she either gave him an inspirational book or a beer.
This American girl once asked him to learn about Chinese culture and learned the expression “get rid of a thousand worries”. She thought that, according to the Chinese personality, a drunken night would relieve her worries, so she gave him beer several times.
Lee Dooh accepted Hannah's kindness and owed this girl alone. In American social networking, there are gifts you can't refuse; otherwise, you'll be mistaken to reject friendship. He cherishes his friendship with Hannah.
He took the wooden box, and Hannah left with a smile. Before leaving, she said, “There are many problems in life, but it's still beautiful.”
After reading this American slang a few times, Lee Doo opened the package and wanted to take out a can of beer. But as soon as he unpacked the wooden box, a crystal that looked like amber suddenly fell out and fell to the ground with a “click” sound.
This crystal was about the size of his thumb's stomach. It fell quite heavily on the concrete floor, and there were a few cracks on it.
The reason I'm guessing it's amber is because it's light yellow in color, and the bread is wrapped in a small bug. It's very similar to the amber he saw when he was in the sixth grade of elementary school. At that time, their textbook had a text called “Amber,” and the language teacher brought them a piece of amber when they were in class.
This crystal reminded him of some good times in his childhood. He remembers that his teacher said at the time that amber with bugs was very precious. Unfortunately, this one has already cracked, which made him very sorry; otherwise, if he sold it, he wouldn't be able to exchange it for two months' living expenses.
The crystal had fallen very badly; it had already shattered when he picked it up, and the small purple bug wrapped in it came out.
The little bug looks like a locust. It is about two centimeters long. It has a strange appearance, with eyes like a locust, but it only has two legs under its stomach, strange lines on its legs, and no wings on its back, so it looks very clumsy.
Li Du had never seen this kind of bug. Strangely held it up and wanted to see it clearly.
Just then, something strange happened: the bug's claws suddenly moved a bit, then quickly regained his vitality, wiggling his body away from his fingers.
He didn't respond yet. After the bug jumped to his palm, his head drooped down, and slowly, little by little, it got into his palm!
Lee is scared to pee. She really wants to pee!
As soon as he screamed, he crashed into the house and shouted, “Hannah, call 911! Help, a bug got into my hands!”
I think his screaming was too loud, and Hannah had a panicked expression when she came out: “What? What kind of bug?”
Li Du spread out her hands and showed her, “This is it, this bug in my palm!”
Hannah's face was at a loss: “A bug in your palm? Where do you have bugs in your palm?”
Not only is there a bug, but this bug is still moving. After it burrows into Li Du's palm, it doesn't seem to be willing to be lonely. This will burrow out again, and half of the body will come out.
Li Du pointed to the bug that was burrowing out and said in horror, “This, just this, purple locusts, can't you see them?”
Lee Doo interrupted her and exclaimed, “I know what you mean, you think I'm crazy! But I'm not crazy, Hannah!”
“Shett, this bug has come out again!”
Just as he was hissing and screaming, the little bug slowly drilled out of his skin and jumped to the ground, supported his upper body with both legs, and walked up on the ground with his legs like a human.
It just so happened that next to it landed on the ground was a drain. The bugs didn't pay attention to walking past, so they planted them all at once.
Seeing this, Lee Du-joyed and said, “Great, the bug fell down the drain.”
Subconsciously, he had an idea in his mind, that is, what is in the drain? Will there be sewage and drown this bug?
However, something unbelievable happened to him!
CHAPTER I
The land of Shenzhou, the Northern Desert.
Ice and snow ravaged the entire land. The reckless mountains and ravines were all wrapped in plain silver. The heavy snow fell, and the sky and earth were all in full color from afar.
On the Wanwan Mountain Road, a caravan was resting. The wind and snow were so heavy that it was difficult for horse-drawn carriages to walk, so they had to wait until the wind and snow were less before going on the road.
“Look, the man who pulls the coffin!”
The cries of a middle-aged man caught the attention of everyone in the caravan. A group of people looked up and looked into the distance with curiosity. They only looked a few times; they were all shocked physically and mentally!
The wind and snow were whistling all over the sky, and heaven and earth became bewildered. A mysterious ancient gold coffin looms in the distance, gradually appearing in the eyes of the crowd.
The ancient gold coffin was two meters long, one meter wide and one meter high. The coffin was engraved with quaint patterns and runes. The pattern rune emits a faint light, isolating all the falling snowflakes from the outside, which is extremely strange.
Another thing that stunned everyone was the person pulling the coffin in front of the ancient coffin.
It was a teenager who looked like he was only 145 years old. Bare with his upper body and bowed back, he grasped two giant chains of cold iron with his hands, carried the chains on his shoulders, and was struggling to pull the ancient coffin forward step by step.
Ice and snow, young people pull the coffin!
This image is extremely visually impactful and captivating. The glimmer from the back of the ancient golden coffin reflected the young man's body in a somewhat blurry manner, making it difficult to see his face clearly. In the trance, the crowd seemed to have seen a god pull the coffin.
“This young man was born with magical powers.”
The middle-aged man shouted again. Many people looked back and carefully looked at the teenager to make sure that none of his dark light shone on his body, and were once again moved.
An ordinary willow casket weighs 3,400 kg. The entire body of this ancient coffin is cast in gold; needless to say, it is at least 3 kg.
If a teenager has no power, then he's not a real warrior; even a strong man only has 5,600 pounds of strength. A young man can pull a three-kilogram old coffin. Although it seems a bit difficult, it's shocking enough.
“At a young age and quite handsome, he actually pulled a coffin. Does this teenager want to be unlucky for the rest of his life?”
An old man was moved, and many people nodded in agreement. Although it is not common to pull a coffin, it has happened occasionally in the history of the Northern Desert. Everyone knows a bit about it.
There are important members of the Northern Desert family who like to be buried in giant gold coffins after they have died. Instead of being buried under the ground, these giant coffins are placed at the top of an iceberg, which is said to protect the people of the Chinese people.
When the family declines or undergoes major changes, the family will hold a casket festival to find a new iceberg to transfer the family's ancestral coffins, replace Feng Shui, and restore the family's welfare.
This led to the appearance of people pulling coffins.
Pulling a coffin is harmful to air transport. In the minds of many people in the northern desert, when pulling a coffin, their own air transport will be absorbed by the corpse in the coffin, and the body's sperm and health will also be absorbed, causing them to be unlucky or sick for the rest of their lives.
Therefore, coffin pulling is the most humble occupation in the North Desert. Even if the commissions are high, young warriors won't be moved; only frustrated old warriors will pull coffins.
Peugeot is a teenager with facial features. He is about 1 meter 75 tall, has broad shoulders and narrow hips, slender legs, and tight muscles. Wearing a quaint animal tooth around his neck, he looks very wild, which is pretty good in terms of appearance alone.
He is 145 years old, good-looking, and has terrifying powers. The conditions for a teenager are not bad. But here to do the most despicable and vile job of pulling a coffin?
“He's not afraid of being robbed of air transport. His longevity has been drastically reduced. Unlucky for the rest of his life?” The middle-aged man stared at the ancient golden coffin and swiped a few eyes and said with relief, “This looks like the Liu family's ancestral coffin? That's right, I've heard that the Liu family has recently experienced major changes, and they are offering sky-high prices.”
“Shut up, people from the Liu family are here.” An old man suddenly said that everyone in the caravan quickly shut up and looked into the distance.
woohoo!
There was a howling of wild beasts from afar, and a team of warriors wearing black armor and riding a silver giant wolf rushed in. The ferocious atmosphere of the giant wolf fluttered before they even got close to the giant wolf.
“The Silver Wolf Guards are certainly the warriors of the Liu family.”
The crowd nodded secretly. The entire area around Wuling City was a thousand miles away. There was only one army riding the Silver Wolf. It was the Liu family's strongest Silver Wolf Guard.
The Silver Wolf Guards stopped after catching up with the teenager. A middle-aged giant at the front, with a long whip, looked at the teenager and drank coldly: “Lu Li, go faster! If you don't get to Black Hawk Ridge before dark, you won't be paid.”
The teenager known as Lu Li looked up and was surrounded by a dozen giant silver wolves one meter tall and two meters long. He didn't have much fear. He nodded his head and said, “Don't worry, I'll be there before dark.”
The giant drank and rushed off with the Silver Wolf Guards, and soon disappeared into the vast mountains in the distance.
Lu Li glanced at the nearby caravan and continued to move forward silently pulling the coffin. He grabbed the giant chain of cold iron with both hands and carried it on his shoulders and struggled to move forward. Every step he took was extremely difficult, and his muscles trembled all over his body. Despite this, he didn't stop, and he quickly crossed the caravan and walked far away.
“It's really heavy!”
After walking a few miles, after climbing a steep slope, Lu Li stopped. He was exhausted and out of breath, and the cold weather was hot and sweaty. You can imagine his physical exertion.
He wanted to take a break. After placing the ancient coffin, he sat on a stone to remove clean water and dried meat from the sack behind him, and chewed and swallowed it in large sips to refuel his strength.
We should be able to get there before dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat and looking at the sky, his eyes soon brightened. He said to himself, “If you pull a coffin, you can exchange it for an elixir. I don't know if the Liu family's Chun Tidan is just like the legend. Can one slice add 500 kg of strength?”
“If I could actually increase my strength by 500 kg, I now have 3 kg of strength. I only need to pull a dozen coffins to reach 10,000 kg of strength, so I can... awaken my blood veins!”
“Look, who in the tribe dares to bully my sister? Hehe, I'll be able to have a great life with my sister soon.”
Thinking about this, Lu Li's tired face shone with glory. He quickly got up and pulled up the coffin and moved forward. This time, his footsteps were even more steady and fast.
Shut up!
After walking for several miles, there was a sound coming from behind. Lu Li looked back. His face was slightly bleak.
There was also an old man in the back, but an old man. The old man clutched the chain with white light on his hand, and there was also a faint white light flowing through his foot.
Lu Li muttered with envy that Bai Guang is the power unique to warriors. The strength of warriors with Xuanli will increase a lot. This old man used Xuanli to walk like fly and pull the ancient coffin easily.
The old man caught up with Lu Li. He glanced and said, “Young man, why are you pulling a coffin? This will damage the air transport.”
Lu Li smiled slightly and didn't say anything. The old man looked at him a few times and stopped saying much and quickly pulled the coffin away.
“If you can't awaken your blood veins anymore, then what future do you have to say? The only thing I have in my life is mediocre and busy, being bullied every day, and my sister has suffered along with her.”
“No, this isn't the life I want!”
Thinking about this, Lu Li's face became somewhat distorted. He yelled, gnawed his teeth and quickly pulled the coffin forward.
The wind and snow grew bigger, the sky gradually became dim, and the glimmer of light emanating from the ancient golden coffin in the vast mountain road seemed extremely strange and mysterious.
Chapter 001
“My brother is looking for a job. You have a good writing job at home. This is ten yuan. Don't forget to go out and buy something to eat at noon.”
In front of a low cabin in the ghetto in the ghetto, Lu Li patted Little Loli on the head and rubbed her with pity. It was great to see her sister alive and healthy!
“Brother, I know,” Little Loli complained, “Don't rub my hair; it's all messed up by you.”
Her younger sister Lu Xin was very considerate in helping Lu Li tidy up her clothes and advised, “You have to work hard. My brother can bear such hardships. I believe he will definitely be able to find a job this time.”
“Don't worry, my brother will definitely find a good job and earn lots and lots of money,” Lu Li hugged her sister and secretly added in her heart, and she wouldn't just watch you lose your life little by little because you didn't have any money.
“When Shin Shin grows up, she will also earn a lot, a lot of money,” Little Loli shook Lu Li's arms, waving her little fist, vowing.
No matter how reluctant, Lu Li said goodbye to her sister.
Getting on the bus, he slurped his pocket hand and couldn't help but laugh bitterly.
The money I just gave my sister for lunch is back in my pocket. I should have expected this little girl to do this. It's really saddening how well-behaved.
Now is the 23rd century. Technology is infinitely advanced, and all kinds of intelligent technology fill every corner of the world. This kind of development has brought rapid progress to people's lives, but incidentally, it has also reduced manpower requirements to a minimum.
It's not unusual to be unemployed, especially for people at the bottom of society like Lu Li. Finding a stable job is nothing but a luxury.
If there were no accidents, he would continue to be unemployed.
It didn't become stable until he joined a game union by chance, but since he joined the game called “Dawn,” the game had been open for almost a year and was far behind in rank, so he hasn't been able to rank among the top players.
Two more years later, her younger sister Lu Xin was found seriously ill during a medical examination at school.
Having no money to pay for treatment of up to millions of dollars, he was also hunted down by several trade unions during that time in the game, only to painfully watch his only loved one get weaker day by day.
The taste was even worse than cutting meat with a knife. Lu Li lost her voice crying while holding her sister on more than one occasion.
However, fate took a turn. On the day she received her critical illness notice, Lu Li cried for a while and then slept in front of her sister's hospital bed. When she woke up, she discovered that she had been reborn until three years ago.
While he is happy that his sister is still healthy, he knows that he must make money, earn a lot, a lot of money.
If you have money, you can cure your sister's illness as soon as possible, and only with money can your younger sister live the happy life that a naive and cute little girl should live like her countless peers.
You can only raise your eyebrows when you have money; you're not inferior to others at any time!
After all, Lu Li had no choice but to discover that even after being reborn, it's not easy to become a rich person.
Seems like the only thing he can do is play the game — “Dawn,” which he has been playing for over two years — now there are only a few days left until the game opens.
Lu Li has given up on looking for a serious job. He came out today and went directly to the headquarters of the Xingyue Trade Union where he served in his past life.
The Star Moon Trade Union is not one of the top ten gamers, nor the top four in China. It is just a gaming league made up of a group of university students. The heads of the trade union are all rich second-generation rich people. Because they are willing to spend money, the development is similar.
The Qinghu Community, located next to the university town, is one of the most beautiful places of this generation. It is surrounded by mountains and water, and is full of cherry blossoms. There are office buildings in front, and a villa area in the back. Only people with great financial resources can set up a company here.
The beautiful woman at the front desk took a look at Lu Li's clothes in disgust, called a string of numbers, and then informed Lu Li that she could go in for an interview.
“We are currently only recruiting for the Expendables, no more money players.” The person in charge of recruiting is a girl, dressed in a very trendy manner, applying nail polish while not lifting her head for the interview.
The so-called Expendables are actually cannon fodder; it's normal for them to die a dozen times a day.
The reason Lu Li wanted to find a studio to join was to use the studio's gaming helmet for free. Although the money scoundrel has no future, at least it can be upgraded. Upgrading difficult cannonfire is bound not what he wants; death in the game will cause him to lose experience.
“What, 20 gold!” The nail polish was applied to her face all of a sudden, and the girl screamed like a cat being trampled on.
Although “Dawn” represents today's most advanced virtual technology and has the best design team in the world, it's not confident enough to dare to go public without having to go on the inside. It's just that the test content is relatively small, and it's a decentralized test, so it doesn't have an impact on normal games.
After just a few days of testing, players were most impressed by the fact that coins weren't easy to play, and there were too many places to spend money.
Players who play normal games can't make ends meet in the early stages, and experienced moneylders can't save a few coins in a day.
Some veteran professional players estimate that if they want to save enough 20 dollars to set up a trade union, a hundred-person gold group to brush off the right monsters and remove equipment and potion consumption, it would take at least a week or more. This was a situation where the money explosion rate was high before the game's third system update.
And the kid in front of me actually promised to pay out 20 gold within a week!
20 gold, but that's 20,000 copper coins.
“Have you participated in Insider? Have you found any money-swiping bugs?” Her heart moved when she was recruiting a beautiful woman, and she asked with hesitation.
Lu Li laughed without saying a word, and seemed extremely unfathomable.
“Aojian, I have something wrong with me here... Well, someone is applying for a job as a moneylender and says they can pay 20 dollars within a week. I doubt he has a bug of swiping money.” There's no way to recruit beautiful women; they can only whisper and call senior management.
It wasn't long before I heard a rush of footsteps. When I turned my head and looked, Lu Li was a bit surprised.
In addition to the arrogant boss of Xingyue, the people who came here actually followed several people. Lu Li lived in the Xingyue Trade Union for two years. Most of these people knew each other; they were all senior members of the trade union.
“Huh, don't tell me, it's this kid who can get 20 dollars in a week,” the little guy walking beside Aojian couldn't help but cry. The game is called Half Tobacco. He's the head of a gang of thieves from the Starmoon Trade Union. He's a very grumpy person.
“How can you get 20 coins in a week, sure it's a game called “Dawn”?” Aojian's face isn't very good-looking either. Originally, he had a glimmer of hope, but when he saw Lu Li, this glimmer of hope was gone.
Lu Li has an average appearance, a waxy, dark face, and wrinkled clothes on the corners. There are obvious signs of wear and tear on the corners. You can tell at first glance that he is the kind of person who rolls around at the bottom of society.
“There's no proof of speaking, even if they don't get you, there's not much to lose, is it?” Faced with a huge atmosphere and a crowd of social elites, Lu Li didn't have the guts of lower-level people at all; she only smiled faintly. Her calm gaze seemed full of endless confidence.
CHAPTER I
“Ye Mo, Ye Mo, are you all right? Hurry up, class is coming soon. This lesson is ruthless; get up quickly.” A somewhat hasty voice sounded in Yemo's ear. Ye Mo had a very strange feeling.
“This idiot has probably been seen without a face; he has covered his face.” Another sound sounded in his ear, but then Ye Mo woke up.
Ye Mo looked around in a bit of a daze. None of them knew; they were all strange faces.
Seeing Ye Mo's dazed look, there was another burst of laughter. It was obvious that all the laughter here was directed at him. Seeing that the people around him laughing seemed to be mocking him. For a moment, he was afraid to ask questions; he was only secretly on guard to prevent anyone from taking action against him.
After watching the classmate sitting next to him, it seemed like he was the only one who didn't mock himself; he just kindly pushed himself to wake up.
“How is it like an academy?” Ye Mo asked subconsciously, somewhat surprised.
“Haha...” came with another burst of laughter.
“Ye Mo, I think you're out of breath. Can Yan Yan write love letters at will? You're fine with the Ye family; now you're not part of the Ye family; be careful later.”
The same table sighed. Naturally, I didn't believe that Ye Mo wouldn't remember for a while; he just loved his face. He hasn't understood the reality yet; he's not the Ye family's Ye Mo anymore.
Ye Mo's first burst of pain. He remembers that he and his master Luo Ying were refining and returning to Yuantan. Later, there were explosions and all kinds of murderous sounds. He remembers that Master used a secret charm while holding himself in the back, but how did he show up here? Is this still the mainland of Luoyue?
Right, I'm sitting here now, what about Master? Master was only three years older than him, not to mention that the reason why Xiliumen suddenly attacked them was because Master was so beautiful that the young master of Siriumen wanted to marry his beautiful master, something that only happened after Master was rejected by Master.
If Master falls into the hands of Xiliumen, the consequences are unimaginable. Thinking about this, Ye Mo couldn't help but panic in her heart and suddenly stood up.
“What happened, don't you know the class bell rings?” A young woman with a cold face walked up to the podium with a few books in between, and coldly glanced at the students who laughed out loud. The laughter soon abated.
Everyone knows that this is Yun Bing, an English class instructor. What she hates the most is that the students get upset, and once she catches her eye, there's definitely no good fruit to eat. Ye Mo already feels something is wrong. Although he can understand these words, the obvious language isn't what he originally used. Isn't this mainland Logue anymore? Frowning, Ye Mo wanted to know more clearly. A burst of headache came and a lot of messy information was memorized.
However, Ye Mo was completely evicted from the Ye family after her father's death, specifically because Ye Mo was not a type of Ip Wentian. More accurately, after the death of Yemo's father, Yemo's lineage was re-tested and determined not to be a member of the Ye family; only then did he get evicted from Yemen.
However, he also has a younger sister, Ye Ling, and a younger brother, Ye Zifeng. It's just that he and I aren't the same mother; they are brothers and sisters of the same father and sister. Three years ago, his father seemed to know that he was indebted to Ye Mo. He deliberately proposed a marriage with the Ye family's grandpa. Ye Tianwen probably knew that he wasn't doing well, so he wanted to help Ye Mo find a backer. Only then did he find Ning's family in Beijing.
Of course, the Ning family is extremely willing to be able to marry the Ye family, one of the top five families in China. Ning Qingxue, Grandpa Ning's granddaughter, was given to Ye Mo.
During a medical examination at the hospital, Ye Mo was found to be impotent. To put it bluntly, he was just inhumane. Although the Ye family wanted to work hard to hide the truth, it seemed like everyone in Beijing knew overnight. The Ye family, one of the five largest families in China, developed impotence, and the Ye family was also quite humiliated.
“Ah...” The memory was turned over here, and Ye Mo screamed, stood up, and almost immediately took off her pants to take a look. He already understood that he might have been reborn as a person also named Yemo, but he is actually inhumane; this is better than killing him.
“That classmate, what is your name, what do you shout at during class, go to my office after class.” The beautiful teacher who was giving the lecture was interrupted by Ye Mo's screams. Her face was very unattractive.
The rest of the students in the class are all secretly funny. They let a college student go to the office at every turn. It's probably only this English teacher who can do it. It's not OK if they don't go; the credits are in their hands.
Ye Mo sat down in despair. Although he didn't really understand the inside story of the family struggle, he also knew that he was probably kicked out of the Ye family because of his impotence, not necessarily because he wasn't a member of the Ye family; furthermore, who knew about his actions during the DNA test.
What Ye Mo is worried about is not being evicted from the Ye family; he doesn't care about this at all; what he is concerned about is his impotence. Also, what happened to his master Luo Ying.
However, he also understood why his classmates were laughing because his predecessor had clearly been evicted from the Ye family and was paranoid in his pursuit of Yan Yan, the hottest girl in the class. As a result, they posted their confessions and love letters on the blackboard, then stood on the podium and looked at themselves with contempt and said, “Grandpa Ye, can you go to bed with me?”
Later, after the impotence incident came to light, he wanted to find a girlfriend because he was ashamed to want face, but what he didn't expect was that the girl who was originally very shy actually treated him like this. Only then did he faint and cheapen his rebirth.
I was actually reborn in a place like this. He couldn't understand a single word from the beautiful teacher's lesson on the podium; he just understood it, and Ye Mo wouldn't listen to it. He definitely couldn't accept the impotence that he is now. Instead of being born again, it's better not to be born again.
It doesn't matter if you don't go to college; the most important thing is to find out about your current situation. His impotence is related to the Ye family's reputation. Although he was kicked out of the Ye family, who knows if he will suddenly be killed? Maybe there were other insiders that caused him to be evicted from the Ye family. Is his safety still guaranteed now?
After the bell rang after class, of course, Ye Mo's first thing was not to go to the beautiful teacher's place, but to rush out of school. He wanted to find a place to see if his little one was really impotent.
Fortunately, there weren't many other things next to Ninghai University, but there were quite a few small alleys. Ye Mo hurriedly ran into a remote and uninhabited alley and quickly pulled down her pants.
It's true that Xiao** is very small, but Ye Mo wasn't completely disappointed because of Xia**, but rather had a really long voice. It's not that he's impotent, but because the small** is too big and his development is blocked by a meridian, causing this false impotence situation.
However, it is certainly an idiot's dream when technology on Earth wants to open up this blocked meridian of his, but this is unmistakable. Although he doesn't yet have the ability to open the blocked meridian veins and make his little one strong, as soon as he reaches the third level of exercise, this meridian will automatically be flushed out.
It's just that Ye Mo immediately began to feel a bit disappointed again, because with the Earth's atmosphere so thin, trying to practice to the third level of gas training is certainly a difficult task. Maybe he won't be able to achieve it for the rest of his life. In that case, he's still tantamount to impotence. Sighing, Ye Mo wanted to pull up his pants, but suddenly a scream made him excited.
“Hooligans...” An absolutely high-decibel soprano sounded in front of Ye Mo. Just now, Ye Mo only wanted to check her litter**, but she actually forgot to check what was going on around her. I didn't expect this small alley to still be connected; it's just that I can't see it at the turning point in front of me.
Ye Mo isn't an exhibitionist; moreover, he doesn't have any capital to reveal right now; he quickly pulls up his pants and has to slip away.
“Why are you, Ye Mo?” After this woman screamed, she actually asked in a surprised tone again. Obviously, she knew Ye Mo.
CHAPTER 1
Quiet in the middle of the night, Qingzhu Premium Neighborhood in Gimhae City.
Shi Feng sat quietly on the soft leather sofa, with a stack of documents in his hand, and looked at the pool outside the floor-to-ceiling window, full of loss and displeasure.
As the leader of Ghost, one of the top four game studios in Gimhae City, he heads the Grand Guild of tens of thousands of people, and is also a famous master sword magician in Gimhae City, but now he can only sit at home and drink to relieve his worries.
A ten-year gaming career.
Ten years of bloodshed.
After experiencing countless pains and tribulations, he finally led the Ghost Guild to establish the top ten city-states in “Sacred Realm.” When they could begin to compete with top guilds and enjoy endless glory, every document became a thing of the past, and never went back.
Shi Feng never expected that his ten years of hard work would be in vain. He gave up so much for the game, but ended up being someone else's wedding dress. All because he opposed Ghost's integration into the Super Guild to dominate the world. The Lanhua Foundation gave him an answer less than the next day, deleting his 200-level Sword King account, which he had spent ten years of painstaking work on, and settling his salary at the finance department.
All he can get is 5 million credits and a mansion. Compared to the top ten city-states founded, the fictional kingdom of Nichijingjin is less than a dime.
Shi Feng thought that he had paid so much for Ghost and turned the Lanhua Group into a large consortium. The result was like throwing away garbage. He lost him. He would definitely retaliate against what the Lanhua Foundation had done.
“I would never just do that; it's no big deal to start again.”
Confidence and determination flashed in his eyes. The cancellation documents in his hand were torn to shatter. Immediately, he picked up a bottle of red wine on the table and suddenly poured a few sips.
Even without a Sword King account and team support, the technology and knowledge in the game won't betray him. As long as technology is still there, it can rise in the sanctuary and establish a virtual kingdom of one's own again.
Early in the morning, the sun had just risen.
DiDi Di Di!
The phone keeps ringing.
Dissatisfied with being woken up, Shi Feng had no choice but to get up and pick up his bedside phone. He had a hangover from last night and is still dizzy.
“Hey, what's wrong?”
“Brother Feng, I'm Kuroko, what else are you asking? We said we want to be professional players, but today is the day that Ghost Studio recruits people at school. Haven't you always wanted to be a core member of Ghost?”
Shi Feng is a bit confused.
I've just been fired from the Lanhua Foundation, how can I go to the Ghost Test. “Brother Feng, Brother Feng?
Are you listening? They have to test it at 10 o'clock; if you don't come back soon, it will be too late!”
“Kuroko, don't joke, I just got fired by Ghost.”
“Brother Feng, how much did you drink yesterday? You haven't woken up until now. Ghost hasn't recruited anyone yet, why did you get fired? OK, come on soon.”
Shi Feng didn't respond yet, so Kuroko hung up the phone.
Shi Feng, with a drowsy head, looked at his phone and found that this shabby Aiman6 wasn't his phone at all; his phone was the latest Aimad 12.
Then take a look around. The small bedroom of less than 15 square meters was cluttered with books on game guides and a laptop on the corner desk. It was also a very backward old model. There were many clothes scattered in the large closet by the wall, and a familiar face appeared in the fitting mirror of the large closet.
Shi Feng was suddenly shocked when he saw this extremely familiar face.
Shi Feng immediately got up and walked to the fitting mirror. After taking more pictures, he determined that he had really become younger.
I slept in a spacious and luxurious bedroom yesterday. Now that I wake up, I'm in this broken place, and I'm still young.
Shi Feng still has some memories of this place. It was ten years ago. I stayed in a small house for over half a year in order to fight in the Shinto Kingdom. After earning some money in the Shinto realm, I went to rent a big apartment in the city.
I think back then, it was extremely difficult. The situation at home was not good. In order for him to go to college, he still owes a lot of foreign debt. In this way, his parents still worked hard every month to earn money and send enough living expenses to make themselves suffer.
Shi Feng wanted to make money and change his family situation, but college students were all over the streets. They wanted to find a job with a good income, so he thought of the most profitable virtual game. In order to improve his gaming skills, he relentlessly bought a virtual helmet. He became a professional player and worked hard at his skills in virtual games.
At that time, he ate white bread and instant noodles every day. In order to save money, his class never attended every reunion or social gathering with his classmates. The boys looked down. The girls looked down. Every time they went to the supermarket to buy instant noodles, there were less than 10 credits in his wallet. She didn't even dare to buy ham sausage with one credit point. The saleswoman looked pitifully at Shi Feng and refused to recommend the discounted ham. Shi Feng looked at the attractive ham and touched her wallet again, but she still bit her teeth.
“Who's kidding me?”
Seeing the familiar scene and his young self in the mirror, Shi Feng couldn't help but shake his head and deny this idea.
Even America, which is the most developed, doesn't have this kind of technology to return to old age. Who would joke with a frustrated uncle.
Shi Feng looked at the time on his phone again.
2129/4/19
“Am I born again?” Shi Feng had a bitter smile on his face and made a joke.
He remembers that today is August 5, 2139; it's impossible that he's still in his senior year in April 2129.
Shi Feng shook his head and wanted to be sober, but he still had a glimmer of anticipation in his heart, hoping that he would be born again. He actually went back to ten years ago, so he walked to his computer desk and turned on his laptop.
If the time on the phone can be falsified, then the news on the internet can't be falsified.
After being online for a few minutes.
Shi Feng was completely shocked. All the information he searched on the internet showed that today is indeed April 19, 2129. Even the official opening hours of the world's popular sanctuary are clearly written on the official website. The countdown is April 25, six days from now.
“Am I really back ten years ago?” Shi Feng stared deathly at the news reports in the sacred realm, leaving tears of excitement in the corners of his eyes.
Shi Feng's mood at this time is indescribable; there are regrets, grief, and joy.
It was as if everything in front of me was a dream.
However, the sound of cicadas outside the window and the air conditioner blowing from the air conditioner reminded Shi Feng that all of this was true.
Looking at the group photo of their family in college on her phone, Shi Feng never noticed that her father had white hair and that her mother also had wrinkles in the corners of her eyes. They were really old, not as energetic as they used to be.
When he noticed that his parents were old, it was a year and a half after the opening of the sanctuary. The high debt, excessive work, and pressure left them all seriously ill. If they wanted to be cured and recovered, they needed millions of credits. However, at the time, Shi Feng was only a squad leader of the ghost, and the money they earned couldn't pay such expensive expenses at all.
Shi Feng tried everything he could to raise money, but unfortunately it wasn't enough. Even though Shi Feng did everything he could to maintain it, his parents left a few months later.
Who knows the pain and regrets that he didn't take good care of his parents in the last generation?
Even though Shi Feng earned millions of credits later, this became an eternal pain in Shi Feng's heart.
I didn't expect fate to tell him this kind of joke; it actually started from scratch and everything went back to square one.
“OK, great, hahaha. Now that I'm born again, I need to change all of this, earn enough money to cure my parents' illnesses, and not let them work hard for a living.” Shi Feng wiped the tears from the corners of his eyes and secretly swore.
Just as Shi Feng was planning her future, Kuroko made another phone call, constantly urging Shi Feng to go to the university for an examination.
However, Seok-feng didn't go to Gimhae University until he got dressed and packed himself up.
He couldn't be more familiar with ghosts.
I remember when he was in college, Lan Hailong, the grandson of Lanhua Group, opened Ghost Studio and also provided a large amount of money to organize expert students from Gimhae University to compete in the Online Art Online. At that time, he also went to the examination and became a core member. Kuroko became an outsider member. At that time, he was happy for a long time.
Three years later, Ghost Studio came under his leadership. The Lanhua Group made a huge profit in the realm of God and quickly became a large consortium. Unexpectedly, in the end, they were expelled by Lan Hailong himself.
Now that he has been reborn, he also has an advantage over the sacred realm that no one else can match. Naturally, he is not ready to join Ghost, become someone else's tool, and make money for others. He has to follow a different path, fight for his own life, stop having his parents pay living expenses, and pay off all of his debts, so he wants to start a business, start his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and live a good life.
Before Shi Feng arrived at School Building No. 1, he saw a thin, dark-skinned young man walking back and forth at the gate. He was extremely anxious. This is a dark person.
“Brother Feng, you've finally arrived. Fortunately, there's no registration deadline. Let's go in and sign up.” When Kuroko saw Sekiho, she spoke anxiously.
Shi Feng shook his head and said very seriously, “Kuroko, I'm not going to Ghost. I want to open my own studio. Are you coming?”
I met Kuroko in a virtual game. The technology was very good. They later broke into the world together. It can be said that during the days they worked with Ghost, although Kuroko had no gaming ability, the management was very strong and managed by hundreds of thousands of people in the guild in an orderly manner. With Kuroko's help, he would go one step further in achieving his goals, but he would follow Kuroko's choice. After all, he has nothing now, and Kuroko's family situation is not good. He decided to become a professional player and join Ghost to earn living expenses.
It was more than a minute before Kuroko looked up at Stone Peak.
“Brother Feng, don't be silly, do you know how much a virtual helmet costs? That's 8,000 credits. To open a studio, you need at least six people. You also need a place to work, pay wages, etc. Just starting capital is 780,000, and there are follow-up investments. That's quite a bit of money, but do you have that much money now?” Kuroko knows Shi Feng's situation very well. She knows that Shi Feng's family situation is not good, and wants to persuade Shi Feng to give up on this crazy idea.
“You're right, I don't even have the money to buy a Shenji virtual helmet right now.” Shi Feng nodded silently and admitted that, as Kuroko said, even 780,000 was too little. I remember that the 100-person studio Lan Feilong recruited spent more than 5 million dollars. Later, they spent a lot more than 5 million to improve the quality and strength of the studio.
“If that's the case, why are we going on an adventure. Going to Ghosts isn't more stable. At least Ghosts can provide virtual helmets; otherwise, we wouldn't even be able to play, let alone become professional players.” Kuroko saw that Shi Feng understood the crux of the problem. She immediately breathed a sigh of relief, so she pulled Shi Feng into the school building.
Shi Feng shook off Kuroko's hand and looked at Kuroko seriously. She looked extremely serious and said, “But I'm still planning to open my own studio. I don't want to be controlled. Are you coming, Kuroko?”
Shi Feng won't force Kuroko. After all, he doesn't have any guarantees, and it's impossible to tell the secret that he is a reborn person; he just hopes Kuroko can trust him.
When Kuroko sees Shi Feng's serious expression, she always feels that today's Shi Feng is so strange. It's so crazy. It's impossible to make money in the early stages of virtual games. Everyone knows this. Is there any way for Shi Feng to make money in the sacred realm? Even after a few months of making money, they don't have that much time to waste.
Kuroko hesitated for half a day, gnawed her teeth, and finally agreed, “I know, who made you the big brother, I just opened a studio with you, but what about the virtual helmet? We can't play games without a helmet?”
Shi Feng's tight brow immediately loosened. He happily patted Kuroko on the shoulder and laughed, “This is my good brother. Don't worry about the virtual helmet. I remember that there is a trial discount for college students. Every university has places to distribute them. As long as you have a student ID, you can get a free trial of the virtual helmet for 10 days. Let's go check it out.”
At this point, Kuroko's dark face turned blue, and she felt that the future was dark. Why did she trust Shi Feng? Is it Shi Feng's kind of confidence and stability? Is it really OK to start a business with Shi Feng?
What can you do in the Sacred Realm in 10 days?
Ten days have passed, and they will definitely miss a good time for the studios to recruit people. At the end of the day, they don't want to buy a virtual helmet, but how did the money come from?
If you want to earn 16,000 credits in the 10 days you open the sanctuary, even a group of pro players won't be able to do it!
“Leave the money problem to me.”
Shi Feng patted Kuroko on the shoulder, showing a confident smile.
Earning 16,000 credits in 10 days is whimsical, but he has the spirit of being a reborn person, and no matter what difficulties he faces, he will break it down one by one. And the opening of the Sacred Realm was the beginning of his rise.
Afterwards, Shi Feng took Kuroko to pick up a trial helmet, bought instant noodles with all the money and placed them on the computer desk in the rental room. Two full boxes were enough for meals for more than ten days. Afterwards, he explained some things about the sacred realm, and waited quietly for the opening of the sacred realm.
At 9 p.m. on April 25, a few glimmer of light flashed in the quiet, dark cottage.
Shi Feng lay still on the bed. As soon as his eyes were closed, he gently clicked the helmet's start button.
“Art Online, here I am.”
I can't tell what kind of sound this is. Hearing it in my ears seems like it can penetrate the body and rush into the soul, so I can't help but feel a bit upset in this cold, snowy night.
The bleak northerly wind whistled through the sky, and white snow fluttered with the wind, shattering the fragmentation of the sky, spreading layer by layer over the earth. Seen from afar, as if wrapped in plain silver, the whole place was desolated.
It wasn't late at night; it was just dusk, but the darkness of the sky was just like the dark night, giving people a heavy feeling. It felt like they were overwhelmed and out of breath. On the silver ground, you can see a huge outline. It's a majestic castle pool, as if a behemoth is looming.
At the center of the castle pond, there is a tall tower shaped like a seven-horned tower, completely dark, standing majestically in the middle of the storm. The whining wind blowing through the altar was mixed with the sound of Karakara, scattered into the distance, with its original roughness, which had a different charm.
The hoarse murmuring sound floated from that altar in the wind and snow, seemed to blend in with that wind; it was vaguely indistinguishable.
“If there is hope, then where is the hope; if there is no hope, why do I see it! !” The sound was insane, almost hysterical, and roared for nine days.
At the bottom of the altar, there are countless figures wearing coats standing there silently. Seen from afar, there are definitely hundreds of thousands of them, men and women. Surrounding the altar, there is a lot of clutter. They don't move, yet there is fanaticism. Just like the people on the altar say a word, they can pay everything for it.
The snow is bigger.
“Since you let me see it, there must be hope, but hope... where!” The hoarse voice on the altar was bitter, filled with sorrow, and didn't go away for a long time.
“Today's Ming and Huang made a mistake, the land was cleared by the Three Terraces, the snow and wind blew. Once made in ancient times, the old man would have to be reckoned with the sky again!” The sound suddenly grew louder, and I didn't know what method was used, but I saw the sky change in color. The countless falling snowflakes suddenly stopped. Immediately after that, they were all rolled over, and the whistles came and gathered together from all sides, causing the earthquake to tremble!
There was no more snow falling in the sky. All the snowflakes gathered to form a huge snow-colored dragon. As soon as this dragon formed, it immediately looked up at the sky and made a terrible sound. Everyone who heard it was immediately shocked. It seemed like it was about to be torn apart by this sound.
An astonishing burst of blood seeped from the Xuelong's body and soon spread all over her body, making this snow dragon look like a blood dragon. It roared violently and struggled to rush violently into the sky. Like a meteor shooting directly into the skyline, it seemed like it was about to blow open a hole in this day and open up hope.
The speed was endless. In a blink of an eye, it was as if the dragon hit an invisible diaphragm somewhere. The sky shook, and the hum spread in all directions. Then the blood dragon screamed violently again, and the body collapsed layer by layer at a speed visible to the naked eye.
Just as it was about to completely shatter, the hundreds of thousands of silent people at the bottom of the altar all clenched their tips, bit the tip of their tongues, and spewed out a bite of blood. The blood seemed to be drawn by some kind of force and sprinted. Like a sea of blood, it went straight to the collapse of the blood dragon. After merging with it, the dragon's collapse eased and rushed higher into the skyline.
Seeing that the Blood Dragon flew higher and higher, gathering everyone's eyes, but at this point, the Blood Dragon had a powerful shock all over the body. After making a loud thunderstorm for tens of thousands of miles, it was no longer able to stop its body from collapsing. It turned into countless blood-colored snowflakes and fell down. Seeing from afar, the world had already been dyed red into a yellow spring.
Furthermore, at the moment of the collapse of the Blood Dragon, a completely different sound from the roar came out of its mouth! “Hmm...”
At the top of the altar, right in the center, there was an old man in a purple robe sitting on his knees. The old man's face was covered with wrinkles and brown spots. He muttered and his eyes were open, but his eyes were bleak and dull; apparently he was blind.
A complete spine was placed in front of him, radiating the white light of the forest. He held a piece of stone in his right hand and stayed above the 13th spine.
He looked at the sky silently with his empty eyes and sighed for a long, long time.
In his words, holding the stone's right hand, he moved once again on the strange spine, rubbed the animal's bone, made a crackling sound, and scattered into the distance. His figure looked bleak. Blended with this sound, revealed a sad sense of loneliness and decline.
In the middle of the night, it was completely dark, but it was not calm in the reckless mountains. Murderous beasts appeared, the roar shook the mountains and rivers, the trees shook, and the leaves were falling.
It was another beast roar. Lin Feng shrunk his neck, brushed off the leaves falling on his body, looked at the mountains in the dark, and sighed in his heart that this place is really not the same as Earth.
Lin Feng was sitting under a tree in a daze. A few teenagers on the other side all looked at him with disdain. A little fat guy even shouted at Lin Feng, “Leaving you as a foreigner in the village won't let you eat dried food; hurry up and get to work!”
Lin Feng came back and didn't speak. He patted his butt and stood up and walked away.
Behind him, the little fat man snorted: “Useless waste, not as strong as a child, you should throw him in the mountains for the murderous beast to eat!”
Lin Feng shuts his mouth away. How can his brother, an increasingly well-dressed Earthling, compare his strength to your group of livestock?
This world of Tianyuan is a world dominated by people who practice truth.
The wolf village in front of you is just a small village in a reckless mountain. Naturally, there are no real practitioners, yet every villager has worked hard to practice martial arts and work hard, not even women and children.
Only in this way can we survive in a world where murderous beasts run rampant, even infested with ancient relics.
Just like now, even though it's late at night, the young and strong people in the village also have to go hunting in the mountains. Many prey are used to going out at night. Although it is dangerous to go into the mountains at night, the harvest will also be even greater.
Everyone in the village is used to this kind of lifestyle. The children who stayed in the village didn't sleep, so they got together to play their skills and wait for the adults to return from hunting.
They also dragged the children with their snot clearing their noses and joking around with dozens or hundreds of kilogram stone locks as toys. A group of teenagers were trying to see who could lift the kilogram giant at the entrance of the village.
Lin Feng looked at this group of small animals and sighed. Compared to their strength, he really looked like he was a waste of firewood.
But that doesn't make Lin Feng feel depressed. Although he is sometimes talked about behind, he relied on his ability to fool around and stay temporarily in this small mountain village called Wolf Village. What really hurts him is that he has one more thing in his mind.
Super Grandmaster system.
At first, Lin Feng was just happy. There were benefits to thinking about crossing, but the first rule of the system made him feel a bit cold.
“The main mission of the system: the host is to establish the largest division in the world and become the first grandmaster.”
“The main mission is divided into different stages. Each stage must be completed within a limited time limit. If the time is not completed, the host is directly destroyed!”
Lin Feng looked at the system instructions, especially the last sentence “kill the host”. After being speechless for half a day, he finally squeezed a few words out of his teeth: “I bought a watch last year!”
After getting angry, Lin Feng reluctantly read the contents of the mission. He wasn't ready to take risks and challenge the system to see if his opponent could kill him. When he first arrived in the world, his butt wasn't hot, and he didn't want to die again.
Main mission 1.0 - Collect the four Kibachi Disciples.
Mission description: Even if it's a casual undertaking, if you want to pass on your mantle, you have to take a disciple. The most important resource of a faction is always people. They are disciples with outstanding talents. Famous teachers give high apprentices. Famous teachers are hard to find, and it's even harder to find high apprentices.
Mission time limit: 1 year. Overtime not completed; directly kill the host.
“What a fool!” Lin Feng sighed. As a newcomer who has just crossed over, the childish one is like a fresh cabbage, so I should quickly find a big cow to be the master and hug her thighs, right?
Big brother of the system, you just gave me a cheat book to take apprentices. This poor and destitute person, what would you let me teach them? Misleading and aggressive?
What's even worse is that the system says there is a newbie package, but it tells him that the gift package system has broken down. The delay in the distribution of the newbie pack made Lin Feng lament that no one is the most insane.
The exchange system that was opened was full of all kinds of good stuff. The magic trick was magical, but you couldn't think of it; none of them were out of stock.
The problem is that everything needs to be exchanged for points, and even if Lin Feng doesn't have any points to redeem right now, he can only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was scolding her in her heart. Suddenly there was an uproar at the entrance of the village. It looked like the hunting team had returned.
The teenagers waiting in the village all cheered to greet them at the entrance of the village. Lin Feng glanced unnecessarily, but was stunned to discover that all of the young and strong people who had returned from hunting had returned empty-handed, not even their weapons.
For these villagers, weapons are their second life. Living in these mountains, they simply cannot survive without weapons.
Lin Feng had an undetectable smile on the corner of his mouth: “Seems like there's a story.” Thinking about this, he also walked to the crowd at the entrance of the village.
Before I got close, I heard someone yell, “Wolf Wind is our hope for Wolf Village. Now being seriously injured by people in Shicun, we must not rest easy!”
Lin Feng looked up and saw a young boy in the middle of the crowd sitting on the ground, covered with scars, and a cold light of hate popping up in his eyes.
“Is this the genius that people in Wolf Village talk about?” Lin Feng took a peek and observed. He has also been famous for this wolf style for a long time. The idol of the entire youth in Wolf Village is regarded as the village's hope. Today is the first time Lin Feng has seen a real person.
Although Wolfeng was injured and looked weak at this time, he was full of energy and blood. Although his physical strength was not comparable to that of a true practitioner, he was definitely superior among secular warriors.
According to Tianyuan World's public opinion, at a young age, you have this level. If you practice the truth, you will also have prospects for development. At the end of the day, the true practitioner is to guide the spirit of heaven and earth into the body, condense mana, and strengthen one's own foundation.
Lin Feng silently drew out his Super Master system. There was a Disciple Talent Detector inside. He pressed OK on Wolf Wind.
“The target's qualifications are too low to become a disciple of the host.”
Lin Feng frowned. The system was also too picky. Originally, he wanted to take in four disciples at random and fool the system over the one-year period; in the end, it was no big deal to just kick these rounded disciples out of the door wall.
But now it seems that it's not that easy to drill a loophole in the system. Even a genius teenager like Wolf Feng, famous in the Ten Mile and Eight Counties, is not qualified enough. Lin Feng wants to gather all four disciples to complete system tasks; it's just too difficult.
“One year, one year...” Lin Feng sighed depressingly.
In the crowd, an old man close to Wolf Wind had a blue face and snorted: “Wolf Wind is my grandson. Of course this can't be calculated just like that, but not now. There has been a lot of activity in the mountains these days. It looks like some mountain treasures are about to be born. Get the mountain treasure first, then settle accounts with Ishimura!”
There are often armed fights between village clans. Lin Feng has no interest in this. Instead, the word “mountain treasure” caught his ear, which made his heart move slightly.
Lin Feng was thinking about the mountain treasure. Suddenly he heard someone in the crowd whispering, “I don't even know how Ishimura raised such a little monster. It's not even four years old. A little doll can actually defeat the genius wolf style in our village. What a hell!”
Lin Feng's eyes suddenly lit up.
Did the little doll under four beat the wolf style in front of you?
Wolf Wind already has some talents. The person who hurt him wasn't even four years old, so what kind of talent should he have?
The little fat man next to Lin Feng whispered, “Damn kid, you must kill him!”
After taking a look at him, Lin Feng added, “Yes, yes.”
But I'm thinking in my heart that this little doll might be recognized by the system. Thinking about this, Lin Feng silently withdrew from the crowd. Now he can't help but fly to Shicun with his wings right away, but he doesn't dare to leave the village alone; otherwise, he just goes out to feed the murderous beast in the mountains.
At this point, a sharp mechanical reminder suddenly sounded in Lin Feng's mind.
“The Starter Pack has been released, can you check it out right away?”
After Lin Feng stunned for a moment, his heart was overjoyed. He never thought that the boring and dull system prompts were so pleasant to hear.
Find a place where no one else is there, and Lin Feng ordered a gift package.
Starter Pack: Hosts get the four-level level of basic training, get a chance to win a lottery, get 300 points in exchange for points, get the moral secret “Jiuxiao Tianthunder,” and get the Shentong Nine-Day Thunder Guide.
Lin Feng was dazed. A warm current fell from above his head, ran straight between his chest and stomach, and quickly washed away a hidden hole in his body.
There are 12 important caves hidden in the human body. True practitioners call them the 12th floor.
The training period during the exercise period is divided into 12 floors, just to open the 12th floor. Every trick is revealed, and Reiki will be converted into mana, and the practitioner's mana will rise one level.
Lin Feng now feels like a series of warm streams, and has gone with him along the way. He didn't disappear until he cleared the four holes in his body. As Lin Feng breathed, air from the outside world was rapidly sucked into the body and circled through the four holes that had been pierced.
Every trick is like a universe of star clusters that keep moving. Reiki is constantly being transformed into Lin Feng's own mana power, just like the beginning of the universe's floods and the evolution of all living things.
Lin Feng felt that his entire body had become lighter. As soon as his mind moved, his mana surged in his acumen, and his explosive power was acting foolishly.
It was only after a long time that Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body and was relieved: “At last, I can protect myself a bit.” However, thinking that the ultimate goal of the system was to establish the first division in history and become the first grandmaster in history, Lin Fengdun was under a lot of pressure and hurriedly checked other items in the newbie package.
“A chance to win?” Lin Feng took a look. In addition to the exchange system, there is also a lottery system in the auxiliary training system, but it's gray. It's not active yet, so there's no need to think about it for now.
Currently, I can only hope that those 300 redeem points have more purchasing power.
While thinking about it, Lin Feng entered the exchange system. Previously, he was poor and destitute, and he couldn't bear to look at prices.
After taking a close look at the price list, Lin Feng secretly scolded the system for being unscrupulous. The lowest-level bottle of nourishment costs 10 points in exchange, and a slightly spiritual ironmaking sword cost 30 points.
Even if you want to get the basics down, a set of badgers and star crowns requires 50 o'clock.
The most basic magic tricks such as “fireball” and “palm thunder” cost 100 points.
As for those luxury goods with zero on the back of their butts, Lin Feng doesn't dare to look at them at all; he's afraid of getting dizzy.
Lin Feng looked at the poor 300 in his “Existing Exchange Points” column and shook his head: “There is too little start-up capital.”
Fortunately, the Rookie Pack revealed a book of Taoism and a magic trick; otherwise, Lin Feng would have gone blind.
Taoism is the foundation of practice, mainly raising one's level, while magic is a practical martial art or spell that has many wonderful uses.
Surprisingly, the Jiuxiaotian Lei Zhengfa in the gift package is so high that the existing exchange system can't even be redeemed; the system must be upgraded before it can be redeemed.
As for the system upgrade, it takes Lin Feng to complete a certain number of system tasks before it starts. Now I'm saying it's still too early.
The Jiuxiaotian Thunder Method is one of the best methods of thunder in the world of Tianyuan, but it has been lost for many years. In the past, all of our well-trained seniors used this method to walk sideways.
According to the instructions, the Rookie Gift Pack is a method of randomly issuing the Jiuxitian Thunderstorm. Lin Feng thinks that his ancestral tomb is burning smoke. Although the purchasing power of 300 redemption points is limited, Lin Feng's heart was completely swept away by the depression at this point.
Had it not been for that damn main mission, Lin Feng would have found an uninhabited place to do his best before coming out and killing the Quartet.
But now that they have to take apprentices, that's another way of saying it.
Dissatisfaction turned into dissatisfaction. Lin Feng quickly adjusted his mentality and acted swiftly.
He was silent. After asking about the route to Ishimura, he left Wolf Village quietly without shocking others.
There is now a state of hostility between the two villages. Lin Feng, who has become a true practitioner, is not afraid of being attacked by people in Wolf Village, but he is afraid that they will reveal their identity in front of people in Shicun.
Fortunately, now everyone in Wolf Village is gathering at the entrance of the village. There is a lot of discussion about the wolf wind being hurt. Lin Feng has taken a detour from behind the village, and no one has noticed his actions.
Walking along the way, Lin Feng did not hesitate to invest directly in 50 exchange points to buy everything for himself.
How is it possible that Lin Feng from Earth doesn't know the “Buddha wants gold clothes, people want clothes”? If he wants to sell something, the promotion and packaging must be done first.
Looking down at his star coat, white robe with wide sleeves, and an image of someone with a strong sense of style, Lin Feng nodded satisfactorily. The system was expensive, but the quality was really unspeakable.
When Lin Feng arrived at the entrance of the village of Shicun, the first thing he saw was a half-cut huge dead tree. The trunk was about ten meters in diameter, and the whole body was burnt black.
Lin Feng took a look and speculated that it was a thunderstruck tree many years ago. It had been cut by lightning many years ago. The huge canopy and vigorous vitality of the old tree were destroyed. Today, there is only a section of tree stump 89 meters high left on the surface of the earth.
But if you just look at the size of existing tree trunks, you can imagine how huge the trees were back then when they were alive.
All of the dead trees were burnt black, with no signs of life at all.
At this point, an old man came over and said with a cough, “This tree has been dead for ten years.” He walked up to Lin Feng and looked up at Lin Feng with a pair of eyes: “The little old boy is the village chief of this stone village. I wonder if there's anything I can do to help this Dao Chief?”
Lin Feng smiled slightly. Naturally, there was a dusty and proud atmosphere on his body. Coupled with his manners, white robe with wide sleeves, and a kale crown, he was not picky at all; he definitely looked like a high-ranking person.
“Discovering the target is suitable for becoming a disciple of the host.”
Lin Feng just wanted to talk. When he heard a sudden system prompt, he was almost choked by his saliva.
The old village chief of Ishimura looked at Lin Feng strangely, but was horrified.
I saw a green light in Lin Feng's eyes, staring at the entrance of the village like a wild wolf screaming from hunger.
At the entrance of the village, a pink-carved, snow-white kid is trying his best to pull the tail of a big yellow dog. The sound of the child is clear and loud: “Whoa whoa, don't run!”
There was no end to the system sound in Lin Feng's mind: “The talent system has been sorted out. The target data for No. 1 is as follows.”
“Fundamental—>10; Enlightenment—>8; Mind—>8; Fuyuan—>8.”
“Summary: The target is extremely talented. It is recommended that you pay less than income, teach carefully, and be the backbone of Zongmen.”
Lin Feng didn't see anything else. He looked straight at the blood-red number “10” behind the root bone.
What does the root bone of 10 mean?
For example, when someone else runs, it takes 100 meters from the starting point to the end point. If the end point is the same, they start running at a distance of 90 meters or less!
No wonder he can beat up when he's less than four years old, and his face is full of peach blossoms.
At this point, I also discovered Lin Feng. I looked at him blankly. He blinked, had big eyes, and was very cute.
Lin Feng shuddered. Not only is this product strong enough to fight against the sky; its understanding, mentality, and happiness are all super genius.
Isn't it a bit stressful to take this kind of goods as an apprentice?
Lin Feng pondered, gradually showing a warm, sunny smile on his face.
If someone familiar with Lin Feng from a past life saw him smile like this, they would have taken refuge as far away as they were right away.
CHAPTER 1
The morning sun shone through the light silver drapes and just fell on her bed. Her stinging eyes couldn't even open them.
At the party last night, she drank too much for a moment. Lu Yanchen picked her up later.
Time sat up, a thin layer of silk slipped off, a hint of red on the white sheets came out, and on my body, my white skin was covered with kiss marks.
What you can tell from watching this is the result of a night of fun.
“I love you.”
When the love was strong, his moving words of love seemed to still be in my ears. Time was full of peach blossoms. My eyes were shy, and I turned my head and looked around.
What about Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out to buy breakfast?
Time lifted the quilt to the bed. When my legs touched the ground, they were weak and soft, and I almost fell to the ground.
When the light came out again at the time, Lu Yanchen also came back and walked calmly and slowly into the living room. Her slender, upright figure had a strong yet oppressive atmosphere.
As time looked up, I fell into a pair of deep eyes, and my eyes were as calm as the unfathomable Cheongdam.
After all, it was the first time we had such an intimate relationship. The time was inexplicably a bit shy, and I didn't dare to look at him with my eyes hanging down.
Confused by fans, she vaguely heard him say he wanted to surprise her.
Are you going to propose to her?
The time was a bit overwhelming, and my heart was fluttering and beating.
As soon as she spoke out, she was interrupted by Lu Yanchen's silence: “Let's break up!”
What did he just say, break up?
The surprise he wants to give her is to break up?
Is he teasing her, joking, or is he serious and wants to break up?
A scream so painful that it can't come out because it's hidden in my throat. It's only half-loud before time finds its own voice.
Very light, very light, as if low to dust. “After breaking up and our relationship... Lu Yanchen, what do you mean?”
Lu Yanchen's apathetic expression didn't change at all. “Last night, who called me to pick her up, and who held me dead and made me not stop. You enjoyed last night too.”
Time was lost like being cut by thunder!
She was stunned. Looking at this man who was completely different from her memory, she couldn't control the trembling all over her body and painstakingly asked three words, “Why?”
After speaking, I turned and looked out the window with a faint smile at the corners of my mouth.
That smile looked like a mockery in time.
Time was as bleak as snow. The pain started from her heart, compressed the nerve endings and spread to all over her limbs. The vertigo darkness hit her. She clasped her palm tightly with her fingertips, but she didn't let herself faint.
The air suddenly became cold and bitterly humid, freezing, causing people to shiver and suffocate, making them unable to wait even a minute.
Time is running out.
CHAPTER 1
The land of rain, Ling Jia, Cangyun Town, is over the middle of the moon.
It took Ling Han a full ten seconds to finally confirm that he had indeed been reincarnated and reborn.
For a powerful person in the realm of heaven, it takes ten seconds to confirm one thing. This is absolutely incredible, but it also proves how incredible what happened to him was.
In his first generation, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts, and also had unprecedented achievements in Dandao. The “Three Hot Farms” technique he pioneered sparked a revolution in the alchemy world, and is revered as “Emperor Dan.”
However, he is not satisfied; he wants to go one step further and reach the legendary false situation, shatter the void, and turn the fan into a god. To this end, he visited numerous monuments and eventually entered the Valley of Black Blood. After going through many dangers, he found a mysterious ancient tower.
He wasn't disappointed. The golden text on the ancient pagoda was an excellent article called “The Indestructible Sutra.” When you practice at the highest level, your health won't be bad and immortal, coexist with heaven and earth, and live with the sun and moon!
However, even after practicing martial arts in the realm of Ling Han Tian, I still think that the “Indestructible Sutra” is obscure and difficult to understand; it's like reading a book of heaven; I have no clue at all.
He forcibly wrote down this trick. When he wanted to study the ancient pagoda, the ancient tower was flabbergasted, released a tremendous amount of light, and instantly shattered his body. But strangely enough, his soul didn't actually dissipate; he fell into a state where he felt like he was awake or not a dream, which continued for tens of thousands of years.
For ten thousand years, his soul has been trying to figure out the immortal scripture — he can't do anything other than this. After ten thousand years, he finally understood the first level of this piece of art.
It took 10,000 years for a powerful person in the realm of heaven to understand the first level of merit. What kind of concept is this?
You need to know that the strongest people in the realm of heaven are usually Shouyuan, which is less than a thousand years old. Normally speaking, no one in the world can complete this immortal sutra, because they are old and dead before they even begin.
However, Ling Han mastered the first level of skill in “The Indestructible Sutra” in this strange way. Then, suddenly, he came back alive and was reincarnated as a sixteen-year-old, also known as Ling Han.
“No matter what happened, I'm alive again!”
“Although this body is just a two-layer construction of the body, and the waste material can no longer be used as waste material, I used to be a strong person in celestial arts. I also used elixirs to make up for my poor qualifications, so I can't go back to my peak if I don't believe it.”
“Also, I can finally practice the Indestructible Sutra. It's a supreme art, or even... it's probably not owned by the Realm of the Earth, but from the legendary Divine Realm. Otherwise, how could it take 10,000 years to understand the greatest power?”
“In this world, I will definitely be able to surpass my predecessor and achieve my throne!”
“Also, what happened to this body? I only got to the second level of fitness when I was 16. Is it because today's martial arts have worn out too much?”
Boom, countless memories pour into my mind. These are memories belonging to another Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in the process, two completely different people also merged together, regardless of each other.
“I get it.”
Ling Han nodded in her heart. The reason he is now on the second floor of the body is that his spiritual roots are so bad.
If you want to train and become a warrior, one prerequisite is that you must have a spirit root. With a spiritual root, you can absorb the spirit of heaven and earth, strengthen yourself, and turn it into your own energy.
Some spiritual roots absorb reiki quickly, while others are slow. Therefore, the spiritual roots are divided into the four major grades of heaven and earth, and each major rank is divided into three lower grades. The upper, middle, and lower grades are also divided into the upper, middle, and lower grades. The upper level of heaven is the best, while the lower level of yellow is the worst.
The key to judging the superiority of a spiritual root is purity. The purer the better, while Ling Han's spiritual root has all five elements and is the most cluttered. In the martial arts world, this is the worst kind of spiritual root. Therefore, at 16, he has only been able to practice to the second level of refinement, yet his peers have reached four or five layers of refinement.
Ling Han from a previous life was a celestial root, and was also the supreme power of the Joyang Fire Ling Gen. Coupled with his unrivaled Tandao talent, he achieved the celestial realm in just 200 years. This is a record never seen before in ancient times.
“The Five Elements of the Spirit Root. This is the lowest-level spiritual root. No wonder the predecessor worked so hard but only completed the second floor of the body.” “As far as I am concerned, the Five Elements Zhayrrgroot is a bit tricky, but with the elixir, I'm sure I'll be able to return to my peak in 400 years at most!”
“Huh!”
Ling Han exclaimed in his heart, showing an unbelievably shocked expression on his face. He stunned for a while and looked back at his Tanden's spiritual roots with his strong soul. The shocked expression immediately turned into ecstasy.
“This isn't the root of the Five Elements. The Five Elements are perfectly balanced, forming a Daolian! This is the Five Elements Chaos Lotus. The best of the best. It's even rarer than the Jiuyang Fire Spirit Root. It can be called a God-level Spirit Root!” “My predecessor's training was slow because God-level spirits all required special skills to unleash their true power.”
“And I... have mastered the Five Elements Tianji Gong, which matches the Five Elements of Chaos Lotus!”
“One hundred years! No, it only takes 50 years for me to be back in heaven!”
Rao couldn't help but show his joy at all of Ling Han's previous lives. Ling Gen was born and cannot be changed the day after tomorrow. In his past life, in order to become a god, he visited countless monuments and obtained a large number of arts and tricks. The Five Elements of Tianji Gong is one of them.
In his previous generation, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts. In this world, he will create another glory and create an immortal myth.
“How did your predecessor die?”
Ling Han picked up his memories, and soon he showed his anger.
The predecessor was the only son of Ling Dongxing, the head of the Ling family. Her mother, grandparents passed away a long time ago. However, the Ling family is a martial arts family. Everyone in the family practices martial arts, and they also respect martial arts. For example, why can Ling Dongxing take the position of head of the family? It was he who had the greatest strength and was able to play.
However, Ling Han's quilt has been treated as waste since she was a child because of the lingen problem, and she ate it out of sight.
In order to give her son a bright future, Ling Dongxing reached an agreement with Huyang University — Huyang College would recruit Ling Han as a disciple and do his best to train him; in exchange, Ling Dongxing would enter Ziguangji Valley to find something that was lost a long time ago for Huyang College.
Huyang University was founded by the Yu Guo dynasty and has countless resources. If it is fully cultivated, even people who waste materials can be promoted to Juyuanjing.
But the people at Huyang University can't be idiots. If that thing is good, how can they offer such favorable conditions?
Ziguangji Valley is dangerous. Even if you take the wrong step, you could die. But for the sake of her son, Ling Dongxing set out seven days ago without any recourse.
Yesterday, people from Huyang University came and informed the Ling family that they would pick them up as agreed today. However, at this time, Ling Zhongkuan, the deacon of the Ling family, ran over to discuss with his predecessor, asking him to give up this precious place and give it to his grandson Ling Muyun.
The reason is that Ling Muyun is a genius with unlimited prospects; this kind of opportunity cannot be wasted on waste.
Naturally, his predecessor wouldn't agree; this was an opportunity his father gave in exchange for his life! However, Ling Chung-kuan said it was a discussion; in fact, it was just a notice to her predecessor; she didn't take his opinions to heart at all.
His predecessor couldn't bear to take action, but Ling Chung-kuan was a strong person who gathered the power of the Yuan Dynasty. He could suppress him with just one finger. Is he an opponent?
With just one punch, his predecessor was seriously injured, then locked in his room, apparently not wanting to mess with him in front of people at Huyang University. By the time Ling Dongxing came back, the tree had already become a boat.
And the predecessor of the heavy attack just got angry and died.
Ling Han snorted. It was really very bullying. Her father gave up his life in exchange for the quota that was actually taken away by Ling Chung-kuan's grandparents?
This is a shameless dog thing!
Intolerable!
He climbed out of bed and immediately felt soreness all over his body — he was alive, but his injuries didn't improve without fail.
“Linggen is still traumatized!” Ling Han's brow was furrowed, and Ling Chung-kuan's hit caused damage to all of his spirit roots, and the spirit root was damaged. This is a very troublesome thing. Ordinary medical stones are not effective.
“As far as I know, there are seven types of elixirs that can repair the roots, but the materials required are too expensive to sell the whole Ling family in exchange — furthermore, my lingen has only been lightly damaged; I don't need such advanced elixirs.”
“Of the remaining three types, two require refining to make it into a dan, so I'm too reluctant to repair the second floor of the body. Then there's only one option -- Yuanxin Reunshen; all you need to do is mix the medicinal herbs in proportion and cook them into medicinal juice.”
“Heal the wounds first, then stop Ling Chung-kuan's grandson. Although I don't have a rare place, I must not let my father use his life in exchange for the chance to cheapen this shameful grandson!”
He sat down on his knees and began running the “Indestructible Sky.”
This is probably his first time running this gate, but since he's been figuring it out for tens of thousands of years, he is now extremely calm when it comes to driving.
There was a hustle and bustle in his body, and a lot of energy was consumed, but he quickly recovered from his injuries.
It only took a few minutes for him to run out of his injuries.
“It's worthy of being immortal; I've had such amazing effects since I just started practicing. It's just that this is completely different from other techniques. The normal use is to use the spiritual roots to transform the Heavenly and Earth Reiki into energy, but the opposite is to hone the energy of the body and heal wounds.”
“Once you've reached the highest level, it's not impossible to be immortal.” “That's why it's called the sky!” “Unfortunately, there aren't enough levels now; otherwise, I would be able to repair all of my spiritual roots using the Indestructible Sutra.”
Ling Han opened her eyes, looked at the white sky outside the window, and muttered, “Now, it's time to go see Ling Chung-kuan's shameless old store. Surprise him.”
He put on his shoes, walked to the door, and opened it.
A tall figure immediately appeared at the door blocking his way. This person's name was Zhang Yuan, one of Ling Zhongkuan's walking dogs.
“Grandpa Han, the deacon ordered you to stay in your room today!” Zhang Yuan laughed. Even though the person on the other side was the son of the family owner, he was famous for being a waste material. In his eyes, it was just a joke.
Ling Han looked cold and said, “How dare you stop me?”
You are the one stopping you. The deacon said, don't let Ling Han make trouble today; you can just beat them up when necessary! Zhang Yuanpi laughed and said, “This is an order from the Grand Deacon. I also ask Grandpa Han not to embarrass me.”
Ling Chung-kuan, an old dog, was really cautious. They were still uneasy about treating him as a serious injury, and they also sent someone to guard the gate. You can also see how important it was for Ling Chung-kuan to let her grandson enter Huyang College — but when this hope was shattered, Ling Chung-kuan's disappointment and annoyance was also imaginable.
“Go away!” Ling Han Leng Keng Dao.
Hurry up!
Ling Han just raised her hand with a slap in the face and coldly said, “What kind of thing are you telling you to roll or not?”
What, I actually got slapped in the face by a piece of waste material? Zhang Yuan caressed his own face in disbelief. This scrap actually dared to shoot him, and he was also hit. What kind of joke is this?
Hurry up!
Ling Han waved again and slapped him firmly in the face.
“Huh————⸺——”
An acoustic cry echoed through the silent mountains.
Li Qiye climbed the hill, and the night wind was sharp and cold, but at this point he was so anxious and sweaty. At the age of 13, he climbed the mountains with his hands and feet. The night seemed particularly lonely and sad, making people feel really sad.
Although the night seemed scary, Li Qiye felt distraught.
Li Qiye comes from a family of tenant farmers. Both parents are poor people. He began herding sheep when he was seven years old.
Today, Li Qiye herds sheep as usual, but when he went back to chase sheep in the evening, he found a missing sheep. This made him in a hurry. He hurriedly went back to the mountain to look for it, but he went all over the hill and never found this sheep.
Thinking about the ferocity of the landowner Zhang Dahu and losing a sheep, Li Qiye was distraught and fearful.
Now the whole mountain hill has been searched, and there's no shadow of that sheep. At this point, Li Qiye thought of one place, but there was only one place he hadn't looked for — Fairy Caves!
Looking up at the night in the valley in front of him, like a murderous beast of the flood, he chose someone to eat at any time with his big mouth open. Hearing the sound of wolves crying and ghosts in the distance, looking out at the lost night of the Fairy Caves, Li Qiye couldn't help but shudder.
Fairy and Magic Cave is a famous place in the area. Legend has it that there is a demon living in it. Anyone who goes in will be eaten. After going inside, no one ever comes out alive.
However, at this point, the sound of Zhang Dahu's crackling whip echoed in Li Qiya's ear. Having lost his sheep, Zhang Dahu will definitely slack him to the point!
“OK, OK, OK, this immortal raven has finally formed. It just lacks a soul. I'm using your soul today!” I don't know how long it took for the Fairy Magic Cave to make a deep, gloomy sound.
“Crack-clack-clack-” It wasn't long before a sudden sound of slapping its wings sounded, and a strange bird like a crow flew out of Fairy Cave.
“Fly, fly, you must use your soul to remember the burial site and fly over the ruins. As long as the Nine Realms are still there, you must find it!” A deep, gloomy voice echoes in Fairy and Magic Cave.
Since then, there has been a haze flying between heaven and earth, burial ground, into a fairy city, and crossing the realm of murder... it couldn't help itself, flew over the Nine Realms, and went through all kinds of trials and tribulations without dying for millions of years!
Time passes, times change, invincible figures rise one by one, and giants fall one after another. Slowly, I don't know when**, a mysterious crow begins to appear. A mysterious crow that has escaped from its confinement begins to search for a path that can control its own destiny.
From the god of medicine, to Emperor Feixian, to Emperor Blood Seal, to Emperor Akihito, to Emperor Tsunnil, to Emperor Immortal of Ice... and finally the Black Dragon King.
Generations of invincible giants have risen, yet another generation of gods has fallen far and wide, yet after tens of millions of years, that crow still looms over a long period of time.
The cold wind was like a knife, and there was a lot of snow.
As soon as Lu Sheng opened his eyes, he saw himself sitting in a yellow and gray carriage. The car was shaking a bit, and there was the sound of a little girl talking in a quiet voice around him.
Outside the car, there was a loud crowd of people. There were howls, shouting, cheering.
Lu Sheng sighed deeply.
He knew he couldn't go back. From eating old oil in a state-owned enterprise waiting to die, he woke up to this world after getting drunk once.
It's been five days until now.
He sniffed his nose, and the air smelled of wine, pancakes, and fried fruit.
“Oops, the white laurel wine at Osmanthus Fang is getting more and more fragrant.” The intimate handmaiden in the car had a small whistling cream channel.
In addition to her natural baby face, she is also very small. It doesn't look any different from a ten-year-old kid.
The little face was chubby and red in white. She was wearing a small green cotton dress. Her little hand was still rubbing Lu Sheng's hair tie to get out of the car.
This type of hair tie is made of a very expensive type of bark and naturally gives off a light fragrance, but the only downside is that it hardens when it's cold, so you need to rub it with hot hands to soften it.
Lu Sheng smiled and didn't speak. The carriage stopped soon.
He lifted the car curtain and walked out of the car. The gray-white street was covered with blue stone bricks, each about the size of a washbasin.
There are cars coming and going on the streets, and there are also people carrying Malays back and forth. The hawkers and the girls and girlfriends who came out to hang out were unabashedly unabashedly.
Lu Sheng looked up at the winery in front of him. The white plaque has a rectangular shape, and the dragon, feifeng dance, has three big characters written in the middle: Osmanthus Square.
“Inside, please! I'll keep the A-size cabin for you!” A bunch of smiles greeted me.
Lu Sheng nodded. A pair of rich boys took the silver-edged white paper fan from their little hands. They shook softly. The fan unfolded. A picture of the landscape and smoke waves was drawn on the top. The landscape was rising one after another, the light and dark overlapped. Another look was the inscription of everyone's style.
He was familiar with the road in his light car and went into the winery with his little boy.
The winery is divided into two floors, and quite a few people are sitting listening to people sing in the lobby on the first floor.
A young girl in green stood in an empty space. Her voice softly softened, and there was also a middle-aged woman playing the pipa beside her.
The song is from Sanhui, and the story of the Sanhui War is about the poignant love between the Expedition Shogun and the Mountain Fox Girl.
Unfortunately, the drinkers present were all rude people; only a few literary boys could quite understand them; the rest of them turned a blind eye to the two young girls.
Lu Sheng stopped and watched how lively the first floor was. He also simply found an empty seat on the first floor to sit down.
“Who ordered the Sanhui Story?” He casually asked Xiaolian a question.
His status here at Osmanthus Fang is different. If this Osmanthus Fang is equivalent to a high-end entertainment club on Earth, then he is the ultimate VIP customer here.
This kind of spending is already considered a top customer in a small northerly town like Jiulian City.
“It's Gongzi Zhou. Zhou lacks Zhou Gongzi.”
Lu Sheng didn't embarrass him, so he just waved and let him go.
After he sat down in a compact seat, his eyes swirled around the crowd on the first floor. He soon saw a pale, thin boy, dressed in white, holding a golden ruffle fan with a backpack in his hand and shaking it gently.
“I think it's the little girl who sings again.” Lu Sheng shook his head.
“The Grand Prince only warned him last time, this guy is such a bad guy!” The little one pouted in dissatisfaction.
Lu Sheng smiled and stopped talking. Start listening quietly to the song.
A table of wine and dishes was quickly placed on the dark red wooden table. Lu Sheng wrapped lettuce and stir-fried shredded pork and put it in his mouth.
Take a sip of white laurel wine, which is about the same as a drink. Blended with a hint of sweetness and sweet floral fragrance, it's just like drinking fruit juice.
Ice shrimp is a specialty of this northern snowy city. If you fish as you like in the thick ice cave, you can get lots of translucent shrimps.
Ice shrimp are half the length of regular shrimp, but they are extremely tasty.
Of course, it's also extremely expensive.
It's already a luxury for a normal person to eat once in January; you can have a meal like him anywhere.
While Lu Sheng was eating food, drinking fine wine, and listening to small songs, he thought about other things in his heart.
It's been so many days since he came to this world similar to ancient China. But according to his observations, there are many strange things about this world.
At first he thought he had gone back to ancient times, but then he discovered otherwise.
The customs and holiday climate here are far different from any dynasty region he knows.
I was thinking something in my heart, but the doors of the winery opened again.
A group of strong men, dressed in short shorts, walked in one after another and found a table close to the corner to sit down with one butt.
As soon as I saw these strong men, I knew they weren't locals; they were dressed more like they came from the Central Plains region, and their clothing and temperament were not as proud as those from the North.
The strong man at the head was bald, with bronze earrings, and his face was full of flesh, but at this point he sighed.” ”
“What are you worried about, Lijiacun can't get through. We can take the second route. It's OK to take a detour from the Zhangcun side.” The other guy frowned.
“What do you know, I was walking from the Zhangcun side when I came to the meeting. The situation is about the same as in Lijiacun; quite a few people have died.”
“What the hell just happened, big brother, if you tell your brothers to listen to it, it also made us gain insight.” A man urged.
The bald man sighed again. “I don't know exactly what it is. I only know that several fishing villages beside Suiyang Lake have had accidents. They seem to have been haunted.”
“? Isn't it?”
Lu Sheng's desk is not far from them, and you can also hear their undisguised chat.
Originally, he was just listening and having fun; he didn't expect these few people to actually talk about Shinto stuff.
The road family of his generation is one of the biggest households in the North Earth Ice City, and the family's wealth is far too small.
If you compare it on Earth, it's at least a rich person with over 100 million dollars in assets.
Having come out drinking these days, he has also heard quite a few rumors about monsters and ghosts in the winery, but most of them are legends.
This is my first personal experience like these few people. So Lu Sheng raised his ear and carefully eavesdropped.
Fortunately, those few people didn't hide it. Keep talking loudly about the strange things in the fishing village.
“That water ghost, I saw it with my own eyes. He's a lot taller, has blue-faced fangs, and has lots of aquatic plants all over his body. Obedient. Had it not been for your older brother and I run fast, now you wouldn't want to see me.” The bald head still has lingering feelings.
“Big brother, is there really such a thing as a water ghost?” A man doesn't believe it.
“I'm afraid it's not a story you made up, big brother?”
Lu Sheng also felt funny when he heard this place; I guess it was just another reckless man who came out of nowhere. There were a lot of people like the ones he had seen during this time.
After eating and drinking, he asked his little boy to pick up the singer's song list and browse it at will.
Although the Sanhuitsuen is good, it doesn't look good; he plans to switch to a more upbeat one.
Hurry up!
But at this point, the bald man blushed and clapped at the table.
“That bone from the water ghost fell to the ground! I secretly got this back after the fact!”
He carefully removed a jade-like green stone from his arms and took a picture of it on the table.
“Isn't this just a piece of mixed jade!” A man laughed.
“Miscellaneous jade? Is this miscellaneous jade?
“This brother. Can you show me this thing.”
Suddenly, a gentle voice came from the sidelines.
Lu Sheng stood at the table of a few people with a smile, and his eyes swept through the green jade on the table.
“How dare you want this thing? This is something the water ghost left behind.” The bald head was astonished.
He just took out Xiusu now and plans to throw it away after a while.
After all, it's not something people left behind. If you really want to bring water ghosts into trouble, then the gains really outweigh the losses.
“I'll just check it out.” Lu Sheng doesn't believe in water ghosts; he just sees that the jade is selling well; it's not like ordinary miscellaneous jade.
You need to know that ordinary miscellaneous jade can be bought everywhere on stalls in stores. It's jade scraps that are polished at will, and the price is extremely cheap.
But I don't know why. As soon as he saw this piece of jade, he felt something was wrong.
A white fox in Tsing, wearing a Tsing Yu Wan's outer hat, is wearing dark boots with cloud pattern embroidered with silver thread.
I've been able to spend all my outfits on here at Osmanthus Fang for several months. It's even enough for the average person's daily use for over a year.
“If a boy wants it, it's not that it's OK, um... just one or two dollars!”
Lu Sheng asked the little boy to pull out one or two pieces of silver and place them on the table.
The bald head resolutely picked up the jade and flogged it in his hand on the way. A few people changed their eyes and got up and left.
Lu Sheng didn't speak either. He saw a few people leave, pinched the jade in his hand, picked it up and looked closely.
“In other words, I've been able to be this rich and rich in my life.” He shook his head. One or two dollars was nothing to him. According to this physical memory, his January expenses on weekdays were at least 102 dollars. Occasionally, it may cost a thousand or two.
Thinking about this, he lost in secret.
Holding the jade, he left the winery with small feet and walked towards the horse-drawn carriage waiting outside without taking care of the eyes of the bustling guests around him.
But as soon as he left the winery, before he had walked halfway, he suddenly took a jade and placed it in his hand.
The jade actually melted in the center of his palm, in the center of his right palm.
The originally hard stone turned into a dark green mass of mucus in just a few seconds, and a scream came out of the mucus.
The entire mucus suddenly exploded and turned into a cloud of green smoke, slowly drifting away from Lu Sheng's face.
He stood on the ground in dismay and took a blink of an eye. The jade was actually still in his hands, but he didn't know when the green inside had quietly disappeared.
He stood in a daze and kept recalling the previous picture for an hour.
The little boy kept screaming at him.
Lu Sheng came back to his senses and looked at the jade in his hand. It was simply an ordinary pebble, not even a jade.
“Gone, back home!”
The two got on the horse-drawn carriage. The chauffer picked up his whip and pumped a few times, and the two dark horses covered in hair slowly started moving.
Inside the car, Lu Sheng didn't say a word and kept looking at the cobblestones in his hand. The small one also discovered an unusual shape in the stone at this time.
“I've been fooled again!” She muttered in her heart, and didn't say much. The grand duke was pretty good this time. The biggest time she was cheated on was for a so-called antique flask, and she spent a thousand two hundred dollars, almost infuriating the old man to death. This time it's only one or two dollars; sometimes the young man has more than that amount of money for a meal.
The horse-drawn carriage went all the way home. While passing by the entrance of the city, Lu Sheng heard someone shouting from outside.
“... I've heard that water ghosts have been eliminated before! A loitering Taoist solved the danger in the fishing village!”
“Has anyone come to the imperial court?”
“Arrived early. I heard that even the head of Ouyang, the governor of Yamen in the city, almost fell into it. Fortunately, I met a Cloud Wanderer. It is said that as soon as that person took a shot, the golden light flashed, then the water ghost screamed, turned into green mucus, and then blew up into heavy smoke to disperse.”
“Of course not!”
Lu Sheng heard that this was an officer guarding the city gate chatting.
He often deliberately passes by this side of the city gate. The officers and guards here are well-informed, and they all like to brag about strange things everywhere.
“This is just a coincidence...” Lu Sheng's face was silent.
His heart sank when he thought back to the previous piece of jade.
Autumn 9999 in the Shenzhou calendar, East China Sea, Qingzhou City.
The Qingzhou School Palace, the sacred place of Qingzhou City, the Qingzhou city's great aristocrats, and more than half of the powerful members of the Zongmen family have all left the Qingzhou School Palace. As a result, everyone in Qingzhou City is proud to be able to enroll in imperial ascetics. If they get a chance to enter the palace, they must work hard to study.
However, it seems that not everyone is aware of this. At this time, in a school building at the Qingzhou Academy Palace, a teenager was lying on a table sleeping soundly.
At the top of the lecture hall, a young girl in a long blue dress also noticed this scene. A hint of anger appeared on her playful face and stepped forward towards the sleeping teenager.
Qin Yi, 17, is an official disciple of Qingzhou University and a foreign apprentice lecturer. She has a beautiful appearance and is in great shape. Inside the school building, a pair of eyes moved along with Qin Yi's moving posture. Even though she was angry, the steps taken by Qin Yi were still elegant.
“This guy is actually sleeping in Sister Qin's lecture hall again.” Seems like only then did I notice the sleeping position. Many teenagers around me were a bit speechless. Obviously, this isn't the first time this is the first time.
“With the appearance and figure of Master Qin, even looking at her is pleasing to the eye. What is that guy actually pretending to be in his head.”
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular lecturer. As for the reason, as soon as you see her, you can understand it. I don't know how many people regard her as a goddess. Her lecture hall has always filled the school building.
Qin Yi walked at a very slow pace and didn't make a sound when she walked around the teenager. She stood at the table and looked at the sleeping face in front of her eyes. Her beautiful face was covered with cold frost.
“Ye Futian.” A gentle voice came out, but it wasn't from Qin Yi's mouth; it came from behind Ye Futian.
It seemed like he heard someone shouting at himself in his sleep. Ye Futian's body moved, his hands held his head, and leisurely opened his eyes. Under his hazy gaze, he saw undulating mountains.
“So big.” Ye Futian couldn't help but whisper. His voice was very quiet, like speaking to himself, yet in the quiet environment at the moment, this sound still seemed extremely obtrusive. For just a moment, many eyes solidified into the air, and then quickly turned into anger.
“How dare he... blatantly disdain Master Qin?”
An angry gaze turned into a sharp sword, causing Ye Futian to shudder coldly, as if he didn't feel right. His gaze moved upward along the alluring place. Afterwards, he saw a face as delicate as jade but full of anger.
“Um...” Ye Futian had a dark line on his face. Why is it Qin Yi?
When I looked back, I saw an innocent fifteen-year-old girl looking angrily at him.
Ye Futian glanced at the young girl and immediately scolded her. The murder was horrendous. No wonder the size was wrong.
“Sister Qin, I...” Ye Futian just wanted to explain.
“Ye Futian.” Qin Yi indifferently interrupted him and said, “In what context was the Qingzhou Academy Palace founded?”
Obviously, Qin Yi wanted to avoid the embarrassment just now and switch topics, but Ye Futian could clearly feel her anger at the moment. He even vaguely felt a glimmer of sword flowing from Qin Yi, sharp, and harsh, stinging every inch of his skin.
“Three hundred years ago, Emperor Donghuang unified Eastern Shenzhou and ordered all the princes of the world to establish the Wufu Academy Palace and prosper martial arts. The Qingzhou Academy Palace was founded in this context.” Ye Futian responded. Of course, what he said was an official historical record; there is another name in the wild history he has seen in his family. However, the taboo name is absolutely not allowed to be mentioned.
“What are the occupations of ascetic practice?” Qin Yi asked again.
“Practice can be divided into martial arts and techniques. Martial arts practitioners have many occupations such as warriors, knights, and swordsmiths. Mages also have many occupations such as mages, dancers, and perfumers, and mages also have many divisions. Of course, there are also gifted people who practice martial arts at the same time.” Ye Futian responded.
“You seem to be missing another career.” Qin Yi looked solemn and asked very seriously.
The young man's face showed a hint of divine brilliance: “The strongest profession recognized by Shenzhou is a heavenly patron, a master of destiny. Those with rare talents, such as summoners, beast handlers, and star sorcerers, come from the vast majority of them are natural magicians. No matter how they practice martial arts, the Master of Heaven can have more genius than others.”
Everyone around him is fascinated. He is a master of destiny, has a legendary career, lives up to fate, and is admired by the gods. “Not only that, but even a natural mage is naturally suited to practicing martial arts.”
Qin Yi showed her hope. Afterwards, she looked at the teenager in front of her and angrily said, “I didn't expect you to know much about this.”
“Of course.” Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and seriously said, “I'm just a natural mage.”
“Phew...” A teenager not far away who was drinking water choked violently, coughing violently, and a pair of eyes around him looked at Ye Futian, like watching an idiot.
There are actually such brazen and shameless people in the world. They not only blatantly molest Master Qin, but now they also falsely claim that they are Mage of Destiny in order to attract the attention of Sister Qin?
However, who is he, a man who has been wandering around in the first phase of awakening and gathering energy for three years. He is in poor health. Obviously, he hasn't completed his physical refinement. He is such a mediocre person who can even be called a waste of firewood. He claims that he is a destiny mage? Is this even more shameful?
Qin Yi's chest was once again full of ups and downs. She looked at Ye Futian angrily: “Since you are a Master of Destiny and the Palace of Natural Life has a soul, release your soul from the Palace of Life for me to see.”
“My soul is still asleep and I can't summon it out. I also fell asleep in the lecture hall because of my soul.” Ye Futian responded calmly.
“Ye Futian...” Qin Yi suddenly shouted, staring at the young man in front of her eyes with beautiful eyes and death, saying, “Three years ago, you entered the palace at the age of 12. At that time, I was still a disciple from outside, visiting your talent test. You were shocked by your sense of energy and shocked the palace. However, for the next three years, I didn't make any progress, I stayed in the first state of regaining my mood in the first awakening. Did you do anything all day long. I was too lazy. Did you actually do anything in the lecture hall?”
“In the past three years, whether it's the Spring Festival or the Autumn Festival exam, you have abstained. You have directly ranked first in the bottom of the Academy Palace. Ye Futian, do you really have any sense of shame?”
Accompanied by Qin Yi's angry roar, the entire school building became silent, and the needles were audible. Everyone stared at Qin Yi's excited face. Seemingly, this was the first time they had seen Sister Qin look like this.
Ye Futian also seemed to have been calmed down. Her dark eyes stared at the delicate face that was red with anger in front of her.
“Three years?” Ye Futian whispered in his heart. Unbeknownst to him, three years had passed, yet the guy in the Palace of Life still hadn't changed at all, and he had some surprises. It turned out that Master Qin, the hot iceberg goddess who has always been indifferent, has always been watching him. From that year on, he discovered that Tianpin's perceptual talents have already begun.
There was silence in the space. Qin Yi's beautiful eyes stared at the young man in front of her. Her handsome face with clear lines and clean, deep eyes were as bright as the stars. At the age of 15, she couldn't pick out any other problems other than being too thin. In three or two years, she must be a beautiful man.
“Is my tone too heavy?” When Qin Yi saw that Ye Futian looked a bit lonely at the corner of his eye, he couldn't help but say it secretly in his heart, and his anger dissipated a bit.
“There's still another month until the Autumn Festival exam. If you still abstain or fail the exam this time, it's no use talking to you for the rest of your life. The Academy Palace won't allow you to stay. Don't you understand?” Qin Yi continued, and the eyes of the people in the school building seemed intolerable to that guy.
If this were the case, I'm afraid it would go down in the history of the Qingzhou School Palace. After all, being able to be evicted from the Qingzhou Academy Palace is also extremely rare.
“He goes, I go.” At the end, there was an indifferent voice. Many people looked at the boy sitting in the corner. His eyes were complicated; they were also envious, jealous, adored, and fearful.
“The school palace has already decided that he doesn't need to participate in next year's Spring Festival for the rest of his life. He can choose the Battle House, the Knights, and any Ichinomiya practice at the Palace of Shukufu Palace. His future will no longer be bothered by you.” Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed. The fate of him and the rest of his life would eventually take a completely different direction.
Ye Futian had a faint smile on the corner of his mouth, which was somewhat disrespectful.
“Shut up...” stood up for the rest of her life sitting in the back. Her eyes shone bright, sharp light, and stabbed Qin Yi.
“Sit down.” Ye Futian didn't come back either. To put it bluntly, his gaze stagnated for the rest of his life, looked at the back in front of him, then sat down quietly, as if what Ye Futian said was an iron order for him.
“I've decided...” Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi with a slightly frivolous smile on her face and said, “I'm officially taking this year's Autumn Test.”
In the background, a bright light flashed through my eyes for the rest of my life.
It's been three years, is he finally serious?
He spent three years of training at the Qingzhou Xuegong Palace. Everyone in the school palace only knew that he had excellent talent for the rest of his life. He also had a natural sense of gold and martial arts. He also practiced law and martial arts. Although he was an outsider disciple, his skills were higher than many instructors.
But who really knows that sleeping teenager?
“Your health is weak, and you're still in the first place of concentration when you wake up. Even if you take the Autumn Test, how can you get through?” Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed in her heart. Even though she got up now, she was afraid it would still be too late.
“What if it's over?” Ye Futian doesn't seem to be self-aware at all; he has strong confidence in his tone.
“If you can pass, you can do whatever you want in the lecture hall in the future.” Qin Yi Dao.
Ye Futian's eyes flashed an unusual light. Looking at the Qianying and hot figure in front of her eyes, her eyes couldn't help but look at places she shouldn't have seen. Weakly said, “Can I do whatever I want?”
“This guy, what does that mean...” Many people stared at Ye Futian.
“Where are your eyes looking, this shameless bastard?” Seemingly noticing the look in Ye Futian's eyes, many people have the urge to run amok. Does he even dare to molest Master Qin?
Naturally, Qin Yi also noticed the look in Ye Futian's eyes. The sympathy that had just been born disappeared in an instant. Her beautiful eyes stared at Ye Futian harshly and gnawed her teeth and said, “You can do whatever you want!”
Deep mountains and jungle, where all demons meet.
For the first time, all ethnic groups put aside their grudges and grievances and appeared at the same time. Tigers, rabbits, foxes, snakes... all kinds of demons have arrived. For a while, the whole forest was full of demons or sounds big or small or delicate or enchanting. There are also ten demon kings sitting at the top. These ten powerful people in the Demon Realm also looked just as heavy at this time.
“All demons, I'm sure you all have some thoughts about what happened here recently.” The Tiger people have always been tough. The Tiger King's first statement was to quiet all the demons. “We belong to the same demons. Under these crises, I think all ethnic groups should put aside their preconceptions and work together to solve the current problems.”
“What's the purpose?”
“Is there any need to guess about this?” Tiger King snorted, “Other than the monks from the Sanzong of the six schools, who would do this kind of thing. Have we had few demons slaughtered by him over the years?”
“But we and the Xiuxianmen faction have always made it clear why did they suddenly stop me from waiting for my way out of the world.” The fox king looked puzzled.
“Also, they didn't eat the second son of their three sects and six schools.” The Snake King also speculated, “Don't they have to tear their faces like this?”
“That's it!” King Panther was also indignant and said, “It's been like this for so many years. Which demon hasn't eaten a handful of mortals? How can the Three Sons and Six Faction suddenly go to death? I don't think it's them.”
“Yes, everyone knows that the demons in our world hurt their manners, so they never get close to the border forest, so how could they stay here on a special trip.”
“But... apart from the six factions and three, who has the strength to kill all the demons that are out of the world within three months.” Tiger King still sticks to his own ideas.
The Eagle King nodded his head, as if he had thought of something. The feathers on his body shook. “I've heard that all of the demons out of the world have died with no bones left, and there are also those that have been stripped of their skin. All of the dead bodies have been dried by the air in the woods. So cruel at the start... animals are not as good as animals.”
“It's just too much deceitful.” The king of the tiger shattered the armrest of the stone chair and stood up in anger. “Dear demon kings, I think instead of speculating on who took the hand here, it's better to kill them together and find out. I don't believe it. No matter how high they are, can they still stop this army of all demons from failing?”
As soon as he said this, the other nine demon kings immediately showed their approval. Indeed, rather than being frightened, it is better to take the initiative to attack.
Deer Wang responded, “My son just died at their hands. Instead of guessing and guessing here, it's better to go out and kill someone. What about the three sects and six factions? When have we demons been afraid of them!”
“Isn't that why we're here today? Whoever he is, kill him to avenge his dead people.” Even the most courageous Bunny King stood up and responded, yet the Bunny family died the most.
“Yes, this feud won't pay off; it's a waste of time!”
“The demons of the tribe are on top; I'll wait to vow to avenge this revenge.”
Other demon kings also stood up one after another to respond. Even demons of all ethnic groups on standby around them also shouted slogans of revenge with excitement.
“So what...” a faint voice suddenly sounded in the demon group, “I don't think I need to go.”
Amidst the wave of anger from the crowd, an opposition voice suddenly appeared. Although it was not loud, it successfully attracted the attention of demons. As soon as the shouting stopped, all the demons stabbed in their eyes.
“Who is it?” The tiger king even shouted, searching for this unscrupulously devil.
The demons looked around. It was clearly the demon type with the sharpest five senses, yet they searched for half a day and didn't find the person who made this voice.
“Who the hell just spoke?” Tiger King is a bit angry, “Where did you get demons from? There's a way to stand up for Ben Wang!”
“I'm here, here!”
The demons patrolled around the perimeter a few more times, and still couldn't see who made a voice.
The “here here...” voice came back, “Left side left, no right... past it's over, a little bit on the right, wrong, look here, look at this!”
The demons followed that voice from side to side several times, but they still couldn't find anyone who made a voice.
“Alas! Forget it, I'm here!”
Until a sigh sighed, a figure suddenly used both hands and feet and climbed onto the hill where the Demon King was sitting. Only then did the demons see the person who made the voice.
It was a woman in a gray robe. Her shoulders couldn't fit down, and her eyes pulled down one by one. The whole person had a laid-back temperament. She was very short and thin, and her face was a bit waxy-yellow.
At the same time, the word “weak” popped up in the demons mind. Too weak! Even the demons on her body were pitifully weak, as if any demon shouted out loud and could blow her away.
It's no wonder the demons have been searching for half a day and haven't found this person; this kind of demon is really inconspicuous.
The bloody Tiger King couldn't see it. As soon as the tiger's nose blew out, he said harshly, “Huh, you're an unscrupulous kid. Just a few monks in the district frightened you, and it changed to look like this.” Demons can all be transformed into monsters, but this is a monster tournament, so most of the demons here have shown some prototypes to differentiate races; only she maintains a complete figure. This makes Tiger King even more displeased. “I don't dare to show people in the original form, what kind of demon are you?” “I'm human.”
“I'm human.” The girl answered.
“Shemales?” Tiger King stunned a bit, “What kind of demons are ladyboys? Never heard of it!”
“Why do all the wacky little demons dare to participate in the Demon Slayer Contest.” Tiger Wang glared indignantly at the woman, “You are an unscrupulous little demon. Hush is talking nonsense here, affecting my morale to wait and get revenge.”
“No, I'm serious.” The woman raised her hand without repentance, but her shoulders unknowingly drooped down. She looked even weaker. “There's really no need for you to go out and seek revenge.”
“Still saying disheartening words!” Tiger King got angry and yelled, “Believe it or not, I ate your little demon.”
“You ate me, don't you have to run for nothing?”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean, the guy you just mentioned that killed all demons and animals...” She sighed and patted her gray robe and looked up. She still looked careless, but pointed at her nose and said, “Maybe... it's me!”
The whole audience was quiet for three seconds, and there was no sound.
“Kill her!”
Wandemon, who reacted, swooped over at the woman at the same time.
Little animals or something — so troublesome!
Five minutes later.
——The first and last Monster Monster Contest has come to an end!
Chapter 1: Tony Dunne?
Loud hustle and bustle stimulates brain nerves, and decibels can cause people to be deaf. A blinding white light shines into my eyes, and the sun** bulges and hurts.
Don couldn't help but squint, but the white light didn't go away; instead, it spread all over the world.
What the hell is going on with this? Am I at a rock club?
Donald opened his eyes with cursing in his heart, but what caught his eye was a big scary face. He had a sweaty black face, and the heat from the two black holes under his wide nose seemed to have gotten on his face. The white teeth in their cracked mouths are as scary as wild animals, and of course the bad breath that comes out of them.
What followed was a violent, head-on collision. Donne felt like he had been hit in the jaw by a heavy punch, and the whole person fell backwards.
The weight of the two people weighed on those poor plastic bottles, and they were overwhelmed and declared to fall apart. The white flower's water splashed out, and there was even a column of water ejected from the mouth of a certain bottle and soared directly into the face of the “pond fish” in the back. Other “pond fish” looked like frightened sparrows.
“Damn it!”
“What the hell!”
“What's going on with this?”
“Team doctor, team doctor!”
“How did you play?”
Donne lay on the ground and looked blankly at the strange faces surrounding him. Some of them were anxious, others were happy, and others covered their faces and couldn't see their expressions. There was still a lot of noise all around, but the loud hustle and bustle had just changed its tone, and there was booing and laughing.
Where is this? Who are they? What's going on with this?
Wait, let's see what happened on the sidelines?” The live commentator suddenly became excited. He stood up and looked down from the top stand. “David Johnson (David Johnson), the main striker of the Forest team, was hit by the sideline coach seat in a fight with opposing players. Poor coach Tony Dunne just stood on the sidelines directing the game... oh! Look at the terrible situation on the ground. This is really a collision between Mars and Earth!
Down was lying on the ground. His light grey suit was soaked and wrinkled with straw and dirt; it looked like a freshly used rag.
A man with a big nose, black beard, and a bit like Mario's appeared in his field of vision. He took white gloves out of the dark colored purse he was carrying and put them on, then began checking up on Don's health.
Damn, it looks like he's on the ground in the back of his head!
“Can you hear me?” He reached out and shook in front of Don's eyes; his tone was clearly much more anxious than he had just been.
At the same time, the scene just now began to be played over and over again on the TV screen.
David Johnson was pushed hard by his opponent during a fierce battle with his opponent on the 14th, then this black man rushed to Tony Dunne, who was standing on the sidelines with an oblique body. But the strange thing is that Donne could have dodged. He had plenty of time, but at this point he just stood on the sidelines like a puppet, watching his team members bump into him.
That's one scene. The Forest team players anxiously surrounded the coach's seat. Naturally, the center of the crowd was Don lying on the ground. The black striker David Johnson, who made a mistake, even knelt down on the ground and kept praying. If his coach had three strengths and weaknesses, he would be the first player to kill his head coach on the court.
Unlike Forest players who are nervous, most of their opponents stand on the court and watch the movie with their arms around their arms. There are also curious people who take on the role of scouts for the whole team, keep running to watch the fun, and then run back to share the situation in the crowd with their teammates.
The Forest fans in the stands didn't seem to worry about the life or death of their head coach. They took this opportunity to loudly curse their team's poor performance. All kinds of words beginning with “F” or “s” came out of their mouths, and the countless raised middle fingers further complained of “0:2” on the big screen.
Forest team doctor GaryF1eming (GaryF1eming) is still doing his best. He just saw Tony's eyeballs move a bit. Why didn't he respond again after that?
He patted Tony Donne in the face, but there was still no response. The team's acting head coach was lying on the ground like wax, with a slightly open mouth and round eyes, as if he had seen something very surprising.
The blue canopy, white clouds like marshmallow, faces with different skin tones and expressions, and the noisy environment are all very familiar, yet so strange, as if they were thousands of miles away from themselves.
The referee signaled to the team doctor to watch and deal with it himself; he couldn't stop the game endlessly because of an injury on the field. He sounded a whistle to get all the players back on the field, and the game will continue, even though the Forest players are no longer interested in fighting.
“But his life could even be in danger!” Fleming was furious at the referee's indifference; he pointed at Don, who was still lying on the ground, and yelled at the referee.
“Then call an ambulance, I'm just the referee!” The referee came back without showing any weakness. “Also, he didn't seem as dangerous as you said.” He pointed behind Fleming and then ran back to the field.
Fleming turned back and saw Donne stand up slowly, touching the back of his head. He hurriedly went up to support him. “How are you feeling, Tony?”
Don was dazed and asked, “Where is this?”
Fleming turned around and said a swear word. The last time has been really unlucky. “Dees, Dees, come here!” He waved for a golden man on the coach's seat to come over.
The man called “Deus” ran over. “How's Tony?”
“Terrible. He even asked me just now where is this?”
Des's reaction was the same as Fleming's just now; he also turned his head and scolded him.
“I suspect this is the result of the impact he had just fallen to the ground and his back brain had been impacted.”
“Is it really bad, Gary?” Des bit her lip with a dignified face.
“I don't know, maybe it's good, maybe bad.” Fleming shakes his head.
“What does that mean?”
“The good situation was that he only lost his memory for a short time, and it would slow down after taking a break. Bad situation... do you need me to talk about it?”
Des waved and signaled that he understood. “Are you going to take him to the hospital? But now that the game is still going on, and we're behind, we need him to lead the game...” He said he turned his head and looked at Tony Dunne next to him, but to his surprise, Dawn is slowly moving to the players alone.
“Hey!” Des hurriedly threw Fleming down and ran to hold back his colleague.
“Where are you going, Tony?” In a noisy environment, Desu's shouting with open teeth and claws actually only had the effect of “whispering.”
Don looked back and looked blankly at Des. This look made Des chilling. Now the afterglow of the sunset above their heads is shining brightly, but he can't see any brilliance flowing through those eyes at all.
“Where are you going, Tony?” Des repeated one more sentence.
“I... I don't know, maybe... I'm going home...” Donne muttered, still trying to break free from Desu's hands.
Fleming also ran over from the sidelines: “Tony, you can't go home right now. We're playing, you're the head coach, you have to command the team!”
The tug of the three at the entrance of the aisle drew the attention of the two teams on the bench and in the stands. Even the players on the field would take a few glances here from time to time.
Donne laughed out of nowhere: “Am I the coach?” This is ridiculous, how could I be a coach... Even though I'm a fan and I often play soccer manager games, how could I be a coach? This must have been a dream, or a damn nightmare!
Fleming said next to him, like introducing the two people he met for the first time, “He's Des, Desa1ker (desa1ker). A former English international and center back on the field, he only retired from the team last season. Now he's your colleague and assistant.”
Donne nodded and then said to Des, “OK, now that you're directing the game for me, I'm going to take a break.” After speaking, break free of Des' hand and no longer care about the loud booing and two stunned people behind him, and walked into the aisle.
Fleming looked at Dunne's back and also saw Deus Walker.
Walker sighed heavily and turned away. “I can't play this game anymore!”
Donne sat in the aisle, leaning back against the wall, and looked blankly at his surroundings. There's a huge sign on his white wall. Underneath the big red “mushroom,” there are three wavy curves, and below is an English word: Forest.
Where did I get here? What the hell is going on?
Don touched the back of his head, and there was still a vague pain there.
***, sneak up on Laozi and hit Laozi behind him!
“What's my name?” He muttered to himself, but suddenly covered his mouth again. It wasn't until this time that he started speaking bird language all the time — English.
“***, how do you get this?”
When he finally learned where he was, Don was once again dumbfounded. This was so ridiculous that his brain stopped responding after calculating the load. And it all seemed like it had nothing to do with him anymore.
The above is the scene of the students at the City Stadium this afternoon. Tony Dunne, the acting head coach of the Forest team, was knocked over by his team members while standing on the sidelines, and then seemed to fall into a brief coma. When he got back up, he went straight into the players' channel.
With the faint light of street lights outside, Donne stood in the bathroom and looked at himself in the mirror. A middle-aged ghost with an upright nose, deep eyes, blue eyes, and a slightly curved brown head.
In fact, Tang Eun from Sichuan, China is only 26 years old; at the moment, the person in the camera even has head-looking lines! Thirty-four years old! This is Tony Dunne's age.
Not only did he inexplicably lean over to an Englishman, he also made his way forward for 4 years and 3 months!
Although he never thought he was very handsome, he was able to attract the favor of many women.
He yelled at the mirror, then smashed it with one punch. The self in the mirror instantly turned into countless numbers. The pieces fell to the ground and made a loud noise. They looked at Tang with countless faces, as if they were mocking him.
Dawn felt a bit dizzy. He took a step back and gasped loudly against the smooth wall.
After being quiet in the dark for a few minutes, Donald gradually calmed down, and he decided not to think about such complicated questions. He has a habit in China; if something he doesn't like, he goes to a place to drink. There are bars everywhere in Chengdu, so maybe you can find a one-night stand or something by the way. In his mind, he habitually treated Nottingham as Chengdu and decided to go out and find a bar to borrow alcohol to quench his worries.
Taking a look at the hazy sky outside, he walked out the door wearing a thick trench coat.
“After losing O:3 to underdog Walsall at home, the Forests have really been at a disadvantage recently. The highly anticipated Paul Hart did not bring good results to the team. He submitted a resignation request to team chairman nige1doughty (nige1doughty) after the last round of the game, which was quickly approved.”
Today's sports news is being broadcast on a television fixed to an overpass. Naturally, the focus is on everything that happened on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest game.
There was a burst of booing in the noisy bar.
A drunken old man gave the TV his middle finger. “That Tony Dunne, I know him! Little Furry used to be Paul Hart's assistant in the youth team.”
When this drunkard had just finished his long story, Donne just pushed through the door. The sound of the door attracted the attention of most of the people drinking and chatting in the bar. Everyone looked at the door. When they saw who the people came in, they were first surprised, and then a joking smile appeared on their faces.
A typical middle-aged English man stood up with a wine glass and shouted, “Our coach Tony Dunne has arrived!”
“Woohoo!” The people in the bar booed “welcome” in their mouths.
“Cheers for his beautiful breakthrough on the sidelines of Johnson!” The middle-aged man held up the wine glass in his hand, and the people around him immediately followed him and raised the glass in his hand. “Cheers!
Another man, who was clearly a drinker, stood up in front of Don, held a beer bottle in his hand and held a bottle of beer in his hand to his mouth and asked, “Coach Tony Dunne, that was a beautiful defense, but apparently neither the referee nor the public opinion... didn't think that... huh!
After asking, he turned his head and laughed out loud at the other people in this bar.
So with a gloomy face, he pushed away the bottle of wine that was in front of him. Then he went straight to the bar and said to the bartender inside, “Please come for a bottle...” He habitually wanted to say a bottle of “Little Two” — a small bottle of two pot heads. Although he is from Sichuan, his university was in the north and has loved this kind of spirits since then — but he doesn't speak the English of “Little Second” himself; more importantly, he quickly reacted that it was in the UK, not in China. He looked down and mutted a curse, then changed his voice: “Let's have the strongest wine.”
The others who kept watching him heard him say they wanted the strongest wine, and they all shouted loudly.
“Yo! Does timid Tony actually drink alcohol too?”
The young bartender was also a bit overwhelmed by these excited guests. He wanted to get alcohol but was stopped by the drinkers: “Get him juice! juice!”
“No no, it's milk, we have the freshest milk!”
“Ahaha!”
The owner of this bar was shocked by the loud noise from outside. He came downstairs, stood at the stairway, and saw almost all of the guests who hadn't slept on their tables in front of the bar, with a man wrapped in a black trench coat sitting in the middle of them, ridiculed to the fullest by the drinkers.
His loud voice immediately quieted the inside of the tavern. The alcoholic drinkers, who were still arrogant just now, immediately quieted down when they saw the person standing behind them.
Don thought it was strange, who could get this group of people to be honest with just one sentence? He turned his head slightly and saw a man come out of the shadows of the stairwell.
The young bartender hurriedly pointed at the man and said, “Boss, he wants a glass of spirits.”
After the visitor saw who was sitting clearly, he was a bit surprised, but he said, “Just give it to him.”
“But... but they won't let it...” the bartender looked at the alcoholics who had gone back to their seats.
This man looked around the bar, but no one who was swept away by him lowered their heads; either pretended to be asleep or drank hard with their heads down. Don became more interested in the capable middle-aged man in front of him.
“I don't think anyone objected. Pour him a glass of scotch whiskey, I invited him.” The bar owner turned his head and asked Donne, “Single portion or double portion?”
The drinkers laughed as they watched the hustle and bustle from the sidelines.
The bar owner laughed too. “I forgot who you are...” He filled the glass with half a glass of golden whiskey and added half a glass of water. Then it was handed to Donne: “This is wine from my hometown.”
Donne took a sip and immediately started coughing. He rarely drank foreign wine. What's more, this pure Scotch whisky also has a strong coke flavor.
There was a burst of happy laughter in the bar.
“As far as I know, Tony Dunne never drank; he lived like a real traditional Puritan. And he wouldn't look at me like he does now; don't you know who I am?” The man stares at Don, and it seems like Dawn himself is going to be seen through everything by this man now.
He had to find a way to disguise himself. “Uh... me,” Don looked down and took another sip. This time he didn't dare to let the alcohol stay in his throat for an extra second and just swallowed it. Sure enough, that uncomfortable feeling was a bit lighter.
Another burst of laughter.
The man touched the back of his head to show understanding.
Someone next to him helped Don break the siege, and a loud voice shouted, “Looks like our coach Tony really had his head broken! The person sitting next to you is Mr. Kenny Burns (Kenny Burns), the proud hero of the Nottingham Forest team, winner of the 1978 Stanley Mathews Award, and winner of the 1978 Stanley Mathews Award! He's a hundred times better than your stupid donkey!”
The people behind him laughed loudly and kept shouting “stupid donkey,” yet they couldn't help the object of his mocking furious return and spill out the only half glass of wine left in their hands. The golden yellow scotch shone brightly under the light, drawing a beautiful arc in the air, then accurately hit the unlucky guy's face — as accurate and beautiful as David Beckham's right foot free kick. “BANG!”
His swear words were smashed back by a thick wine glass, and Donne swooped on the other party with the glass in an unexpected way that no one else could have imagined. His tone was unbearable. He came to this place inexplicably for four and a half years, and inexplicably ridiculed and humiliated... Now he wants to find someone to divulge it, whether he knocks someone down or someone else knocks him down.
The two hit the back table, an empty bottle of wine fell, and shattered the ground in a crackling sound.
The laughter came to an abrupt end, and everyone was stunned. They didn't expect Tony Dunne, who just looked like a coward, to suddenly explode.
The first person to respond was Kenny Burns, the bar owner, who pushed a fat guy standing next to the bar and shouted, “Why are you standing stupid? Pull them off!”
Apart from the horrible situation on the ground, blood had already oozed from the forehead of the beaten person, and a red circle appeared there, just a mark from the mouth of the cup. Other than that, he got a punch on his left cheek and was as red as if he had been drunk.
And Donald, apart from messing up his head and clothes, nothing happened. Pulled up, he seemed to have already vented his anger; he didn't have to go after him. He tidied up his clothes and head, then shouted at the unlucky guy being held by his partner: “No matter who you are, don't mess with me.”
Then he turned around and said to Burns, “I'm so sorry for making a mess for you here. “Too much today***...” He was annoyed as soon as he thought he had been traversed. “Another day... I'll personally apologize, so don't worry about compensation.”
Then, without waiting for the bar owner to say anything, he turned around and walked towards the door. When he passed by the fat guy, he also mocked, “Leave your milk to yourself to drink, fat pig.”
Everyone watched him push out the door, but no one thought they would stop him, just watch him leave, leaving behind a mess.
There was silence in the bar. At this point, the drunken alcoholic got up from the table, looked at the silent people in the room and in disarray, and asked in confusion, “Have I missed anything?”
I don't want to be a ghost! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Donne shout like that?
Since your “past life” was pretty bad, why not use this opportunity to have a different life? Although he's never been a soccer coach, he's also been watching soccer for over ten years. He has played soccer manager games for every generation. Learn more about the nature of the work of some coaches. Isn't this a great opportunity for a challenge?
He stopped thinking about why God chose him for such boring questions. He now just needs to think about how to act more like a real career coach, and although it will be difficult, it's worth trying.
“Hey man. You broke into my house without my permission, and I made dozens of calls if you don't leave, I'll call the police!” Suddenly, an old voice sounded next to me.
Don looked blankly at the old man standing across from him. He held many, many newspapers in his arms and a hamburger that was half bitten in his hand.
“Is this... your home?” He pointed to the bench underneath himself**.
“Of course.”
“Ah, I'm sorry to have bothered you...” Donn got up from his chair, immediately sat down, then lay down. Cover yourself with the newspapers in your arms and press them firmly between the backrest of the chair and your body.
Looking at the contented beggar eating a burger and lying in the “newspaper nest,” Don even wanted to thank God for not letting himself “stick” to him. It wasn't bad for fate to treat him.
A taxi got off in front of him, and he quickly walked forward and drilled in. Donne took one last look at the beggar in the car enjoying his “dinner” in the cold wind, and asked the driver to take him back to his strange home.
Starting today, a whole new world slowly unfolds before Don's eyes. It was sunny and sunny on Saturday morning, and Zhao Yao was on his way to sterilization... neutering his family's cat.
The cat bag I was carrying was a yellow tanuki cat, also known as an orange cat, a type of garden cat. The head, back, and limbs are all covered by a layer of yellow-orange markings.
The chest and stomach are covered with thick white hairs, and the tips of the limbs are white. It is said that these snow-white gloves have a killing effect on girls. They control their brain waves and make them make an “ah~~ah~~” sound.
Although it's a male cat, it has big eyes and looks very feminine.
At this point, the cat was making a heart-wrenching howl. The vast majority of domestic cats are very homey and only want to stay at home for the rest of their lives. Moving or going out is a very scary thing for them. Zhao Yao only kept on comforting the cat.
Meanwhile, outside of the Earth's atmosphere, a dark meteor slowly swept through outer space and gradually flew over China. The surface of the meteor sparkled a strange light, and seemed to be continuously emitting some kind of radiation into the surrounding void.
At the Star Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao left the cat bag at the front desk: “The male cat was sterilized. I had an appointment before. The last name is Zhao.”
“You haven't been to us before you read the records. You need to fill out the medical record card information field.”
In outer space, the meteor slowly swept over the land of China and began moving in the direction of the Pacific Ocean. As the meteor passed, many cats suddenly shook their bodies. The deep glow flashed through their eyes, just like the light emitted by the meteor.
At this point, the matcha suddenly moved, struggled, and flew towards the hospital gate.
The little nurse screamed, but Zhao Yao, who was on the sidelines, swooped out violently and grabbed the matcha that had escaped.
Zhao Yao's speed was still too slow. He couldn't grab the matcha's body; he only grabbed the matcha tail.
The tail was caught, and Matcha made a roar. Instinctively looking back and biting at Zhao Yao. This was a feline instinct, and it was also extremely fast. In an instant, she opened a mouth on the back of Zhao Yao's hand. As soon as Zhao Yao had a back pain, she immediately let go of her palm.
Maybe she knew she was in trouble, but Matcha didn't keep running away; she just curled up and looked at Zhao Yao with some unease.
Zhao Yao hugged the matcha airway and said, “Silly cat, what did you bite, you rebelled, right!”
The matcha cat's eyes suddenly flashed through a glimmer of light, and the traces of blood on her teeth completely disappeared.
Zhao Yao also felt that his head had suddenly fainted a bit. Then he wanted to see if the wound on the back of his hand was deep or not, but this look was slightly dazed. He only saw a smooth surface on the back of his hand; there were any wounds or blood stains.
The little nurse on the side took the cat and comforted her and said, “Obedient matcha, it's fine, it'll be fine for a while, don't be nervous.”
This cry was heard in Zhao Yao's ear, but it wasn't just a cat cry; it became an understandable statement.
Chao Yao pointed in shock at the matcha in front of her eyes and said in surprise, “This... this... this cat is talking!”
The little nurse looked at Zhao Yao in doubt and said, “Mr. Zhao, are you okay?”
“Didn't you hear that?” Zhao Yao hurriedly said, “It... it's talking.”
The little nurse raised her eyebrows and looked at Zhao Yao's eyes getting weirder and weirder.
“Can you hear me meow?”
“Take me home!”
“Whoa whoa whoa, that scared me to pee ~ meow.”
Zhao Yao suddenly opened her mouth. After watching it, she was unaware. The little nurse was still comforting the matcha. After reading the matcha, she also read the matcha and said, “Can you understand what I'm saying?”
“Understood, understood, I want to go home, take me home, whoooooooo.”
The little nurse on the other side turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao talking to the cat, but her face was getting weirder and weirder.
Despite the little nurse's strange gaze, Zhao Yao quickly picked up the matcha and stuffed it back into her bag and trotted all the way out of the hospital.
Inside the rental house, the matcha cat immediately relaxed when it came back to its familiar environment. Lying on the coffee table, she began licking her little white hands. Her eyes squinted, and her face was relaxed. For cats, licking hair has always been a great relaxing act.
A few days before tea, Zhao Yao stared dead at the matcha cat in front of her and tried to say, “Can you still talk?”
As soon as I said it, I stood up and was eager to try, “Does the owner want to play games?”
“Ah, this... wait and play.” Zhao Yao grabbed the back of her head and was somewhat overwhelmed and said, “When did you learn to talk?”
Looking at the innocent matcha cat, Zhao Yao had a strange face.
But the matcha cat didn't feel strange about the situation in front of her. It suddenly jumped into Zhao Yao's arms, squinted and rubbed Zhao Yao's body, whispering: “Play games with me.”
Looking at the matcha cat talking like a five-year-old child in front of her, Zhao Yao touched each other's heads; the latter screamed in pleasure.
“By the way, you're only one year old; now you're only five years old as a human.” There was a smile on the corner of Zhao Yao's mouth: “You're still a kid. That sounds great.”
A month later, at nine o'clock in the middle of the night.
With a tired face, Zhao Yao opened the rental house door, took off her clothes, and sat down on the couch.
Although the rental house he lives in is only 30 square meters, it is the house that the newlyweds used to live in. It is also very close to the company, so he doesn't have to worry about transportation problems when working overtime every day, so even though the rent isn't cheap, it still makes Zhao Yaozheng feel happy.
After Zhao Yao lay down, the matcha cat unwittingly climbed up beside him and rubbed his arm with its head, looking friendly and flirtatious.
Zhao Yao smiled and rubbed Matcha's head; the latter showed a happy expression.
But just then, the phone on the couch was also pushed over by matcha.
CHAPTER 1
Tang Moer was lying on the table, with her thin white arms resting on her little head, and her long, dark, satin hair flowy down in the middle of the sky, showing half of her young girl's beautiful little face. Huh, it's hot, so hot.
What's going on?
There was a steady stream of heat and dryness in her body that burned her little face, making her feel uncomfortable. Today, she came to the Imperial Capital from Yecheng and just drank a glass of plain water brought to her by Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, the younger sister of her half-mother.
“No good, Tang Moer has jumped off. Go chase her, you can't let her run away!”
Tang Moer was so excited that she was more than half awake; Han Xiaowan actually designed her!
What should I do?
Tang Moer looked at the man as if he had caught a lifesaver. “Mister, save me, I've been drugged. There are a few men in the back who want to attack me.”
The man's cold, narrow eyes passed over the girl and took a look at the few men in the back. Although his eyes were faint, they made people shudder.
Those few men are little bastards, and they have seen the world a few times. They have seen this man who covers the headlines of the entire financial magazine and controls the lifeblood of the entire imperial capital's economy on TV.
Gu Mohan.
They definitely couldn't stir up this man, so they just turned around and ran away. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, an earth-shattering war is taking place. Angels with burning flames, knights with heavy armor, crusaders with long golden swords are fighting against a group of bone dragons covered in black smoke, the terrible death knights, and countless evil Skeleton soldiers.
The battle ground between the two sides is not a plain of war and smoke, or a burial ground full of skeletons, but in the dark and invisible edge of darkness. This is certainly a very strange imagination.
But what's even more bizarre is that outside of this battlefield, in the empty space shrouded in endless darkness, you can hear a few vague whispering voices whispering?
“Operate it, do it quickly! OMG!”
“When talking about others, just control your Death Knight first! Death Knight and Mobile Bunker are fighting! !”
“Where are my troops? Who's attacking my troops? Where's the enemy?”
After the battle was over, the angels, knights, and fleeing Skeleton Soldiers that originally existed on the battlefield also disappeared into the darkness of the background. Once again, it returned to a state of absolute silence shrouded in endless darkness. It seemed like nothing had ever happened before.
But a few voices are still talking about something, and even more others have joined in.
“My teammates are just a bunch of pigs! Strappy dogs are better than them! Not only was there no help in the battle situation, but they also had to seize command of the core forces...” The voice that had previously failed said a bit unwilling.
“Whoa! It's clearly because the undead creatures are so weak; if they were replaced by my army of demons, it definitely wouldn't be the same...” Another voice also made an unrelenting counterattack and forcibly justifying his mistaken command: “I originally thought the Death Knight could solve those bunkers very easily.”
After hearing this voice, I couldn't help but hear a few chuckles in the dark, and both sides of the argument lost their temper. They had no choice but to say to the victorious side, “Your skills are not as good as people; they are willing to give up.”
And the winner actually carried out a round of unflattering taunts at this point?
“Haha! In the end, justice will triumph over evil!”
“In the face of our power, whether it's the undead or the devil, even the gods will kill you!”
There is no doubt that this kind of statement is even more popular. The two sides, which had already calmed down, immediately began a new round of scolding, and the third person on the winning side, who was outside of this new battlefield, asked, “Shouldn't I have organized this round of games?”
It turns out that the fierce and intense battle before was just a game?
A voice that didn't participate in the game responded, “Being able to simulate a realistic war with your senses makes all of the bystanders feel like you're in an immersive situation. It's amazing. Sure enough, you're really good at bringing us surprises. I hope you.”
Faced with the other person's sudden thanks, the guy called Hope replied in a low-key manner, “You've won the prize; this is just a pastime.”
Yes, the battle of life and death between the righteous and evil camps was nothing more than a pastime; it only added a little bit of fun to this endless prison.
This is a field of the void outside of reality. It is supposed to be a Jedi that is always dark, cold, and silent. There will be no living creatures alive; it is a realm more fearsome than death.
However, in a place like this, where it is difficult to hold any living thing, there is a group of creatures that are difficult to characterize stubbornly. They have lost their bodies, and only their last consciousness remains in this empty space.
They claim to be Skywalkers and are imprisoned forever in this prison called the Void.
Before they were imprisoned here, they were all powerful people of all races and fields, mages who reached the pinnacle of magic, warriors who touched the limits of martial arts, alchemists who created everything, staunch and noble missionaries, demons that ruled hell, witches that controlled souls, etc., and so on. They had left their names in every position of history.
Many people think that they have long died out. There are only historical records that prove that they ever existed, but they don't know that these old monsters, strong enough to be described as perverts, are actually imprisoned in an endless void outside of their positions. They have lived through unfathomable years there, and seem to be imprisoned here forever. The seemingly thin barrier between reality and the void is a wall of sigh that they can never break through. Nah what.
But they never gave up hope of getting out of trouble, because among these 33 Skywalkers, there is an extremely special presence, the Fifth Walker codenamed Hope.
I hope the original name of Bai Kai didn't come from the size and size of human survival outside of the void, but from a strange place called Earth. He was an editor of a small news website during his lifetime. His daily job was to extract news from other websites at home and abroad, then replace it with something like Shocking!
It's an aggressive and tedious job to post titles like Men Will Shed Tears, Women Will Be Silent, etc. on my website.
Bai Yu, who later lived and died due to an accident, did not immediately lose consciousness. Instead, she entered this mysterious void under the influence of the sun and met several other Skywalkers. In the end, she survived so strong until this moment.
The Nailwalker insisted that he from a different world would be the key to getting out of this endless prison. “Only if you are unique and want to get out of here, you are our only opportunity. I believe in this, so I call you with the code name of hope.” The first walker in the Void, codenamed Magician, once said this to him.
They have always believed this, believing that one day they will be able to see the light again, even if they have been imprisoned for countless times, hundreds of years? How many millennia?
If you want to stay in this immutable prison for thousands of years without going crazy, chatting or discussion alone is clearly not enough. In fact, the most important means for Skywalkers to spend time is an activity called memory sharing.
This activity is based on an awareness technique called memory backtracking. Using memory backtracking, people can recall every detail they have experienced, even clearly recall every punctuation mark on a newspaper.
Then, through a certain amount of editing, remove some memories you don't want others to see, such as going to bed with a woman or sleeping with your left and right hands, and then exchange the memories with the other person. This is tantamount to enjoying a super long movie about someone else's life. This is a great way to pass the time.
The memory of 33 Voidwalkers is equivalent to having him go through 33 lives. Even though he later forgot most of his memories to avoid memory chaos and only kept their knowledge and experience, his state of mind also sifted out all kinds of weaknesses such as naivety and impetuousness in these 33 life experiences, and he became mature and calm, and he was no longer the ordinary person on Earth.
That's why he's placed high hopes on him by the other Skywalkers, yet these countless years have passed, and even he can't find any chance to break away; the only thing he can do is just make this boring and boring time a little less boring.
Meanwhile, at this time, the reality of East was about to fall at night. As the afterglow of the sunset filled the whole of Xiansai College, the students finally finished the day's heavy schoolwork. Accompanied by young and energetic laughter, they walked three, three, two, two, two, three, two, and two on one of the college's tree-lined paths.
Maya, a second-year Soul A student, is also one of them. She has a lovely, pretty face, long black hair curled into two equally adorable ponytails, and wears a standard uniform from Fairy College. After saying a simple farewell to her classmates, she came to the college square alone, found a bench to sit down at will, then pulled out half of the bread left over from dinner by carefully tearing the bread into bits of debris and then finely sprinkling it on the bluestone floor of the square.
Moments later, there was a fluttering sound of wings in the middle of the air. A few white pigeons quickly fell to Miya's feet. While bowing their heads and pecking at the bread crumbs she had spilled, Miya carefully crouched down, and her long ponytails gently swept to the ground along with her movements. She looked quietly at this group of pigeons and her already familiar pigeons, showing a happy smile on her face.
A beautiful young girl, a gentle white pigeon, stands quietly in a square with several statues, and is surrounded by lush vegetation. Under the golden afterglow at the end of the sunset, they come together into a beautiful picture.
It's something Miya does every day, and it's also the most relaxing moment of her day. As a student with average qualifications, life at Xiansai College, an institution of higher learning always seems extremely difficult.
“It's almost getting dark. I'll be here today. I still have to go back to practice. Goodbye, Mr. Pigeon.” With a relaxed smile on her face, Miya said goodbye to the group of pigeons. She pulled off her short uniform dress, slender legs wrapped in white stockings, and quickly rushed back to her dorm room.
The evening is also an important time to study, especially for a gifted student like Mia. The effort required is not as easy as the smile on her face forever.
1. Chapter 1
At the Soviet mansion, in the huge martial arts arena, a martial arts soul awakening ceremony is being held.
The young man on the altar, named Su Yu, is the son of an elder from the Su family. He is extremely talented.
Sumo, the son of Su Hong, the head of the Su family, completed nine weight quenching at the age of 14. He is known as the greatest genius of the Su family.
Now that a genius like Su Yu has appeared, the martial arts spirit that has been awakened with Sumo's talent will surely not be worse than Su Yu.
If Sumo can also awaken martial arts spirits of the 5th rank and above, then the Soviet family will be able to have two top geniuses this time. The future development of their Su family is no small feat.
When the host elder called out this name, all the disciples, elders, and others were shocked to look at the Qingxiu teenager next to them. In their eyes, the anticipation was so strong that it even surpassed that of Su Yu before.
Sumo looked calm and walked to the top of the altar.
Su Yu, who walked off the altar, had an arrogant face and a cold smile at Sumo. Her eyes were full of provocation.
Sumo ignored each other. He took a deep breath, sat on his knees, and closed his eyes.
A rune light immediately floated from under the altar, continuously burrowing into Sumo's body.
His talent is at the top of the Su family. He completed his body hardening when he was only 15 years old. It can't be described as a bad talent. However, he was always overpowered by Sumo.
At this time, there were more and more flickering runes on the altar, enveloping Sumo's body.
Sumo, sitting with his eyes closed, had a slight shortness of breath, and a burst of roar gradually sounded from his body.
Everyone stopped breathing, staring their eyes on the altar!
Boom!
Finally, as soon as there was an explosion, a dark ghost suddenly rose. The dark ghost looked like a black hole. It slowly rotates inside and is not bottom-deep, giving people a sense of coolness.
At the same time, a yellow halo shimmers above the ghost.
ah!
In an instant, everyone's eyes immediately became sluggish.
An aura?
The lowest level of martial arts?
How is this possible?
Even Su Yu's face was full of sluggishness, and she was stunned.
Because he couldn't have imagined it at all, the first genius of the Su family actually only awakened the first-level martial arts soul, the lowest level martial arts soul!
Sumopan was sitting on the altar, and his eyes slowly opened. Seeing his martial spirit, he was also held back.
“A human-level martial arts soul...!” Sumo muttered to himself, evoking a bitter smile at the corners of his mouth. He had no idea that he had actually awakened a low-level martial arts spirit!
The most trashy martial arts soul?” “I actually woke up an abandoned martial arts spirit!
“What a first genius is simply the first waste of my Su family.”
For a while, everyone, including the Su parents, the deacons, etc., looked at Sumo changed. They were disappointed, disdainful, and disdainful.
At the altar, Sumo slowly got up and clenched her fists unconsciously.
After a cold glance, Sumo smiled in his heart: “These people are really snobbish!”
In the past, Sumo was extremely talented, and everyone was kind to him. Wherever he went, he shouted back and forth, hugged, and his horse-butt clapped.
Now that he has awakened his trashy martial arts spirit, these people immediately changed their mouths and faces.
Sumo shook her head, didn't compare with them, and walked off the altar and walked away.
There was a slight itch on my face, and there seemed to be grass all around me.
“Didn't I die in a car accident? Why are you alive again?”
He was a bit surprised, but before he had time to figure out how he had escaped death, the scene in front of him immediately widened his eyes with excitement. I was immediately dumbfounded!
You can't do it! How can such a good-looking girl go anywhere?
Xu Wei widened her eyes. I just watched as the beautiful girl completely dropped her skirt in front of her eyes, and the slutty pants on the inside came off little by little. What I saw was a white and tender white patch, with a body scent unique to a woman's body.
“Girl, what are you doing, but you can't urinate anywhere!”
The scene came to an end. She screamed and put down her skirt in a panic. Her whole body bounced off the ground, but actually flew through the air with a sharp sword.
Damn, what is this? Imperial sword flying in the sky?
Turns out, they really are fairies?
Xu was shocked. At the same time, a bunch of strange yet familiar memories suddenly popped up in his head, as if he had experienced them all his life.
I made it through the hell!
Immediately reading the file, the memories that didn't belong to her mind were her own; Xu was able to sort everything out.
This turned out to be a world of immortals. Just like the angry little fairy in front of you, the imperial sword and the sky, people can practice all kinds of techniques to become immortals.
However, the owner of this picture of my own body is today's Grandpa Ma, yet this Grandpa Ma is an extremely unlucky bastard.
He himself is just a poor orphan, yet he has a unique spiritual root that is rare in a thousand years.
When he was young, by chance, he was favored by the emperor and offered him countless natural treasures to practice. In just six years, he developed stomach cramps and entered the Jindan period.
It was on the day he set foot in the Jintan period that he actually went into a cave with the princess, so he spent seven days and seven nights in a row in his wedding bed. As a result, the beautiful and flirtatious princess actually made up his entire body to make up for it, and even his talents were taken away.
The genius Grandpa Ma became an abandoned person as soon as a newlywed. Having no use of any value, he was sent out of the palace overnight in a low-key manner. He was slapped to death by people arranged by the emperor on his way to the frontier. He died out of his breath, and was finally abandoned here.
“Alas, what a pity!”
Having cleared up these memories, Xu's face was full of regret. He shook his head and sighed, and said in annoyance, “Damn it! Why didn't you go one step earlier to the thrill of being crazy about exercising in bed with the gorgeous princess?”
Remembering the beauty of the gorgeous princess in her wedding bed, her proud stature, and all her style of relaxation, Xu Wei felt even more sorry; she came one step too late!
“A daring thief, who dared to spy on this girl going to the toilet, gave me my orders!”
At this point, an outcry came suddenly; it was the fairy who went back and forth.
Her face was full of shame and anger, but with endless murderous intent in her eyes. She also stepped on the grim, sharp sword under her feet, and killed Xu Wei.
“Damn, fairy, this is definitely a misunderstanding! It's clear that you're crouching with your butt where I'm lying, and... even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, why don't you lift your pants first? The way you look has left me with no motivation to run away!” Xu Wei shouted, pulled out his leg, and ran.
The woman's face immediately changed. Her red face raised the slutty pants under her dress, shouted, and exclaimed, “The thief is looking for death.” The speed at which the sharp sword flew under his feet suddenly increased, and he headed towards Xu Wei to kill him.
Running through the runaway, Xu Bai frantically thought of a way to escape.
All of a sudden, there was a flash of light in my head.
Immediately, as soon as I stopped, reached out and pulled out a familiar token from my arms, I turned around and shouted at the woman, “Bold demon girl, I'm the current Huoyuan country horse. How dare you disrespect me? Be careful I criticize you of the Nine Nationalities!”
At this point, a series of system prompts suddenly sounded in Xu Wei's head.
“Congratulations to the host 'Xu Bi' for activating the imitation punch system. This system will protect you and help you pretend to help you fly!”
“Congratulations to the host for successfully pretending to be 'Xu'. The reward package is worth 1 point. Can you redeem it in the mall?”
“The system has detected that the host's ability to 'Xu Lian' is poor, making it difficult to survive in this world's difficult conditions. The bonus is a bonus for newbies. Can you check the package?”
At the same time as the prompt sounds, a light curtain window pops up in front of you, showing several pieces of information data.
Xu Wei first took a breath and burst into laughter following his uncontrollable loud voice. What kind of face-punching system is this? As soon as I heard it, it was just an anti-sky system that was tailor-made for me to help me break through the skyline! Now it's time to have fun.
“Thief, death is imminent, what's funny about you?”
Suddenly, an outcry pulled Xu Wei back from his ecstasy.
I don't know when the woman was standing about ten meters in front of him, pointing at him with a flying sword in her hand, but the big eyes of the Water Spirit were wary of watching him suspiciously.
“Come on... you want to do it with me, don't you? Is there something you can try closer to me?”
“Phew, congratulations to the host for successfully pretending to be 'Xu'. The reward is worth 1 point.”
As a result, the system prompt that only he could hear in Xu's ear sounded again, and he couldn't help but laugh again. “By the way, it looks like there's also a gift pack.”
Immediately, the image in the light curtain window in front of me changed, and a square gift box appeared. The gift box was opened, and a few streams of light leaped out, then flashed away.
“Congratulations to the host, Xu Wei, for getting the first level of EXP. You can get 10,000 experience points by taking it.”
“Congratulations to the host, 'Xu Bi', for getting two Beginner's Walking Escape Charms. After use, they can instantly move anywhere within a radius of five kilometers.”
“Congratulations to the host, 'Xu Bi', for getting the first level of “The Five Elements of Taikoo” (note: the first level can only be practiced until the foundation building period, and can be redeemed at the mall later).”
“Yes, we have detected that the host 'Xu Wei' has no active roots. If the training conditions are not met, the system will fill up all the roots for you.”
Immediately, Xu Wei felt his body was being penetrated by an electric current, and his scalp instantly became numb.
What followed was a feeling of comfort. The pores all over the body seemed to have been completely opened, greedily drawing the spirit of the four sides.
Boom!
Soon, he felt that his body had changed dramatically and became closer to nature, as if he could integrate into everything and control everything.
However, he knows very well how familiar this feeling is. Back then, when the Heavenly Fire Spirit had not yet been taken away by the princess, he had such a affectionate feeling about the flames. Today, the system not only repairs his Heavenly Fire Rex, but also supplements all other attributes.
Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth all five spiritual roots are all at once, and each one is at the highest level of “heaven.”
I'll go the other way; this is going against the sky!
Thinking about this, Xu Wei finally couldn't help but raise her arms and shout, “The system is in my hands. What kind of huo is the princess and emperor of Huoyuan, when I upgrade and return, I will step on all of you under my feet and smash them.”
“An audacious thief, since he claims to be a victim of the Huoyuan Kingdom, still dares to make crazy remarks and try to beat Jun?” The woman next to me was a bit silly. Is this crazy dishearted?
“Pheh, congratulations to the host 'Xu Wei' for successfully pretending to be forced. Getting the impersonation is worth 1 point.”
Only then did Xu Wei take it easy. The corners of her mouth slackened slightly. Damn, she pretended to look forward to the future. She almost forgot about the trouble right now; she had to quickly find a way to run.
“Yes, experience Dan!”
He suddenly remembered that there was also a beginner's experience kit in the Starter Pack.
Without the slightest hesitation, I hurriedly thought about the operating system interface, opened a package, and three items suddenly appeared in it.
“Use, use.” Xu Wei stared at two of the items and shouted in his heart.
“Phew, congratulations to the host “Xu Wei” for successfully practicing the “Five Elements of Taikoo”.”
“Hmm, the host 'Xu Wei' took the first level of experience and received 10,000 experience points.”
“Congratulations to the host 'Xu Wei' for upgrading. The current Realm gas refining period is on the first level.”
“Congratulations to the host 'Xu Wei' for upgrading. The current Realm gas refining period is on the 3rd floor.”
“Congratulations to the host 'Xu Wei' for upgrading. The current Realm gas refining period is on the 10th floor.”
In just a few short minutes, Xu Wei went from being a mortal with no restrained chicken to being an immortal, sprinting directly to the 10th floor of the gas refining period, only one step away from the foundation construction period.
Moreover, his current strength is actually much stronger than the normal 10-story gas refining period.
The reason is that he has five Heavenly Spiritual Roots, which is equivalent to one person having five times the strength of an ordinary person.
Even under the compatibility attributes of these five different types of Reiki, the power that erupts is far more than five times as simple.
“There's really nothing more to say this time. I'm not invincible, who is invincible?”
Xu Wei couldn't help but feel excited. But at this point, the woman on the other side waved a stream of light and walked through the sky, and the sharp blade of the sword flew over like a poisonous snake in the blink of an eye.
“Damn, fairy, I'm just asking you, this little beauty, to take care of Grandpa Benjama. Who made you shoot the sword? This is a sneak attack on you!”
Xu Wei was shocked when he saw the Flying Sword attack. He immediately opened his mouth and scolded.
They scolded and scolded, but the movements under their feet weren't vague at all. They followed the trend and slipped backwards. The tips of my fingers actually condensed a glimmer of water energy and fluttered softly against the oncoming sword blade.
“When!”
There was a murmuring sound, and the sharp sword was blown off by him.
“How... is this possible?”
The woman stopped right away. The Zongmun who was able to crack this sword so lightly, not to mention the unfathomable teachers and uncles, at least the brothers and sisters who built a six-story foundation period could do it!
“I'm just wondering. They all said what just happened was a misunderstanding. You're still getting tangled up; you still want to kill me? Don't think I won't hit you if you look like a fairy. Anyway, I haven't seen it clearly just now; this time I'll watch it in a bright and honest way.”
Xu Wei scolded in annoyance. Yu Bu stepped out under his feet, and Tuyuan's reiki quickly integrated into the earth. The speed suddenly doubled, and she appeared in front of the woman in the blink of an eye.
Following that, a ray of Water Reiki gushed out of her palm and surrounded all sides. The woman had time to react in the future and was banned on the spot.
“Pervert... horny thief, what do you want to do?” The woman was stunned and felt that the Fire Reiki in her body had been completely suppressed.
“Hehe! Since you all call me a scumbag? Then I can't just carry this pot in vain.”
Xu Wei had a smirking face. As soon as her eyebrows were raised, she reached out and slashed directly at the woman's skirt.
Chapter 1: If You Had an Afterlife, Dance the World with Jun!
Nine-fold sky, sea of clouds, wind and thunderstorm, first-line sky!
Here is the mainland of the Nine Heavens. For three days, a Jedi Land, the Wind and Thunderstorm! You can catch wind and thunder on the top, and get out of the first line of the sky!
But at the moment, on the windstorm, there is a mist of a fishy wind!
“Chu Yang, hand over the nine heist swords! I won't die!”
“Chu Yang, the number one thing in the world, such as the Jiujiajian, is in your hands. It's been so many years that you haven't made any progress; it's just a crass thing! Let's just hand it over.
A burst of hustle and bustle came from all sides.
The look in my eyes was still as calm and settled as a rock! -My body is still as straight as a javelin gun!
Just like the sword in his hand, it's full of meaning of rather than bending over! Even though he's been mortally wounded!
Under his feet, within a radius of hundreds of feet, there were countless broken limbs, and blood was pouring out.
Watching the crowd of experts who just shouted around but didn't rush over, Chu Yang had a mocking smile on his face. He was arrogant and disdainful!
People like this, no matter how high their mentality is, no matter how many people there are; even if they can kill me ten thousand times, they don't deserve to be enemies of me!
How could the events of the Jiu Jiken in his own hands be revealed? It took me three years to find an opportunity to risk nine deaths and get to the last three days when I visited the thunderstorm for three years before I finally found an opportunity and risked nine deaths for the rest of my life to arrive in the first three days, but why did I encounter such a massive ambush after arriving here?
Today, I'm in my third day, and I'm only on my fifth day! Today's situation is pure death! I've always been famous for my secret whereabouts; who knows my plans?
I rushed over a dozen times in a row, and every time, I was blocked back by someone! And the places I chose were all dead spots!
Extremely affectionate, extremely sword! Destroy your feelings for swords, use kendo to get into martial arts, seek heaven with martial arts, and kill all over the world at the cost of a lifetime of loneliness. Unfortunately, after all, you still can't do the nine heist sword, and practice nine times the Tenjin Gong!
Did you make the wrong choice? or is this path simply wrong?
A ruthless swordsman is a ruthless swordsman. If a swordsman has feelings, what kind of swordsman is he? Kendo, martial arts, and Tendo are all ruthless after all... but now at the time of life and death, why are they so shaken?
What exactly is your secret, nine robberies?
Watching the people around him greedily staring at Jiu Jian Jian, Chu Yang smiled bitterly in his heart. You only know that you can be invincible in the world if you get these nine heists, but do you know how much I've paid for these nine heists?
There's nothing left.
Blood was flowing, and Chu Yang clearly sensed that his life was passing rapidly. He pursued martial arts all his life, entering, breaking up, and ruthlessly dying. At the moment of death, he thought his only regret was that he didn't reach the highest level of his life's pursuit in his life, but what he didn't expect was that at this moment, a figure he had actually popped up in his mind that he had already forgotten.
Mo Qingdou, Chuyang's infatuation with an unflattering woman!
“Turns out, I'm not really breaking my heart...” Chu Yang muttered to herself, with a self-deprecating smile at the corner of her mouth.
A hint of remorse spread quietly in his heart, like smoke, and swept through his entire mind in an instant.
Dance lightly! I don't know if I might meet you when I go to Huangquan this time?
“Let's all play together! I simply chopped him up! As for the nine heists, it's not too late for us to discuss it!” One person shouted, “If not, wait for him to respond, it will be our turn to spend a lot of money!” There was an outpouring of promise from the crowd around them. They immediately held swords in unison and surrounded Chuyang.
“Never dance lightly for the rest of your life; dance for the rest of your life; dance for the rest of your life, dance the rest of your life!”
This is a small poem written by Mo Qingwu from A Night of Love. I still remember that Mo Qingwu had tears in her eyes at the time, and her eyes were puzzled and complaining. She... knew she was using her feelings to practice, yet she still threw it into her arms like a moth fighting a fire, and let her burn to her heart's content!
After hearing the news myself, I immediately rushed away, but in the end I was one step behind. Although she later exterminated all the members of the family that hurt Mo Qingdou and did not leave behind the nine chickens and dogs, the beautiful woman was unable to recover after all!
On the verge of death, the immortal redhead lay softly in her arms and said to herself, “Chu Yang, if I had another life... if I could meet you, I hope you can... take a good look at me. I look better than a sword!”
Dance lightly, you're not satisfied; you have regrets; otherwise, why would you have tears in the corners of your eyes?
Two tears were shed, but they shattered my heart at that moment! Since then, my heart has been covered in dust!
Life and death go hand in hand!
This is a poem specially written by Mo Qingwu, the most talented person in the world, who felt Mo Qingwu's affectionate feelings for Chuyang.
But now, dance lightly, you've reached Jiuxiao, and I'm still in the world... but I'll be able to follow your life and death right away... live and die!
Chu Yang was astonishing in her thoughts. She always had cold corners of her mouth, and had a gentle, poignant smile.
Dance lightly and wait for me!
Light dance, you know, if I had another life, I'd rather not practice any kendo, be at the pinnacle, rather than take revenge, and be with you! What in the world can match your satisfied laugh?
Nothing! Not bitter... dance lightly, you suffer, but you don't feel bitter, now... I'm bitter!
More and more swords were added to the body, blood was flying out, and the pain was focused little by little from all over the body, finally interrupting the song and dance in my mind!
Chuyang's furious cry! Suddenly I stood up, and my long black hair soared violently!
Chu Yang's heart ached. As soon as she looked down, the crackling sound hanging from her neck shattered right in front of her eyes. Time is desperate!
This is the only thing I can remember about the light dance!
“Kill!” Chu Yang suddenly looked up, and there was a frantic rush of murder in his eyes. With a raging sound, the Jiujou Sword suddenly shook off a thousand swords of light in his hand, just like the Lightning of the Nine Days suddenly connected to a waistband!
There was a thud, and all of the weapons around him were neatly cut off!
Everyone hurriedly retreated and watched in horror as Chu Yang had a neat circle and a half of weapons under his feet, and cold sweat trickled down from his vests. I couldn't have imagined the power of the Nine Swords and the Hit of One Hit; it was so scary!
Chu Yang took a look and suddenly asked softly, “Do you want the nine heists?”
Without waiting for anyone to answer, he laughed coldly and slowly said, “OK! I'll show you the Nine Swords!”
All of a sudden, he jumped up! He had already been fatally injured countless times, but he actually jumped!
“Nine swords, a little bit of cold light shines brightly!”
As the arc came out, tens of millions of cold rays rushed out!
Kuju Heavenly Sword! One sword!
The nine-fold sky is the name of this continent. I've never dared to use these three words to name any sword in history, but these nine sword robbers simply use the name “nine heavy heaven”!
From time immemorial, this is the only set!
Although Chu Yang was unable to use the true power of the Jiujou Sword Sword Method, he had understood these swords for a long time. Although the power of these few swords is not as great as one might think, they also far surpass secular swords.
There are dozens of expert players around. The sword of intelligence is no small feat. They all showed off their abilities at the bottom of the pressure box and tried their best to withstand this attack! Everyone's bodies were shaking, and they felt the weapons in their hands, but they almost didn't hold it steady.
“Why don't you rob nine swords and slay all the world!”
The first move is unfinished; the second move has already taken a deadly turn! The rush of light is like the ocean's high tide, and endless killing machines are shooting out all over the place!
There was a scream. There were about a dozen players who were good enough to dominate one side. At the same time, they tried their best to resist them, but they still had blood all over their bodies, and they retreated!
At this moment, everyone has an illusion: now Chuyang is definitely not hurt! Absolutely in perfect condition!
But they didn't know. They interrupted Chuyang's memories, interrupted Mo Qingdou's songs and dances, made Chuyang completely furious, and completely unleashed all of his physical potential! This is the power of life, the fury of the soul!
“If you steal nine swords, you'll be king as soon as you gather the storm!”
Chu Yang Huoran opened her eyes and yelled, “Why? Why not?”
In the distance, in three directions, three kinds of light rise at the same time, transforming into three golden shadows in the air! Fearful and dazzling, with unparalleled fervor.
I'm just a martial artist. Although I'm only one level short of the king rank, this level is tantamount to the difference between heaven and earth!
Three kings! What a big pen!
“But for the past three days, it's not a place in your district where the Poison Sword and Martial Arts can go wild!” One person softly said, “It's just a pity that I can't fight you fairly, I'm sorry!”
Following the conversation, the other two showed up together. All three of them were in wide robes and long sleeves. Their clothes were fluttering, protecting them from the wind. She has a chic demeanor and a relaxed face.
Chu Yang's eyes are already a bit blurry: “You three kings... also want to steal the nine swords?”
“Instead, I want you to die!” The three of them smiled at the same time, and their manners seemed like: “But by the way, taking over the Jiujiajian was also an unexpected gain. Great harvest!”
Chu Yang smiled arrogantly, straightened his back, and proudly said, “It's just a pity that you don't know about the Jiu Heist! You'll never get it!” His eyes became unmistakable, absolutely!
He's now powerless to fight again!
This is the only sword he can use at full power. When he first saw Sword Tips, he knew he could use this sword himself. But a sword like this needs to be spurred by one's own life!
It was the Jiu Heist Sword Soul that killed people on their own and destroyed everything!
The Three Kings were almost too late to even go on a manoeuvres; they had time to scream in the future, and it went up in smoke! Even the golden shadow of their royal power is still shining in the air, yet their lives have been reduced to nothing!
Chu Yang sighed. He was in the middle of the air, and his eyes blinked at will, but he discovered a person he thought should never have appeared here. In the distance, a man in white looked at this side in astonishment, and his face was full of disbelief.
“Tianji?” Chu Yang kept looking, and finally understood. Why are my covert actions actually being ambushed, and why have all of my attacks been blocked by people!
It turned out to be him. The ghost of Shanpan is no Tianji. No wonder I was so defeated!
Chu Yang's body slowly fell from the air and slowly fell down, like dead leaves falling in late autumn, falling to the dust. With a faint but warm smile on her face, she muttered, “Dance lightly, if you have an afterlife, dance with you!”
Since death is inevitable, embrace death with the greatest passion and strongest hope! Because there, I have my own lover!
CHAPTER II
Meng Qi's secret joy was interrupted, and her pride turned to shame, while the eyes of Zhende and the others were astonished and despised. It meant that elementary school students wanted to draw a clear line with their bad classmates; only Zhenhui, “Fang Ah Qi,” looked blankly at the golden Buddha statue in front of her, looking like a god traveling to heaven.
Subconsciously, when Meng Qi turned his head halfway and looked at Xuanzang next to him, would he see any signs?
For him, embarrassment and frustration are trivial matters; exposing the fact that he has borrowed his body to return his soul is a huge problem!
Xuanzang's face was still full of bitterness and despondency. After feeling Meng Qi's gaze, she shook her head softly: “There is no Amitabha Buddha; everything is subject to Xuan Gu's decision.” He didn't suggest it; he just said it.
Uh, he thought I was asking him for love... Meng Qi felt relieved and understood that he had passed this hurdle. Unless his parents abandoned his physical body, Uncle Horse-faced, etc., they probably wouldn't have been seen through. If it were another 10 years and 8 years, then no one would doubt it; his childhood memories are easy to forget.
Compared to this, breaking into a janage house is just a trivial matter!
The mischievous Meng Qi tried hard to make her expression look as sluggish as Zhenhui, lest she be seen through by Xuan Zang and actually wasn't that depressed or sad.
After questioning the remaining children one by one, Ga Mengqi and Zhen Hui, a total of six people joined the jantry house; the rest went to the martial arts monastery.
The ring on his right hand gently tapped the center of his left palm: “I went to the general store to shave, read the Buddhist sutras, etc., and worked hard in the future. I didn't experience any opportunities to study the deep Buddha sutras or martial arts at the Bodhi or Dharma Institutes.”
Is there Dharma here too?
Meng Qi stunned a bit, but Hyun Ko didn't give him time to think. He went straight through the children and walked out of the temple.
Surrounded by strangers, Meng Qi didn't dare to ask too many questions. Following Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang, two monks in yellow, they abducted into a nearby courtyard.
“You're not an official beginner; you only need to visit the Buddha, shave, and stay famous.” Xuan Gu pointed to the futon path inside the Little Buddha Hall.
“Yes, Uncle Hyun Kyu.” The children all responded with True Deok, then knelt down on the futon one by one and prostrated their heads at the golden Buddha statue above them.
Until all the children had prayed to the Buddha, Xuan Gu put her hands together, and Bao Xiang solemnly performed a ceremony on the Buddha statue, reciting “Namu Amitabha.” Then, he walked in front of a child and caressed his right hand over his head.
The child's long, dark hair changed from birth. At the speed Meng Qi could see with the naked eye, the roots turned yellow and drifted to the ground like fallen leaves. In less than two breaths, the child became a real little girl.
“Get rid of your worries, stay away from the red dust.” Xuan Gu said something solemnly, and her mellow voice echoed in the clean Buddha hall.
“What kind of martial arts is this? It's amazing!”
Meng Qi was astonished and excited. Will she have a chance to learn martial arts like this in the future?
Hyun Gu walked to the children one by one, removed their hair, and always said the same words in their mouths.
When it was Meng Qi's turn, he bowed his head, meditated on the name of Buddha Taozu, and mourned the hair he was about to say goodbye to himself.
The thick, wide palm caressed the top of Meng Qi's head, and a dead hair fell in front of his eyes. This made him sad. It almost made him feel sad. But he loved Red Dust, and he never wanted to leave his home as a monk.
“Get rid of your worries, stay away from the red dust.”
The dark voice was like a bell ringing suddenly. It shuddered all over Meng Qi's body and made her mind clear.
However, after Xuan Xuan left and the cleanness disappeared, Meng Qi's beliefs remained firm; she must be successful in the future!
After worshiping the Buddha, shaving, and leaving a famous monk, Xuan Su asked a few monks in grey to take the children to the backyard to pick up their own things — two sets of grey monk robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, “The Shaolin Commandments,” “The 12 Little Curses of Early Learning,” etc.
“Once you've learned the words in 'Kankyoyuan, 'you can recite the temple precepts and early school mantras. Before that, I'll talk about the main precepts of this temple, 1. You must not deceive teachers and exterminate your ancestors, 2. Don't allow martial arts, 3. Don't kill, 4. Don't drink alcohol, 5. Don't drink alcohol, 5. No meat or spicy food, 6. Don't break the rings...” Xuan Gu repeated the main precepts that need to be followed over and over again several times. At the end of the day, I seriously said: “Violators of merit, scolding people, and abolishing military exploits, evicted from the main temple.”
He mentioned only two of these punishments, the lightest and the heaviest, while the others included punishments such as hard work, scripture copying, criticism, and obstruction.
After explaining these things, he and Xuanzang left the “General Store” with this group of Little Sami.
“In the main temple, those wearing gray monks are ordinary monks, those wearing yellow monks are deacons of each house, and those wearing yellow monk robes in red are abbots, heads of each temple, and elders...” Along the way, Xuan Gu unrelenting instilled in instilling “common sense within the temple,” and it wasn't until Shindoku and others joined the “martial arts monastery” that he became silent again.
The group went further and further. The yellow wall was covered with greenery all inside and outside. It was rare to see a Buddha temple. Only after a while did Meng Qi see a mottled and old courtyard.
“Oops, Brother Xuan Gu, Brother Xuan Zang, did you arrive this early?” A big fat monk greeted me with a smile at the door. He was also dressed in yellow, but his collar was slanted and his stomach was slanted.
Xuan frowned and meticulously joined the ten words: “There is no Amitabha in the south, Brother Xuanxin, how can you be so lazy?”
The fat monk Hyun Shim has long been familiar with Hyun Sin's temper and doesn't get angry at all, saying, “Oops, you're too obsessed with the foreign minister. Is this for our handyman's apprentice?” He didn't want to get involved with Hyun Wai over this issue, pointing directly at Meng Qi and others.
“Please also ask Brother Hyun Shim to make arrangements.” Genkaku gave a serious answer.
At this point, Xuanzang, who has always been a jawed gourd, suddenly said, “Yes, is Zhenguan still in the janitorial yard?”
“It's still there, it's still there!” The fat monk Hyun Shim was puzzled and said, “Brother Hyunzang, what are you asking them? Is there any intention of taking them as apostles?”
Xuan Zang shook her head and sighed: “My martial arts are ruined. It's not convenient to mislead my children. How dare we take prisoners? Brother Xin Xin, please let them have the same house with True Ying and Zhenguan.”
He was referring to Meng Qi and Zhenhui.
Meng Qi's heart beat violently. This is also the first time Xuan Zang has taken steps to arrange his own affairs. Are there any special features of the two monks, True Ying and True Guan, who can help him?
“Haha, brother Xuanzang, how dare I bear the word 'trouble' for what you ordered, sir? Why is it necessary for such a trivial matter?” Hyun Shim agreed in one fell swoop.
Xuan Su took a look at Xuanzang from the sidelines and didn't say much. Instead, she said to Meng Qi, Zhenhui, and others, “I placed you in the jantry house because each of you has problems. If you can understand yourself and polish your mind, you won't necessarily have a chance to join a martial arts monastery, Dharma Temple, or even a Bodhi Temple in the future.”
“But if you continue to steal, be lazy and playful, be impetuous, and unbearable, I won't hide it. I will definitely report it to the Disciplinary Court and punish you accordingly.”
He unabashedly expressed his thoughts to show that he was frank, unselfish, and had a slight blush on the old face of Xuanxin next to him.
“Yes, Uncle Hyun Kyu.” Meng Qi and Little Shami answered in unison.
After watching Xuan Gong and Xuan Zang leave, Hyun Xin shook her lower body and made a piece of fat shake up and down: “I'm finally gone. I'm most afraid to see this Iron-faced ghost.”
This monk... Meng Qi pretended not to be a strabismus, and followed Xuanxin, who was swinging east to west, into the Zen room.
“True response, true view. This is your teacher, the truth, the wisdom.” After Hyun Shim pointed to Meng Qi and Zhenhui, she turned around and took the other Little Sami to another Zen room.
Inside the Zen room, there is a store that can sleep seven or eight people, and nothing else.
On top of the pavilion, the two monks in grey were all in their 20s. They were all in their 20s. The people lying on their faces were sluggish and speechless. The person sitting had deep locks on their eyebrows, and their tone was cold: “You can just put your luggage on the floor. If you want to drink water, pick it up from the water tank in the courtyard.” “I don't know what you call your brother?”
Meng Qi took a look at Mumnene's true wisdom and decided to establish a good “roommate relationship” on her own.
The person sitting coldly said, “True.”
After answering, he stopped speaking, and even turned his head and didn't look at Meng Qi and Zhenhui, making it impossible to talk about Meng Qi's close relationship.
As for the real response, I even closed my eyes and continued to sleep.
What kind of people are these!
Meng Qi was secretly slandered in her stomach, but she smiled and said to Zhen Hui: “Brother Zhen Hui, I'm really sure. You can just call him brother later.”
“Yes, brother.” Zhenhui shouted without any embarrassment.
Still, this dumbfounded little guy is fine!
Meng Qi secretly lamented herself and decided to play the role of a brother and help Zhenhui: “Little teacher, ah, I'll just call you little teacher brother. Come on, let's change the monk's coat first.”
Although there were people inside the house, Meng Qi, who was often shirtless and cool off in her bedroom at the beginning of college, didn't feel unwell. She quickly dropped her clothes and put on a monk's uniform.
While quietly thanking the monks' clothes for being easy to wear and not showing off their anger, he checked things on his body that were too late to examine before.
This bodily robe is finely woven and has a soft texture. Even if Meng Qi doesn't know the goods, it can be seen that it's worth a lot. At the same time, “he” wears a transparent jade crown on his waist and a small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red string around his neck, which fits his chest. It's clean, cool, and uncomfortable.
Meng Qi carefully played with this thumb-sized Jade Buddha, only to see that “it” had a compassionate and lifelike face. Obviously, the carving was extraordinary. At the same time, “it” had a delicate feel, which was both gentle and refreshing.
“According to Uncle Ma's face, what unknown old monk sent this jade Buddha? But since Grandpa didn't take it away, I don't think it's everything, so it's better to wear it close to you.”
Meng Qi hung the Jade Buddha pendant back on her chest and hid it close to her, then packed up the jade ornaments, clothes, etc. and placed them under the bunk of her choice.
At this point, the sleepy one actually turned over and sat up, effortlessly put on his shoes and went out. Seeing Meng Qi all at once, he couldn't understand what had happened.
“Time for dinner.” After speaking frankly, he also got out of the store and walked out the door.
What kind of people are these two!
Meng Qi scolded again, then turned her head to Zhen Hui and said, “Little teacher, okay? It's dinner time!”
“Alright!” As soon as the voice of Zhenhui fell, the little figure flew to the door like a rabbit, as if she was already unbearably hungry.
“...” Mengchton was in trouble. Is he the only one who is more normal here?
Zhenhui suddenly stopped at the door and looked back at Meng Qi. Her face was full of doubt: “Brother, aren't you going?”
You have a bit of conscience; you know how to wait for me!
Meng Qi secretly thought about it, then half-jokingly answered, “I'm not as hungry as you guys.”
Look at the two of you, it's like starving to death to death! \ Q>
As soon as he turned around, he flew away.
Hello! After shaking a few times, she shouted, “Hey, little teacher, wait for me!”
Suddenly, a moment of desolation hit his heart. The others were little teachers and sisters. Why do I only have little teachers, and there won't be any teachers or sisters in the foreseeable future.
Heavy rain poured down. A 278-year-old, good-looking woman, with a 56-year-old boy, knelt in front of the iron gate of a luxury villa.
The woman's name is Zhao Meiling. She comes from a remote mountain village. Six years ago, she was admitted to college with her dreams and hopes, but she didn't expect to meet the man who changed everything. This man is the famous Huahua of Beitang City... Li Zhe!
At the time! Zhao Meiling and Lee Chul were at the same school. By accident, she was favored by Lee Chul. Afterwards, Lee Chul went on a frantic pursuit of Cho Mei Ling, almost at any cost.
However, Zhao Meiling is nothing more than a simple girl who has just arrived in the city. She will be the opponent of such an expert. Not only her body, but her whole heart will be handed over to him, but then, after Lee Chul got tired of playing with her, she harshly abandoned her.
Only later did Zhao Meiling learn that she was pregnant. She wanted to have a child, so she didn't hesitate to break up with her family.
After the child was born, Zhao Meiling wanted to raise him as an adult by herself, but after five years, she was terminally ill because she was too tired and had a terminal illness. She finally decided that she wanted to send her child to the Li family. She wanted her child to feel fatherly love and have a better life, so she could feel at ease after her death.
However, this was coldly rejected by the Li family, and they did not acknowledge that this child belongs to their Li family at all; Zhao Meiling could only kneel in front of the Iron Gate with the child and bitterly plead for it.
At this point, the iron gate slowly opened, and several people walked out with umbrellas. The leading man was somewhat similar to the little boy. He was Li Zhe, the little boy's father.
“Give! “Bad woman, this money is enough for you to have a good life,” Li Zhe frowned and handed over a check to Zhao Meiling.
Zhao Meiling shook her head and looked up at Li Zhe, saying, “Zhe! You must leave your husband behind; he is your son!”
Lee Chul declined in one fell swoop, then coldly said, “Do you really want this money?”
According to the news, Zhao Meiling was already tearful and shook her head.
Seeing this, Lee Chul snorted, threw the check in her hand at Zhao Meiling, and was about to turn away.
On her knee on the ground, Zhao Meiling immediately hugged Lee Chul's thigh and bitterly pleaded, “Zhe!”
“Hehe!”
Before Zhao Meiling finished speaking, Lee Chul slapped her with a heavy slap on her face, “Let go! You stinky woman”.
Seeing his mother being beaten, the little boy next to him hurriedly ran over and hugged Lee Chul's thigh, and cried out childishly, “Dad! Don't hit mom”.
In fact, from birth, the little boy didn't know who his father was, and his mother never said anything. It wasn't until this time that Zhao Meiling showed the little boy a picture of Lee Chul that the little boy knew he had a father. At the time, he was so happy that he started dancing fast.
But now, he doesn't understand why his dad doesn't want his mom; he still has to beat her.
Lee Chul looked at the little boy holding his thigh with disgust and knocked the boy out with one foot, “Who is your dad, dead ~ wild!”
The little boy was knocked out, fell to the ground, curled up and covered his stomach in pain. The pain was far beyond what a five-year-old boy could bear. He couldn't help but roll out a burst of tears from his eyes.
Zhao Meiling was also shocked. She hurriedly let go of Li Zhe, ran over to pick up the little boy, and asked nervously, “Are you okay?”
The little boy looked at his mother worried, pouted her mouth, held back her tears, and shook her head.
Lee Chul didn't even look at the mother and child. She walked into the Iron Gate. Next to her was a housekeeper with white hair. She picked up the check and handed it to Zhao Meiling, sympathetically advising, “You should put this away!”
Zhao Meiling shook her head, hugged the little boy, and slowly disappeared into the rain.
The housekeeper looked at the mother and child's back, sighed deeply, turned inside the house, and slowly closed the iron gate.
Four years later! Before her death, Zhao Meiling called the nine-year-old boy, who had grown quite a bit older, to the bedside, gently rubbed his head, and said with a weak smile, “Whew, you should study well in the future, have a good job in the future, don't hate the Li family, and don't hate your father. Promise me?”
The little boy held back his tears and nodded seriously.
Watching the little boy seriously nod in agreement, Zhao Meiling had a serene smile on her face and slowly closed her eyes forever.
At 2 o'clock in the middle of the night, a bright moon hangs high in the sky, and the bright moonlight shines on the earth, making the surroundings not dark.
“Boom!”
There was a sudden, deafening sound from the sky. Zhao Fu was shocked. He looked up at the sky, only to see that the whole sky seemed to be burning, turning into a huge sea of flames. Countless colorful lights were emitted, dragging their long tails, like meteors falling from the sky.
“BANG!”
There was a loud noise, and a meteor with colorful light fell in front of Zhao Fu. The blinding light caused Zhao Fu to block it with his hands. Afterwards, the strong light dissipated. One finger long, two finger thick gemstones floated silently in the air two meters above the ground.
Zhao Fu walked forward curiously and held the gemstone. The crystal floating in the middle of the air had no reaction and was caught by Zhao Fu.
At this point, people who were already asleep were also woken up by a series of loud noises. They opened doors or windows, looked at the countless gemstones floating in the middle of the air, and began to frantically rush out of the house to snatch this central gemstone. Zhao Fu didn't leave much of it in its original place, and hurriedly returned to his home.
In a single-room rental house, Zhao Fu carefully weighed the gemstones. If they were sold alone, no type of gemstone could match it. If the quantity were scarce, then the value of the city is beyond question. But the point is that there are too many falling from the sky, or tens of billions of dollars to say the least, so this gemstone is probably not worth much at all.
“Detecting the host as a primary intelligence body and beginning soul binding...”
Hurry up! The souls are successfully bound, and they begin their journey to the world of enlightenment.
After this sound, Zhao Fu's eyes went dark and he fainted on the ground. “Hong Dali, male, 22, orphan, unfortunately died as a result of courageously rescuing two children who were about to be hit by a car. According to research and decision by the relevant departments, Hong Dali is the hero, an outstanding university student in the province.”
“If I don't go or don't go, then I won't go to the Hong Family Family with you!” Tang Muxin buried her head in a pillow and desperately kicked on Bai Nen's calves: “Hong Dali is a famous waste product in the city. They have lost all of their faces, and they have a crooked, mischievous, mischievous brain, and a standard loser, so I shouldn't look for someone like this to be my fiancee!”
Tang Muxin, the only daughter of Tang Ruisi, the chairman of Down's Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is multi-talented. Not to mention bogutong, she also looks like a flower, a slender lady, and brings out the spirit of heaven and earth. In particular, she also cooks good food, has a good cooking style, a big bed in the kitchen, and I don't know how many boys' dream lover at school.
But today I heard her dad say they want to take him to the famous loser Hong Dali's family. How could she endure it: “Had it not been for his parents to pamper her, a single seed on a thousand hectares of land, just his kind of waste, would have been evicted from the Hong family and destroyed themselves on their own. How could there still be a chance for losers all over the world?”
After listening to her daughter, Tang Ruisi, sitting at the bedside, had a bitter smile on her face. She couldn't help but say, “Xin Xin, I have nothing to do.”
Your family affairs with Hong Dali were decided by your grandfather himself back then. Although he lost his family a bit, it wasn't a big problem, right?
Tang Ruisi is wearing a blue-gray vest with a spotless white undershirt, a simple bow tie at the collar, a faint stubble on her lips, and a bronze pipe in her hand. Her short black hair is meticulous and shiny. Her overall image is quite good, but her bright eyes are now full of helplessness and reluctance.
Speaking of which, if he wasn't really forced to leave his own daughter, how would he be willing to leave his own daughter? After all, Hong Dali is a wonder of the world. The only thing he likes to do or can do is just two words: loser.
One of his most famous sayings is, “I have to lose; don't an undefeated family waste my parents' ability to make money?”
This sentence is laughing material that no one knows and no one knows. Many parents and children will say, “If you dare to learn from Hong Dali, the loser, I don't want to break your leg!”
Therefore, it really makes sense that Tang Muxin would have such a big reaction.
“This is also...” Tang Ruisi thought with a frown. Suddenly her eyes lit up and said, “Xin Xin, why don't you look at it this way?” Let's get married first and wait until dad's company returns to normal. At that time, we'll find an excuse to leave our family. This time our research funding has exceeded our budget. Once the funding keeps up, as long as the research on this project is successful, it will definitely be a world-wide sensation. When we slow down and find a way to leave our family when the time comes, his family probably won't say anything more, right?”
Tang Muxin sobbed, “It's easy to leave a family. His family is one of the world's top 500 companies. Why is it that easy?”
I have to say that Tang Muxin is a very smart girl.
If her family falls, her performance will definitely not be as good as it gets. This is the world where the weak eat the strong. When you're strong, no one may dare to move you, but when you're actually on your way home, there will definitely not be a few people who come and hit the ground.
For example, the young man from the Liu family, who was always entangled with her at school.
So Tang Muxin cried again for a while. Finally, she knew there was really no other way but this method; she just reluctantly climbed up: “Well, then try it first, woohoo, dad, in the future you must remember to leave your family, so I won't marry that loser!”
“Well, for the sake of my family's warmth, my dad will definitely try his best.” Tang Ruisi sighed and patted Tang Muxin on the shoulder: “Xin Xin, let's go.”
Hong Dali was sitting on the bed. Her eyes were dazed, and her mind was in a mess.
The surrounding environment was very strange, and his memory in his mind had quite a problem. Today, he can only barely recall the harsh sound of braking. What's left is just a bunch of messy memories that don't belong to him at all.
“Am I not dead, here, or where?” Looking at her pale, slender hands, Hong Dali secretly thought, “This isn't my body, nor is this a place I usually live. So where is this?”
He looked left and right for another moment and thought, “The first priority is to figure out the current situation.”
“First, am I dead or alive. 2. What kind of place is this, and who is my status. 3. What should I do next.”
“Well, now let's look at the first point.” Hong Dali pinched a small piece of oil on the back of his left hand, rubbed it, and it hurt. “There's a feeling of pain, so I should still be alive.” He also carefully touched his face, neck, ears, and top of his head: “This body is clearly not my previous body, but it's still within the scope of humans.”
“Then there's the second question, what kind of place is this and who is my status.” Hong Dali also looked at the surroundings. The structure of the reinforced concrete house, the snow-white walls, all kinds of modern household appliances, and even a computer with a 30-inch LCD display in the corner of the room: “Yes, it's modern society, but I haven't seen any of the celebrities on the surrounding walls, and I've never heard of any toy models. Having said that, is this world supposed to be the legendary parallel space?”
There was no one around. Hong Dali stood up carefully and took a deep breath: “This body is really weak enough. It looks like a thin bamboo pole. I really don't know when it will suddenly be killed.”
Turning on the computer, Hong Dali opened a few random websites. The content displayed was very different from what was on Earth, but at least it made him understand a few things: “First, this world, or the language of this country, is still Chinese characters. 2. It is indeed parallel space. Many things are different from Earth, but not much the same.
Don't you have any ID cards?” I thought about it, but I was quickly relieved: “Hehe, I don't think this body is very old. It's probably about 178 years old. An ID card may be available, but the bigger one is probably not issued yet. After all, this world is different from Earth, and some minor differences are normal.”
“The big loser system was successfully bound. Current rank: Level 1.”
With the introduction of the system sound, a little person immediately appeared in Hong Dali's mind; it seemed like he was probably himself.
“Host name: Hong Dali.”
Sexual ability: 32. Note: The indices for normal people are 100.”
Hong Dali looked dumbfounded: “Big loser system? Is this stuff real or fake?
Fortunately, there is no end in the world. Hong Dali is reluctant to commit suicide. The metallic sound of the system is once again heard: “Explanation: for every 100,000 yuan (RMB) of the host, you can get one attribute point for every one hundred thousand yuan (RMB) of the loser.
When all of the host's stats reach normal human levels, the Big Loser system will be upgraded, and new items will be added at that time, so stay tuned.”
“Can I get attribute points?” At this point, there's really nothing better than being able to improve your stats. Hong Dali's eyebrows smiled, “Can you really get attribute points through losing players and make yourself like a normal person?”
The sound of the system was still so cold, but what I heard in my ears at this point was just like singing: “Yes.”
Hong Dali's excitement almost didn't jump: “I'm going to splurge! I'm going to lose!”
“Next, ask the host to take on the first task: the first loser. Mission Requirements: Lose at least 100,000 yuan before midnight today.
“Current loser amount: 0.”
“Damn, it's already 8 p.m.! There are only about four hours left, no, I'm going out! I'm going to lose!”
Just thinking about this, suddenly the room door was gently pushed open. A maid in her forties bowed slightly to Hong Dali and softly said, “Grandpa Dali, grandpa and his wife let you go. Please come with me.”
“Can I buy you a game module?” Jiang Fei asked his dad with a lot of anticipation.
“Xiaofei, now that you're in high school, you can't be as addicted to games as you used to be!”
“Mom! This game is different! This is a masterpiece carefully crafted by Shengshi Company for 13 years, claiming to be the second world of humans!”
The game called “Dawn” mentioned by Jiang Fei is indeed another innovation in human history. Not only is it a model of a virtual reality game, the degree of realism is close to 100%, but through a brand new technology, players can experience a completely different kind of life through eight hours of sleep at night. Through this technology, the human body has enjoyed eight hours of quality sleep physiologically, but mentally, you can experience a completely different magical life for 24 hours!
“This game is being promoted all over the country! It's not a lie; not only does this game not affect learning, but it also gives people a better rest!”
Jiang Fei is still holding on!
“I said it last time, no! If you don't go back to your room to do your homework within 20 seconds, then next month's pocket money will be cut 50 percent!” Dad said with a face on his face.
“Old stubborn!”
Jiang Fei muttered in a low voice, but I also knew there was no need to talk about it. The conditions at home were good. My dad definitely couldn't bear to buy this game module; it's just that his brain is rigid; he definitely doesn't believe playing games won't affect his studies! “What about Phineas? “Dawn” will officially launch tonight. Do you have a game module ready?”
As soon as the bell rang after class, after the teacher left, a small fat man behind Jiang Fei looked at him by the shoulder and asked.
Don't mention, I won't be able to play with you guys this time!” Jiang Fei smiled bitterly!
The brothers are all pointing at you!”
The little fat guy, Zhao Feng, said that this little fat guy is one of Jiang Fei's few friends at school. Jiang Fei's first and ninth class of high school is the school's key class, but Jiang Fei's grades are average. Her grades aren't good, he's not good at sports, and he's not very good at interpersonal communication, so he can definitely be called a standard transparent person.
“My dad doesn't agree, what can I do?” Jiang Fei rolled his eyes; he had nothing to say about his only friend.
“Why don't you guys round up the money to buy you one?” Zhao Feng said that since the conditions are similar to Jiang Fei's, they are all the kind of guys who don't excel in every way, so the relationship between these two transparent people who don't get the attention of teachers and classmates is very good.
Jiang Fei comforted herself.
“I hope so!”
Zhao Feng nodded.
Jiang Fei has loved to play games since she was a child, especially this kind of realistic game. As a boy, the one who didn't want to fight in Sword Ranger? It's okay to carry a three-foot sword. It's every boy's dream. It's just an age of peace, and a society with highly developed technology. Not to mention that there were no wars, even if there were wars, just press the button, so if you want to enjoy the fighting, you can only experience it in a virtual game!
But this time, Jiang Fei had no hope. Since entering high school, Jiang Fei has been issued an entertainment restriction order by her dad. All of the gaming equipment at home has been blocked, and online games are even more untalked about!
It was too late to leave school. Jiang Fei walked home briskly. Although it was only around 6:00 p.m., at this time it was only around 6:00 p.m., but since it was already winter, it was very early to get dark.
Thinking that today is the day “Dawn” begins, Jiang Fei gambled to lock himself in his room! At around 10 o'clock, Jiang Fei also finished his homework. He lay on his back on his bed and looked at the wall clock on the wall at a little bit close to 10 o'clock. Something in his heart didn't taste good.
“Dawn” starts at 10 p.m. today, then runs for eight hours every day from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. the next morning. It not only delays players' normal lives, but also allows players to fully experience 24 hours of gaming time! “Hey! This great game doesn't belong to me!”
While mutting, Jiang Fei subconsciously rubbed his hand over the ring on his index finger.
“What the hell is this?”
Jiang Fei's boss, with an open mouth, looked at the glimmering ring on his hand and was so frightened that he couldn't say anything!
“Hehe!”
A white light flashed through, and Jiang Fei had a flower in front of her eyes. By the time his sight was clear again, it wasn't his room anymore!
“Whoa! Welcome to the world of Dawn! Novice Assistant No. 34784 is at your service!”
A crisp female voice came into Jiang Fei's ears!
“Dawn? Is this the login interface for Dawn?”
“This is the character creation interface, to be precise!” The novice assistant answered.
It's still a bit hard for Jiang Fei to imagine. He doesn't have a game room at all, so how could he get into the game?
Maybe this is my dream! Maybe I'm too tired to finish my homework, so I fell asleep in bed. I'm afraid all of the things, including the mystery ring just now, are part of my dream. I have thoughts every day, I have dreams at night. Maybe I really want to play this game! CHAPTER I
“Scammer! Big liar!”
An angry voice immediately followed by the sound of running away with the sole of the foot stepping on the blue-rock floor.
Zhang Xuan reluctantly held out her hands: “I'm really not a liar; I'm a college teacher... I just want you to be my student! Also, even if I'm a liar, why add the word 'big'?”
After muttering, recalling what the Director of Political Science and Education had said, Zhang Hang rubbed his eyebrows: “It's the 17th one! If I can't even recruit a single student today, I'll be able to roll it up and go home tomorrow!”
Zhang Xianben is not a person from this world; he is the manager of an ordinary university library on Earth. He only remembers the raging fire, then... there was nothing left, and he woke up to this world again.
Similar to what is described in the novel, martial arts are respected, strength is king!
I thought I'd be able to get through a scrap of firewood, get bitterly retiring, then get punched in the face and cheered along the way... It seemed like I had thought about it a lot, but only discovered that I wasn't a student, but... a teacher!
The saddest teacher in the whole college!
Other people's classrooms were all overcrowded and too crowded to sit down, and his classroom didn't have any. It was hard for him to pull them in a few. In the end, they even scolded several “liars,” and they turned around and ran away!
The reason for this is that the guy who has been carried away by his own soul, not to mention the least powerful teacher, has extremely poor eyesight and can't see anything. Crucially... he also made a teaching mistake. There was one case where he went viral!
This is the same as a dead person in the hospital. Their reputation has been greatly damaged, and they are rejected. Even the new students are shunned one by one. They are afraid that they will fall into his hands, and they will be taught half to die and not live!
There are no students, and it has also been criticized. In last year's teacher assessment, the entire college came in the bottom, and even got the only zero points in history.
In the midst of depression, I borrowed alcohol to quench my sorrow. As a result, I got what I had hoped for, so I took the opportunity to get through it on my own.
At the beginning of the new semester, the college has issued an ultimatum. If he can't enroll another student in his classroom this year, he will simply dismiss him as a teacher!
Seventeen new students have passed by his classroom today. As a result, as soon as they heard the name, they all fled without exception. It was like the little girl ran into a strange monster, how fast and how fast she ran.
“Looks like we have to find a way to fool one!”
I was thinking about how to open my mouth and pull someone out of my head when I saw a girl with a cute face showing her head through the door.
“Excuse me, is this Mr. Lu Xun's classroom?”
The voice is sweet, cute, and the appearance is beautiful and lovely.
Teacher Lu Xun, the college's star teacher, is full every time, and countless people admire her.
“Just her!” Seeing someone throw themselves into Luo Net, Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up.
Remembering all the pretense routines I had seen in my past life, sat quietly in my seat and posed as an otherworldly person: “Do you want to worship him as your teacher?”
The girl even nodded like a sparrow, and her dark eyes were full of adoration: “I heard that Mr. Lu Xun is the best teacher at Hongtian University. The professor's students are all extremely talented. Everyone is proud to be able to join his class!”
“No matter how good he talks, it doesn't match your practice theory. Not only will he not make progress; he will retreat if he doesn't do well! The teacher's fame is not obvious. If it matches your theory, you can also make rapid progress and improve dramatically!”
“Yes... I heard my brother say the same thing!” The girl stunned, and her beautiful eyes were a bit confused: “But I don't know what kind of class I'm suited for!”
Seeing her get hooked, her eyes lit up, and hesitated a bit. Marx, Encos, and other pioneers appeared in her mind one after another, pretending to be embarrassed: “An encounter is a relationship. OK, I'm also a teacher at this college. I can help you see your roots, talents, and personality for free, and recommend a suitable teacher by the way!” “That would be bothersome, sir!”
I didn't expect to meet this teacher at random. The girl nodded in a hurry with excitement.
“Let me show you the repair first!”
Her eyes were half open and half closed, and she didn't seem to care.
“Yes!”
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-huh!
After a moment of hard work, the room was full of excitement, swirling around the girl like an energetic dragon. The whole person's atmosphere was not scattered, not showing off her prestige, which showed that she had an excellent foundation.
“Well, I can see that you usually practice hard, have a solid foundation, and excellent talents. You are a rare genius!” After a set of punches, Zhang Xuan nods satisfactorily.
He learned this from fortune tellers on Earth. His words are all golden. They cover a wide range of topics, making people unable to hear mistakes; on the contrary, they are implying accuracy.
“Teacher, I've had a leg injury. The doctor said it's basically like being scrapped...” The girl interrupted him endlessly, and his eyes were a bit puzzled.
“Injured...” Zhang Hang blushed. However, his cheeky face was so thick that no one else could see it. He continued to make fun of it: “Do you think I haven't seen it? I knew it when you just wield your strength! The reason I say that is because... it's unbreakable!”
Anyway, it's all fooling around. If you can talk nonsense, just talk nonsense; fool a disciple over first and then talk about it.
“A serendipity? Teacher, what kind of chance?” The girl's eyes lit up.
After she hurt her leg, she always felt that she was inferior to others. She had low self-esteem, and didn't expect that she might be blessed because of the accident.
“It's no exaggeration that this chance can take you to the skies and become the first freshman. After all, your talents are already very good. You are a peerless genius like no other in time, but...” Zhang Hang Haikou has almost taken out a copy of “The Palm of God.”
Hearing that she can be the first freshman and boasting that she is a genius, the girl couldn't help but look hot on her face and hurriedly asked, “But what?”
“But...” Zhang sighed, and a bunch of good people were about to be buried: “There aren't many teachers in the whole college who can see this kind of seriousness!
“Not accepting students?” The girl was already very hopeful. Her eyes were slightly bleak when she heard this remark, and immediately thought of something and jumped out loud: “They don't accept students, then teacher... can't you accept them?”
“Of course I'll take it back, but you can see that I'm not interested in fame and fortune, and I don't have that much time!”
Thumb!
Before she finished speaking, the girl fell to the ground: “I know Mr. Gao Jie, please take me as an apprentice! I will definitely practice hard and not lose my teacher's face!”
“The students are guaranteed not to be a last resort; they will never bother the teacher!” Seeing him a bit reluctant, the girl nodded in a hurry, with a sincere face.
“I don't have many students; I may not be able to match other teachers in terms of resources, and I will also be criticized...” Zhang Hsiang continued.
“Hmm... I've heard that refining resources is important...” the girl hesitated.
When teachers receive resources at college, they are linked to many conditions such as grades and numbers of teaching students. If resources are insufficient, it will be difficult for them to progress in their practice.
“Whoa whoa, I said this on purpose to test you. Since you are determined and sincerely recognize me as a teacher, I have reluctantly tried to put you down!” Seeing her hesitation, Zhang Xiang immediately interrupted and hurriedly said, “Let's verify your identity!”
“Is this... that fast?”
I didn't expect this teacher's face to turn over a book. The speed was outrageous. The girl was slightly stunned. After taking the token representing her identity, she was considering whether to verify it. Seeing that Teacher Zhang, who had been extremely calm before, had already pulled the palm of her hand, pulled out a sharp knife, and gently stroked it, and a drop of blood fell on the jade card.
Hurry up!
The light is flickering.
The girl was dazed.
Didn't this teacher just say that you should think about it; be indifferent to fame and fortune? Why is it moving so fast and... the knives are ready?
“You're my student from now on!” Only then did Zhang Xuan breathe a sigh of relief and once again look like a tall person: “What's your name?”
“Back to the teacher, my name is Wang Ying!”
Knowing that it couldn't be changed, the girl stopped talking much and nodded with a cute face.
“Uh-huh, grab your ID card, pick up your bedding and books, and find your own place to stay by the way! The class officially starts tomorrow, so just come find me here!”
Zhang Xuan waved.
“Yes!” Wang Ying nodded and turned away.
“Successfully fooled the previous one!”
Seeing her become her student, Zhang Xuan was relieved and smiled slightly.
It's really not easy. If I hadn't read a lot of pretend tricks on the internet, I'm afraid it would be really difficult to succeed today.
Having a student can avoid the misfortune of being expelled. As Zhang's mood relaxes, she immediately feels that the whole person's spirit has smoothed quite a bit. The obsession that hovers around his predecessor in his mind is slowly disappearing.
“Don't worry, now that I've crossed over as you, I'll live a good life for you!”
Before, Zhang Xuan died because she couldn't enroll students. There was a lot of displeasure. Now that there are students, her final persistence has disappeared without a trace. Up to this point, Zhang Xuan is considered to have taken full control of this body.
Boom!
Taking full control of his body, Zhang Xuan wanted to fool a few more students in the future. He felt a shock in his mind, and a loud voice from Huang Zhong Da-lu sounded.
Boom!
Shocked by all the enigmatic language, he was a bit dazed. Immediately after that, a huge palace appeared in his mind, and the five large characters on it sparkled.
Tiandao Library!
I pushed the door in, there were countless bookshelves, and the variety of books was endless, and I couldn't see the end at a glance.
“A library? Nima, I was a librarian in my last life, so I wouldn't be in this world; it's still the same!”
The other person's gift package was either an old man or a system. All kinds of awesome stuff, but he was a library. Zhang Xun only felt it was dark in front of his eyes; he almost didn't pass out.
A library? Dried birds? Will we fight later, others throw swords, and I throw books?
“Look what kind of books are there?”
Helpless in her heart, Zhang Hsiang reached over and grabbed the books on the bookshelf and wanted to see what effect this library actually had. It was only a quick grab that he discovered that his palm went directly through the bookshelf and grabbed an empty space.
“Are you playing with me? I gave it to the library, but I couldn't get any books and couldn't read them. What exactly do I have to do?”
Zhang's face was speechless; she wanted to cry without tears.
CHAPTER 1
hey? What about my tattoo!
Zhao Yu pulled off her sleeves and looked at her white and tender arms in surprise. Before, he had two teeth and claws tattooed on his arm, a dominating blue dragon!
How... are they all gone?
Zhao Yu looked up and found herself sitting in an office with dazzling lights. The front, back, left, and right were all small partitions for office use.
At the moment, the phone is ringing nonstop, paper documents are flying all over the place, and more than 10 office workers are quickly shuttling through the hall. They all look like they are in a hurry.
At this point, a middle-aged man in a brown jacket quickly walked over and greeted the crowd, “Team leader Qu Ping is now telling you about the circumstances of the electric baton rape* rape case. We have to act tonight. Everyone should listen!”
Someone quickly pulled over a white board. The whiteboard was full of words, and several pictures were also posted.
Hearing the greetings, many staff members quickly rounded up, pulled up chairs, and sat in front of the whiteboard and listened attentively.
Zhao Yu didn't move her place; she was still sitting in her seat.
At the moment, he is still in the midst of great shock. He touched his right ear, but it was actually in perfect condition! Previously, during a fight, his right ear was split in half by a little bastard.
Zhao Yu wanted to look in the mirror to see her face, but she stunned at the picture on her desk. There is a young and handsome young man in a police uniform in the photo. He actually looks exactly like himself!
Grandma is a bear! In shock, a strange memory instantly poured into his mind, like the Yellow River flooding into his mind. Only then did Zhao Yu gradually realize that... has she experienced the legendary crossing!
As Zhao Yu clearly remembers, he was originally the gold medal fighter of the Qinglong Gang, a slayer king who fought and died! Although his real name is Zhao Yu, people from all over the world prefer to call him Zhao Tianba!
Grandma is a bear!
Zhao Yu was shocked once again. At last, he remembered that before that, he had already been executed by injecting drugs!
But I thought about it... why did you just run here?
Did... I actually made it through! ?
Also, it's a seamless connection; there's no use in reincarnation at all?
As new memories poured in, he was astonished to discover that this was a parallel world similar to before, yet his current status is that he is an agent in the Mobile Force of the Serious Crimes Unit; it's actually a police officer!
The lobby where he is now is not anywhere else; it's the police office!
Zhao Yu couldn't believe her eyes; this huge contrast was unimaginable. A veteran scoundrel turned into a serious crime unit detective. This... where does this make sense?
He subconsciously touched his head. In the past, since he had been cut several times on his head, his hair didn't always grow evenly, so he simply had a big bald head, just like a vicious person. But now he actually has flowing dark hair and looks like a handsome kid.
“Colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been 3 cases of electric baton rape* in our city...” At the moment, a female detective with short hair and big eyes is telling the crowd about the case.
Zhao Yu quickly found information about this detective from her memory. She is the leader of Group B of the Serious Crimes Unit. Not to mention that she is not very old, but she has a steady style of work and a high rate of solving cases. She is a celebrity in front of the leader. She usually presides over any major case that requires the cooperation of the whole team.
“The victims were all beautifully dressed young women, and they all had poor lifestyle issues.” Team leader Qu Ping explained, “Most of the incidents occurred near popular places such as bars and cabarets. The time of the crime was also after midnight.”
“According to the victim's statement, the criminal first followed the victim into an unmanned roadway, then used an electric pole to corona him, then rape* committed the rape. After committing the crime, the offender will also throw urine on the victim!”
Hearing the words “scow*pee,” the scene was quiet.
Zhao Yu took a look. This person was Liu Changhu, the deputy captain of the Mobile Task Force of the Serious Crimes Unit. During Zhao Yu's internship, there were many members of the Zhao Yu tribe. They asked him to pour tea every day, just like summoning someone else.
However, in this world, Zhao Yu is not a scoundrel, but an old boy with a weak personality. He has just finished his internship and became an official police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but many of his old colleagues make fun of him and arrange for him jobs that aren't supposed to belong to him.
Today's Zhao Yu isn't a soft persimmon; how can she stand being scolded? As soon as he hit the table, he freed up and stood up.
Liu Changhu was shocked by his sudden rise; even team leader Qu Ping had to pause.
Who knows? Just when everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a female voice like a silver bell suddenly rushed ahead of Zhao Yu. I saw a girl wearing a ponytail, overweight, and still wearing big glasses. She appeared in front of the crowd.
The girl is a newly assigned intern clerk for the Serious Crimes Unit. Her name is Benny Lee. This girl is a flower idiot. It's been less than a month since she came into contact with her, and she looked down on Zhao Yu, life and death.
Although Zhao Yu has a weak personality and is often bullied by people, she looks like a talent. At 1 meter 78, Yushu is in the wind. She is young and handsome, and has a certain lethal power against the opposite sex.
At the moment, seeing her loved one being abused, Benny Lee quickly stepped forward to break the siege: “Captain Liu, I'm here, I'm here! I'm still in my internship, so of course I did these jobs!”
After speaking, Benny Lee smiled at Zhao Yu's heart and went to the tea room in the lobby to make coffee.
Zhao Yu didn't have a good seizure either; she was only patient and sat back down and continued to think about her crossing problems. Although he crossed, his memory is very clear because he was lying in a execution chair just a few minutes ago. In his past life, he was sentenced to death for murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in her heart that he was framed; he didn't kill anyone at all! The person who was murdered was the owner of a real estate group. Zhao Yu only beat him once in accordance with instructions from his superiors; it is impossible for him to die at all.
Furthermore, even if an actual assault results in death, it is a manslaughter; it should not be convicted of murder! So, his death sentence was all someone else's plot!
Remembering this, Zhao Yu couldn't help but be furious, clenching her fist. If I can find the person who framed me in the future, I definitely want them to double my repayment!
At this point, Benny Lee had already made the coffee and distributed a cup to each of her colleagues present. The little girl's face was always full of enthusiasm. Every time she served a drink, she kindly encouraged words like “It's been hard work” and “Go for it,” which was very well received by her colleagues.
“Officer Zhao, there are two packs of sugar in this cup! You're bound to get through the dawn tonight, but you have to stick with it!”
Without waiting for Zhao Yu to respond, Benny Lee placed the plate in a beautiful way.
At this point, team leader Qu Ping had already explained the circumstances of the case; instead, Captain Kim Chun-bang, the leader of the Serious Crimes Unit, spoke instead. Captain Kim is over 50 and has white spots. He is an old man who doesn't say anything, and takes his work very seriously.
Captain Kim said in a loud voice, “There have already been 3 cases of the electric baton case; another one will be characterized as a serial incident. Not only the top, we can't wear this big hat either!
So, everyone cheer up and try to solve this case in the shortest possible time! “Like this... Group A sent a person to the scene of the crime to investigate. Since the criminal was the one who followed the victim's actions, then he must have appeared in the bar and cabaret where the victim was before. All the surveillance there was brought out. This person must be found!
“Yes!”
“Group B, you are mainly responsible for evidence comparison!” Captain Kim ordered, “The criminal has no background; the line of blood doesn't work. However, the criminal's urine is an important clue. Although the police can't find a match, you can go to the hospital or medical examination center to check and compare. As long as this person has had a medical examination or has been hospitalized, they will definitely be able to find him!”
“Yes!”
“Furthermore, the television stick used by the criminal, the cell phone signal that appeared on the scene, and the only victim who saw the criminal's appearance cannot be ignored; they must all be sent to follow up!”
“Yes!”
“OK, let's arrange an action plan for each group. If there's nothing wrong, then let's go as soon as possible!” Captain Kim said it; he closed his folder and saw that he was about to turn away.
“Wait a minute, I... I have a problem!”
The crowd looked back and discovered that the person speaking was not someone else; it was Zhao Yu.
Captain Kim was also upset and hurriedly asked, “What happened, Zhao Yu? What's your problem?”
Pointing to her forehead, Zhao Yu rightly said, “I'm not feeling well. Go home first, have fun on your own!”
CHAPTER 1
In the 21st century, the office of the director of the Donghai Advanced Private Hospital.
A thick case was thrown hard on the table. Director Lin was great-looking and furious. “Han Yunxi, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Lingyun Group. He owns 40 (percent) shares in our hospital. You must prioritize detoxification for him!”
Faced with the dean's furious anger, Han Yunxi placed her hands in the pockets of her white coat and was very calm. “Director Lin, I'm very sorry. Mr. Li has chronic snake venom. I'm not allowed to join the queue here unless it's an emergency.”
She is pure and beautiful, has big eyes, and is famous in traditional Chinese medicine for her amazing acupuncture talent. She is a rare expert in detoxification. Whether dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins, or endotoxins in the human body, she is her strong point.
“You figured it out, this is Ling Yun!” The director was so furious that the crime began to be filmed.
“Enough, don't tell me that all doctors are equal; only men and women are divided. Han Yunxi, I told you to schedule detoxification right away; otherwise, starting today, get out of the medical community!”
I thought Han Yun-xi would be afraid, but she was still calm and calm and serious. “Director Lin, in front of me, there are no men or women. There are only two types of people: the one I want to save and the one I don't want to save. I won't save Mr. Lee. Please ask for another one!”
When she finished speaking, she smiled politely, then turned away. Her seemingly thin body was elegant and calm, and her quiet beauty had a sense of pride that could not be ignored. However, when Xuan Han Yunxi opened the door, Director Lin was furious.
“Han Yunxi, if you dare to talk to me like this, you stop for me!”
Speaking of it, snatching the case on the table onto the back of her head, Han Yun-xi shouted, only to feel a heat and humidity slowly flowing down the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, Tianning.
Han Yun-si woke up confused from her parachute and heard a sense of celebration all around her. The sound of gongs and drums was ringing one after another, and it was dark in front of her eyes.
What's going on?
Han Yun-xi took a look at the thing covering her head, and immediately took a breath of cold air. Isn't this... isn't this Hippa? Subconsciously, I looked up and bowed my head and found myself wearing a phoenix, like a married bride... drunk!
The floats were turned upside down, causing Han Yunxi to have a headache. At this time, strange memories also poured into her mind. Undoubtedly, she made it through, and she's about to get married as soon as she gets through!
The original owner was the heir of the Han family of the Tianning National Medicine Family, also known as Han Yunxi. Because her birth mother was able to save the then empress, that is, the current Empress Dowager, she is accused of marrying the Seven Princes of the time, that is, the current Qin Wang and the Dragon of the Night. It was also rumored as a good story at the time, and the Han family's status soared as a result.
However, no one knows that Han Yun-xi killed her family as soon as she was born. She also grew into an ugly waste woman who didn't understand medicine. As a result, the marriage became taboo for Qin Wang over and over again. On the other hand, Qin Wang annoyed the emperor a few days ago. The emperor ordered the emperor to choose a date to complete the marriage before the end of the month.
Qin Wanglong is the only remaining prince in the battle for the throne. He is only in his early 20s at a young age, yet he is currently the only royal uncle in his generation. It can be described as Tianning's first person in power.
The Qin Wangfu is in the south of the city, and the Han family is in the north of the city. Qin Wang got married. Even though he didn't show up, he attracted thousands of people to empty alleys. The whole city was sensational.
Just as Han Yun-xi was sorting out this memory information, her joy came to an abrupt end; she only heard Hippo shout, “It's bad, it's not good, it's not a good big deal!”
CHAPTER I
“Xiaoyu, Xiaoyu, get up. It will soon be zero o'clock. Get up and eat some gyoza.”
Feng Yu felt that his voice was a bit strange, but he also felt very kind. He agreed in a daze and opened his eyes, only to see a young face that only existed in his memory.
“Sister?”
“Wake up. Hurry up and wash your face. I told you not to drink; you have to drink; you probably fell asleep without watching the Spring Festival Gala.” Fung Danying said with a smile.
Spring Festival Gala? Is today New Year's Eve?
Feng Yu looked left and right in bewilderment. There was a cottage of less than six square meters, a single bed, patched futons, an old wooden table, a 20-watt incandescent lamp above his head, emitting a dim light. The walls were still covered with old newspapers. There were also some major national events on it that he couldn't remember clearly.
Isn't this the old house on his farm when he was a kid, but this house was already demolished along with the construction of a small town. How did his sister become so young?
When Feng Yu raised his hand, he discovered that it was definitely not a trick joke, because his hands were getting smaller and his arms were getting thinner.
He suddenly jumped out of his bed and stood by the door frame, which also had a mark he made with a pocket knife every year on New Year's Day. The highest line, 1988, was 166 cm.
Is it 1988 now? He hasn't graduated from middle school yet?
He strangled himself so hard that he almost screamed in pain. Isn't that a dream?
Feng Yu opened the door, and her mother was cooking dumplings in a large pot in the kitchen. He lives in a cottage. The kitchen is right outside the kitchen, the living room is on the other side of the kitchen, and he calls it a hall on the farm.
“Got up, why don't you drink in the future?” Zhang Muhua took a pitiful look at her son.
Feng Yu looked at her mother, who still had dark hair, and her eyes were wet.
“Mom, you've worked so hard.”
“What is this kid talking about. Wash your face quickly, go to the house and watch TV for a while, and the gyoza will be ready right away.” Zhang Muhua was also very happy to hear that sentence of hard work. Her son has grown up.
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips all trembled. As soon as he was able to make money in the future, his father was found to have an advanced brain tumor. He passed away in less than three months, without even spending a penny of his earnings.
For a long time, Feng Yu felt very bad because she wanted to support her children and couldn't wait for her family.
“Dad.” Fung Hing-tai turned his head and looked at his son: “Got up, are you still dizzy? Let's watch TV and have a folk dance party, but it's exciting.”
“Dad, I'd like to have a drink with you later.” Seeing his father's anger on his face, Feng Yu quickly explained, “Just beer.”
She hasn't had a drink with her dad a few times in her entire life. Now that Feng Yu has a strong desire, she wants to drink with her dad again.
“I don't have a long memory yet. OK, I'll drink a little bit later. I think you can wake up tomorrow to celebrate the New Year! Dan Ying, go get two bottles of beer.”
Fung Danying shook her head helplessly and turned around to get her beer and glass.
The hall also has a single bed with futons on it. Fung Danying went to school and stayed at school. When she came back from vacation, she stayed in a cottage with her mother. This bed was where Feng Xingtai slept. But three years ago, Feng Yu was still sleeping.
There is a three-door vertical closet on the west wall of the living room, and there are also two suitcases on top of the closet. A 14-inch black and white TV was placed on a wooden table. The Spring Festival Gala was on the TV.
There is a folding round table in the middle of the living room, which is already full of dishes and dishes. There are eight dishes in total, but they are all leftovers from the evening. There are chicken, fish, and elbows. All eight dishes are meat dishes; none are vegetarian.
Instead of watching TV, Feng Yu walked to the front of the closet and took a close look at the mirror.
He looked at the calendar on the wall at the door. February 16, 1988, New Year's Eve.
He now knows for sure that he's born again!
The mother quickly prepared the dumplings. Feng Yu and Feng Danying both went to the kitchen to help bring the dumplings. It was only after all four of them sat down that Feng Xingtai picked up the chopsticks.
“Xiaoyu, you still drink!” Zhang Muhua glared at Feng Yu.
“Mom, let me drink a little more for the New Year.”
Fung Hing-tai also helped say two words. Cheung Mu-wah shook her head and let them go. Feng Yu also kindly poured a glass of beer for her mother and sister. The whole family must drink one.
“Happy New Year, Mom, Sister, Cheers!”
Feng Yu casually took a bite of these leftovers on the table and found them all extremely tasty. This year, there were no hormone additives or anything like that for posterity. Fish, rabbits, etc. are all wild; chickens and pigs are all kept at home. The grandparents ate these dishes, just dumplings. One person drank a bottle of beer, and Feng Xingtai wouldn't let them do it any more.
After eating and washing up, Feng Yu went back to his cottage and lay down. While lying in bed, he went back and forth, and couldn't help but think about the life he had lived during his lifetime.
Feng Yuben is a middle-aged man in his forties. After resigning from the securities company, he made his own investment lifestyle.
He has a wife and no children, his father died of illness at an early age, and his mother lives with him.
He remembers that it was the spring of 2015. In order to take his wife abroad to treat infertility, he wanted to make more money, so he borrowed all of his family savings, including house and car mortgages, and invested all of his money in the stock market. According to his predictions, it was a bull market at this time, and any fool could make money.
The situation was very good at the beginning; his investment soon doubled. As a result, he boldly used high leverage at an investment company and wanted to make more profit. Once again, he doubled it. For the rest of his life, he was able to do nothing without worry about clothing or food.
When the stock market rose to 5,000 points, like many people, he was greedy and thought it could continue to rise. At first, the stock market did rise a bit more, but the stock market soon experienced a dive because he used high leverage and had no additional capital. Instead, he lost a lot of money. After paying back the money he had borrowed, he became destitute. His wife didn't know that the house and car had already been paid off; he didn't know how to go home and face his family.
He went bankrupt. He drank a lot of alcohol that day, then deliberately, under the watchful eye of many people, he accidentally fell on the road and was hit by a large truck.
This probably wouldn't be considered suicide. If he took out that accident insurance, he should be able to pay millions of dollars, enough to redeem his house and car, and leave a sum of money for his mother and wife.
He remembers looking at the speeding truck and thinking in his heart that if heaven could give him a chance to come back again, he wouldn't die in such a rut; he wanted his family to live a comfortable life!
But I didn't expect that God actually gave him a chance to come back!
Since God made him come back, there will definitely be no more regrets from his past life in this life. He wants to be a millionaire, he's going to be an investment legend!
“Xiao Yu, stop shouting, go to bed.”
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted. At the same time, I complained about my husband and why I let my son drink again at night. This is all nonsense.
Hearing her mother complain, Feng Yu smiled, turned over, and fell asleep sweetly. CHAPTER I
Monday, May 20, 2019.
Spring is the summer solstice.
The temperature difference between day and night in the Jiangnan region changes greatly this season. They also wear slits during the day to become hot dogs; at night, they have to shrink under their covers and freeze into cold weather birds.
Gangnam University Town.
But Song Shuhang stayed alone in his dorm room, and his computer desk was pulled to the bedside, making it easy for him to watch movies in various positions.
Song Shuhang doesn't have a hobby of skipping school — the weather was sweltering in the middle of the night last night, and in his sleep, he used a trick to “go out to sea” to pedal on a quilt.
The temperature dropped dramatically in the second half of the night. Song Shuhang, who had only one small slit all over his body, was immediately overwhelmed. In his sleep, his hands were struggling to find it on the bed, but he couldn't touch the quilt. In the end, it only shrunk into the shape of a shrimp, shivering under the sinewiness of the cold wind at midnight.
When the sun rose, Song Shuhang became a member of the seasonal influenza army.
His roommate has already taken a day off from class for him.
Then he took cold medicine and slept until now.
The high fever went away, and my health was still a bit weak. I couldn't go to class at all in this state. Therefore, he can only stay alone in his dorm room watching movies and be bored.
On the screen, the movie's playback progress bar slowly advances. However, Song Shuhang didn't watch any of the movie's content.
“Haven't the effects of the medicine passed yet? I'm so sleepy.” He yawned and felt a bit heavy on his eyelids.
At this point, the chat software in the lower right corner of the computer is beating.
This is a hint for someone to add him as a friend or join a group.
“Who added me?” Song Shuhang muttered. He reached over to the bottom right corner of the computer's touch screen, and a message popped up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun (＊＊＊＊＊＊) requested to add you as a friend. ] Additional messages: None.
Huangshan Zhenjun? Who, such a strange nickname?
“Are they classmates?” Song Shuhang secretly said that in his mind, he couldn't help but think of the guys in his class who had clearly gone to college but were still in their youth fantasy period. If it were them, it would be a strange nickname like this.
Thinking about this, he clicked “Agree.”
Immediately after that, another system message pops up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun invited you to join the 'Jiuzhou No. 1 Group'. Do you agree?
Song Shuhang continued to agree.
'Shushan is under pressure' agreed to join 'Jiuzhou Group No.1. '
[You've agreed to join the group and say hello to your friends! ] A system with a smiley face is also included.
Chat tools are becoming more and more user-friendly these days.
After a series of prompts popped up, Song Shuhang agreed to close the reminder and group chat window — he is now drowsy; how can he manage what groups he has joined?
Anyway, his group settings have always been 'show only the number without prompting messages'. The group chat doesn't pop up to bother him; it only shows the number of chats after the group.
Once he's sober, he can go through his chat history to know what group he has joined, and the chat history of the group members won't be lost.
The movie's schedule is still tenaciously advancing, yet Song Shuhang's consciousness is becoming more and more blurred.
In the Jiuzhou No. 1 Group, after seeing a new member join, some divers in the group spoke up. Beihe Sanren: “Has Huangshan Zhenjun added a new Taoist friend? It's been over a year since no new people were added, right?”
Another ID quickly replied to 'Su Shi Qi': “Are there any new Taoists? Which district in China are Taoist friends from? What about road names? What product has it been repaired for?”
With this series of questions, do you always feel like something is wrong?
“Is it a fairy or not? Yes, go ahead and take a good picture!”
“Brother Sanlang, are you sure you are a goldfish?” The Beihe Dianren sighed, “Don't die again. What if the Zhenjun of Huangshan comes in with another senior?”
This guy from Sanlang is good at everything, is affectionate, and helpful, so he's very popular — even if he usually likes to talk, and his work is so easy to die for.
On the other hand, this guy's low lucky value is infuriating. Every time he can't help but die, it's always the elder senior who offends him. These elder seniors who are idle and have no fun are having fun. Naturally, they are very happy to throw away the three waves of crazy swords and the joy of delivering them to their homes.
“Kneel down and ask not to mention the words 'big senior'. There are shadows in my heart.” Mad Sword Sanwa made a row of “tearful” expressions.
Four years ago, he offended a beautiful 'big senior' with his broken mouth and was horribly tortured... That senior tormented him over and over again for a full year and four months. You heard that right, it's been a full year and four months! Remembering those impersonal exuberant years, his eyes are all wet.
As soon as Sanlang had just finished saying this, a series of smirks popped up in the group — an unconcealed, straightforward act of happiness and misery.
There were eight people in the group showing their online status; six of them all popped up with a row of smiley faces.
“You guys, miserable people, I remember every one of you. Don't let me meet you; otherwise, I must let you experience the damage of the 72 Way Express!” Mad Sword Sanwa hates He is very confident in his quick knife. Of the six guys that just had a bad laugh, none of them were his opponents.
Mad Sword Sanlang just finished speaking.
He is a veteran and has reached the level of Empress of the Five Pins Ling, and is only two steps away from the Six Pinling Jun. but he is no match for Ah Qi.
He was quick and ruthless in his one-handed method of sniffing, and he was also as fast as lightning, but he couldn't beat Ah Seven.
He claims to be a maniac. When he goes mad, he's afraid even himself, but he just can't beat Ah Qi!
When the people in the group saw that the three waves had withered, they had another string of unscrupulous smiles.
“...” This time, Mad Dao Sanlang couldn't help but post a string of colons in depression.
There was a hustle and bustle in the group for half a day, but they didn't see the newcomer make a sound. I was a bit puzzled.
“Are new Daoists not speaking out?” Kitagawa Sansanjin asked in a loud voice.
Unfortunately, due to the effects of cold medicine, Song Shuhang has gone into a half-sleep state once again.
At this point, Su Shi Ah Qi posted another very happy message: “I read it. New Taoists call it 'Shushan is under a lot of pressure'. Have you ever heard of a master of this title? Does this name sound a bit like a Confucian walker?
In retrospect, the Runic walkers were even better at fighting than the Formons. Not only did they hurt their mouths, but their fists were tough enough. Also, when they're excited, they sing heroically to cheer up, so cool! I love hitting them the most.”
“Ah 7, I said, what you expect from new Taoists will always only be whether they play well, and whether they play well or not?” Mad Sword Sanwa had a tearful expression on her face.
“Uh.” I'm a little embarrassed by Su Shi Qi.
Beihe Sanren laughed badly: “Will it be another 'big senior' who doesn't use chat tools?”
When he said that, did everyone feel that this scene was very instantaneous?
Right, it seems like almost four years ago, there also seems to be a senior who left the customs after being locked up for over 100 years. He also had a hard time using chat apps and was joined by Zhenjun of Huangshan. But he didn't speak because he couldn't type.
Afterwards, a guy named Mad Dao Sanlang was very happy in front of this senior. He also wanted this senior to report Sanwei, ask her to post photos, and voice chat or something.
Then... within a few days, the Three Waves saw this senior with their own eyes. He was a very beautiful senior, as dazzling and beautiful as the bright moon in the night sky.
Next, this beautiful senior left with full satisfaction after a full year and four months of turbulence.
At this point, an ID called 'Pharmacist' spoke.
Inexplicably short news, no end to end.
Fortunately, the people in the group have long been used to pharmacists' brief chat habits - he is asking the group leader, where is the real king in Huangshan?
The short speech is not that the pharmacist has a noble personality and is arrogant, but because he uses two-finger zen and handwriting, he is slow. It's also easy to make mistakes when there are a lot of words; deleting, deleting, and writing is extremely painful. Therefore, pharmacists are used to keeping their speeches short but short.
“He went online right after adding people. I heard that his family's baby monster dog got angry and ran away from home again, and Huangshan Zhenjun went after him again.” The North River Scattered Circuit.
“...” Pharmacist.
“We'll have to wait until the new Taoists learn to use the chat tool before we talk.”
They are all preconceived; they think that the new members are also from their peers.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang woke up slightly.
“Remember someone just joined my group; it seems like it's called Jiuzhou Group 1?” He whispered, clicked on the chat tool in the lower right corner, and pulled out the Jiuzhou No. 1 Group chat window.
What kind of group is it?
Soon, a chat log from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang probably visited once.
Honjo? Chasing the Big Demon Dog?
Special vocabulary for all kinds of fairy tales.
The way the people in the group chatted and talked was also very interesting—half ancient, half plain. It gives people the impression that modern people try to communicate in ancient language, but the way they communicate is very awkward because of poor proficiency in ancient texts.
“Whoa!” Song Shuhang laughed.
Looks like this is a group formed by Xianxia enthusiasts?
Oh no, this is definitely not your average group of Xianxia fans!
Everyone in the group gave themselves a name. The place they lived was called Dongfu, and the group owner's lost pet dog had to be described as a family monster dog running away from home. There are also people who claim that they haven't fought a Confucian in hundreds of years, which means that person claims to be hundreds of years old?
Just looking at these chat logs is such a sense of shame.
“This level of obsession has reached the level of middle school sickness, and it is Xianxia No. 2, which is very characteristic of China.” Song Shuhang nodded secretly.
Looks like this is a concentration camp for people with the second disease in Xianxia!
This is his first impression of the 'Jiuzhou Group 1' and the members of the group.
But why did you add him to the group?
He read the information on the group leader, Huangshan Zhenjun. He's not his classmate, and he certainly doesn't know him.
The thin blue line runs smoothly from under the tip of the pen. The number of light blue lines on the big slap card continues to increase, and gradually, a complex and mysterious pattern continues to become more perfect as the tip of the pen slides.
All of a sudden, the tip of the pen was heavy, changing the lightness just now, followed by a sharp side hook. The pen hook was like a blade! The pattern on the card suddenly lit up, then quickly faded and went back to normal.
After completing this card, his face is still as focused as before. He has only completed 15 cards, which is still 10 cards away from today's mission. What he is currently making is a one-star energy card. As the lowest-level energy card, it is currently the most widely used and one of the most consumed cards.
At this point, the room suddenly became dark.
The meter shows the number one hundred. I didn't expect to run out of energy; it looks like I'll have to add one more for today's tasks. Back at the table, Chen Mu-xun went back to work. All of his livelihood depended on the finest paper cards of this kind.
Chen Mu's room is very small, less than 40 square meters, with a semi-old work desk inside. Other than the work desk, which is quite clean, there are mountains of debris piled up all over the rest of the room. These miscellaneous items are also all kinds, piles of old books, and all kinds of scattered raw materials.
Chen Mu lived in this humble place for a full three years. This is a relief room specially provided by the federal government. You only need to pay 150 ODIs every month to stay in a small room like this. For poor people like Chen Mu, there really isn't a cheaper place than here.
At 5 p.m., Chen Mu finally finished his work for the day — 25 energy cards. He carefully counted the number of cards and counted them twice in a row to make sure that there was no mistake in the number before he carefully packed the energy card into the card bag in his clothes.
As soon as he entered the door, the owner noticed and said, “Amu is here!”
He gave an answer to the owner. The owner, Uncle Hua, is an old man around 50 years old. The years have left an indelible mark on him. Fine wrinkles, half-white flowers, a pair of reading glasses.
Chen Mu carefully took the card pack out of her arms, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed it to the owner: “25 cards.”
Uncle Hua took the card from Chen Mu's hand and placed it on the shelf without looking at it. He smiled and said, “Thanks to Amu, you deliver cards every day; otherwise I would run out of supplies here.”
Chen Mu smiled slightly but didn't speak. He knew that what Uncle Hua said was mostly meant as a joke. The 1-Star Energy Card is the cheapest energy card, but it's also one of the cards that consume the most. What's more, it's located near Dongwei University. Where is it possible that they only sell 25 energy cards a day?
Uncle Hua also knows Chen Mu's temper and doesn't say nonsense. He directly asks, “Does Amu need cash or transfers?”
Chen Mu simply answered. After speaking, he handed over a light green decal that had already been prepared to Uncle Hua. After the settlement had been settled, Chen Mu wanted to turn around and leave after saying goodbye to Uncle Hua.
Uncle Hua suddenly stopped Chen Xu: “Wait a minute.”
Chen Mu stopped and turned to look at Uncle Hua with a slight surprise: “Is there anything else? Uncle Hua.”
Uncle Hua took a goose yellow note out of the drawer and looked at Chen Wu with a smile: “I almost forgot something. This is an attendance pass for the card maker training course. It was attached to the dealer when I purchased the product yesterday.”
Looking at his gracious Uncle Hua, Chen Mu couldn't help but feel a moment of emotion. He knows how much the old man in front of him has helped him over the years. If it weren't for him, Chen Mu believes that his current life is also out of reach for him.
Three years ago, he just learned how to make energy cards and peddled them everywhere, yet few people paid attention; no merchants wanted to buy them. The amount required for a one-star energy card is very large, and merchants prefer to buy large quantities at once. However, Chen Mu can only make up to 30 cards a day. For merchants, this is just a small amount that can't even be considered zero.
Fortunately, he met Uncle Hua. Uncle Hua agreed to buy his energy cards, but the purchase price of each card was 103 odi, which is two ODIs lower than the bulk price of energy cards on the market. Despite this, Chen Mu is still extremely grateful to Uncle Hua.
Although the price of the 103 Odi was lower than the bulk price of the 105, Chen Mu felt that he was surrounded by great joy. I sold all of my energy cards, bought the cheapest food, and spent the rest of my money buying all the ingredients for the energy cards.
Since then, Chen Mu's life has finally stabilized.
With 25 energy cards a day, he hasn't been interrupted for a day.
It's been three years since this passed. For the past three years, he only made one type of card — a one-star energy card. Outside of making energy cards, he spent all his time researching ways to reduce costs.
Finally, in his third year, the cost of an energy card was controlled by him at 95 ODIs. Each energy card can make a profit of 8 ODIs, and his daily income is stable at 200 ODIs. This is a figure he couldn't have imagined at all three years ago.
Chen Mu came back and smiled at Uncle Hua: “Thank you, Uncle Hua!” Take the course pass and carefully place it in the card holder in your pocket.
They often have extremely gorgeous advertisements. For example, on this course certificate, it says “Dongwei University recognizes academic qualifications” and “Dongwei University's senior card maker authoritatively speaks” Yun Yun; in fact, Chen Mu knows exactly what is inside it. The only slight relationship between the agency hosting this training course and Dongwei University is that this institution has to pay a fee to Dongwei University every time to pay a price for them to maintain this nominal “joint organization.”
Chen Mu is still planning to listen to what is actually being said in the training course. Making cards is one of the hardest things to learn. Over the years, he hasn't given up on studying on his own, yet there has been little success. It wasn't until last year that he understood what was going on.
Naturally, for a teenager without the slightest foundation, it is even more difficult if they want to learn card making on their own, which is known for being difficult and obscure. However, he didn't have the slightest doubt about his intelligence. He was able to learn how to make a one-star energy card using only his memory within a week. The card maker praised his talent back then.
Since then, he has let go of this goal, which was temporarily too high for him, and began to move on to the most basic theoretical studies. Every day, no matter how tiring his work is, he takes time out to learn this boring knowledge.
After saying goodbye to Uncle Hua, Chen Mu walked south along an alley. Today is Saturday and he has another job.
After walking through two streets for about 20 minutes, he arrived at a used card buying station.
He is also the owner of this buying site. Every Saturday and Sunday night, Chen Mu comes here to work part-time for three hours.
Chen Muchao nodded slightly to Xiao Hei, but his face was still a bit vague.
Xiao Hei has long been accustomed to Chen Mu's rhetoric. When Chen Mu first came here to ask for a short job, Xiao Hei originally refused. Since the beginning of his father, this buying site has always been managed by himself; when it comes to his hands, he has also always managed it himself.
However, when Chen Mu said he didn't want wages, Xiao Hei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Mu is still paid. Chen Mu usually chooses a few used cards to take away as his wages.
Sometimes Chen Mu also picks out a few unused energy cards from these waste heaps. Xiao Hei has calculated a bill. Every month, the money he saves on this is a huge amount of money. It's just that Chen Xu, who is silent, can't help but be a bit curious. How does this guy know that these calories still have leftover energy?
Since then, however, he has smiled every time he sees Chen Mu.
Chen Mu crouched down and began sorting the piles of used cards. There are many types of cards, such as energy cards, item cards, gift cards, and even animal cards, which are relatively rare plant cards. However, all of the cards here, without exception, are useless; all Chen Mu needs to do is sort these cards into different categories.
The work was carried out very quickly, and it can be seen that he is very familiar with the work.
Chen Mu flipped her wrist and threw a card over at Xiao Hei: “Hah, I can still use this card for a while.” There's still at least half of the energy in this two-star energy card, and Chen Mu couldn't understand why the original owner of this card was so wasted. The capacity of a two-star energy card is 1,000, which means it still has almost 500 energy inside.
When Xiao Hei looked at the two-star energy card on her hand, she all smiled. He ran backwards to the front of the energy meter and inserted the card. When he saw the “523” number on it, Xiao Hei laughed so much that his facial features were almost all squeezed together.
His three-year career as a producer gave him his own understanding of the most common and lowest-level cards. There is more than one way to make a one-star energy card; Chen Mu has already collected twelve one-star energy cards with different structures from this type.
Chen Mu was greatly inspired by these one-star energy cards with different structures. It was because he drew on some techniques from these cards that he successfully reduced the cost of making one-star energy cards to 95 ODIs. However, this kind of good fortune doesn't happen every day; up until now, he has only collected 12 cards.
But today's luck seems to be good.
I looked at this one-star energy card on my hand. Judging from the structure on the surface, it is a one-star energy card that Chen Mu has never encountered with another new structure.
He put this energy card aside and continued to search through it. The number of one-star energy cards is really too many, but Chen Mu tirelessly checked them one by one. He is extremely fast, and you can tell if it's what you want almost as long as you gently caress these one-star energy cards with your hands.
All of this comes from his familiarity with one-star energy cards. This familiarity was left over after three years of uninterrupted production. He didn't need to look at it; he could determine whether this card was a one-star energy card or a structure he had seen on his own. He's so familiar with them that every detail of them.
The finger that had skipped over the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
Lin Che climbed out of bed in dismay.
Her head didn't seem to be dull like her own. The luxurious sheets she touched in her palm weren't the worn ones she usually used to wash. The light on her head wasn't the same energy-saving lamp style she used to seeing. The pain in her body seemed like it had just been torn by something. She raised her wrist, and the blue, purple, and purple marks on it were clearly visible.
She covered her mouth and didn't want to make a sound. She lifted her quilt. Seeing that she was unmistakable inside, the scream almost burst out of her voice.
Lin Che's bright eyes twirled two times under her eyes. She resolutely lifted the quilt, got out of bed and packed up her messy clothes, put them on whatever she wanted, and had to run outside.
“Ah... let go of me, let go...” Lin Che began to struggle with both hands and feet.
The man pulled her neck and dragged her directly back to her bed without any effort.
His deep eyes seemed to have an innate sense of pride. They were as cold as ice on his cheeks, the wings of his pen and nose stood high on his fair face, and white jade like white jade, making her, the woman who asked herself if she had good skin, feel envious and jealous.
She asked herself that she had seen quite a few men, but the men known as male gods suddenly became overshadowed when they arrived in front of him.
Is this the man who spent half the night yesterday throwing her half way through death?
“Who sent you, and you actually gave me medicine? You did something like this and thought you'd be able to get out of here unscathed?” He looked at this sluggish woman, and anger flashed through his secret eyes.
This strange woman has snowy skin, a pretty face, big, dynamic eyes, and flickering eyelashes. She looks like just a frightened fawn, and looks at him with her eyes open.
Gu Jingze set her eyes on her, and saw Lin Che's eyes once again rapidly twirl with her brain.
However, she got lost in the wrong person.
Although the person in front of me is handsome and makes people feel dizzy, it's clearly not Gu Jingyu, the superstar.
This time, she was rudely grabbed by his arm once again, and when she fell to the ground, she even rolled around in a hurry before settling down again.
“You made a mistake; I'm the one that is seriously damaged right now.” Her butt hurts, her hands hurt, and the pain below is even more unignorable. Annoyed, she just yelled, “What I want to fall in love with is someone else. It has nothing to do with you. You think you're worth taking medicine for me. Grandma Ben didn't just do it; you paid back my medicine!”
Lost in the wrong person?
Gu Jingze's cheeks were tight, and her eyebrows were crooked in the character of a Sichuan. Her dark eyes looked like a dormant beast. Half of her white shoulder was exposed. The blue, purple, red marks on her face were clearly visible. It looked like a blooming plum blossom on her white and tender skin.
The images from the night flashed into his mind again. Suddenly, his lower stomach became hot. Once again, he felt that obvious heat, and it surged in his body.
I took my eyes off her face.
This damn woman dared to give him medicine; the effects were still so strong.
His momentary surprise finally gave Lin Che an opportunity. Despite everything, she jumped out of bed. She pushed the man away with all his might.
She didn't dare to go back, so she quickly ran out.
Hearing him hissing, she yelled, “Look what, see for yourself!”
“You...” Gu Jingze was about to turn around and catch her, but she felt unbearable for a while, and the bottom was once again uncontrollably excited.
“Damn it.” He scolded and clenched his fists to restrain the damn**.
There were a series of sounds coming from outside.
Qin Hao looked back and was amazed.
What was the situation just now? What's wrong with a woman running out of his room?
He raised his sharp eyes, and his dark eyes sparkled brilliance, causing Qin Hao to quickly swallow all his undue doubts into his stomach.
Gu Jingze kept washing her body in the bathroom until the skin on her body had been washed pink before she scolded in the mirror, “****.”
As soon as Gu Jingze said, her mother actually came over. Even if she thought about it, she knew it wouldn't be a good thing.
When the bathroom door opened, the lady with a beautiful face was standing outside looking at the bed in disarray with surprise.
The beds, which were too late to clean up, were clearly telling everyone in front of them what actually happened last night.
Gu Jingze had dark eyes and gloomy eyes. He held his bathrobe and draped it over his honey-colored shoulders. “I know what you want to ask, but, Mother, I'm very busy today.”
How could Mu Wanqing not ask? The excitement on her face was hard to hide. Looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed at her bed and said, “Jing Ze, I already know that you have a relationship with a girl.”
Gu Jingze pushed open the door and said coldly to Mu Wanqing, “You don't care about this, OK?”
“How can I ignore it? Jing Ze, you have to marry her before you can do it; you have to take responsibility for other girls.”
“Mother, I'm not going to marry her. I'm not crazy. She's just a strange woman, I don't even know her name.”
“Mother!” Gu Jingze stood there and looked even more upset because he remembered that woman.
“Are you still thinking about Mo Huiling? I told you, it's impossible for you to be with her; you've been with her for so many years and still can't touch her; you're just doomed to not be together!” Mu Wanqing said it unkindly.
“Mother, that's enough!” Gu Jingze wanted to interrupt Mu Wanqing.
But Mu Wanqing was very excited. “Jing Ze, you know your illness. You can't touch a woman at all. The family has almost made artificial insemination ready for you to have children, but the fact that you met a woman today shows that she is the perfect person for you!”
Since ancient times, the Taoist family is famous in Qingcheng. Since ancient times, countless strange people have come and gone. This is the case with the so-called reckless hidden dragon snake.
Countless myths and legends, and countless legendary stories, like a heavy cloud, cast a veil of mystery over Qingcheng.
The morning light was slightly dewy. On the mountain slate path, groups of Tsing Yi Taoists, carrying three long incense plants, marched silently and quickly along the path, towering high into the clouds at the back mountain, and running smoothly against the mirror-like stone wall.
The mountain road was steep and the dew was slippery, yet these passers-by quickly ran past the horse, causing all the blue shadows. There are also people who leap up from time to time. Ling Feng spans a distance of 100 meters, the morning breeze blows, and the clothes are fluttering. The fluttering trend is just like that of immortals.
In the Qingcheng Mountains, the mountains, the mountains, and the palace pavilions, there are Taoists who are constantly on their way, gathering in front of this unknown stone wall.
Among them, there was also a large group of little Taoists wandering around the Jiugong Palace, carrying various flags and instruments, and carrying incense burners. The cigarette rushed straight into the air, and the air of the smoke wrapped up, turning into a cloud covering the head of the group.
At the front of many Taoists, right under the stone wall, a group of people wearing a Phnom Penh purple robe with silver thread embroidered on the chest and back. The sleeve edge of the robe also had clouds and herbs patterns. Gorgeous Taoist people all around them were holding dust and standing there with no expression on their faces.
The crowd waited quietly for a while. When a red light from the east suddenly leaped and the red light ripped away from heaven and earth and spread all over the place, many Taoists went on praying and praying in a pious manner towards the stone wall.
Thousands of people recite mantras at the same time, and the “humming” mantras are entwined, turning into an astonishing faint sound that spreads far and wide. Gradually, a strange power rose from the sound of the spell, and a bright, colorful glow shone from above the heads of many Taoists and shone on the smooth, smooth stone wall.
The Taoists, dressed in purple robes in Phnom Penh, prayed on the ground at the same time, muttering a prayer in their mouths.
If it continued for half an hour, a ray of white light finally came out from the top of the stone wall, and soon the entire stone wall emitted a clear white light.
Smoke and haze rose from the sky, and there were countless clouds and smoke wrapped around the stone walls. It was vaguely visible that a few hazy figures with golden light surrounding their bodies appeared in the smoke. The figures became more and more clear. In the end, three men, two women, five were wearing white Taoist robes, and their faces were obscured by golden light, and an invisible Taoist appeared in front of the crowd.
The woman in the middle looked down and looked down at the many Taoist people kneeling in front of the stone wall. Suddenly, there was an extra set of scrolls on her hand, and she threw them out.
White light flashed on the stone wall, and the purple jade slowly floated out as a scroll woven with gold wire, falling right on the front hand of the old man in the purple robe, who led many Taoists to worship. The woman who threw out of the scrolls said a few words in a loud voice, then turned around and waited to leave with a few of her companions.
A few old people in purple robes suddenly shouted, “Grandmaster is merciful, merciful!”
The “thunderclap” sound continued to be heard. All the Taoists bowed their heads to the five men and women and made loud noises in their heads.
The woman who threw out the scrolls drank a cold drink. Immediately, all the Taoists fell on their stiff knees to the ground, and they didn't dare to make any more movement sounds.
Instead, another woman close to that woman laughed a few times in a low voice, lost her hand and lost a few more things.
The light on the stone wall dimmed, and the five Taoists disappeared without a trace.
A few strange shining things slowly fell from the air, namely a sword, a jewel, a small tripod, five runes, and nine medicine bottles.
The sword, the jewel, and the small size are like children's playthings, but each one is shining brightly wrapped in smoke and smoke. Obviously, they are all extraordinary things.
The five runes are even more engulfed in gold and have a strong sense of vigor. If any pressure comes out of the runes wave after wave, and the slightly close Taoist have an unstable foothold, one after another, they are pushed backwards by this force.
The nine medicine bottles were densely engraved with various symbols and seals. Fang Cai took over the scrolls and opened one of the medicine bottles in front of many Taoists. A quiet medicine box immediately came out. Thousands of people in front of the stone wall took a deep breath at the same time. They felt that the seven tricks were smooth. Their meridians seemed to have been washed with clean water all over their bodies, and their whole body became bright.
Just smelling the scent of medicine is more than three months of hard work for these Taoists. The old man of Zipao was busy sealing the medicine bottle tightly. The scent that comes from the elixir alone has such amazing effects; you can imagine what kind of treasure the elixir in this medicine bottle is.
A few old people in purple robes got together and whispered for a while, packed up their swords, orbs, trims, runes, and medicine bottles, and then unrolled the scrolls in front of the crowd.
The first half of the scrolls is the verse “The Sutra of Faithfulness,” which is an exercise in strength and nourishment. However, the second half of the scroll made the old people in purple robes lose their faces and start screaming in horror. About a quarter of an hour later, countless people from Qingcheng Mountain swarmed out.
Qingcheng Mountain's potential in the secular world was fully activated, setting off a huge invisible wave.
CHAPTER 1
It was extremely hot in July, and under the scorching sun, Yucai Road had a pungent smell of paint, looking like it was about to melt.
The sky above the road surface is directly distorted and skewed because of evaporated air.
Under such toxic days, there are almost no pedestrians on the streets, not even cars coming and going. Everyone is looking for a cool place to escape the heat or enjoy themselves in an air-conditioned room.
A woman in a washable white shirt and grey suit pants walked in a hurry and headed straight for the Second People's Hospital.
The hair sticks tightly to the woman's face because of the sweat. The woman's cheeks have an abnormal blush. It is obvious that they have been sunburned by the sun.
The white shirt was soaked with sweat from his body, and the feeling of being wrapped around his body was very uncomfortable, but Qiao Nan had no time to take care of this and clutched his 100,000 yuan bag.
This is the money she has painstakingly collected from selling all the valuable things around her. Her sister's surgery costs 200,000, and she still has 100,000 left to find another way.
Walking straight to the ward, Qiao Nan's hand touched the doorknob; he heard the conversation between the mother and daughter in the ward.
“Mom, it's all Qiao Nan's fault. If it weren't for her, Dajun wouldn't have divorced me.” This is the voice of Jo Nan's sister, Jo Zi-eum.
“Stop crying, Mom has taught you a lesson for Qiao Nan.” Mother Ding Jiayi touched her oldest daughter's head with distress.
Qiao Nan, who was standing outside, had a feeling in her heart. Chen Jun didn't catch her sister because her sister had cheated; Chen Jun only left her, but what does this have to do with her?
Thinking of Chen Jun, Qiao Nan's eyes were bleak for a moment.
Chen Jun was originally Qiao Nan's boyfriend, but Qiao Ziyin became pregnant with her younger sister's boyfriend's child. Ding Jiayi scolded Qiao Nan, saying that Qiao Nan hid harbors bad intentions. It was an unscrupulous little beast who robbed her sister of her boyfriend, and even forced her sister to have an abortion.
In the end, Qiao Nan had to quit, leaving Chen Jun and his sister.
“Mom, Dajun got divorced from me, my child isn't with me yet, and I have this disease again. What should I do? Mom, I don't want to die; I haven't been too filial to you yet; I really don't want to die.”
In the ward, Qiao Ziyi cried a lot while holding Ding Jiayi. She was still so young and still had a great life; she really didn't want to die.
Ding Jiayi couldn't be moved to hear that her oldest daughter had such a serious illness and thought that she should be filial to herself in the future.
Ding Jiayi coaxed and patted Qiao Ziyin on the back: “No, Mom definitely won't let you get into trouble. Mom is already raising money for you because of the dead girl Qiao Nan. ”
Not long after Qiao Ziyin and Chen Jun got divorced, she suffered from kidney failure and had to have her kidney replaced right away.
However, in this marriage relationship, Qiao Zijin cheated on the wrong side. In addition, Chen Jun also works for the government, Qiao Zijin has been cleansed from her home. Now that she is sick, she doesn't even have any money to see a doctor or take medicine.
I had long known that her mother's eccentric Qiao Nan couldn't help but hurt her already numb heart after hearing this conversation.
She's already 40 years old. After she broke up with Chen Jun back then, she never fell in love. It's not that she didn't want to talk; it's that her mom wouldn't let them talk.
Over the years, most of the money she earned went to her mom. Her mom used the money she earned to buy her sister a 150-square-meter apartment, yet she was only able to stay in a rental house of only a few tens of square meters.
She paid for her parents' food and even utility bills at home. Every time her sister went back to her mother's house, even though she carried some things in her hands when she came, she carried more when she went back.
I haven't gotten married at my age. The joke is that no one wants a leftover woman. It's not that Qiao Nan doesn't know; her mom won't let her get married; she just wants her salary.
But this is her mom. Every time she goes on a blind date and falls in love, her mom goes to death looking for her; there's nothing she can do.
Her hard work over the years ended with only the three words “dead girl.” In particular, Qiao Ziyin also placed all responsibility for her cheating and divorce on her own. Qiao Nan grabbed the 100,000 yuan in her hand and suddenly didn't want to give it to Qiao Ziyin.
I haven't waited for Qiao Nan to leave. The conversation Qiao Nan heard next really made Qiao Nan feel cold and hopeless.
What if Qiao Nan has raised 200,000 but can't find **? In fact, the doctor said that if a loved one were willing to donate a kidney to me, the compatibility would be higher, and it would be less likely to cause rejection.”
Relying in Ding Jiayi's arms, Qiao Ziyi said pitifully, “If I had a real loved one***, I might be able to save a little bit of money to see a doctor.”
**No matter where it's so easy to find, some people can't wait until they die to get this chance!
Aware of this, Qiao Ziyin knows that it's not enough just to be rich if she wants to stay alive; she has to find another way.
“What if Mom goes for a blood test?” Ding Jiayi asked with some hesitation.
Qiao Ziyin even shook her head. Her mom is this age, and her kidneys are definitely not as good as hers. Since they do, she definitely wants a good one: “Mom, you're the mom who gave birth to me and raised me; I can't bear to use a knife; my dad definitely can't do it either.”
“Well...” Ding Jiayi thought, and her eyes lit up: “Wait a minute for the dead girl to arrive, I'll have her go for a blood test. She's your sister. Definitely yes!”
“It's good, but will Qiao Nan not agree? After all, this is a kidney.” Jo-Eum's eyes are full of the light of calculation.
In order to stay alive and just in case, she would never let Qiao Nan refuse.
“Miss Qiao, come see your sister, why don't you go in?” Qiao Ziyin chatted with Ding Jiayi. The voice of the nurse came from outside the door.
Qiao Ziyin's face changed dramatically: “Mom...” The conversation she just had with her mom was all heard by {Jiao Nan, the dead girl?
Without saying a word, Ding Jiayi got up and chased him out. Sure enough, she saw Qiao Nan's back, then shouted out Qiao Nan's name.
When Qiao Nan heard Ding Jiayi's cries, she didn't want to go back or stop. Tears kept falling, but her heart shattered one by one.
For her mom, her sister, she doesn't even have a home of her own, but her mom and her sister have calculated that her money isn't enough; they still want her kidney now.
Ding Jiayi didn't understand what Qiao Ziyi said, but Qiao Nan understood it. The more this happened, the more Qiao Nan hated it; even if she actually owes the Qiao family, it should be enough!
As soon as Qiao Nan had a headache, she wanted to tell her mom that it was dangerous on the street; a car rushed at her.
“Whoa,” “bang,” the two loud noises burst into her ears. Qiao Nan was in so much pain all over her body that she couldn't say anything, yet she barely opened her eyes and wanted to see what was going on with her mom.
Ding Jiayi was indeed frightened. Seeing her little daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over and muttered, “Qiao Nan, it's good that you're dead; at least you can help your sister if you die. Zi Yin has kidneys and money too!”
The little girl was hit to death. Whoever hits her will definitely lose money.
Hearing Ding Jiayi's words, Qiao Nan immediately blinked and stared at Ding Jiayi to death. Without waiting for the paramedics to arrive, she couldn't survive until Ding Jiayi died alive!
CHAPTER 1
There's nothing more annoying about the world than the moment you were still fantasizing about heaven, but the next moment you found yourself in hell.
Mo Wen is this kind of person. Two months ago, he was still sitting in his classroom and fantasizing about being admitted to a key university in Xinyi, yet at this time he was working as a minor worker on a construction site exposed to the scorching sun.
Remembering his miserable experience, Mo Wen took a hard spit on the ground, raised his hand indiscriminately, and wiped the sweat that was constantly flowing down his face. I had just moved a car of bricks, and I was already sweaty at this point.
Mo Wen, a 178-year-old teenager with an ordinary face, dark skin, a slim figure, and a pair of calm eyes. Perhaps the children of poor families have long been the parents; at his younger age, he makes people look like they are a bit old.
As soon as the cement truck carrying the bricks in his hand went to the side of the road, Mo Wen found a shady place to sit down. The foreman wasn't there at this time, so it was a good time to be secretly lazy. Being able to be lazy for a while on a boring and busy construction site makes me happy.
He was sitting on a concrete slab, and his eyes were constantly patrolling the road; his eyes soon lit up; a beautiful figure walking across the road immediately attracted his attention.
Although it's a long distance and you can't see the other person's appearance, the figure is definitely attractive, especially the walking posture is very elegant, like a professionally trained model.
Don't just look at women walking; there's a lot of learning in it. Meanwhile, Mo Wencheng is on the construction site; the opposite side is the road and sidewalk.
He seemed to remember something. Pulling a cyan metal disc out of his chest of clothes, only the size of a coin, held by a small blue chain, like a strange necklace.
This is also something that Mo Wen discovered by accident when he was demolishing an ancient house a few days ago. At the time, he discovered an ancient blue brick in one of the walls. The blue brick was potholed and completely destroyed. It is estimated that it is an ancient brick with a history of 100 years.
If it were any other antiques with 100 years of history, I'm afraid they would still be worth a little bit of money, but a blue brick, even if it's an antique, probably isn't worth any money at all.
At the time, Mo Wen threw the blue brick on the ground at random, but he didn't want the blue brick to break and drop a piece of metal jewelry from inside. It was a strange necklace in Mo Wen's hand.
The cyan metal disc is a bit strange. It is divided into eight areas on the plate, and various strange runes are engraved on it.
Mo Wen isn't familiar with antiquities, but he can also see that what he has in his hand is probably a scaled-down version of a gossip pan. Ordinary people would hang a gossip pan at home to seek good fortune and avoid criminals, using it as a tool of worship.
Although he is not superstitious and doesn't believe in the power of gossip pan to gain luck and avoid murder, he also knows that this kind of old gossip pan should be of great value. Maybe it's still an antique. If you sell it to an antique dealer, it's likely that you will become rich overnight.
Mo Wen's eyes were full of hope, and caressing the gossip necklace was like caressing his lover. Once they have become rich people, those big beautiful women who only dared to peek from afar and secretly swallow saliva are not left to be taken by him.
“Something happened. Something happened!”
“Something happened! Call an ambulance.”
A loud cry never sounded far away, and quite a few people ran there right after that. The shouting interrupted Mo Wen's dream at the same time.
He took a puzzled look over there and hesitated a bit. Instead, he stood up and ran over there to the place where the crowd had gathered.
As soon as his eyes were swept away, he jumped at the situation right in front of him. At nearly 50 years old, the middle-aged man, dressed in a slumber, was constantly convulsing while lying on the ground. He looked pale, took a big breath, and covered his chest tightly with his hands. It seemed very painful.
There was a deep sense of fear in his eyes, and he seemed to feel death.
Many workers arrived, but no one dared to step forward. A group of uneducated workers apparently didn't know what had happened and were afraid to act rashly.
“Acute myocardial infarction!”
Mo Wen's face changed slightly. There was an unsightly look at the old Zhang twitching on the ground. He recognized Lao Zhang's condition at a glance, because someone in the village had a sudden acute myocardial infarction and died in just a few minutes. He witnessed the whole process with his own eyes.
The village he lives in is very remote. There are basically no professional doctors in the village. Usually when he gets sick or anything, he simply treats them with earthworks handed down from his ancestors; there is no targeted treatment at all.
However, his mother is frail and sick, and there are no doctors in the village. His biggest dream is to be admitted to the most famous medical university in the country and become a doctor to treat his mother and people in the village in the future.
Unfortunately, he lost in the college entrance examination. Originally, he could have been admitted to Huaxia University Medical School with his score and be eligible for free admission, but he was replaced by a powerful boy from his family. It was clearly lower than his score, but he was squeezed out.
Although he can be admitted to other good schools based on his grades, the high tuition fees are an expense he simply cannot afford. In order not to burden his mother, he can only quit his studies and start working to earn money.
The construction site is in a development zone on the edge of the city. It is very far from the city. It takes 25 minutes for an ambulance from the nearest hospital to arrive. It depends on what the patient looks like and whether they can hold out for 25 minutes is a matter of two. Hold on for 25 minutes? That's just a miracle!
He knows this person. He lives in the same shed as him. His name is Zhang Roshi. Normally, everyone calls him Lao Zhang. He is an honest and honest person. Since he doesn't have any skills, he can only work as a lower-level worker on the construction site.
It is said that he also has a son who is in college, and he works so hard to earn money for his son to go to college.
Mo Wen looked at his colleague Lao Zhang on the ground with some hesitation. His dream was to become a doctor. He had a certain understanding of the pathology of some simple and common conditions. For acute myocardial infarctions, he knew there were several first aid measures that could relieve the condition.
But in these years, who dares to save people at will? Being able to save nature is a good thing, but if you don't save a good person, the patient has three strengths and two weaknesses, and I'm afraid the responsibility will fall on him.
This is the reality of the Naiho society. Perhaps simply taking some emergency measures to relieve the condition and prolong the time of death can save a person's life. However, Mo Wen, like everyone else around him, was afraid to rashly step forward to help.
After taking a deep breath, he was slightly silent for a while. Finally, he sighed and walked towards Lao Zhang, who was in the midst of his illness. He's not a good person, but Lao Zhang has a good relationship with him. They are all poor rural people who come out to work. They deeply understand each other's hardships. Lao Zhang is the backbone of the whole family. Watching Lao Zhang die, his conscience can't do it.
“Don't touch him, I'm a doctor.”
A beautiful figure came from afar, trotted all the way through the cluttered construction site, and trotted to the site of the incident.
Mo Wen shuddered slightly and subconsciously stopped. As soon as a burst of fragrance hit, she had a beautiful figure in front of her.
It was a beautiful girl. She was tall. She was only half a head shorter than Mo Wen. She had a beige floral dress. The hem fell at the curve of her leg, showing off a pair of slender, white legs. Along the way, her dress fluttered, and Chu Chu was moved.
Mo Wen couldn't help but look in a daze. Every day he squats on the construction site peeking at young girls passing by, but this is the first time he has seen such a beautiful girl! A beautiful, naturally unsculpted face kept echoing in his mind! It's not Fantailed, but it's amazing.
He discovered that the girl in the white dress was the same woman who had previously been across the street. He had quietly adulterated others. I only now know that not only are they in good shape, but they also have surprisingly beautiful faces.
The girl ignored the question. She just crouched down to check on Lao Zhang's condition. Soon her beautiful face changed. It seemed like the situation was a bit serious.
Mo Wen also knows that the patient is in shock at this time, and the situation is not optimistic.
“Can you help me?”
The girl looked up and looked anxiously at Mo Wen. At this point, Mo Wen was the closest to the patient and naturally found him as soon as possible.
“Yes!”
Mo Wen shuddered. He didn't expect the girl to ask him for help, but she quickly reacted and hurriedly walked over to the girl.
“Can you help me flatten his body and lift his legs slightly?” While carefully performing external chest compression surgery on Lao Zhang, the girl asked Mo.
Mo Wen already knew some ways to relieve a myocardial infarction, and soon followed what the girl said. He knew the girl was right about the method. The purpose of lifting the patient's legs was to prevent the shock patient's brain from running out of oxygen. Currently, when there are no devices such as oxygen tanks, this is the best solution.
He suddenly noticed that his chest was burning and getting hotter, and there seemed to be a red block of iron stuck to his chest. His face changed slightly. He subconsciously touched his chest and discovered that it was the gossip plate unearthed from the ancient blue brick.
Yasurin stood at the top of a tall building, facing the hustle and bustle of the wind.
The wind was raging, and that feeling of losing weight so rapidly that even though he was already unlovable, he was frightened and screamed. “Save my life! ! !”
The fear of impending death engulfed his entire body, causing every part of his body to tremble.
At this point, Anlin's whole body was suddenly enveloped in a mysterious white ball of light.
The terrible feeling of being overweight also came at this moment. He felt like he was on a roller coaster, rushed to the bottom, then went around a curve and flew up into the sky.
Yasurin's screams continued. After his body flew into the sky, he fell back on top of the roof.
The extreme sense of being overweight and losing weight, and the alternating feeling of life and death made Anlin feel a bit dizzy in his head, then reluctantly threw up.
“Hey hey, lad, are you better?” Just then, an ethereal voice reached Anlin's ears.
He looked up and saw an old man looking at him lovingly.
The old man has white hair, a fairy style, and a golden fairy spirit lingers all over his body, looking holy and immaculate.
Seeing this scene, Yasurin's whole body was shocked, and countless stories came to mind.
Various plots are beginning to pop into Anlin's mind, so isn't the beginning of all his dreams just the scene right before his eyes!
Thumb!
Anlin knocked her head and burst into tears: “Immortals, thank you for saving me!”
The old man, who was called a fairy by An Lin, caressed his white beard and smiled slightly, “Boy, you're in your prime, why would you prefer to be light?”
“My mother died young, and my father was addicted to gambling.” “After my father ran out of gambling on the house, he owed millions more and was unable to repay his gambling debts, and then he ran away alone!”
“Millions! What am I going to pay back?”
“After that, I was forced to drop out of school and work hard for my debtors.”
An Lin complained with his nose and tears, only feeling that his life was dark. What's the difference between a life where you've been paying debts all your life and saltwater fish; it's better to have a baby sooner.
After listening to Anlin's experience, the immortal also had a sympathetic look in his eyes. He slowly said, “Young man, your life is really painful... well, you and I have a relationship when we meet, and I think you have excellent qualifications. Why don't you just let Ben Xian send you a set of 'systems' to change your life.”
Anlin shuddered all over his body when he heard the news. He thought it was a great blessing to be able to form a fairy relationship with the Immortals, but he didn't expect the Immortals to take such a big step; they actually sent it to the system as soon as they met!
“Woohoo, Grandpa Xianren, you are so nice to me! I really don't know how to repay you!”
The fairy smiled lovingly, with his palm facing the sky, followed by a pure white ball of light, which appeared in his palm.
“Lad, come here and hold this ball of light in the palm of your hand.” Xianren said to Anlin.
According to the rumor, An Lin was thrilled and couldn't wait to hold the ball of light.
The ball of light emits a hint of warmth in his hands, and the light shining through the ball is extremely soft.
“Start system migration.” The fairy spoke slowly.
The words of the Immortals have just fallen, and the light on the white ball of light is shining brightly!
At this point, Xianren said to An Lin, “Young man, take an oath and swear to accept this God of War system and never give up for the rest of your life!”
God of War system?
What a dominating name!
But how does this vow look like a declaration of marriage?
Too late to think about it, Anlin hurriedly said, “I promise to accept the God of War system and never give up for the rest of my life!”
As soon as Anlin finished speaking his vow, the ball of light hit his body directly into the ground and became one with him.
Immediately after that, a voice sounded in his mind: “Test that the host has a natural physique, meets the qualifications, and the system begins to integrate!”
Anlin was so excited that she wanted to cry.
I originally thought my life was bleak, but I didn't expect the peak to turn, but now I have a life with an open system!
Immortals are also very excited, and they're so excited that they're already crying!
“Grandpa Xianren, what happened to you, are you okay?” Seeing the old man acting strangely, Anlin inquired curiously.
Immortals came back to their senses, wiped away tears, and knew they had made a mistake.
“Lad, once you get the system, you have to cheer up.” Immortals have a long center of gravity.
“Hmm! I will!” Anlin is the focus of Anlin.
“So, do you want to go to school Xiuxian?” The immortal went on to ask.
Going to school to Shuxian? Only a fool would say no, OK!
“I think, I really want to Xiuxian!”
Yasurin almost didn't think about it, so he opened up and answered. The Xianren smiled with joy. He pulled out a piece of gold paper and handed it to An Lin, then said, “This is my letter of recommendation. Once you have it, you can study at Xiuxian Union University and officially embark on the Xiuxian path.”
An Lin was shocked. Daring to love the Lung Aotian Xixian Road, the Immortals paved the way for themselves!
He solemnly took the letter of recommendation from the Immortals to himself and looked at the Immortals with gratitude.
Yasurin is very curious about this immortal who gave him a new birth.
“Well... let's not say the name.” The fairy caressed Yasurin above his head, with a sympathetic look on his face.
“I gotta go, bye lad.”
The immortals bid farewell to Anlin, and the clouds drived away.
“Immortals, walk slowly!” Yasurin is grateful to the fairy that flew into the sky.
The laughter of the immortals came from heaven. The laughter was so cheerful and unbridled, as if it had poured out a lifetime of grievances.
Why are these immortals so happy, why do they feel happier than me?
Yasurin was puzzled.
Just then, a female voice sounded in Anlin's consciousness: “Hello.”
This woman has a beautiful voice, just like the sky, and I can hear Anlin's ingenuity all over her body.
Is this the sound of the system?
Yasurin was unsure.
At this point, an interface appeared in Anlin's mind.
The interface is grey and white, and only a few words are shown on it: the Ares system's features will be activated after entering Taichu.
What the hell is Taichu mainland?
Anlin thought of the letter of recommendation from Xianren. He spread out the golden paper in his hand with anticipation.
Next, he discovered that there was nothing inside the gold paper; only a slightly sunken handprint.
An Lin didn't understand the reason, but he still followed the trend and placed his hand on the paper, which matched that handprint.
Suddenly, there was a lot of gold on the paper, and Anlin only had time to say “huh” in surprise, and was completely swallowed up by that golden light.
Anlin only felt that the sky was spinning for a while, and his field of vision changed from dark to bright again.
Then he discovered that his body had once again appeared in the sky and began to land freely.
Once again, Anlin experienced the feeling of jumping from a building. No matter how many times the sour feeling came, he wanted to shed tears.
An Lin looked up in a difficult way, then saw a scene he would never forget.
Two hundred tall white-patterned dragon gate pillars stand between the skyline, with a subtle font engraved on the plaque that he couldn't read.
Behind the gate, there are tens of millions of palaces; there is no end in sight.
Colorful clouds wandered around the palace, and all kinds of creatures soared between heaven and earth, creating a grand and magnificent Xianjia atmosphere.
Yasurin stood still and looked shocked.
It turns out there really is a wonderland in this world!
An Lin tried to calm her mood and calm herself down.
After a while, he saw a woman in a Taoist robe walking up and hurriedly went up to say hello.
“Hello, fairy sister.” Yasubayashi waved to the girl.
When the beautiful woman saw Anlin waving at her, she walked over.
Anlin was a bit excited to see the situation and asked, “This beautiful fairy sister, may I ask what kind of place this is? I'm new here, and I don't really know this place.”
When she heard Anlin's words, the woman looked a bit strange and said, “Grumpy?”
“Ah, what are you saying?” Yasurin is a bit puzzled.
The woman showed the same expression as Anlin, and said, “Guri purr, grin?”
Yasurin was blindsided at this moment, and a terrible conjecture appeared in his mind.
“Sister fairy, can you speak Mandarin?” Yasurayashi's eyes are a bit wet.
“Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa?” The beautiful woman placed her hands on her waist and was a bit angry.
Done, I don't understand the language.
What the hell is she talking about? I can't understand it at all!
! Nani? In the end, Anlin cried.
“Yell!”
“Yell!”
“Yell!”
Hundreds of people gathered on one platform screaming and cheering. The crowd was surrounded by dozens of cars, most of which were supercars.
The most notable aspect is the two cars that are about to run.
One is the most expensive bright red Ferrari 488 in the market, worth over 4 million. The one next to it is the cheapest Ford Mustang in the market, worth 500,000. Together, the two cars form a stark contrast.
This is a confrontation between Liu Feng, a new junior in Beijing, and Zhang Han, one of the top four.
On the side of the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han leaned silently against the car door. His costume was shaky and his hair was very long. When he looked down, people couldn't see his closed eyes. From his cut cheeks on the lower half of his cheeks, we can still vaguely see how handsome Zhang was back then, but now his temperament has become full of decadence.
Meanwhile, Liu Feng, in the crowd on the right, was like all the stars holding the moon. His expression seemed like he was saying that the whole world was at his feet.
“Let's take a look at Zhang Da-shao, who used to be tall.”
Liu Feng waved his hand and walked past with a sneer from the corner of his mouth.
“Zhang Da Shao?”
“Are you asleep? Zhang Da-shao, who was once unrivaled, now looks like this. Hehe, it's about to start the game, how nonchalant is my Zhang Da-shao!”
“He looks like this now; I think he's just a poor person asking for food!”
“No, I don't think he's even good at asking for food; maybe it's a pig diet.”
On the side of the Ford Mustang, there is an overgrown man with glasses. He has a three- or four-year-old girl on his leg.
The little girl had a long, pink, jade look like a cute princess in a fairy tale. Her delicate little face was like the cute princess in a fairy tale. Other than her messy hair, everything else was perfect, but at this time, the little girl's big, clear eyes contained tears of grievance. Listening to the crowd's comments on Zhang Han, she seemed to be about to weep.
In normal times, I think the cute little girl's cute appearance would attract a lot of attention, but now, it's time for Liu Feng to perform alone.
A bout of ridicule and abuse finally made Zhang Han have a slight reaction.
As soon as Zhang Han opened his eyes, his eyes were dazed. Seeing the actions of the people in front of him, his eyes curled. There was a sense of contempt for the world in his eyes.
“How dare the dogs bark in front of the elephant?”
An inexplicable remark like this popped out of Zhang Han's mouth.
The audience was quiet, but the next moment, there was an ironic burst of laughter.
“Zhang Han, I think you're really crazy, aren't you?”
“I'm afraid I've become a fool.”
The crowd mocked once again, but Zhang Han was stunned when he saw the picture in front of him clearly.
“Isn't this when I raced with Liu Feng on Langhang Mountain in 2009?”
“Why am I here?”
“Aren't I going to rob the sky?”
“Am I back...?”
“Have I been reborn after being bombarded by the Divine Thunder?” There was a tremor in Zhang Han's eyes.
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight largest families that went to Beijing. Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at the time, so Zhang Han was not afraid, but once the family was on a plane trip, there was an air crash along the way. Her parents and younger sister were killed, and her second uncle Zhang Ming became the head of the family, but that didn't stop the Zhang family from falling lonely.
Zhang Han was hit hard at the time, believing that his family had been murdered, and began a private investigation into Zhang Ming, who had always hated his father, but was discovered, and Zhang Han had offended quite a few people before, and was eventually evicted from the Zhang family.
It's been five years until now. Zhang Han refused to leave. He always wanted to find out the matter. The days were very difficult, but he always persisted, until this incident on Wolhang Mountain.
I remember when I first raced at Wolverine Mountain, I was seriously injured in an accident, lost both arms, and finally jumped off a cliff after five years of rest. I didn't expect to enter Xiuzhen World by accident. Beginning to come into contact with Xiuxian, Zhang Han woke up his genius — smelling a treasure nose. His nose could smell the treasure within a certain range.
With this magic trick, over the course of 500 years, Zhang Han used all kinds of treasures to build it up to the extreme.
“Why wasn't it five years ago?”
Zhang Han's expression raised a hint of loneliness.
Not being able to do his filial piety has always been the biggest regret in Zhang Han's heart. Before his loved ones left, he was too young and sensible, causing a lot of trouble to his father, and even said a lot of sad words that made her mother feel. All of this is irretrievable no matter how much she regrets.
Baek Seon-hyo comes first. Although Zhang Han initially said he was rebellious, his love for his parents was no less than that of others.
The trees want to be quiet and the wind doesn't stop, and the children want to be nurtured and can't wait to be close.
“Zhang Han!”
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's contemplation. He looked up, only to see Liu Feng look at himself with a cold eye.
“You kicked me out of Beijing five years ago!
Today, five years from now, I'm the car king in Los Angeles, Liu Feng, has made a strong comeback, yet you Zhang Han are not as good as a living pig! Remember, today I, Liu Feng, will let you take Zhang Han out of Beijing!”
“Oh, that great?” Zhang Han was astonished and refused, “Then I'm not comparable.”
“Zhang Han!”
Liu Feng shook the Ferrari car key in his hand and said, “As long as you beat me, this car is yours.” “Then it would be hard for me to be kind.”
Zhang Hanmei said with a smile.
“Huh.”
Liu Feng sneered and raised his hand and commanded all of his hands, “Set up the screen!”
At the end of the conversation, the crowd behind them set up several TV screens. At the same time, they also raised remote control aircraft all over Langhang Mountain. The screen was turned on, and the footage from the remote control plane was transmitted back one by one, showing the entire track of Wolhang Mountain.
“Ready to begin!”
Liu Feng nodded secretly at the fat guy with glasses on the back of the Ford Mustang and got into the Ferrari.
“Daddy (Daddy), Come on (go), Beat the Bad Guys
“Why can a very cute little girl just call her dad?”
Zhang Han shook his head in a funny way.
“Brother, you will definitely win!”
The fat man shook his fist at Zhang Han and gave him a look of encouragement.
“With your words, your car will bring me good luck.”
Zhang Han took a faint look at him and sat sideways into the Mustang carriage.
“Ready!”
The engines of the two cars let out an angry roar at the same time.
At Ferrari, Liu Feng had a proud smile on the corner of his mouth.
The fat guy in the back had a deep smile.
The eyes of the lovely princess at his feet were full of fear and concern. Her eyes were tearful, making Chu Chu feel sorry.
Meanwhile, Zhang Han, in the Mustang, had a sneer at the corner of his mouth.
“Do you want to hurt me by colluding?”
“Unfortunately, I'm not who I was back then.” “Even if nothing has been done now, how can we just wait for the ants to provoke?”
CHAPTER I
Rust Lake.
Federal Special Waste Disposal Site No. 23.
Also known as the “tomb of the magic weapon.”
With the continuous development of the Xiuzhen civilization, the magic weapon that was once lofty and could only be driven by people practicing the truth has entered thousands of households and has become an essential tool for ordinary people to travel from home, study, and work.
While it brings convenience to life, it also generates a large amount of scrap magic tricks and metal waste.
Most of these garbage magic tricks have a lot of energy left behind, which can easily cause radiation pollution. The runes used to construct magic tricks are also extremely unstable, and there is even a risk of explosion. If left unchecked, they will cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the Federation, several “special garbage disposal sites” will always be set up to specifically dispose of scrapping magic tricks.
The No. 23 special garbage disposal site is located in the southern suburbs of “Fugo City”, a major federal training town.
Under the dark sky, a polluted purple swamp emanates a strong stench. The mountain made of metal fragments is like hundreds of dinosaurs showing their backs from the swamp. The mountain is full of fragmented flying swords. There are rusty gemstone puppets sitting next to the flying sword. The hollow eye sockets have already extinguished the spiritual flame. The only thing left is a bug that feeds on the spirit, finding its head from the inside, carefully measuring the magic weapon of this four-way crisis.” graveyard”.
“Boom!”
Countless metal components, like Heavenly Lady, scattered all over the place, also triggered a series of collapse of several surrounding garbage mountains, raising smoke and dust all over the sky, dancing like demons, covering the entire sky.
This seems like a no-go zone for life; only a few cockroaches and worms regard it as a paradise.
Lee Yew lay dormant behind a garbage heap and licked her chapped lips. The earthy yellow trench coat was covered with dust, making him blend in with the environment.
He glanced at the explosion clouds not far away. The young man's clear eyes didn't show the slightest emotion; the waves were displeased.
It was only when dirt and metal shards were splashed onto the garbage heap where he was hiding that he retracted slightly deeper into the garbage heap while wearing goggles that covered half of his face.
“Here it is!”
At 3:52 p.m., the daily routine garbage disposal time is also a carnival time for Lee Yew's “trash bug”!
The Reiko watch he wears on his left wrist is a hunter-specific model launched by Zongmen's “Feiling Zong” three years ago. It took him two months to fix it after he picked it up in the garbage heap.
In addition to timing, it also has a very powerful function that can record a special frequency of vibration and notify the owner when a specific vibration comes from nearby.
This feature was originally used to remind hunters that there might be powerful monsters nearby.
However, after Lee Yew's modification, it became a reminder that a garbage ship was about to appear.
Moments later, along with a slight hum, more than a dozen dark spots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this point, the smoke and dust that shrouded the sky and sun from the explosion had not yet dissipated. More than a dozen small dark spots were mixed in, and it was not clear at all.
Lee Yew shrugged the tip of his nose and lightly touched a rune on the side of the goggle, “cheer,” and the surface of the goggle was blood-red.
Scanned by red light, the garbage ship hidden behind the smoke and dust was outlined in a circle, clearly.
Meanwhile, the hunting function of the Reiko watch also firmly locked in the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
“Junk Ship 1327, that's you!”
From birth until the age of ten, Lee Yew stayed at the Devil's Tomb for ten years. She knows every inch of land and every garbage ship in the sky here. This “No. 1327 garbage ship” is specifically responsible for collecting garbage from the “Upper East Side” of Hugo City.
The Shangdong District is the most luxurious and affluent district in the city. There are quite a few people who practice truth living there, and the magic weapon they have abandoned is also the most valuable.
There are quite a few magic tricks that are even in perfect condition, only because they are slightly obsolete, or because they have introduced a new generation of products, and have been thrown away unscrupulously by the real handlers and the rich.
For Lee Yew, what kind of garbage ship is this; it's simply a treasure ship full of gold mines!
“Hehe!”
Lee Yew shot out like a projectile and hurried through the garbage mountains, rushing towards smoke and dust, and rushing towards the “garbage ship No. 1327”!
Surrounded by a shaky garbage mountain, there is a “rumbling” bubbly poison swamp under his feet, but Lee Yew is like the most dexterous monkey in the mountains. From time to time, with strength at a prominent part of the garbage mountain, he can pop out tens of meters away every time he pedals. His movements are flowing through the water, which is pleasing to the eye.
“Li Yao, you bastard, are grabbing food with Laozi again!”
At this point, more than a dozen figures came out of the back of several garbage heaps, almost dressed like Lee Yew, but they didn't wear his advanced Blood Red Goggles and Spirit Watch.
These people are all holding shovels and iron bars in their hands, and they are acting menacingly.
Like Lee Yew, they are all trash bugs that eat mixed meals at the “No. 23 Special Waste Disposal Site.”
Where there is interest, there are fights. A ship of abandoned magic tricks may be just garbage for high-ranking truth repairers, but for these lower-level poor people, it is a hope for survival. Lee Yew is the best trash bug mixed in magic weapon graves. Naturally, it is also a stab in the eyes of most trash bugs and a sting in the flesh.
But Lee Yew didn't care. He smiled. His lower back suddenly became strong, and his figure was strangely discounted. He actually turned 90 degrees without warning, flashed off an angry obese teenager in front of him. He also took advantage of the momentum and stepped hard on his fat face. Taking advantage of this foot, the whole person stepped another 340 meters.
“Fat Dragon, everyone comes out to eat mixed meals. Whoever is faster than that, you should lose weight!”
There was a huge red mark on the face of the obese teenager. His nose almost fell into fat. He shouted in anger, commanded his men to chase and relentlessly, and the team quickly entered the smoky area.
There has just been an explosion here. It's extremely unstable. Dozens of garbage mountains can collapse at any time. Even the vicious Feilong and a group of teenagers can't help but slow down and watch Lee Yiu-feng run wild.
Fat Dragon couldn't help but take a bite.
There was no end to the conversation. Another explosion occurred inside a garbage mountain not far from Lee Yew. Tens of thousands of tons of metal components and broken magic tricks washed away like a flash flood!
“So smart!”
But I heard a scream coming from the smoke and dust: “Little Hei, help!”
A dark beam of radiation deeper than the night sky came out and “drizzled” in the metal flash flood, then rushed over the middle of the sky, but it was a flying sword with rust spots, a gap in the blade, and a dark body. This flying sword had huge protective hands that spread like black wings. Lee Yew was like a drowning person grabbing a straw, lying very clumsily on the flying sword, all around her body shining dark and rushing to the sky!
In the sky, more than a dozen garbage boats have already revealed their huge shapes. Each garbage boat is hundreds of meters long. The round shape is like the legendary turtle that supports the earth. The “turtle shell” is densely engraved with tens of thousands of runes, flashing light, and colorful colors to help these tens of thousands of tons of people withstand the attack of gravity.
“Whoa!”
The hatch on the abdomen of a “big turtle” opens, bursts of metal components and broken magic weapons, and hits the ground hard.
For an hour, the spiritual forces of heaven and earth stirred like crazy, setting off a turbulent wave!
Even the tens of thousands of tons of garbage ships rocked left and right in a wave of spiritual energy, bumpy violently, and had to be desperately separated to reduce the interference.
People like Fat Dragon are even more afraid to approach easily; they are afraid of being affected.
Lee Yew still rode her black flying sword and rushing left to right in the wave of spiritual energy. Although the wolf had reached its extreme, it was as flexible as a mudslide.
Of course, he didn't dare to face the turbulent waves, but with more than ten years of survival experience, he tried to find a relatively calm safe area between spiritual forces and tides, just to get as close as possible to the landing point of the garbage magic weapon, and get close to the water stairs first.
After almost ten minutes of dumping, the garbage boat roared like a behemoth, changed direction, sailed back lazily, and the smoke gradually dissipated.
It was hard for Feilong to climb into the center of a dumping center full of garbage. He saw Lee Yew sitting comfortably on a brand-new garbage mountain and looking at him with a smile.
“Damn it!”
Fat Dragon's face was shaking all over her face, but at the bottom of her heart, it was quite entangled.
The garbage mountain chosen by Lee Yew is quite ingenious. It's not the biggest garbage mountain, nor does it look like the one with the richest materials.
There are also dozens of garbage mountains scattered around, containing valuable garbage magic tricks.
If they continue to get involved with Lee Yew here, they may be benefited by other trashbug fishermen.
Other trash bugs have already appeared all around, and many of the garbage mountains are cheering; someone has discovered something valuable.
Fei Long heard that Lee Yew, this bad boy, is also a student at the famous “Chixiao School No. 2 Affiliated High School” in Fugo City.
The Chixiao School is a well-known major sect in the southern part of the Federation. It has strong strength and many experts.
Although Lee Yew doesn't have to learn any real story, it's not something that can be dealt with with three punches and two feet. Otherwise, after breaking through the magic weapon tomb for more than ten years, she is still in full swing, and she is also known as a “vulture”!
But he just left, where did his face go again?
His nose is still embedded in the flesh! My heart was getting tangled. A strong wind passed by, and the fat dragon subconsciously reached out and tried. It had cold hands, but it was a scrapped crystal brain the size of a fist.
Lee Yew smiled and said, “Fat Dragon, everyone came out to buy a living. Isn't it just the last time they robbed you of a 'starlight' type crystal, but they didn't kill your dad. As for the endless death? Hmm, I just found a 'Snapdragon 17' crystal brain made from 'Qinglongmen'. It is the most advanced model. It can calculate more than 5,000 ideas per second. Even though it burns out, I think it can sell for 3,4,000 yuan, just as if I honor your Big Brother Fat Long. From now on, let's make a point, how about?”
“You...” Fat Dragon didn't expect Lee Yew to come out like this. She immediately stunned. Some couldn't believe it and scratched the fat on her face.
“Hey, look over there. The members of the 'Wild Wolf Gang' are almost here. They're not like me as a lone traveler. They will definitely eat away dozens of garbage mountains and won't even leave any screws for you!” Lee Yew pointed to the west.
“Good boy, you have a set! Let's go, quickly clean the goods!”
A trashy of garbage bugs dispersed and rushed to the garbage mountains on all sides.
Lee Yew took a long sigh of relief. Her butt was sitting in the garbage heap. Sweat the size of a bean rolled down her forehead, and her smiley face instantly burst into tears.
“Fat guy, the 'Snapdragon' grade crystal brain I've worked so hard to find is cheaper for you in vain!”
“Just wait, is my 'Vulture Lee Yew” stuff this good?
One day I want you to throw it out of me after eating mine, take mine back, and add interest on usury loans to let you know why everyone calls me a 'vulture that wants money and is mortal! '”
“No, you have to speed it up. The 'Wild Wolf Gang' is a bunch of clutches, but it's even more unreasonable than the Fat Dragon!”
“Mom, how many times have I told you that I'm going to save people, not suicide!”
“Don't lie to your mom, you can't even steal a dog, save someone? Besides, there's no one in the river at all!”
Wang Yao was speechless. Today he came down from the mountain and saw someone fall into the river next to the village. He hurriedly jumped down to save people. He only remembered after jumping off. What's even more ironic is that it wasn't a human; it was an inflatable doll, the kind that fell into the water.
“Does anyone else in the village actually use this thing in style?!”
This was his last thought before he lost consciousness. When he woke up again, he was lying on his bed with his parents next to him, and his eyes were tight.
Less than a day later, the whole village knew that foolish contracted the mountain. The college student growing herbal medicine couldn't think of it and committed suicide by jumping into the river. “Today's kids haven't experienced any setbacks; they can't stand it!”
“Well, 80% of the kids have gone to school and are now famous college students who still go home to cultivate land?”
“That's it!”
“We don't grow this medicine anymore!”
The father, who had always been sitting on the sidelines to smoke his cigarette bag, popped out of his cheer. The people in the village had a nice face. When Lao Wang heard this rumor, he went ahead and planted it. He didn't lose any money. Unfortunately, even his son lost it.
“That is, listen to Mom this time, stop growing herbs. Go to the city another day and ask your sister to help find a decent job. The children of your third uncle Chang Mao just graduated from an unfamous school. They found a job in the city, and now they are all buying houses there!” Wang Yao's mother also spoke on the sidelines.
After hearing it, Wang Yao stopped lifting the pressure with her parents; she had no choice but to nod and accept it.
He was originally a graduate of a prestigious university. After graduation, he returned to the mountain village with enthusiasm, started his own business, contracted a barren mountain in the village, and wanted to grow herbs and become rich. As a result, it wasn't until he actually started drying that this herbal medicine was far from as simple as he had imagined. It wasn't enough to just be passionate, and many things weren't in the books; they only relied on practice and experience.
In the first year, the herb he grew suffered from worm disease and lost its blood. In the second year, the herb blossomed and had long leaves but didn't grow roots. This was the third year. Seeing that it had improved a bit, the problem broke out again.
However, after feeling well, he went up to Nanshan Mountain. This is a barren mountain. Perhaps because of the soil, there are not many crops. There are more than a dozen large chestnut trees and jujube trees. There are a few acres of medicinal fields on the mountain that he painstakingly reclaimed. For this reason, he also specifically spent money to build a small house on the mountain, pulled on electricity, and took care of these few acres of medicinal fields. The wind, rain, spring, summer, autumn and winter, he said he really couldn't give up..
Looking at the herb, which is growing well, he reached out and touched it.
Do you want to try it again for another year?
“If the herb has been detected and the trigger conditions have been met, will it be activated?”
A cold mechanical sound suddenly started ringing out.
“What sound, who? !”
Surrounded by mountains, water, and woods, but no one.
“Hum, did you have an illusion?”
“Are you sure you want to activate the system?”
The sound of the machine sounded once again, and it seemed like it was within easy reach.
“There are ghosts!”
Wang Yao was full of excitement.
Pharmacist system?
As soon as he said these few words, a light curtain appeared in front of him, very much like the character panel in Wang Yu.
An illusion, it must be an illusion.
He shook his head vigorously, and the light curtain that appeared out of thin air disappeared.
Wang Wang, just at this point, a native dog rushed down the mountain and came beside him, spitting its tongue and shaking its tail. He looked very happy.
“Sanshen, where have you been again?”
This is a native dog raised by Wang Yao. It has accompanied him on this mountain for three years. One person and one dog went into the mountain hut. Wang Yao took a trip to bed and felt a bit dizzy.
“What was that thing just now?”
He read the uniform name again. As a result, the light curtain reappeared, as if it were a projection.
“Here it is again!”
After several tests, Wang Yao determined that this thing was not an illusion, but something that actually existed and could not be explained by science. The characters have attributes, skills, and packages, just like an online game.
Career Level: Rookie (Actually, you can't even count as a bird; at most, you count as an egg!
Physical fitness 1, strength 0.9, mentality 0.85, agility 0.9, will 1.1 (1 is the average level of a normal adult male).
Is this true? He was completely blindsided.
Great, he's growing herbs now; this is what he's missing! Wang Yao, who came back to his senses, suddenly jumped up with excitement and was shocked by the “Sanxian” on the sidelines.
There's also a skill panel? Wang Yao wanted to order it but didn't watch it.
“Why can't you open it?” he asked subconsciously.
“I can't grow any herbs. I still want to do something else. Go get rid of the poop!”
Seems like I heard his question, and a line like this popped up on the panel.
Damn, what kind of situation is this? Who designed it, come out, I promise I won't kill you! “What's this again?”
Wang Yu looked in the package column and found a sign that looked like a water bottle.
The ancient spring pot contains ancient spring water, one bucket a day.
How do you use it, can you reach for it?
As soon as Wang Yao's thought moved, she had an extra thing in her hand. It was a wooden water jug. It was quaint. It was still quite heavy when he shook it gently, and there was a sound of water bubbles inside.
“There's so much water! Ancient spring water?”
He found a bucket from the room and poured out the water in the water bottle. The water kept coming out of the small pot, but it didn't stop draining until the whole bucket was filled.
So amazing?
! Wang Yao looked blankly at the water in the bucket. It was very clean and pure. She reached over and took a sip and put it in her mouth. It was very sweet.
It's delicious!
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank it. After drinking enough of the three bowls, he stopped. After drinking this water, he felt that the whole person felt much more comfortable and that his tiredness went away.
Wang Wang Wang, the Sanxian on the side circled around the bucket.
“Come on, drink some too.”
Wang Yao also filled a bowl of water for it to drink. The native dog soon drank it out, then screamed and shook its tail. Obviously, it wasn't drinking enough.
“OK, let you drink enough!”
This person drank half a bucket full of water. Had it not been for being in a panic, it is estimated that they would have drunk up this bucket of water.
Wang Yao has never drank such sweet water in her life.
Chapter 1: I want to lose weight!
On a hot summer day, the Chiyun Rainforest in the eastern part of the Federation is full of clouds and fog. Surrounded by a layer of tulle, with towering trees, criss-crossed, and lush canopies, sometimes a few flying birds rise out of the air and soar through the skyline.
In the sky, the sun, which seems to exist forever, is no longer what people remember. Instead, many years ago, it was directly pierced by an indescribable ancient bronze sword, revealing half the tip of the sword!
This ancient sword seems to have gone through the ages. It has come from the starry sky and reveals endless vicissitudes. It also has a strong sense of pressure, forming a halo that envelops the sky, as if it could suppress the earth and make all living beings adore it!
Seen from afar, this Jianyang Rainforest looks like a picture scroll, and it wasn't broken until there was a humming sound coming from afar. A large red balloon boat is slowly flying over the rainforest.
This hot air balloon cabin is large enough to accommodate hundreds of people. You can see many young men and women in groups of three or five on the deck, with laughter from time to time.
They are students from central Phoenix who were admitted to one of the four major schools of the Union this year. They are traveling thousands of miles aboard this airship belonging to the Mysterious Daoyuan Institute to study at the Mysterious Daoyuan Institute.
It's probably an expectation to study. The journey isn't boring for these young men and women. There's also some hazy appeal between men and women, making this journey of thousands of miles a bit of fun.
Also, due to the long distance, the airship is equipped with areas such as restaurants, training rooms, and infirmaries.
At the moment, there are quite a few students in the airship's cafeteria. At one of the dinner tables, there is a little fat guy sitting on his stomach.
This little fat guy is about 178 years old. Wearing a large blue robe, his round face is barely clear. While patting on the stomach and making a crackling sound, he looks at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him with undue regret.
“I had to gain another three pounds after eating this meal. Why couldn't I hold back? If I wanted to become the President of the Federation, I wouldn't be able to die early.”
The little fat man had a sad face and burped full of remorse. The name of this little fat guy is Wang Baole, and he is also a student who has been admitted to the Mysterious Daoist Academy this time. His lifelong dream is to become an official and treat becoming the president of the Federation as his lifelong pursuit. The reason he has such great ideals is inseparable from his childhood experiences.
In his memory, when he was a child, his father often patted him on the head with a lot of emphasis, and he was overwhelmed with emotion.
“Baole, it's good to be an official. Remember, even though money can solve everything, you'll still be bullied. If you don't want to be bullied, just be an official and be superior to others.”
At the beginning, Wang Baole didn't understand. Until he was in elementary school, he was scolded by the class leader for not handing in his homework on time. After he delivered two pieces of sugar, he was also registered by the class leader and made a small report to the teacher. All of this left an indelible imprint on his young mind.
So from that moment on, he wanted to be the squad leader, not to bully people, but to protect himself from being bullied by others.
However, as he grew up, he discovered that there were many others who could bully the squad leader, so he felt that as the biggest official, that is, the federal president, no one really dared to bully himself. The reason I cut my head and got into the Mystical Taoist Academy is also because all senior federal officials graduated from the Big Four Taoist Institutes.
It's just that he didn't have a good life, and his family lineage is very strange. He still remembers that night a year ago, his father, who was thin and thin like firewood, was in the family temple and showed him the genealogy.
That was the first time Wang Baole saw the genealogy. He clearly saw that there were generations of ancestors, yet everyone who weighed more than 200 kg all died young and lived no more than 35 years.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream... Before he had to wait to become the president of the Federation, he was reunited with those fat grandparents.
The year after that, for him, weight loss had already risen to a certain level, but even after the Confederation entered the Reiyuan period, with the intensity of Reiki and the revival of ancient martial arts, there were a variety of ways to lose weight, but Wang Baole tried almost everything, and his weight was still progressing steadily.
The resurfacing of her memory made Wang Baole gnaw her teeth hard and made up her mind to lose weight tomorrow.
After making this decision, Baole Wong immediately felt that the pressure was much less. While picking her teeth, humming small songs, looking up at the blue sky outside the window in the distance, her mind began to flourish.
“I don't know if it's a gift for Dr. Lu. He likes it or not, but it's an antique I brought out of my house. The old guy should love it.”
Wang Baole comforted herself, thinking that as long as Dr. Lu was there for Dr. Lu, she would be a small backer in the future when she was in Taoyuan.
“Teachers have limited power, but they'll have to give some gifts later, but at this age, Dr. Lu must have had a lot of connections. I must have taken the right step.”
Thinking about this, Baole Wong only felt that he was one step closer to the position of federal president.
He is very confident that he can become the President of the Federation. This confidence mainly comes from all the autobiographies of senior officials he has studied since childhood, and he has even summed up a few killer tricks to become an official.
The body and mind are happy at the moment. Wang Baole looked at the blue sky outside the window and felt that it was extremely beautiful.
But soon, his eyes suddenly widened. He noticed that in the sky in the distance, there were black clouds that seemed to cover the sky. There was lightning inside, flashing a ray of light, and they were slowly approaching. This scene also attracted the attention of many students, and exclamations came out.
Wang Baole was also taken by surprise. In fact, after the Confederation entered the Reiki period, the appearance of Reiki caused quite an amazing atmosphere between heaven and earth. It was difficult for flying objects to be safe in the past. Only then was the birth of a hot-air balloon airship driven by a spiritual stone.
As the screams continued, the thunderstorm came suddenly, and there was a loud thunderstorm. Lightning had spread rapidly in the distance. Like a big black net, flashing on the skyline, dazzling and frightening, it made people's heart beat faster. The airship that was originally on the move was also slowly slowing down at the moment.
Just when the crowd was feeling uneasy, the restaurant door was pushed open as if the wind was whistling. He walked into an old man in a white robe. The old man had a wrinkled face, but he had a good-looking face. In particular, his eyes shone brightly, and his good spirit spread all over. As soon as he arrived, his dignified voice spread throughout the restaurant.
“Everyone, immediately report in the healing room. After putting on your magnetic spirit suit and half a pillar of incense, we will enter the lightning zone!”
As soon as the words came out, all the students in the restaurant were in awe and quickly stood up.
As soon as Wang Baole's eyes lit up, the old man in front of him was Dr. Lu, who had given gifts before. Looking at his opponent's aggressive momentum, Wang Baole increasingly felt that his previous investment was right. Secretly, this old guy must be very human, and that he is even better at chess.
When Zheng Mei was proud, the old physician glanced and saw Wang Baole, snorted, walked over, took half a black mask out of her arms, and threw it on Wang Baole.
“At a young age, don't put your mind in a messy place. You've learned how to give gifts before you enter Taoyuan. My husband is also a knowledgeable person. You should keep this mask for yourself.” The old physician looked awe-struck. His clean and impartial appearance reprimanded him as if he hated the iron or not the steel.
Wang Baole took the mask and shuddered from the bottom of her heart. She saw that the old physician was angry. She was a bit anxious and just wanted to explain, but suddenly thought of the killer tricks she had summed up in the autobiographies of senior officials. One of them was in front of her boss, cheeky, admitting mistakes the first time, which often made a big deal smaller.
So I took a deep breath, quickly put on a look of repentance, and admitted my mistake.
“The teacher was right, I was wrong!”
The old physician was a bit surprised. Some of the words he originally wanted to reprimand couldn't go on saying because the other party was so happy to admit their mistakes.
Wang Baole was relieved to see the old physician's expression. She also had some pride. It was really useful to secretly say this autobiography of a senior official.
The old doctor snorted, looked up and swept all the students in the cafeteria, pointing his right hand at the crowd.
“Also, you are all future students of my Esoterian Taoist Institute. Look what you look like these days. You should always remember that my generation of warriors stood up first, then spoke up, then acted!”
The old doctor abhors it. When everyone heard this remark, they couldn't help but bow down. They were a bit ashamed, but Wang Baole's eyes lit up violently, and she felt that the time had come to express herself.
So I quickly took a small book out of my arms and recorded it on it. From time to time, I looked up at the old physician, showed a listening expression, and sometimes nodded seriously, as if I had to remember every word the other person said. This move was also a killer trick he summed up in his autobiographies of senior officials.
The other students saw this scene and looked at Wang Baole like a godman.
The old physician was also instantly dazed when he saw it. A strange feeling that had never been seen before came to his mind. In fact, he welcomed so many students. This was the first time he had met such an amazing person. He couldn't help but look at it a little more, but he gradually began to sneer.
“Little guy, the old man's horse butt isn't that good to shoot. You have to thank him for this thunderstorm. Otherwise, the old man can train for 3 days and 3 nights in one go. I wonder if you can write them all in a small book!”
As soon as the old doctor's words came out, the momentum was different. The air of a strong person emanated from his body, as if turning into coercion, enveloping the entire restaurant. The students were all astonished. They only felt that the old physician was one foot taller.
Wang Baole blinked and touched the recording Yu Jian in his pocket. After a long period of trade-offs, he watched the ever-approaching thunder and magnetic storm and gave up on the idea. He felt that it was not shameful to stand in front of his boss.
Seeing how the crowd looked, the old physician was proud and spoke a few words with generosity and passion.
“Remember, you have to focus on practice, be a human in the future, not be greedy or unrighteous, let alone always want to find a female partner. You have to know that the words of color are really unspeakable. These days, you, the Qing Qing, I, and I are so unspeakable!”
Having said this, all of a sudden, a trickling sound came out of the old physician's voice bracelet.
“Grandpa Physician, where are you? No one wears this magnetic suit; come and help me.”
This sound was lovely. As soon as the old physician heard it, his body couldn't help but shake a bit; he had a barely dry cough; he glared seriously at the crowd. Only then did he quickly turn away, and at the same time make an excited opening for the Legend Belt. “Oh, here it is, baby, I'm not in a hurry, I'm here to help you.”
The reversal of this scene was too fast. The contrast was so great that everyone was dumbfounded. Even Wang Baole stunned a bit before taking a breath. Following the unbearable uproar, Wang Baole gnawed his teeth and scolded a few words.
” This old bastard said all the stuff I said before was nonsense! There are only so many female classmates, and we don't have enough points. At this age, he came to steal resources from us; wouldn't he just be an official based on size?”
The more she thought about it, the more angry she became. In discussions with her classmates around her, she became even more determined about her dream of becoming an official.
As the alarm grew louder, the crowd ended their discussion and went to the healing room one by one with indignation from the bottom of their hearts.
The training room, located in the core area of the airship, is, as the name suggests, a place for these students to practice. It is also the most heavily protected place for the airship as it passes through a special area.
At the moment, in this rehearsal room, as the crowd gathered, under the arrangement of the teacher who accompanied the ship, everyone sat in several rows and wore the special magnetic spirit suits for airships distributed by the Mysterious Daoyuan.
Having just put on her magnetic suit, Wang Baole was immersed in anger at Dr. Lu. She looked up at her surroundings at will. She was already depressed. The moment was even worse because of a gaze from afar. Her eyebrows frowned unconsciously, showing a look of disgust.
As far as his eyes were, he was sitting on a girl with slender legs. It was very moving, but right now he also raised her eyebrows, showing disgust. Obviously, in their eyes, they were both familiar and extremely disgusting.
“Obscure!”
They both muttered from the bottom of their hearts and quickly avoided their eyes, as if they were even looking at each other, and they felt irritated.
“You can find this tablet Dumin anywhere. It's so annoying!” “What's amazing, isn't it just a squad leader? When it comes to Daoyuan, with my official killer, Laozi can even mix up with one official and a half!”
Soon, after everyone had finished wearing them, the teachers accompanying the ship at the Mysterious Temple explained some precautions, and even harshly warned the crowd that after the airship entered the lightning zone, there was a danger, and there was definitely a risk of life and death.
Seeing everyone's looks change before the teachers on the boat leave in awe. The door to the healing room is also sealed directly, and the lights gradually dim.
At the moment, the healing room is still talking in a low voice, but as time passed, the tension became more intense, and gradually no one spoke, and it fell into complete silence.
In the silence that seemed to be able to hear her own heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still in the middle of no anger, couldn't help but get nervous until after half a pillar of incense, the entire airship had a violent earthquake and entered the thunderous zone!
Seen from the outside, the entire thunder-magnetic dark cloud looks like a large mouth. Compared to that, it is a very small hot air balloon airship, which is directly swallowed up.
This kind of weather seems to contain the power of destruction and can sweep everything. Perhaps it is only in the sky that the shocking round of sword and sun can ignore everything, as if looking down on the world for 37 years isn't enough; it will be even longer.
This year is the 37th year of Lingyuan.
In 2022 AD, the Earth's science and technology developed rapidly. There were no borders, the Earth was unified, and we entered the era of federation. It was also at this time that a big sword flew from the starry sky and penetrated the sun, and the world was sensational.
The handle of this big sword is probably because it was already broken. A large amount of debris burst and scattered all over the starry sky during this violent vibration. Some of it fell all over the Earth.
With the arrival of the Bronze Sword and the falling of the debris, the Earth suddenly added a new energy source that seemed to fill the sky and the earth. It was later named... Reiki!
Reiki is like air. In some places it is rich, and in others it is thin. It was also obtained by the Federation and various forces because of the scattered debris. On it, they found various uses relating to refinement, refining instruments, alchemy, and spiritual refining stones. The text above is full of ancient meaning, causing people to come into contact with ancient texts and become a trend.
However, the emergence of Reiki also rapidly eliminated the original energy source and changed people's lives. It not only formed a spiritual network, but also changed the progress of global civilization, enabling the entire Earth to start practicing civilization.
Since then, since the rise of ancient martial arts, the world has changed, and the era of immortals for all people has begun.
According to the historical name, the Reiyuan period.
At the moment, in the dark clouds of thunder and magnetism, the slow-moving red hot air balloon airship is constantly bombarded with lightning. Fortunately, there is a soft light screen diffusion protection, making the airship extremely stable.
As for the rehab room in the core area of the cabin, all the students, including Baole Wang, are now unknowingly asleep. They seem to have a strange power to guide them into their dreams.
There are only seven or eight teachers in the captain's main cabinet at the moment. Some are drinking tea, and some are laughing. They are having relaxed conversations with each other. It's very different from how they scared the students before.
The first person was an old man, with a face full of wrinkles, holding a gun, and smoking in his mouth. If Wang Baole were here, he must have recognized it at a glance. This old man was Dr. Lu, the same old man who was once shameless.
As one of the middle-aged teachers spoke, the old physician, who was smoking, smiled slightly.
