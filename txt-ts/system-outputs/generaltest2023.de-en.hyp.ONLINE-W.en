Diego Cocca becomes new national coach of Mexico
In the summer of 2026, Mexico will host the World Cup together with the USA and Canada with 48 teams for the first time. Cocca succeeds Gerardo Martino, whose contract was not renewed after the early World Cup exit in Qatar. Until a few days ago, the 50-year-old was not among the favorites for the post. He had only taken over as coach of Mexican club Tigres in November. His surprise appointment as national coach sparked anger at the club.
Geesthacht: New bed signs to encourage replanting
Franko Stein (FD Environment, left) and Friedhelm Ringe (Nabu) put up the plant signs in the beds in the pedestrian zone.
The "Geesthacht blossoms" campaign also includes information about what is currently blooming there - currently in the colors white and pink.
Geesthacht. "Geesthacht blossoms up" is the name of a campaign by Nabu in cooperation with the city administration. With the help of many volunteers from associations, schools, daycare centers, companies and institutions, thousands of flower bulbs and plants have been put into the ground since 2015. The aim: to create flowering islands over a wide area in the Geesthacht municipal area, where insects can find food at any time. "When the weather is favorable, the bees fly out as early as January to look for food," says Friedhelm Ringe of Geesthachter Nabu. He has beehives on the property himself.
In order to ensure that the project is not just an initiative of conservationists and the city's environmental department, but also has a wide impact on private gardens, explanatory signs are repeatedly placed next to the plants. There are about 50 signs so far. Passers-by should be able to inform themselves in this way about what is blooming so beautifully here. The hope is that hobby gardeners will specifically replant at home.
In the first week of January was already the start of the season at the wild hazel
More recent are shrubs such as winter-scented hedge cherry and winter snowball in the beds of the pedestrian zone. They have been stuck in the soil of the tubs on Bergedorer Straße for a year now, are leafless and are just showing their first delicate blossoms in white and pink, and have recently been given more signs. "The winter-scented hedge cherry is a very broad bushy shrub and can grow between two meters high and three meters wide," it says among other information, for example, about the suitable location.
Friedhelm Ringe emphasizes that it is not only the bedding plants that are now showing flowers, however. The first week of January saw the start of the wild hazel season. It blooms particularly luxuriantly at the Richtweg at the incline, in the Gutenbergstraße, Wilhelm-Holert-Straße, Fahrendofer Weg and many Knicks.
Ernestine is 102 years old: "Stepping keeps me young".
Munich - Dancing god Fred Astaire would surely be proud of them when he looks down from the sky to Munich's Ostbahnhof!
Every Monday, three ladies meet there at the "Mandolin Motion Show Academy" at 3 p.m. sharp for a lively tap dance - together they are an incredible 277 years old, pardon young!
The oldest of them is Ernestine Stauchner, who recently celebrated her 102nd birthday.
For the native of Munich (January 15, 1921) from the "Schwanthaler Höh", Monday is THE highlight of the week. "Dancing and tap is my life, I can't imagine life without it".
Eva-Maria Stolze (almost 97) and Elfriede Widmann (79) also swing their dancing legs with Ernestine.
The 97-year-old was born in 1926 in Jena (Thuringia). She was a soubrette, today we would say musical actress, worked with the legendary Marika Rökk. "With dancing, acting and singing I spent my life".
At 79 years of age, Elfriede Widmann is something like the chick in the circle of tap dancers. She says: "We just have fun here with our dance teacher Sissy Engl".
Wikipedia: Tap dancing was developed in the 19th century in the USA and is now known all over the world. With two metal plates each, which are more durable than the wooden soles used at first, attached to the front and back of the shoes, rhythmic sounds are produced while dancing, which match the visual impression and the music. The dancer thus also becomes a percussion musician. The English term for this is onomatopoeic tap dance and the French claquettes. Spanish flamenco may have influenced tap dance. Here the tips of the shoes are nailed so that they produce a well audible sound when dancing.
77-year-old Sissi Engl is the good soul of the dance studio at Ostbahnhof. She is an actress, dancer and choreographer. "We are one big family, big and small, old and young are welcome here".
And what is the recipe for such a long life? "Exercise keeps me young," the 102-year-old tells BILD. Her advice to everyone: "Sport, healthy food and no alcohol.
Analog in Dialog - The Limits of the Digital
With advancing digitalization, some people are once again turning to analog technology
The rapidity with which our everyday lives have become digital has left us little time to establish rules for dealing with it and to adapt our ways of communicating and working to it, says DNN columnist Claudia Muntschick.
Dresden. If you wanted to make a telephone call in Bautzen in 1985, there were three options. Either you were one of the lucky six percent who had a private line. Or you were one of those who had someone from this exclusive group in the neighborhood and could make a phone call to your relatives for a bottle of Radeberger. Or you went to a telephone booth. The smell of the plastic receiver and the clicking of the coins in the machine were unforgettable. My greatest dream was to be able to see the other person's face when calling - video telephony, I thought, what a great thing that would be!
What next in Moldova? 14 days for a new government
In Moldova (also: Moldova), President Maia Sandu has appointed former Interior Minister Dorin Recean to form a government.
The 48-year-old economist now has 14 days to do so. Until now, Recean has been one of the president's advisors.
After only one and a half years in office, Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita unexpectedly resigned. The pro-European head of government was under massive pressure, as she herself announced as an explanation for her resignation - apparently she was opposed by pro-Russian forces.
The president thanked Gavrilita for their "enormous sacrifice."
Moldova is Ukraine's neighbor and is suffering the economic consequences of the war. Inflation is over 40 percent and the small republic has taken in tens of thousands of refugees from Ukraine.
In the parliament in Chisinau, the pro-European party PAS (Party of Action and Solidarity) founded by President Sandu has a comfortable majority, occupying 63 of 101 seats. The confirmation of the new head of government and his cabinet should therefore not pose a problem.
However, pro-European politicians have lost popularity in Moldova in recent months, while pro-Russian ones - with support from the Kremlin - have become more popular.
These were the costumes of the celebrities
In 2023, Veitshöchheim will once again be celebrating in style. The 5th season is in full swing and the celebrities did not let themselves be asked for long.
Bavaria's father Markus Söder did not go as Moses, as his costume would suggest. He sees himself more as a tribal elder of the Bavarians. At his side, wife Karin Baumüller-Söder.
Bavaria's Minister for the Environment and Consumer Protection, Thorsten Glauber, chose the children's hero Chase from Paw Patrol for his costume.
Justice Minister Georg Eisenreich and his wife Anja came to Franconia from the depths of the sea.
Completely off the beaten track: Minister for Science and the Arts Markus Blume is drawn to space.
State parliament president Ilse Aigner chose none other than "Mama Bavaria" as the model for her costume.
In peace-and-love mode: Bavaria's Health Minister Klaus Holetschek and his wife Birgit.
Bob the Builder aka Minister of Construction Christian Bernreiter with his wife Ann-Kathrin Jandt-Bernreiter as Wendy.
Bavaria's golden boy: Finance Minister Albert Füracker with his wife Evelyne. She was wearing silver.
He even plays the sheriff at carnival: Bavaria's Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann. At his side, wife Gerswid.
On the road: Economics Minister Hubert Aiwanger pays homage to craftsmanship with his costume. His partner Tanja Schweiger, District Administrator of Regensburg, does the same.
Of course, the political opposition could not be missing either.
All for Bavaria: Green Party leader Katharina Schulze as Bavaria and her co-leader Ludwig Hartmann as the Bavarian lion.
Hiking is the SPD parliamentary party leader's pleasure: Florian von Brunn with SPD state chairwoman Ronja Endres.
Martin Hagen, head of the FDP parliamentary group, was a royal. He and his wife Anisha came as Harry and Meghan.
Otherwise, he certainly speaks more. In Veitshöchheim, Manfred Weber, the leader of the parliamentary group in the EU Parliament, was on the road as a pantomime. At his side wife Andrea.
If it doesn't work out with politics, at least he can do magic. Nuremberg's mayor Marcus König as Harry Potter and wife Anke as Hermione.
A bee on the move: Bavaria's Digital Minister Judith Gerlach.
Back to the 1920s: BR's legal director Eva Majuntke, BR director Katja Wildermuth and BR cultural program director Björn Wilhelm.
A small side blow against the climate activists from the Franconian Tatort commissioner Sebastian Fleischer played by Alexander Leopold Schadt.
Of course, the first mayor of Veitshöchheim was not to be missed. Jürgen Götz and his wife Julia.
Oberhof: Kühn eighth in world championship sprint
Bö continued his impressive series despite difficult conditions and won also the sixth sprint race of the season. The five-time Olympic champion has now collected 14 World Cup titles and continues to close the gap to his compatriot Ole Einar Björndalen. The biathlon icon, who is on site as a TV expert, is still the undisputed record champion with 20 World Championship gold medals. Even partly heavy fog did not prevent permanent winner Bö to collect already his second gold at the Rennsteig. On Wednesday, Norway's mixed relay team had already successfully defended its title.
Hardly anyone doubts that in the pursuit race number three will follow. In the pursuit Bö is once again the clear favorite. His running form is outstanding so that he can compensate shooting mistakes to a certain extent frighteningly easy.
For Doll, meanwhile, nothing went right again. After the veteran missed all chances for a medal in the mixed relay and finished only sixth, it didn't go any better three days later. Three penalties already in prone shooting and two more in standing were a big disappointment for the oldest in the German team, who had celebrated the biggest success of his career in this discipline in 2017.
In Hochfilzen six years ago he surprisingly won by a razor-thin margin of 0.7 seconds ahead of Bö. It was one of only three career victories for Doll, who has been on the podium once so far this winter. The Beijing Olympic eighth-placed skier pulled away wordlessly after his weak performance and did not give any interviews at first. Roman Rees made it to 19th place, the second World Cup debutant David Zobel finished 35th.
Biden receives Lula: "Must stand up for democracy"
At a meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and his counterpart from Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the main topic is the value of democracy. Both look back on their predecessors.
U.S. President Joe Biden has insisted on the preservation of democratic values during a visit to his Brazilian counterpart Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.
"The strong democracy of our two nations has been put to the test," Biden said Friday at the White House in Washington. "We must continue to stand up for democracy, for the democratic values that are at the core of our strength." Lula countered, referring to his right-wing predecessor in office, Jair Bolsonaro, "Brazil has isolated itself for four years."
Lula, a left-wing politician, won a runoff election against Bolsonaro at the end of October. Lula took office on January 1. The transfer of power was accompanied by heavy rioting. Bolsonaro's supporters had stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the seat of government in the capital Brasília in January. The outbreak of violence in Brazil is a grim reminder of the storming of the U.S. Capitol just over two years ago, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently invaded the parliament in Washington.
Lula openly criticized Bolsonaro at the meeting with Biden. He said his predecessor didn't pay much attention to international relations. "His world began and ended with Fake News, morning, afternoon and evening," Lula said. "Sounds familiar," Biden countered - an obvious reference to his predecessor in office, Trump.
Short note about the press - the Friday
Does anyone still remember the RAF wanted posters? You could see the members of the Red Army Faction on them, cleared for denunciation and firing.
In a country with a culture of denunciation, which existed even before Corona, the public mood was created in this way against the most dangerous opponents of the FRG; let's say bourgeois democracy, let's say late capitalist society. (Here nothing to the really dangerous in pinstripe suit and tie).
Now the Stuttgarter Zeitung, which is usually rather after Raudis in the suburban trains or onanists in the park, gives a new edition with the "war criminal" Putin's friends. Because they are so beautiful, there is a picture gallery. Of course, the StZ is badly informed, because there are perhaps more "Russian friends" in this world to which Asia, Africa and Latin America belong than the StZ has space for pictures.
But that is not the point, but: On place 1 to 5 (!) is Ms. Wagenknecht, then follows Ms. Schwarzer.
Well, I don't know anyone around me who reads this paper anymore. If they did, it would be high time now. We have reached the familiar level where there is nothing below.
And at the latest now, well dialectically, Mrs. Wagenknecht should be the most popular politician of all not yet completely dumbed-down, i.e. peace-loving, pacifist and anti-militarist people. (And here now no more differentiation is necessary).
Harald Glööckler files for divorce from his husband Dieter Schroth
Designer Harald Glööckler (57) and his husband Dieter Schroth (74) have separated. Glööckler's lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser confirmed this in the same wording to the "Bild" newspaper and RTL. It says: "I can confirm that my client has filed an application for the dissolution of his civil partnership with the competent court via his family lawyer. I do not comment on details".
Glööckler and his life partner Schroth were together for 35 years, separation rumors had been around for about a year. After his participation in the jungle camp, the fashion designer is said to have already moved from the house they shared in the Palatinate to Berlin, according to various media reports. He also spoke about marital problems in the RTL show.
SS massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane: last survivor dead
A memorial center was set up in 1999 in the destroyed village northwest of Limoges, whose ruins remain. France's President Emmanuel Macron had awarded Hébras the National Order of Merit a year ago. Hébras had fought for freedom and defended France's values, Macron said. He had also contributed to Franco-German peace. Among other things, the survivor had promoted Franco-German youth encounters.
One curve location for 14 houses: In Homeien everyone knows everyone
LZ series North Lippe hamlets: In Homeien, it is not uncommon for three or four generations to live under one roof. Here, the residents find pure idyll. In the summer, 300 motorcycles a day roar along the winding road between Niedermeien and Hillentrup - and some back again.
Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing believes further interest rate hikes are "absolutely" necessary in the fight against high inflation. "Inflationary risks remain high. The cost of energy can easily rise again, and the opening of China can also give prices a temporary boost," Sewing told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
At the beginning of February, the European Central Bank (ECB) raised interest rates in the euro zone for the fifth time in succession and held out the prospect of a further increase of 0.5 percentage points at its meeting on March 16. The key interest rate in the euro area now stands at 3.0 percent. The deposit rate, which commercial banks receive when they park money with the ECB, is 2.5 percent.
Higher interest rates make loans more expensive. This can curb demand and thus counteract high inflation rates. At the same time, higher interest rates on loans can lead to investments being postponed and thus to weaker economic growth.
Rising interest rates are also a burden for highly indebted euro countries such as Italy. "The consequences of sustained high inflation are much more serious than higher financing costs for some countries," Sewing said. "Of course, we have to keep that in mind, but high debt levels should not prevent the ECB from acting consistently."
The ECB is aiming for price stability in the euro area in the medium term at an inflation rate of two percent. This target has been a long way off for months. Although inflation weakened again in January, consumer prices in the currency area, which now comprises 20 countries, were 8.5 percent higher than in the same month of the previous year.
Higher inflation rates reduce consumers' purchasing power, because they can then afford less for one euro. Sharp increases in energy prices, which are a major driver of inflation, are also a burden for companies.
If inflation remains high, private consumption will "sooner or later collapse," warned Sewing, who is also president of the Association of German Banks (BdB). "This is where I currently see the greatest danger for the German economy. But I am optimistic that we can avoid this scenario."
Bosch CEO Stefan Hartung hopes for a broad debate on the "German pace" for infrastructure projects proclaimed by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD). "There will have to be a political and social dialog on this. And it will perhaps also be a bit more controversial," he told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Stuttgart. He said he hoped that, in the end, a set of rules would emerge that, while not necessarily as fast as the LNG terminals that went into operation around the turn of the year, would not be as slow as before.
In mid-December, after ten months of planning and construction, the first German terminal for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) was opened. The aim was to close the gap in gas supplies caused by a lack of Russian gas deliveries. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) had spoken of a new "German pace" on the occasion. In addition, the German government had recently launched an acceleration of approval procedures for wind turbines and power lines.
"First of all, it is very reassuring that the government acts so quickly when it matters. But that shouldn't automatically mean that from now on we always act so categorically and, for example, put a wind turbine in the neighbor's garden against his will," Hartung said. There must therefore still be a negotiation process as to what is right and wrong as a society, he added.
In the past, he said, they had tried and failed with the classic set of rules. "We should think again about whether the previous approach was right. Perhaps we overdid it with the rules and made it too complicated for ourselves.
In view of the many unfinished tasks, such as the expansion of power lines, he does not envy the German government and the companies involved, however, Hartung said. "As a consumer of these energies, I absolutely need the expansion and it should be as green as possible."
Union warns of breakup of Bayer Group
The chemical union IG BCE warns of a breakup of the group after an announced change of chief executive at Bayer. "From the employees' point of view, Bayer, with its three pillars, is positioned exactly right for the challenges of the future," Francesco Grioli, a member of the union's executive board and a member of Bayer's supervisory board, told the "Rheinische Post" (Saturday edition).
This refers to the pharmaceuticals business with prescription medicines, the consumer health business with over-the-counter medicines and the agricultural business. "You can only manage the transformation of the industry with a corporate policy based on risk diversification and sustainability - and not on hedge fund activism."
The background to this is the change of chief executive at the pharmaceutical and agrochemical group announced on Thursday. The controversial boss Werner Baumann will leave his post this summer. The ex-pharmaceutical boss of Swiss rival Roche, Bill Anderson, is to take over at the beginning of June.
Baumann has long been criticized. The acquisition of the U.S. seed producer Monsanto for $63 billion, completed in 2018, hangs over the manager. With the purchase, the Leverkusen company had brought expensive legal disputes about alleged cancer risks of the weed killer glyphosate into the house. Bayer's stock had been on a downward slide for years. In 2019, the shareholders even refused to approve the actions of the CEO at the annual general meeting.
It had been known for some time that Baumann was not seeking to extend his contract, which was supposed to run until 2024. Pressure had been exerted by long-term strategic investors. Recently, several activist Anglo-Saxon investors such as Bluebell Capital also got involved. According to a media report, Bluebell is pushing for a split-up of the Group.
The very small fund with an unknown stake in Bayer is known for an aggressive approach. A spin-off "of the Consumer Health division would be a possible way to increase the company's value," Markus Manns, fund manager at Union Investment, told the "Rheinische Post" newspaper. By contrast, he does not consider a spin-off of the much larger Crop Science agricultural division to be feasible.
Hundreds of thousands plan to demonstrate against pension reform
Paris
On Saturday, the French want to take to the streets again against the planned pension reform.
The unions are opposing the government's plan with a concentrated protest in the streets. Hundreds of thousands plan to demonstrate again on Saturday against the pension reform.
In France, hundreds of thousands of people are again expected to demonstrate across the country on Saturday against President Emmanuel Macron's planned pension reform. For the fourth time, the unions are mobilizing against the center government's plans to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Twice already, more than a million people took to the streets and there were nationwide strikes. Last Tuesday, 750,000 people took part in protests. The controversial reform has been the subject of a turbulent debate in parliament for the past week.
Many people in France are already working longer than the age of 62 if they have not paid into the pension scheme long enough to receive a full pension by the time they reach that age. In many strenuous jobs, people could hardly work longer, opponents of the reform say. In addition, employees want to be able to enjoy their well-earned pensions and not wear out their health completely on the job.
Macron: Threat of deficit in pension fund
Macron justifies the reform with an impending deficit in the pension fund. Because the population is getting older and older, employees will have to pay for an increasing number of pensioners with their contributions. In order to keep the pension level stable, the population would have to work a little more. Critics doubt the government's calculations and demand that the state find other sources of money to keep the pension system in balance.
But it is not just the retirement age that the government wants to tighten. The increase in the period needed to pay into a full pension, which was decided years ago, is to be accelerated. In addition, individual pension systems with privileges for certain occupational groups are to be abolished. The minimum pension is to rise to around 1,200 euros.
Pension reform is considered one of President Macron's most important projects. During the Corona pandemic, a first attempt to implement the reform was aborted, and even then there were massive protests and strikes. Several presidents before Macron had already tried to reform the French pension system with varying degrees of success - widespread protests and strikes were a certainty for all of them.
Since Macron's camp no longer has an absolute majority in parliament, it hopes to push the reform through with the help of the conservative Républicains, who have announced support. But some of the deputies - even from Macron's faction - still have reservations. And even greater than the fear of a close vote at the moment may be Macron's concern about crippling strikes. Ahead of Saturday's renewed demonstrations, the president said he could count on the organizers' sense of responsibility to keep them calm and not lead to a blockade of the country.
Calm weather expected - lots of sunshine at high altitudes
A powerful high-pressure area lies over Central Europe and determines the weather in Germany. Does this mean that lots of sunshine can be expected everywhere?
Offenbach
In Germany, calm high-pressure weather is expected at least until midweek. "When looking at the weather maps, a powerful high-pressure area directly over Central Europe immediately catches the eye," explained meteorologist Markus Übel of the German Weather Service in Offenbach on Saturday. "Admittedly, this high pressure shifts a little to the east in the course of the next week. However, it continues to determine the weather in Germany."
However, calm high-pressure weather in winter does not necessarily mean sunny weather, Übel says. "Such a high pressure can even be quite mean and give people in the lowlands dreary high fog gray for days, while there is pure sun in the high altitudes of the low mountains."
Thus, Sunday will start foggy and cloudy in most regions. From the Ore Mountains and the Thuringian Forest to Lower Bavaria, it may also rain a little, according to the DWD. Especially at the edge of the Alps, but also in the southwest and partly in the west, the cloud cover will clear up during the day and the sun will appear more and more often. In the rest of the country, it will remain cloudy or overcast with high fog. Temperatures will reach 4 to 9 degrees, near the Rhine around 10 degrees.
"On Monday, the sun, which is gradually getting stronger, will nibble at the high fog again and will be able to clear it more and more during the course of the day," says the meteorologist. On the edge of the Alps, in the high altitudes of the low mountain ranges and in parts of North Rhine-Westphalia, sunshine is expected throughout the day, while elsewhere it will first have to fight its way through the high fog cover. The highs will be 5 to 9 degrees, around 11 degrees in the Lower Rhine area, but only around 3 degrees in the permanent gray in the southeast. In addition, a weak wind will blow from different directions.
On Tuesday, there may again be only tenacious dissipation of fog or high fog in some lowlands. Otherwise, the weather will be clear after the fog has dissipated. In high areas, in large parts of North Rhine-Westphalia and at the edge of the Alps, the sun will shine all day according to the forecast. Temperatures will rise to 5 to 11 degrees, depending on the sunshine.
Dominator struggles: Again no World Cup medal for Goggia
Defeated top favorite Sofia Goggia has expressed serious disappointment after her exit in the downhill of the Alpine World Ski Championships.
Méribel
"I'm sad because I didn't give the performance I'm capable of," the Italian said on ZDF after she threaded a gate and was eliminated. At least the 30-year-old was just able to avoid a possibly serious fall.
Goggia has been the dominant downhill racer in the World Cup for years. She has won four of the six races in this discipline so far this season. After winning gold in Pyeongchang in 2018, she took silver at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. However, Goggia, who is known for her risky skiing, will have to wait further for a World Cup medal in her parade discipline. She missed her home event in Cortina d'Ampezzo two years ago due to injury.
"I actually thought I was in a good mood. It was about hundredths of a second," Goggia said after the surprising victory of Switzerland's Jasmine Flury in Méribel, France, now. "I am disappointed. I gave everything I had. But that's life." Sometimes you think things are guaranteed, she said of the medal expected by all experts and ultimately missed: "But they are not."
Girl missing in Berlin: Who has seen Viktoriya?
Viktoriya Stankovych has been missing since February 10.
Viktoriya Stankovych was last seen on Friday at Waidmannslust S-Bahn station. The police are asking for information about her whereabouts.
Berlin. With the publication of a photo, the Berlin police are asking the public for help in the search for a missing child. The 12-year-old Viktoriya Stankovych is said to have left the grounds of her school together with other children in the direction of the Waidmannslust S-Bahn station at around 12:30 p.m. on February 10, 2023. She was last seen there at the S-Bahn station. The child has been a refugee in Berlin since April 2022 and has very little knowledge of the German language and the local area.

Selenskyj and ministers against Russia's Olympic participation
Kiev. Sports politicians from 35 nations have increased pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) by calling for Russian and Belarusian athletes to be excluded from the 2024 Olympics in Paris.
It was agreed at a joint conference call to draft a statement to prevent attempts to send athletes from Russia and Belarus back to international sports competitions, the Lithuanian Sports Ministry said on its website.
"We demand the exclusion of Russian and Belarusian athletes from all international competitions, including the Olympic Games, as long as the war in Ukraine continues," said Minister Jurgita Šiugždinienė.
The video consultation had taken place at the initiative of Great Britain. It was a very productive meeting, British Sports Minister Lucy Frazer wrote on Twitter. "And I made the UK's position very clear: As long as Putin continues his barbaric war, Russia and Belarus must not be represented at the Olympics. We will now issue a joint statement on this issue."
Earlier, at an international video conference of sports ministers and other senior officials, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selenskyj protested against the participation of athletes from Russia and Belarus in international competitions. "While Russia kills and terrorizes, representatives of this terrorist state have no place in sports and Olympic competitions," Selenskyj said. He published his speech on his Telegram channel. Because of Russia's war of aggression, he said, ultimately even a neutral flag is soaked in blood and cannot be worn.
Ukraine threatens boycott
Ukraine also sees Belarus as a warring party because the country provides Russian troops with military bases for attacks. Selensky called on officials to work to protect Olympic principles and prevent the admission of Russian athletes to competitions. The president also renewed his criticism of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), saying it has "unfortunately lost its honesty."
The conference was prompted by the IOC's announcement that it would allow athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international competitions under certain conditions. Ukraine is also threatening a boycott should the IOC allow the athletes.
Federal Ministry of the Interior also takes a stand
The Federal Ministry of the Interior, which is responsible for sports, said afterwards that it had also reiterated during the consultations that it would refuse to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in Paris. "In our view, there is no reason to invite Russian and Belarusian sports to return to competition. The Ukrainian athletes must continue to have the full solidarity and support of the international sports community. The IOC's effort to readmit Russian and Belarusian athletes is the wrong way to go," a spokesman for the Interior Ministry told dpa in response to a query.
Interior Minister Nancy Faeser (SPD) had already stressed at the end of January: "Sport should be clear in its condemnation of the brutal war that Putin is waging against the Ukrainian civilian population. Major sporting events do not take place in a vacuum." Russia, on the other hand, stresses that sport and politics must be kept separate.
Currently, Russia and Belarus are excluded from many international sports competitions. However, the IOC is seeking a return of athletes from both countries to the international sports stage under a neutral flag, provided they clearly commit to the Olympic Charter and do not actively support the war in Ukraine. IOC President Thomas Bach had recently stated that exclusion "because of a passport or place of birth" would violate the ban on discrimination.

"Hey, hot ass!", whistling after the fool in the skimpy sexy costume and shouting lewd sayings: All this falls under the term "catcalling". Behind the term is nothing less than a form of verbal sexual harassment in public spaces.
Half of the vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow's tank inventory severely depleted
Half of vehicles lost? USA sees Moscow's tank stock severely depleted
The Pentagon believes that Russia has lost a significant number of tanks in Ukraine since the war began. There is talk of "half of the main stock".
The Russian Army has already lost half of its main battle tanks in its war of aggression against Ukraine, according to U.S. Defense Department estimates. "Probably half of the Russian army's main inventory of tanks" has been "destroyed or seized by Ukraine," said Celeste Wallander, undersecretary for international security affairs at the U.S. Department of Defense.
Wallander did not provide further details on the number of tanks the U.S. estimates have been seized and destroyed at an online event hosted by the think tank Center for a New American Security.
Ukraine is to receive battle tanks from several Western allies in the coming weeks. The UK has promised Kiev the delivery of Challenger-2 battle tanks in March. Germany, in a coalition with other countries, plans to deliver a battalion of Leopard-2 tanks to Ukraine by April. The U.S. has also pledged a battalion of 31 Abrams main battle tanks. However, their delivery will in all likelihood take much longer.
Russia wants to follow up
In response to Western military aid, ex-Kremlin chief Dmitry Medvedev held out the prospect of building and modernizing thousands of tanks. "As we know, our enemy has been begging abroad for aircraft, missiles, tanks," Medvedev, who is now vice head of the Russian Security Council, said during a visit to a tank factory in the Siberian city of Omsk. "It is clear that in this case it is natural for us to increase production of various types of weapons and military equipment - including modern tanks."
Since last summer, a law has been in force in Russia that allows the economy to be geared more closely to the needs of the armed forces. This means, for example, that individual industries can be obliged to supply the armed forces.
Turmoil over appointment to Army post
The post, which will be held by the former director of the Museum of Military History (HGM), Christian Ortner, was not advertised. Herwig Jedlaucnik, the academy's staff representative, suspects post corruption and abuse of office. Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner (ÖVP) defends the procedure.
An advertisement was not necessary because the appointment was to a previously vacant position, she said. She did not want to comment on "speculations by a liberal staff representative." Ortner was replaced last year after 17 years at the helm of the HGM. In addition to criticism of the museum's handling of Austria's military past, he faced serious allegations of bullying. From Tanner's point of view, these have been cleared up.
Jedlaucnik also doubts Ortner's suitability in terms of content. Ortner is an expert on the First World War and the wars of the monarchy, but the institute deals with current issues of security policy.
The SPÖ demands clarification from Tanner about the "unusual ordering process". The decision has the "appearance of a job scam," says SPÖ military spokesman Robert Laimer. The Neos demand Tanner to take back the appointment. The ÖVP is "still up to its neck in the corruption swamp," said Douglas Hoyos, spokesman for national defense. He announced a parliamentary question on the subject.
Carnival: First fools go down before costs
Unlike the state capital, Thuringia's carnival stronghold Wasungen wants to hold on to the traditional carnival parade. However, the higher costs for security, among other things, are also difficult to manage in Wasungen, says carnival president Marcel Kißling. The funds for this alone accounted for about half of the calculated total costs for the parade.
No carnival parades are cancelled in Brandenburg. The "Zug der fröhlichen Leute" (procession of merry people) in Cottbus, probably once again eastern Germany's largest, will take place for the first time since the pandemic. No parades have been canceled at the Swabian-Alemannic carnival either.
Schleswig-Holstein's carnival stronghold Marne is sticking to its traditional parade despite the increased costs. "We're going through with our event," says the president of the carnival society, Heiko Claußen. But here, too, financial worries are pressing: if no more sponsors were found or the previous ones contributed even more, reserves would have to be touched - "that's not possible every year." The current deficit is about 200,000 euros.
And inflation: some confectionery prices have risen by up to 60 percent, says Elvira Reuther from the Förderverein Nürnberger Fastnachtszug. By a stroke of luck, too much was ordered in 2020, which is why there is still enough stock this time. For the procession, however, it is already clear that it will be more expensive. Twice as many personnel will be needed for security as in 2020.
Anyone standing on the side of the road at the Rosenmontag parade in the Rhineland could get fewer Kamelle than in the past. Because sweets have become more expensive, some parade participants don't have as much with them. Candy or not, the number of visitors is likely to be high: "I think that if it doesn't rain cats and dogs on that day, we can definitely expect an increased number of people," says Holger Kirsch, the head of the Cologne procession. "That's due to the fact that there hasn't been a regular Shrove Monday procession for two years. Of course, there is no substitute for the procession."
The festival committee in Cologne does not comment in detail on costs. However, the train is generally "loss-making", that is no secret.
The Ukraine diary: dreams and home-made vodka
Ukrainians are not considered hard drinkers for nothing. There is local beer like Obolon from Kiev or beer from Lviv. Every now and then I discover German beer here. Not Kulmbacher, but other large breweries like Krombacher or Warsteiner. I can't detect a big difference in taste. The same goes for vodka, which is widely available. They distill it themselves here, especially in the villages. They call it Samargon. No one knows exactly how much of it is consumed in the former Soviet republics. In Russia, the health minister claimed a few years ago that consumption had fallen by a staggering 80 percent in five years. Well, you can see here how little you can believe the Russians. They say that tourists should be careful with it. But that only applies when it goes on sale en masse. Then there is probably also adulterated.
FC Hansa Rostock rewards high effort: "Match luck on our side".
Food and drink
If you want to celebrate the weekend with cocktails or have a beer at the end of the day, you will find great places to do so in Rostock and Warnemünde. The restaurant scene offers many locations for after-work get-togethers or pre-glow for club parties. Where is the best? A look at the Google reviews shows it.
Biathlon World Championships: Federal President sees favorite win and praises Oberhof
Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and his wife Elke Büdenbender are welcomed at the arena by chimney sweep master Tobias Böttger and the Oberhof mascot "Flocke
Oberhof. The German biathletes had nothing to do with the medal award at the World Cup sprint in Oberhof. But there were two bright spots in the fog.
No matter how hard the Federal President tried, it was impossible to tell from the VIP stand on Saturday whether the targets on the shooting range were actually falling. "I had to get the results on my cell phone," Frank-Walter Steinmeier admitted with a smile, referring to the fog that kept drifting into the stadium and greatly impaired the view of the spectators at the Rennsteig.
Steinmeier nevertheless enjoyed attending the 10-km sprint race at the World Biathlon Championships in Oberhof, getting plenty of tips from Olympic champions Frank Ullrich and Peter Sendel: "Ever since the Olympics in South Korea, when Laura Dahlmeier won gold in the first race, biathlon has fascinated me," he revealed, and also praised Oberhof for its modernized sports facilities: "The rebuilt arena is great and offers ideal conditions. The athletes also say that - with thanks to those who have lent a hand here since the World Championships were awarded." In terms of sustainability, too, the site is now "one step ahead of many others" and thus "safe for the years and even decades to come".
In terms of sport, Norway's Johannes Thingnes Bö once again outdistanced the competition. Despite a penalty loop after a shooting mistake he secured his sixth victory in the sixth sprint of the winter in 23:21.7 minutes - and thus his second World Cup title in Oberhof. Behind him his brother Tarjei (14.8 seconds behind) and Sturla Holm Lägreid (1 miss/39.9 seconds) as well as Johannes Dale (1/43.6) made the Norwegian quadruple victory perfect.
The local ski hunters could not intervene in the fight for the medals one day after Denise Herrmann-Wick's triumph. Johannes Kühn finished eighth after a shooting mistake and with a gap of 1:04.8 minutes as the best German. World Cup debutant Justus Strelow shot flawlessly and finished twelfth (1:14.6). Two bright spots behind the gray veil. In contrast, Benedikt Doll disappointed again. After his failed mixed event on Wednesday, the Black Forest athlete missed five targets this time and disappeared into the dressing room in 55th place, deeply disappointed and without comment.
Bö had started the race with the number 1 in front of 14,300 spectators and manifested this status despite the complicated visibility conditions. However: He was lucky with his last two standing shots; they both landed on the edge of the targets and still fell. The 29-year-old then enjoyed the award ceremony together with his five-year older brother: "It's the best feeling to stand here with him," said the world champion: "We are the best family, the best brothers, the best athletes."
There is little doubt that the Norwegians will also dominate the pursuit on Sunday. In the women's race, however, German hopes rest on Herrmann-Wick. "When you start with the number one spot, the goal is not to come in tenth. There is only full throttle and attack to defend the number one spot," sports director Felix Bitterling took his "locomotive" to task. The organizers expect an almost sold-out arena for the double event (1:25 and 3:30 p.m./ZDF and Eurosport live).
Brych dislikes "swarm of bees" on the pitch
Felix Brych - Referee Felix Brych rules on a dropped ball.
Aggressive players or grumbling coaches? Germany's referees want to "consistently punish" unsportsmanlike conduct. Referee boss Fröhlich points to a role model function.
Top German referee Felix Brych has identified negative tendencies in the way players interact on the pitch. "I do think that there are new behaviors of players who surround the referee after decisions a bit like a swarm of bees and try to push him into the review area," the 47-year-old told Deutsche Presse-Agentur. "We discussed that during the winter break. We decided that we will not accept such unsportsmanlike conduct. We will pay more attention to that again - and will also sanction it."
Two coaches were also recently sent off. Mainz coach Bo Svensson had seen the red card in the cup defeat to FC Bayern. For Freiburg's coach Christian Streich there was the league defeat in Dortmund yellow-red. "The coach's behavior also falls into the area of unsportsmanlike conduct. We have noticed that unsportsmanlike conduct has also increased in this area, that the behavior towards us referees has become a bit more demanding or aggressive. We also want to punish such unsportsmanlike conduct consistently," Brych said.
DFB referee boss Lutz Michael Fröhlich pointed to a basically good cooperation between coaches and referees. "Overall, the relationship fits. There are reactions, followed by consistent counter-reactions. Then the person concerned has to live with that. That should be nothing earth-shattering," Fröhlich told the Deutsche Presse-Agentur.
"Conflicts can certainly arise from emotionality in the course of the game. But if the emotionality spills over into personal denigration, then you also have to accept that the appropriate measures will be taken by the referees," Fröhlich said. In recent cases, he said, the parties involved have cleared things up in the aftermath. "It would only be important if a process of rethinking were to get underway that such behavior is simply not appropriate," Fröhlich said on the sidelines of an event organized by the Association of German Sports Journalists in Munich.
The 65-year-old pointed to possible repercussions at another level. "Of course, incidents from professional soccer always rub off. There's a role model effect, imitation results from that. In recent cases in the Bundesliga, referees have reacted consistently to negative behavior," Fröhlich said. "Regardless of the consistent interpretation of the rules in the game, a clarifying conversation, with an exchange of perspectives between the referees and those affected, is always helpful."
Combined athlete Oftebro wins in Schonach
The victory was secured after a jump from the normal hill and the ten-kilometer cross-country ski race by Jens Luraas Oftebro of Norway ahead of the Austrian overall leader Johannes Lamparter. Third place went to Kristjan Ilves from Estonia.
The German combined athletes will not be at their best in the Black Forest. Beijing Olympic champion Vinzenz Geiger, Eric Frenzel and Johannes Rydzek will not be there. They are preparing with training in Oberstdorf for the World Championships, which will be held from February 21 to March 5 in Planica, Slovenia. "We have three world-class athletes at home. Of course, the team feels that," said national coach Hermann Weinbuch on ZDF.
Seven lightly injured after rear-end collision on A5 motorway
Seven people were slightly injured, including two children, in a four-car accident on the Autobahn 5 near Hemsbach (Rhine-Neckar district). According to a police statement, the rear-end collision occurred on Saturday when a motorist crashed into a car from behind during a slight tailback, pushing it onto two other cars. The full closure of the lanes in the direction of Heidelberg was lifted after about one and a half hours, it said.
Finissage at the Marl Sculpture Museum
Initiators Sebastian Freytag (left) and Georg Elben (right) stand with artist Christian Freudenberger in front of his mural.
On Sunday, February 12, an unusual exhibition ends at the Marler Skulpturenmuseum. There are some extras for the finale.
The finissage to the exhibition "Wallbound" will take place on Sunday, February 12, at 3 p.m. in the transitional quarters of the Marler Skulpturenmuseum at Georg-Herwegh-Strasse 63-67. In each of three exhibition rooms, two large-format wall paintings attract attention.
After the exhibition, the walls will be painted over and the artworks will disappear. However, a catalog documents the works created especially for the Marl Museum. It will be presented on February 12 by the two curators Georg Elben and Sebastian Freytag.
At the finissage, Dr. Friederike Schuler will also give a lecture on wall-based art in the service of the community. On the basis of numerous pictorial examples, she will present the special features of mural painting from the Weimar Republic and ask about the lines of connection to this art genre in the Federal Republic with a focus on NRW from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Dr. Friederike Schuler is a freelance art historian and curator who completed her doctorate on mural painting in the Weimar Republic in 2013. Since then, she has been researching building-related art as well as art and institutional history of the postwar period in Germany, most recently together with Sebastian Freytag on Kunst am Bau in NRW. The lecture will be followed by the final curatorial tour of the exhibition. The artists will be on site.
Arrest warrants after building collapses in Turkey
It is about construction defects that contributed to the collapse of buildings: In the Turkish earthquake region, judicial authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of suspects.
Istanbul. Dozens of arrest warrants have been issued in southern Turkey for possible construction defects following building collapses during the earthquake. In the city of Diyarbakir, arrest warrants have been issued for 33 people, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported Saturday, citing law enforcement officials. The defendants are believed to be responsible for construction defects that may have contributed to the collapse of the buildings.
The public prosecutor's office in Adana is also investigating possible construction defects in collapsed buildings, according to Anadolu. As part of these investigations, 62 arrest warrants have been issued so far, it said. One of the suspects was reportedly caught at the airport in Istanbul. He allegedly tried to travel to Montenegro with cash and is now in custody, Anadolu reported. Nine other people were arrested in the cities of Sanliurfa and Osmaniye, according to the report.
Early on Monday morning, a 7.7-magnitude quake hit the Turkish-Syrian border region, followed by another 7.6-magnitude quake at midday. More than 7,500 buildings collapsed in Turkey alone.
Last but one Minister President of the GDR Hans Modrow died
Hans Modrow is dead, according to the Left Party in the Bundestag. The 95-year-old died on Saturday night. Parliamentary group chairman Dietmar Bartsch paid tribute to the former SED functionary and later PDS and Linke politician as a "deeply sincere socialist."
Last night, "Hans Modrow passed away at the age of 95," the left-wing parliamentary group in the Bundestag announced on Saturday. The party thus loses "an important personality," said Dietmar Bartsch, chairman of the parliamentary group, and Gregor Gysi, former parliamentary group leader.
In the 1970s, Hans Modrow became the 1st secretary of the district leadership of the SED in Dresden. As prime minister, he saw the end of the GDR. Just four days after the fall of the Wall, on November 13, 1989, he became chairman of the GDR's Council of Ministers - for about 150 days. In the Volkskammer elections on March 18, 1990, the SED/PDS lost power and Modrow lost his office a month later. He was succeeded as the last prime minister of the GDR until reunification by CDU politician Lothar de Maizière.
Dietmar Bartsch, the parliamentary group leader of the Left Party, described Modrow as a "deeply sincere and combative socialist" in a message on the short message service Twitter. Bartsch added:
"Until his old age, he was an important advisor in our party whose wisdom will be missed."
"The entire peaceful course of the establishment of German unity was precisely a special merit of his. That will remain his political legacy," Bartsch and Gysi wrote in their obituary. They go on to say:
"His later work in the People's Chamber, in the Bundestag, in the European Parliament and as honorary chairman of the PDS always consisted of also representing that part of the former GDR population that was not wanted and whose interests were regularly violated."
After reunification, Modrow sat for the PDS in the German Bundestag from 1990 to 1994 and represented it in the European Parliament from 1999 to 2004.
According to a report by the Deutsche Presse-Agentur (dpa), Modrow had taken a "thoroughly critical" view of the new state. German unity had been achieved too quickly, the GDR had gone down too unconditionally, and it had been condemned too one-sidedly as an "unjust state," Modrow had criticized in many interviews, according to dpa.
What happened during the night
Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelensky condemns Russian missile attacks. Meanwhile, Kiev must carry out emergency repairs to the power grid.
Kiev - The latest wave of Russian missile attacks is again forcing emergency repairs to Ukraine's power grid. But Ukraine is also attacking Russian positions. Several thermal and hydroelectric power plants have been damaged, the head of the Ukrenerho power company, Volodymyr Kudryzkyj, said on Ukrainian television Friday evening. He said the power supply in the Kharkiv region was particularly bad. Due to the instability in the Ukrainian power grid, a reactor unit had to be shut down at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant, and production was curtailed at the Rivne and South Ukraine nuclear power plants.
President Volodymyr Selensky condemned Friday's Russian attack with some 100 missiles and cruise missiles as terror. In a video message, however, he told his countrymen how much support Ukraine had received during his trip to London, Paris and Brussels this week.
Selenskyj does not want to abandon the small town of Bachmut
February 24 will mark one year of war. US President Joe Biden announced a visit to key Ukraine supporter Poland shortly before the anniversary. Meanwhile, the threat of Russian missile attacks continued into Saturday night. An air alert was sounded in the capital Kiev late Friday night for the fifth time for the day. "There is a threat of an attack with drones," the military administration of the Kiev region announced. Iranian-made combat drones were also spotted and shot down over Mykolaiv and Odessa regions in the south.
Deutsche Bahn: Federal government selects consultant for network company
Demands from the FDP and the Greens, among others, during the election campaign to spin it off failed because of the coalition partner SPD. In the coalition agreement, a compromise was reached on an infrastructure company that would, however, be oriented toward the common good in the future. This means that it does not have to generate and transfer profits.
Renovation backlog of 80 billion euros
The two consulting firms are to help the federal government accompany this process. The backlog of renovations to the rail network is a major reason why the railroads are currently running very unpunctually. Transport Minister Wissing has set himself the task of eliminating this deplorable state of affairs by completely refurbishing entire rail corridors. The investment required for this has so far been estimated at 50 billion euros. According to recent calculations by Deutsche Bahn, however, the figure is closer to 80 billion euros.
Biathlon World Championships in Oberhof 2023 - Gold for Denise Herrmann-Wick: "Can someone please pinch me?"
The external circumstances had apparently not been in Herrmann-Wick's favor. She had slept badly, she said after the race, had been "totally excited," and her pulse had not come down during the run-in. "Such a race", and that at the home World Championships, "cannot be described in words", she said. 11,000 spectators cheered to booming pop music with German flags, coaches and team fell into each other's arms.
"Enjoy biathlon", that's what she had set out to do
For Herrmann-Wick, the pressure had been particularly high. The 34-year-old had started the World Cup as Germany's biggest, if not only, medal hope away from the relays. Herrmann-Wick is the only German to have won two World Cups this winter. She is currently ranked fifth in the overall World Cup. And even if the performance density in the women's top is significantly higher than in the men's, where only Johannes Thingnes Bø and his Norwegians dominate at the moment, others were rather on the cards for this sprint victory.
Criticism of the government - Bishop in Nicaragua sentenced to 26 years in prison
The bishop is a prominent critic of the leftist head of state. He accuses Ortega of suppressing religious freedom. Relations between the Nicaraguan government and the Catholic Church have been severely strained since 2018. At that time, demonstrators demanding Ortega's resignation had found refuge in churches. More than 350 people had died in the protests in 2018. Thousands of people left the Central American country in the following years, often for fear of repression or arrest. President Ortega accuses the Catholic clergy of plotting with the U.S. government to overthrow him.
Bundeswehr: Arms industry demands more orders from special assets
As a result, the first defense projects have already been canceled, and further projects are threatened with the same, as reported by "Welt am Sonntag. However, it is not yet possible to say which specific investments will be cancelled. "There is no need to assign specific procurement measures to a possible savings requirement at this stage," reads a response from the German government to a question from Bundestag member Ingo Gädechens (CDU).
The background to the falling investment amount is rising interest rates. The fully credit-financed special fund, which the Bundestag approved in June 2022, has to bear the interest charges for the loans itself. If these rise, less money will be available for concrete acquisitions for the Bundeswehr. In addition, the current high inflation is reducing the purchasing power of the remaining sum.
Kupferzell: Accident with 3 injured
In the night from Friday to Saturday (10.02.-11.02.), around 01.40 o'clock, a 24-year-old BMW driver, coming from the direction of Kupferzell, wanted to turn left at the Kupferzell freeway slip road in the direction of Heilbronn onto the freeway. At that time, a 21-year-old female VW driver was driving on the B19 in the direction of Künzelsau, according to police. When the BMW driver turned, the two vehicles collided.
Both parties involved in the accident stated that the traffic lights installed at the scene of the accident showed "green" for them. A check of the traffic light system did not reveal any objections. Further investigations will follow. The 24-year-old, the 21-year-old and the passenger in the BMW were each slightly injured in the accident. They had to be admitted to hospital. The two cars were damaged to a total of around 20,000 euros.
Schlossplatz Stuttgart commemorate the victims of the earthquake disaster
Many Stuttgart followed the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community on Friday evening
Tens of thousands of people have died in the earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria. The sympathy is great - also in Stuttgart.
Earthquake disaster in Turkey and Syria preoccupies the world. On Friday evening, more than 200 people remembered the victims and prayed for them in Stuttgart's Schlossplatz.
Many members of the community had responded to the call of the Feuerbach Ditib mosque community, young and old, women and men. They all listened to the Imam's supplication seriously and silently. In the prayer, the Imam asked Allah for help for the people in the affected areas, so that they could also overcome this disaster. Among other things, he asked for health, protection from plagues and respectful interaction. The congregation also requested assistance and strength to "bring our help to the areas affected by the earthquake."
Ditib stands by the side of the people in Turkey and Syria. The speakers expressed their sympathy for those affected and the relatives of the more than 22,000 victims at the time of the memorial service. The prayers of supplication were also translated into German at the Schlossplatz.
The solidarity of Muslims in Germany with the earthquake victims in the Turkish-Syrian border region is great. The fundraising campaign of the German Islamic Association Turkish-Islamic Union (Ditib) has already raised several million euros.
The Alevi community in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt collected donations in kind over several days in Glockenstraße, which are to be transported by truck to the earthquake areas. There, too, the willingness to help was overwhelming.
Hike with meat - Ebersberg
"After eating, you should rest or take a thousand steps".... The older ones know the saying, the younger ones just put it into practice. Either way, in the years of the pandemic, the good old digestive walk has experienced an unexpected renaissance. For those who, thanks to their home office, are not sitting in the middle of a stone desert, but rather just a stone's throw away from fields, forests and meadows, now use their lunch break either after a quick snack in front of the screen or as a substitute for a walk in the fresh air. At least, that's the impression you get around Lake Egglburg, where more than just dog owners can be found between 12 and 2 p.m.
One reason, of course, could be that modern man, in the course of an optimal use of time slots, can combine the health-promoting supply of fresh air with other things. After all, why not take a short walk through nature to hear news about the settlement from a neighbor you haven't seen in a long time? Or meet the friend with whom you never make it to the cinema in the evening, not even to the Old Cinema? This is also a good way to combine work and private life - who says that an appointment with a tax advisor, lawyer or investment advisor can't take place outdoors? Provided there are no foreign ears in the vicinity, of course.
What you can also do very well is to buy something in kind. Fresh fruit, for example, which stands on a table along the way, along with a small box. Or potatoes and meat. Stupid only if one did not consider the purchase already in the apron and made appropriate arrangements. Thus, an elderly couple in Hinteregglburg leaves the wooden sales room of the farmer with empty hands and regret in his voice. "Too bad, we have unfortunately forgotten the money".
You can understand the disappointment, since you have a companion with a wallet, but not a transport container. You also let the friendly chance acquaintance know this. To which the man replies: "But that's not true! You very well have a bag with you!" Thereby he points to the hood of the jacket, which one has thrown on quickly before leaving the house, although the sunshine makes an additional head covering superfluous. "My wife always packs everything in there!"
And so it happens that one starts the way back with a meat insert and has become richer during this midday short excursion not only by a saddle of lamb, but also by a decidedly practical idea. It's quite possible that a second walk will be due that day - after dinner. This time actually for digestion.
Trapped and seriously injured
Around 9 p.m., the 25-year-old drove his Audi on the district road towards Hailfingen and, for reasons as yet unexplained, left the road to the right in a left-hand bend, according to the police report. In the process, the Audi damaged a delineator, crashed into the side of a tree and came to a stop a few meters away. The collision trapped the driver in his car. The fire department freed him with heavy equipment. The rescue service took the seriously injured man to a hospital. As there was a suspicion of impaired driving, a blood sample was taken. According to the police report, the Audi was a total loss of 1000 euros.
Donald Trump's tax records: point for the rule of law
The US Department of Justice has ruled: The Internal Revenue Service must turn over the ex-president's tax returns to Parliament.
Trump in 2018, then still in office as president of the U.S.
The Treasury Department must direct the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to release the confidential records to the Finance and Revenue Committee, the decision Department said Friday.
In contradiction to political customs in the USA, the real estate entrepreneur Trump had not made his tax returns public either as a candidate or later as president. He resisted disclosure all the way to the Supreme Court. A prosecutor's office in New York has now received the documents, but no details were allowed to become public from them - unless it came to a trial.
The disclosure to Congress is probably more sensitive for Trump: There, the circle of those authorized to access the information is somewhat larger, and under certain conditions, individual details could be published in the course of the committee's investigation. In addition, confidential information from the parliament is also repeatedly leaked to the outside.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, immediately hailed the decision as a "victory for the rule of law." Access to the Republican's tax records is a matter of national security, she wrote on Twitter. "The American people deserve to know the facts about his conflicts of interest and his undermining of our security as president," Pelosi declared.
Cabaret at the Bastion: Life plays between birth and death
Kirchheim. Pasta or pizza? Samsung or Apple? Which cell phone contract among the many offers? Stay or break up? Either - or? As slaves to time, today's people rush from appointment to appointment, sometimes shoving people and hamburgers in between just like that. Lucy van Kuhl shows in her new program that the "in-between" state has something exciting.
In a humorous and thoughtful way Lucy van Kuhl tells and sings about situations from life. In her sensitive chansons and crisply pointed cabaret songs, she gets to the heart of a lot of things - and one or two things are also written between the lines. It all starts on Saturday, February 18, at 8:30 p.m. in the Kirchheimer Club Bastion.
British felon caught in Thailand after long escape
London - After five years on the run, a convicted drug criminal from Great Britain has been caught in Thailand. According to the British Criminal Investigation Agency (NCA) on Saturday, the man was arrested by Thai police officers at a car repair shop in Bangkok on Friday. The 55-year-old was on the NCA's "most wanted" list of criminals.
The leader of a criminal group had fled in early 2018 ahead of the start of a court trial in which he was sentenced in absentia to 11 years in prison for attempted importation of amphetamines worth eight million pounds (nine million euros), according to authorities.
Meetings at the church table
Bielefeld
What is served remains a secret in advance. After all, people should come to the Vesperkirche first and foremost to meet others, not because there is something specific on the menu. This Sunday is the start, then the Marienkirche in Neustadt becomes a dining hall for two weeks.
Cabaret - Stories from the Big Apple
Vince Ebert has a mission: The physicist from Lower Franconia, who has been living in Vienna for three years and, by his own admission, loves Viennese humor, takes up the cudgels for science in his cabaret programs. The programmatic title of his current solo "Make Science Great Again" fits this. Whether this fits in well with the generally prevailing domestic skepticism about science here remains to be seen. In any case, his humor fits very well in Vienna.
Incidentally, the English-language title is also derived from Ebert's more recent life story, as he spent a year in New York in 2019 trying to gain a foothold as a stand-up comedian. Now, however, he's back and not only tells his German-speaking audience about his experiences overseas, but also explains what Wissenaft actually is and what it can and, above all, what it can't do. Of course, Corona is mentioned, but also German thoroughness on the toilet and American engineering.
And he breaks it down to the most important question that many put off: What is really important? He does all this with a huge wink, in an unagitated and very ironic way. And so we are not only well entertained, but can also learn something in the process.
Please go for typing... it doesn't take long, doesn't hurt and can save many people's lives.
My cell phone rings with an unknown number. I assume. This woman is the honest finder of her wallet.
Further the Nordcon team writes: "In contrast to our old location we have very few stairs.
MdB Pfeiffer calls climate protection a substitute religion. May even be true, because I love this planet and its civilization more than some abstract god.
Ten firefighters and two police officers were injured in the explosion, some of them seriously.
I can dismiss it all as harmless quirkiness. You don't do that to children.
It's a good thing that for decades the city's politicians have been aware of the advantages and have never questioned them.
Peace and Security at the Turn of the Times? On Monday, May 15 at 6:00 p.m., the Solidarische Kirche, the Friedensplenum and the ev. Stadtakademie invite you to a lecture and discussion event at the Ev. Hochschule on the topic "Peace and Security in the Turn of Times?"
I really don't understand why people don't do events like this on Sunday. Or not in the city.
What doesn't the #Bahn actually do to scare away customers and mess up the image even more!?
Brilliant how well #LuisaNeubauer sums it up. We need exactly such people. Thank you Luisa!
Microtransactions in Diablo IV: Blizzard gives details and prices of monetization <URL> #DiabloIV #ActivisionBlizzard
After the political crisis and new elections in 2020, politicians of various stripes will travel to Germany together (!) for the first time.
I am curious who I will meet there and who I will get to know there ;-)
Party colleague Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer eleven, as well as the Ministry of Education under Anja Karliczek, who is also a CDU minister.
This is really nothing new, it is the same with every electronic ticket. Checkin/checkout is a different story.
Certainly no reason to do anything about the tax evasion of 150 billion euros per year in Germany alone.
Does anyone play #wortify and found the word with all letters today? If so, please let me know, it's driving me crazy right now.
I haven't written anything for a long time, the search for a suitable job has taken up all my resources.

1. general
The one-man entertainment device BATTLEZONE is equipped with a Vector or X/Y monitor. This game illustrates the battle action from the tank driver's point of view. The battles are fought in a wide valley, which is completely enclosed by mountains and volcanoes. In the valley there are rock pyramids and ashlars, which provide the player with temporary protection, as they cannot be destroyed by enemy bullets.
The enemy is represented by slow-moving tracked vehicles and fast super tanks, as well as nimble missiles, which, during the extended gameplay, are increasingly difficult to hit. Additionally, UFOs appear at periodic intervals. These cannot attack the player tank. Conversely, however, the player can achieve a high score by hitting a UFO. The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) different modes of operation. These are the attraction run, the game initiation run, the game abl on, the initial entry for high scores, and the self-test run. The latter mode is a special procedure for checking the controls and computer operation.
4. gameplay
The game sequence is triggered when the START pushbutton is pressed. The LED switch remains lit and the game sounds become audible. When the last player tank is eliminated by the enemy attacker, a game is over. The game starts with slowly moving tanks becoming visible on the screen. The player can determine the position of each enemy tank or missile by paying attention to the superimposed text in the upper left hint display angle of his cockpit. A hint may read, for example: ENEMY FROM RIGHT. In addition, a dot representing the enemy position becomes visible on the long-range radar screen, accompanied by a sonar BLIP sound.
The upper, cone-shaped area on the radar screen represents the player's field of view on the screen below. If the opponent is in this area, he is easy to aim at on the screen. Furthermore, ANYONE IN THE FIELD OF FIRE is simultaneously displayed in the upper left hint display.
At times, UFOs become visible on the screen, flying over the battlefield. These are harmless flying objects that observe the battle and cannot eliminate the enemy or the player's tank. The flight position of the UFO's cannot be detected by the radar. UFO's are meant to round out the combat action and distract the player, as they usually appear at the same time as enemy tanks or missiles. UFO's can be eliminated by both the player tank and the enemy tank. One shot down by the player earns the player 5,000 points. If an enemy is hit, the following points are scored: for a slow moving tank 1,000 points, for a missile 2,000 points and for a super tank 3,000 points. A super tank travels and turns twice as fast as the player tank or an enemy slow-moving tank. Several options give the player the opportunity to use 2, 3, 4 or even 5 tanks in one game. Furthermore, a bonus tank can be released after reaching pre-set scores and the appearance of the missile can be varied for a more difficult game design. Details and the exact switch positions of the game sequence selector for this setting option can be seen in the figure.
5. initial input for highest results
If a player exceeds the minimum score in the table of maximum scores, HE or SHE may enter three (3) personal initials in the table after the end of the game. The instruction for this is self-explanatory and can be displayed in four languages. Note that if a self-test is triggered, the RESET button on the Battlezone Analog Vector-Generator PCB is pressed, or the mains power is interrupted, the table with the highest results will be cleared. When cleared (RESET), the ten (10) highest scores are preserved with their initials and reinscribed on the screen to challenge other players. Any score , above 100,000, will also be marked with a tank symbol followed by the player's initials. If a player does not enter his or her initials within 60 seconds, the computer automatically inscribes dashes. After this, the machine switches back to the attraction game sequence. SET-UP
1. new parts
The BATTLEZONE device has five (5) new components. If you have previous experience with ATARI video equipment, you should take note of these important differences. The new parts are: A. The control lever. This is a redesign of the ATARI control lever. It has been strengthened by several additional ribs in the inner and outer case sections, making this assembly more stable and ensuring proper operation of the switch contacts. Another modification is the rubber centering bellows, which, like a centering spring, always returns the control lever to the center position. The microswitches are now fastened with self-locking nuts for easier replacement. B. Two PC boards. ATARI'S X/Y game circuitry has been extended to two (2) interconnected boards. These are the Analog Vector Generator board and the Auxiliary board. Using this switching technique, more lines are generated on the screen at a higher speed, resulting in a smooth and steady image. C. Power Supply. Battlezone is equipped with a newly designed power supply. It has a larger, more powerful transformer to cover the increased power supply given by the expansion of the circuitry. D. The device housing. Due to the new design, it was now possible to install a new cash register with a larger coin capacity. Furthermore, there is a console in the device, which is intended as a platform for smaller players, in order to make playing easier. At the same time, this console ensures maximum stability of the device at the installation site.
These new parts, as well as all other main assemblies of this device are shown on the figure 1. If one of these new parts is mentioned in the manual, you will find this sign. 2. device inspection
After removing the packaging, this new entertainment device is ready to play. Nevertheless, you should perform some inspection to round off the quality control. To be certain that the unit has been delivered to you in proper condition, the following checks should be made: NOTE: Do not connect the unit to the 220 V mains yet. A. Inspect exterior of housing for damage. B. Open unit maintenance door and inspect components inside unit as follows: (1) Check all harness connectors for proper and tight connection. Connect any open or loose connectors together.
NOTE: Never force plug connections. The plugs are provided with a positive guide so that a correct connection is made. A connector connection twisted by 180 degrees will destroy the PCB.
(2) Check plug connections to the game PC board for correct and tight fit. (3) Note the manufacturing number of the unit on the nameplate on the back of the unit. Check that the stamped manufacturing number matches those on the Battlezone Analog Vector-Generator PC board, Auxiliary PC board, Controller/Audio II PC board, and TV monitor. An illustration of where the manufacturing number is located is provided on the back cover of this manual. This number should always be provided when calling your dealer for further service information. (4) Check all other main components such as the power supply, the control panel and the TV monitor for proper installation. (5) Finally, the unit must be supplied with mains voltage and switched on. By looking through the viewing glass of the player, check whether the radar screen is also located in the bright opening of the casing, circled in orange. If the opening is not exactly centered, the fairing, which is attached to the housing with tape, must be loosened and realigned. Before connecting the instrument to the mains supply, make sure that the voltage selector plug on the power supply 1 (see Fig. 3) matches the local mains voltage. Check the cable color on the plug and check the connection values as listed below:
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SOFTWARE? Below are a number of tips that can help you solve most problems related to current DirectX games. Check the system configuration
Please take the time to check if your system meets the requirements listed on the package. You can use the DirectX Diagnostic program to get an overview of your system if you are not sure if your PC meets the requirements. To access the DirectX Diagnostics program, please follow these steps: Click the "Start" button and select the "Run" option. Type "dxdiag" in the text box. Now the user interface of the DirectX diagnostic program is displayed. Here you have access to all relevant system details, including information about graphics and sound cards. Among other things, you can check if graphics and sound are working properly by clicking the corresponding buttons to test DirectDraw, Direct3D and DirectSound. Note: If you do not have advanced computer skills, we would advise you not to change any of the options in the DirectX diagnostic program. Before starting the game
It can happen that other programs hog the system resources that the game needs to run properly. Not all of these programs are obviously active, and many are started automatically when the system boots. Such programs that are constantly active on your system are also called "background applications". In some cases, they can be the cause of your program hanging or crashing. That is why we recommend you to close such background applications before you start the game. - If you have antivirus or crash guard programs running on your system, you should close or disable them before starting the game. To do this, locate the program's icon in the Windows taskbar. Right-click the icon and select the appropriate option ("Disable" "Close", or similar). - Once you disable the antivirus and Crash Guard programs, you should also close general background applications, as they sometimes cause problems when you install or run a PC game. You can read more about this in the section "How to stop all unnecessary background applications". Clean up the system
Before you install any software, you need to make sure that your hard disk is working optimally. You should therefore make it a habit to "clean up" your PC at regular intervals. The tools you need to do this come with Windows: Use ScanDisk, Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup to keep everything running smoothly. Then chances are that current games will run mostly smoothly on your PC. A "clean" system also has the advantage of running much more efficiently, so other applications you use will run faster and more stably. Consult the Windows help files to learn about the ScanDisk or Error Check, Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup tools. Using Windows Help
1. click on the "Start" button and select the "Help" option (or "Help and Support") to access the Windows Help. 2. now click in the search box and type the appropriate keyword, e.g. "ScanDisk" (Win 98/ME), "Error Check" (Win 2000/XP), "Defragmenter" and "Disk Cleanup". You will then receive instructions explaining how to use these tools.
The game crashes or hangs?
For games that use the latest version of DirectX, make sure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card. This can often prevent a game from crashing or hanging. - First, you should try downloading the latest drivers from the graphics card manufacturer's website. Below you can find the latest graphics card manufacturers:

Hold down the CTRL and ALT keys on your keyboard and then press DEL. Now the Windows Task Manager is displayed. 2. to end a background application, switch to the "applications" tab, click on the corresponding entry in the task list and then on the "end task" button. Before you call the hotline
If you want to call, you should sit down at your PC and have the following information ready (see section "Checking the system configuration"). Please also prepare note material. - PC make and model - Processor type - Operating system including version number (e.g. Windows® 98;Windows® Me) - RAM (working memory) - Information about graphics and sound card and drivers.
INTRODUCTORY WORDS TO FAHRENHEIT
The desire to create video games was sparked by the advent of real-time 3D technology, which suddenly opened up a host of new possibilities and seemed to me to be a new means of expression through which to push the world to its limits. It was a way for me to open up new horizons. I felt like a cinematographic pioneer at the beginning of the 20th century: On the one hand, I was struggling with the still immature technology, but on the other hand, I was aware that there was still everything to be discovered - especially a new language that had to be both narrative and visual. To be perfectly honest, the next ten years couldn't satisfy my hunger. I had the dull feeling that video games were exploiting only a tiny fraction of their amazing creative possibilities, because they were too focused on "action" and forgetting about a fundamental element of the human experience: sensation. Meanwhile, technology continued to advance rapidly. Fahrenheit represents my contribution to making video games a true means of expression that transmits sensations. Although this could have been done in a completely different way, of course, Fahrenheit's greatest merit is the fact that it raises real questions and offers concrete answers. Fahrenheit is proof that you can indeed create an interactive gaming experience that isn't just based on fighting hideous monsters in dark corridors and shooting boxes to get ammo, but has far more challenging and in-depth content. It's proof that you can both tell a story and offer gameplay content without having to sacrifice the narrative or interactive elements because of it. I hope that both die-hard gamers and casual gamers will enjoy this new gaming experience. If you are skeptical about video games, I hope that Fahrenheit will help you change your attitude. May other developers also feel the desire to follow this new creative path and enrich it with their own inspirations, talent and ambition. Interactivity is still in its infancy and offers the chance to discover everything yet. Over the past two years, Fahrenheit has filled a large part of our lives and has represented an unforgettable interpersonal and intellectual adventure for the entire Quantic Dream team, where we have been forced time and again to question many of the principles previously considered irrevocable. I would be happy if Fahrenheit - much like books, movies and songs that have left a lasting impression on you - also leaves a mark on you. David Cage

Gameplay
Pressing the corresponding start button starts the game for one or (with minimum credit 2) for 2 players. You must try to get a lot of area without crossing the path of the rotating QIX and without hitting the wandering SPARX. The game flow is set so that a minimum prescribed area must be taken before the next area (round) can be tackled. At the top of the screen, the timed SPARX are indicated by red timing lines. When the red lines meet, additional SPARX are released. When an alarm is sounded, the SPARX become SUPER-SPARX and more aggressive. If, while you are trying to draw your area, your marker gets into the death spiral, it will be destroyed because you cannot cross your own path, or go back. If you hesitate and do not complete your area, a fuse will be lit and your marker will be destroyed. Two speed settings are available. If the drawing speed is slow, the points will be doubled. After opening the control panel, the 4 programming and test switches are accessible.
The QIX game is able to check itself, it provides data and demonstrates that circuits and controls are working properly. See "Service Program" for more information. The volume can be adjusted at the volume control (VOLUME) on the Data/Sound PC board.

SERVICE PROGRAM
General. For programming and testing the - in the device - 4 switches, the Self-Test button and the LED's on the video PC board are used.
Programming display. This display is used to select the language (English, French, Spanish, German) with which the address programming and the game work. The "Sub-Test" switch can be used to set the languages. When the desired language - green - appears, press the "Test" switch to go to the next program display. Deployment Programming. This display can be used to set the difficulty factor for the game. It can also be used to set a "maximum number of credits" that may be before the game starts. The line to be changed is set by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch (appears green), the value desired for this line is programmed with the "Up" or "Down" switch. The factory or basic setting can be reached by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch several times, when the lowest line (RESET line) lights up green, press the "Up" switch. The values are reset, the pointer (so called the green appearing lines) jumps to the first line, further programming can be done. "Test" always triggers the next program display. "Back" [Reserve High Score value x 10 000) is used to transfer the High Score pointr to the next program display until "High Score so far". This value determines the required score/hit number for a player to enter their own initials (name) and hit points on the screen. The "Maximum number of credit" determines a coin acceptance limit for the machine. If the limit is exceeded, coin acceptance is disabled - if coin lock is present. This allows a limited number of games to be set for a player. This value is from 1 - 99. It should not be set so close to 99, so that by inserting a coin the credits cannot become zero if added above 99. A free play mode can be selected by setting "Maximum number of credits" to O. Other programming: "Number of games": Number of markers per credit
"Threshold": level of the % number that must be reached to switch to the next pass.
"Time limit": Release for additional Sparx
"Difficulty": degree of difficulty of the gameplay.
"Attract sound": at "0" no sound in standby mode
at "1" sound also at stand mode (animated sound) "table model": at "0" stand model
for "1" table device
Credits per coin are set on the "Insert Slot Programming" display. High Score Programming Display ("Highest Hit Rate So Far"). The player's hit points and initials appear, including the next 10 scores. The values are used to set to high score selected on the previous display (set from "back"). Pressing the "Up" button sets the initials QIX standard. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears. The "total evaluation". By pressing the "Up" switch, can be set to 0. The following values are registered: Total credit: The number of credits paid. The total number is not set to 0. When 1,000,000 is reached, the count starts over. The total number can appear at 0 only if the battery or the connector W1 are removed, with the power off. Left side coins: Number of coins inserted - in the left coin insertion slot. Middle coins: (not available) Right-side coins: Number of coins inserted - in the right coin slot. Credits paid: number of credits given for coins inserted (revalued). Credits granted: number of credits given by the machine. % Free Spins: Credits awarded (Paid + credits awarded per 100) Minutes played: Number of minutes played. Won minutes: Number of minutes, in case of extended or won game. % Free Time: Minutes won/ minutes played per 100. Average Game Time in sec: Minutes played/ credits paid + credits granted.
High Score: Number of times a player has had a high enough hit rate to knock other players off the high score list. By pressing the "Up" switch, the values are set to 0. By pressing the "Test" switch, the next program display appears.
Insert slot programming/normal coin setting. Using this display, a default coin setting can be selected by the operator or another setting can be programmed
If a default setting is provided, pressing the "Up" and "Down" switches selects the programming while the top digit lights green on the screen. The size values change as the digit changes. When the correct setting is reached by pressing the "Test" switch, the setting is accepted. If a setting other than the standard setting is desired, the values can be adjusted by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. After pressing once, the upper setting number is set to 0, which means that own setting is possible. Since the lower values are unchanged, the programmer can reduce his setting efforts by selecting a setting that is close to his desired values and changing only those values that do not fit. Once the adjustment is made, any new value to be adjusted can be selected by pressing the "Sub-Test" switch. If pressed inadvertently, the default setting will appear. The "Up" and "Down" switches can be used to increase or decrease the values. By pressing the "Test" switch the process is finished. The coin multiplier ("coin unit") tells how many coin units are given for each coin inserted - through an assigned slot. Coin units - "Credit" shows the number of units required before a credit is given. "Bonus" coin units shows the units required before a bonus credit is issued. "Min coin" is a value that accumulates credits until a specified minimum amount of coins is reached. By default, this value is not used "0". CMOS MEMORY FAILURE
If "Memory Failure - Service Required" appears on the display, the CMOS RAM in which all programming is stored has failed. All values stored in the RAM will be reset to factory default settings. This condition probably indicates battery failure or error.
MISSING SEARCHES AND SETTINGS
Start the test method. Press the "Sub-Test" button or the "Self-Test" button (SW 1 near the LED display). All LED's should light up and the hardware test can begin. The tests and settings can be entered to the respective program display, by pressing the "Test" switch, the next program is displayed in each case. If a continuous test of the video board is desired, the self-test button must be pressed twice to start the video test in the auto-test mode. In this program, the unit will run the hardware test continuously until it is turned off. When the "Open Coin Door to Test" display appears, the program connector J 19, 1 - 2 must be plugged in. If connector J 19 is disconnected, the memory is protected and the CMOS RAM test video cannot be performed. Hardware tests: These tests are performed as follows: O = off / I = on / X = test results
The ROM checksum calculates the checksum of each video ROM and compares it to the checksum stored for that ROM. If there is a difference, the device stops and the value of the ROM with the wrong checksum appears on the LEDs. If the checksum ROM is error high, U 10 is displayed first. If this test fails, the next ROM shown on the LED display must be replaced. The E-PROM memory in a given game can be introduced as banks (series) of either 2716 or 2732 E-PROM's. The E-PROM type for each series is selected by the decode connector (26-00002-016 for 2716 or 26-00002-032 for 2732). Communications RAM from Video Board
The Communications RAM test determines the functional reliability of the memory shared by two processors by storing predetermined series of numbers in RAM and then checking whether the storage was correct. LED value: 00 0010 If the Gerdt holds with the above display, an error was detected. If the Communications RAM's fail during the video board test, the error may have been caused by faulty wiring (RAM) or errors in the Data Board. To locate the fault, remove Data-Board from P 6 and repeat the test. Failure means: error in U 3, U 4 or related circuits.
Video Board CMOS RAM
After values have been written to another part of the memory, the CMOS RAM is tested in the same way as the Communications RAM. If the test was passed, all memory locations are set to their former value. LED value: 00 0011 If the device stops with the above display, there is an error. In this case, check U 85 and U 86 and the associated circuits or decoding.
Check video board color RAM by storing predetermined number sequences in the color RAM. These numbers follow are checked for correctness when read back. LED value: 00 0100 If this value is displayed, there is an error. Check U 56, U 57, associated multiplexers and decoders.
Video board (display RAM). The display RAM is tested by writing a pattern on each side. The results of these writes are compared to the original pattern. Any discrepancy will cause the program to stop and the LEDs will indicate the faulty RAM. If a display RAM fails, determine the problem and replace the RAM. If this fault diagnostic does not indicate a RAM failure (00 0101 on LED's), it indicates that the next test is being started (Data Hardware). The connection to the Data Processor must be present and it must be functional.
Unfortunately disappointed
The jacket arrived after 2 days with AMAZON logistics. This is also the reason for star No. 1. The 2nd for the fact that the right jacket arrived without visible seam defects. BUT I have probably looked forward to this jacket too much, because the disappointment was all the greater. Had oriented me on the basis of the other reviews and ordered the jacket in L. Since it is to sit so tight and I did not want to fight with my bust size in a S or M.... In the end, it would have fit from the length and at the hip...in the rest I could swim. In addition, the lining material came to one already when opening the package and spread everywhere. Just a shame.. It is sent back :/
Fast delivery and good workmanship
The jacket makes a great impression. We were surprised by the good workmanship. You can wear it well from both sides. We ordered it for our daughter, she is totally thrilled. She usually wears the 158 and her fits the 36 in this case quite well and will certainly still worn the next year. We can recommend an order.
Robust quality
I opted for the gummiauflage c because I always work with wood on the jack and that is not optimal. Unfortunately, I have measured myself and the support does not quite fit. But that is my fault. Have then slightly changed something so that it fits. The support seems very robust and you no longer damage the edges. You can use the groove or the whole surface. Has worked without problems. It slips nothing more. I would buy again immediately.
Unfortunately too big for under 1 year
The product itself I quite okay, but not under one year. Since the surface for chewing is much too large for the small mouth. We got him when our son was 7 months and he could not use him because of the size. Now at 12 months we got him out again and he can use it. Has also not been able to bite anything yet with his teeth already a few. And when he was in the fridge, it calms him down a lot.
Quality not sufficient / Unfortunately goes back
I have probably been blinded by the partly effusive reviews here. I would like to say in advance that I already have 2 backpacks from Lowepro in use. A very large (to store the equipment) and a fairly small for the most important, everyday things that you just take. Because I just bought the Sigma 70-200 2.8, the small Lowepro is now finally too small and I need a replacement. At Prime Day I bought this backpack for a really very affordable price (just under 29 EUR) and was actually very happy about this purchase, I had read through many of the reviews in advance. When the backpack came yesterday, the disillusionment followed: The backpack is not bad for under 30 EUR, you can not say. But that he (as written in many reviews) can keep up with the well-known products, which are sold at much higher prices .... Guys, this is simply not true! I really hoped that it would, but there is really no question of it. The padded walls are much thinner and do not offer such protection as my Lowepro. Oh the separations inside, are of a different caliber, much more unstable. Overall, the feel of this backpack is nothing like my Lowepro. Also the zippers and the materials of the compartments for the small stuff are not exactly high quality. Therefore, I have decided for me that the backpack goes back. If I buy equipment of many thousands of EUR, then I must unfortunately also take the money for a decent backpack in hand. Quality here apparently has its price. For someone who does not want to spend a lot of money, the backpack is certainly a good choice, but not for me. And it's not like I had a hard time deciding either. When I unpacked the backpack, I knew after 2 minutes that it was going back. What I liked is the color inside. You can definitely find your stuff much faster here than with a gray interior. For someone who has other demands on a backpack, the backpack is certainly a great thing, but mine goes back.
Unfortunately disappointed with the third part
So far I had liked the Elektrik series by E. L. Todd the best, but my opinion was revised with this book. The first two books I found very strong and also recommendable and had really looked forward to the third part. This part is all about Volt and Taylor's feelings and I found it unnecessarily drawn out. Taylor has had a crush on Volt for so long, finally admits everything to herself, and then is like a little kid every time there's a fight, and she just goes away! At the same time there were inconsistencies, in my opinion, because at the end of the second part Volt tried to convince Taylor's ex and didn't believe him when he said that Taylor was into him and tried to convince the ex that Taylor couldn't do without him and that he had heard it himself. But at the beginning of the third part Volt seems to have forgotten everything and fights for Taylor. I had hoped that this would be the last part of the series and I think that this part is the weakest and at the same time quite unnecessary. I will still read the fourth part and hope that then finally comes out that Taylor's girlfriend Sarah is the ex of Volt. That would bring more tension into the story.
Man destroys everything, appreciates nothing and does not learn! First of all: Sooo bad the film is not now, as many write. Of course, the story is totally constructed, and again and again after the same scheme F konzepiert. If you have seen the beginning, you know how the end is. And the message is always the same: Man destroys everything, and appreciates nothing, and does not learn! And this is exactly what the film wants to tell us! How often did I think during the film (and that although I know that it is only a film, and the animals come from the computer): Oh my God, the poor animals, there often shoot one already the tears in the eyes. From there Jurassic World The Fallen Kingdom is already really neatly done. It's just a shame that people don't get the message behind the film, even though it's a mainstream movie. We are consistently destroying animals and the environment, and ultimately our planet and ourselves. For greed and profit, and stupidity and arrogance ! Empathy for the environment and living creatures :missing. 4 stars, because the film is well made, but unfortunately always after the same principle, otherwise 5 stars would have been in it. Nevertheless, well-made popcorn cinema.
a quiet, sensitive film
Some expect a film à la 8 Mile here. This film is not a Hollywood blockbuster and doesn't want to be. This film is first and foremost "French" - it is also quiet, sensitive, empathetic, authentic and makes you cry - if you let yourself get involved with it and don't expect anything from it that it doesn't want to be.
Problematic
Taste like Quench from the 90s, because of orange, but that does not matter. 5 days every morning a packet: nothing has moved, but purely nothing. My abdominal girth has grown by 12 cm! Flatulence like never before! Then diarrhea 5-8 times a day. Not very helpful, unfortunately, despite immediate discontinuation, the diarrhea has remained for 1 week. It should be noted that with the smaller package size only 2 stars (unfortunately seen too late) were given, with the larger full 5 ? This is very very strange!
terrible smell and little result! I dyed my blonde hair in October with an intense tint to a chocolate brown, in February / March I used this hair color remover. I have used the product twice. The first time I noticed right away that it stinks terribly! However, there was still a not too bad result, it came out an in about chestnut brown (slightly darker). Since I had not achieved my desired result, I used it, as in the instructions even if not satisfied result, another time. This time it was a waste of time! It didn't make any difference, my hair looked like it did the first time I tried it. What was the very worst, it still stunk weeks after application.... No matter how many times I washed my hair, the smell just didn't go away.
Highly recommended
I take the tablets now for a long time and always one tablet every 5 days. My vitamin balance has been in the basement for a long time due to my work, too little exercise and a prolonged additional illness. I wanted to help my immune system not only by healthy food but also by taking vitamin D3 and K2 something on the jump. This works also in a very good way. I feel fitter and much better. I sleep better and get out of bed better. The price is also great because you also have to consider how long you can take the tablets. Absolutely recommendable.
Function not quite flawless !!! After 3 months of use of the battery case I have discovered the following gross defects which I find very annoying: 1) The case has over time problems to "connect" with the phone. This means that it no longer charges even though you have pressed the "Power On/Off" button for 3 seconds. Removing the phone from the case and reinstalling it solves the problem in 70% of cases, but creates a new defect. 2) By frequently removing and re-installing the phone in the case, the cover has now become so worn that it detaches itself from the case, which is why I almost lost it several times. These are not many major defects, but I think that a case with battery should work properly just in its function and therefore I am, for the cost of 30 €, very disappointed in the product, especially because I only use it for 3 months.
Viei too expensive, too thin and disappointing
I do not know how all these good reviews come about. Ultimately, it is actually a glasses cleaning cloth, which you can get at any optician in a slightly smaller form gift. The cleaning effect is as good as a kitchen towel and no better. I have promised me much more of these cloths it is also really very very thin. Since I have used it I can unfortunately no longer exchange it I am disappointed and can not recommend it from my side the price for these cloths is far exaggerated more than 2 euros should not be given.
I doubt the frequency response
I bought this speaker for the shower when my smaller free speaker, which I got as a giveaway, unfortunately broke. Basically, the Onforu works great, is waterproof (me shcon fallen into the shower), gives bass like bass again, Bluetooth works great ... Suction cup you have to water of course, otherwise it loosens... he can play sound very loud.... yes... what I see critical is the frequency response of this small speaker. As I said, bass is reproduced as bass and not converted to a higher frequency. However, this causes a problem. Some frequencies are reproduced very loudly, while others remain very quiet. While some frequencies of vocals almost hurt the ears, higher and lower frequencies are just audible enough. My old speaker didn't reproduce bass well as bass, but the frequencies were presented fairly naturally in volume. Unfortunately, this is not really the case with the Onforu, which I find a bit annoying. Therefore, I have to deduct one star. I expected more from the frequency response.
Very bad
In a few places, the paint was chipped and if you just went over it with your hand, the paint went right off in some places. We wanted to have them picked up free of charge because we no longer wanted to have them, but unfortunately only at our expense. they would only replace the damaged parts but how if both chest of drawers was damaged. Poor service from the manufacturer Amazon has done it all for us and transferred us the money back. A LOB to Amazon
Better to spend a little more money
The price is relatively low, which is noticeable in the quality. Delivered are individual parts which you have to glue together yourself. The product was packed in a simple envelope, which consists of thin cardboard. There was no further protection. Since the letter carrier has stuffed the product into my mailbox, a few stencils were damaged. I did not complain about it, because I needed this product urgently. The supplied adhesive hardly holds, but sticks neatly - like chewing gum which, however, does not become hard. Already one day after gluing, almost half of the stencils had fallen off the wooden stick. Since the adhesive material does not dry out (at least this 5 days after gluing was still not dry), you have to be very careful that not everything sticks together. The templates are partially incomplete punched out. For one-time use and as a gag for a party ok, but at a wedding I would invest a little more money and reach for a high-quality product.
Am not dissatisfied. The cabinet looks good and is easy to assemble, even if the instructions are not so clear. + magnetic closures + nice look + stable when assembled + shelf can be positioned as desired.
- Doors bang due to magnets (might be possible to compensate with rubber studs) - some unclean spots
- Supplied dowels are much too small and wobble (had no other and have them since no cup was in the house, glued with craft glue) - the brackets for the shelf wobble a bit (habs with some paper wrapped and balanced) Conclusion: If he would not look so good and have such good dimensions, I would give fewer stars, because you have to make everything fit to be really satisfied. In addition, I find him then also a little too expensive.
The coffee tastes me....but
...there are only 3 stars. The taste is subjectively good, but in my opinion the original capsules are better (but also much more expensive). In this respect, I would have awarded 5*. Unfortunately, the coffee does not run evenly through (if at all!). Also, the additional plastic waste (individually packaged s.Photo) means for me a star deduction. I hope the manufacturer changes this and cashes soon full score.
Gets on my nerves
The alarm clock came quickly and everything is easy to set up. But: the natural sounds are terrible, and exceedingly loud at that. I could not turn it down either. Probably a defect, supposedly that is possible. The quietest radio setting was also too loud for me, I immediately fall out of bed. In addition, the darkest display setting is so bright that you can conjure up shadows on the wall with your hand. I always woke up when I turned to face the alarm clock because I thought it was already tomorrow. However, when the time came and the sunrise simulation started, it was immediately too bright for me. The colors and also the color change I found beautiful, unfortunately you can not dim the colored light. I also found it good that it has a battery, so that in the event of a power failure, the clock and the alarm time must not be re-entered. Went back but for the reasons mentioned.
Light super, processing insufficient
I have replaced four bulbs in the house with these lamps. Unfortunately, I could only replace four, because the other two were delivered without a socket - instead, a circuit board laughs at me at this point... There was nothing in the box either. "Pay 6 - receive 4" is not a good deal. Certainly Amazon would have settled this accommodatingly and quickly, but I only noticed this after the return period. Thus, I see this as my mistake and live with it. Nevertheless, it is not a good indication of the quality of these bulbs - so far the only reason for two stars deduction. The light itself is super. The rooms are now very bright and evenly illuminated. The light color goes rather in the direction of cold white. For hallway, study, workroom, laundry room etc perfect. For living rooms I would personally reach for warmer light. Quite comparable with a good old 100 watt bulb. However, other lamps can also and evtl I get there also intact copies according to the order. If my evaluation should be a help, I am pleased about a positive evaluation. Questions I try to answer quickly.
Great
I have received gestures and I would like to share my first look. Yes positive. I have long thought about whether I order this set, or not. ** The material is sturdy and it feels good in the hand. **The utensils all have a hole on the handle to hang them **The soft silicone will not scratch expensive cookware and pots and is especially handy to use on pans with coatings. **They are heat resistant and can be used up to 440 ℉. **They also do not pass on the heat and thus can be touched directly. **The dishwasher, however, sometimes leaves water spots on the black silicone. But shortly after wipe and they are gone. Finally I must say that I am very surprised and I can only recommend
B-goods sold as new
Amazon Prime shipping simply top. Delivery within 24 hours. Then the shock, faucet unpacked and all parts checked.dabei we found that the part has already been installed. At all assembly parts, we have significant scratches, abrasions have to determine. The screw connections / connections of the hoses were all damaged. Nevertheless, we have installed the part in the sink (unfortunately). Only now we saw that also on the chrome faucet itself is scratch marks / streaks to see. This part was probably already delivered and sent back again. We keep this faucet and install in the sink in the basement because there it does not matter how it looks. Our conclusion; Never again we order such goods through Amazon but rather spend a little more in the hardware store where we get Ordentliche goods. Find it just sad that customers are so screwed!!!
Product itself top, outdoor sensor unfortunately already broken after 6 months
In principle, I am very satisfied with this product. The installation was very easy, and the radio range is also very good, there are no problems with the transmission from the inside to the outside. I also find the design of the device appealing. It is kept very simple and can either be mounted on the wall or set up like a small picture frame. The only annoying thing is that after about half a year of use, the device which measures the values outside seems to be broken. The thermometer seems to be still intact, plausible values are still displayed here. The hygrometer, on the other hand, is probably broken, because it always displays completely astronomical outdoor humidity values. This is a pity, since the device was installed outside in a protected place and also the reason why I give this product only two stars.
Strong mower with weak catcher bag
Apart from the fact that the first attempt at delivery As of today, still blithely drives with Hermes through the republic without finding its way to me or back to Amazon, the service of Amazon with the triggering of a replacement delivery was excellent as always. The mower arrived quickly to me and made a quality impression. The engine is strong and it gives a nice cutting pattern. The volume is not exactly impressively low, but ok. Big drawback is unfortunately the catcher bag. For one thing, it is only made of hard plastic at the top and bottom and fabric in between. If you put it down full just briefly, then of course it gets compressed and parts of the contents fall out. But what's worse is that the actually practical fill level indicator already shows red when the catcher bag is half full. That wouldn't be so bad if the mower didn't lose large parts of the clippings from then on. Emptying the basket every time it is half full on a large lawn cannot be the solution. Therefore, I cleaned the device as well as possible and sent it back. Conclusion: Basically a very good mower, but the unfortunate design of the catch basket makes it unusable for me.
Good device for monitoring
I have two of these devices. The device is easy to integrate via the app. Very good is the supplied plug-in sensor cable, which can also be extended if necessary. The device is solidly built. Room temperature and humidity are displayed, but to save battery only once to three times a day (adjustable) in the app. I give only 4 stars for the following reasons. - The soft back panel of the device, which also closes the battery compartment can only be closed again quite fiddly. - One of the two devices is in a room with quite thick walls. This device loses its connection to the network every 1 to 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the device does not reconnect by itself, even if you put it near the router. You have to take the batteries out and put them back in after a short break, then it reconnects. This should actually work without removing the battery. There is always an alarm when the connection is lost. - The alarm sound could be a bit louder.
3D Printer Prusa i3 DIY
I ordered this 3D printer because I wanted to use it for my own projects. Unfortunately, I have not yet managed to level the hotbed correctly. The right rear locking screw is completely tightened, but the hotbed is still too high and the front right screw falls out, because it is not tightened at all, although the hotbed is still too low. The rods that hold the trolley are straight as well as the table. Maybe someone knows what can be done, because it is impossible to print anything. To the construction: The construction was quite problem-free one could only show how to lay the cables because otherwise you have to lay them several times again, which is very exhausting. Support I have also written but after a week of waiting still no answer. Send back is unfortunately no longer possible. Had expected something more.
robust and precise am positively surprised
My old caliper has unfortunately given up the ghost after many years, so had to get a new one. This one makes a very robust impression and is just as precise after several test measurements. Included are two batteries, so you can get started right away. The packaging of the slider is simple, but completely fulfills its purpose. Otherwise, the slider leaves nothing to be desired and has all the necessary measurement methods. I can only give full marks for it and believe it lasts at least as long as the old caliper. From me there is a clear purchase recommendation and a good measuring instrument simply belongs in every household.
Disgusting, persistent odor
Bought the bracelet and have not worn for the time being, because it exudes a disgusting smell. To this day, this smell is not gone, although it was constantly "aired". After return no longer possible, I have disposed of it. Advise against purchase
For the price ok
The stars and spheres on this necklace are a bit too big for me personally, so it looks quite massive. The larger ball are freely movable, which I find again quite nice. However, the chain is processed overall very simple, so that I have already torn open the closure twice. So far I could always repair him again, but I think that will not go well / hold for a long time. But for the low price you can expect simply also nothing really high quality.
Very beautiful jewel
A beautifully crafted bracelet - and the simple clasp actually holds! You just have to pull the end through the mouth, it can't come undone, amazing! I rubbed it with some leather care, this makes it a little softer and more supple. Only: who has something magnetic on the arm: The clasp is made of steel!
Unfortunately scrap! I was already disappointed after unpacking, because the small displays of the transmitters were all scratched, so I had the feeling that it was used goods. The base station was fine. Now to the function: Connects only after some playing.... If you follow the instructions, it does not work at all, only after I removed a battery from the base station again and inserted a new one, the transmitters finally connected. Unfortunately, my joy did not last long, because already after an hour the connection was gone again, and that although the transmitters were next to the base station. Also, the display of the three transmitters was very different! All in all for me so not to use! The thing went back! Would advise against a purchase in any case, brings only trouble!
Transport damage
Hello, I had this garden pump once before, unfortunately after 3.5 years the thread of the internal shaft was rusted off. I bought it again for only one reason, I needed it urgently because of the current drought and I knew the connections of the suction line as well as the discharge line would fit. I hope the shaft on the previous pump had a manufacturing defect and the current pump will do its job a little longer. Unfortunately, the new pump had shipping damage, the plastic housing was cracked and the vents broken. The box was also damaged on the outside, so I would recommend packing the pump a little better in the future rather than just using a thin-walled box. I kept the pump anyway, because as described above, I needed the pump urgently and the cracks in the plastic housing did not affect the pumping performance.
Could have been thought through better. Since I often have to deal with many different keys, I thought such an organizer is more pleasant than running around all the time with a huge bunch of keys. At the beginning everything went quite well. However, the paint came off pretty quickly and the screws always had to be retightened. It's nice that this can be done with a cent coin, but only with a cent coin. A suitable slotted screwdriver I have not found, which would not have immediately ruined the whole screw. Now to come to the most annoying part of the whole thing: attaching the keys. Nice is that through the different parts, the screw can be set to different sizes or lengths, but if you have the whole thing screwed together, you need a pair of pliers to bring the whole thing apart again. The attachment of the key itself is simply a game of patience, balance and skill. Ultimately, the third time I mount the screw in the thread is broken off and thus the entire thing unusable. Conclusion: If at all then for only once all the necessary keys and then never again, but at the price you can also buy a cheaper alternative.
Do not quite correspond to the specified dimensions
Smooth zippers, the material seems sturdy and all in featherweight. Since I have no comparison (my first organizer set), I will be able to actually judge the goods only after the first use. In advance I can already say that the height is lower than specified. At the moment I can not really imagine to pack everything there, for example, for a three-week vacation. If necessary, the really big parts can go directly into the suitcase - as before. It should also be noted that not 8, but 10 parts were delivered, because in the round cosmetic bag still two smaller bags / sachets were included. Not high quality processing, I wanted to mention that anyway. That the cosmetic bag has a different color and is made of different material than the other bags, I personally do not mind. The price-performance ratio I see as a trial price and that's ok.
So lala
So, ordered before Christmas and also worked until after Christmas. Now, when I wanted to use it again, it didn't. Battery? Exchanged. But he still does not work. So the money I could have thrown directly into the trash can.
Care is always good! The application is simple, but you should be very careful with the brush approach not to damage the needle. An improvement in the sound I could not hear out of my very high-quality record player.
Long battery life
The headphones are wonderfully protected. Included were two black cables. The battery life is very long. Definitely perfectly adequate sound. I liked that the headphones do not hurt even after long wear and are therefore very comfortable. The ear cups are totally soft and comfortable to wear. The weight is also kept very low. Purchase recommendation in this price range.
chic dress
Very nice dress that is well wearable for a variety of occasions.... Price-performance is fully in line here, especially since I bought it even in the lightning offer. It fits perfectly in my size, I'm glad I did not order it smaller (was recommended). I would have wished only that the neckline would not be so deep, and also the sleeves could use a little more fabric (if you do not have quite as narrow upper arms as the model in the picture). But all in all a chic dress for many occasions.
Hands off. It doesn't get any worse than this. I really and seriously did not expect such junk to be sold these days. The drive is powered by a high-end Asus ROG Strix Scar II gaming laptop. It can be assumed that the USB ports supply enough power. Nevertheless, a trouble-free operation of this drive is not possible. DVD normally goes, Blu-rays are recognized unreliably at most. The discs have to be inserted several times, after which it makes roaring noises like you haven't heard since the 90s from old PCs and the very first CD-ROM drives. After minutes you can either restart the computer because nothing happens or the disc is finally recognized. But then you can't press pause or jump to a chapter or change the language during the movie or anything else. This immediately leads to an unrecoverable freeze. On top of that, of course, there is no Blu-ray software included. If you buy PowerDVD or similar additionally for a fee, the price of this drive doubles.
Does what it's supposed to, but it's not pretty. First of all, I would like to point out that the two USB ports are actually window dressing, because only the port that points upwards is a USB port. The other plug is only there to charge any devices and is thus relatively useless. I did not know that when I bought it, which is why I was a bit disappointed. I actually needed a second port and if I had only needed a plain extension, I certainly would not have bought this bulky lump with gold plugs. But looks and my misjudgment aside, the extension does its job very reliably. And due to the weight of the plug, the inserted USB stick doesn't just dangle around like a normal extension cord. So not a real bad buy, but my euphoria is kept within narrow limits :-).
Small but mighty! I bought this product so that I have an audio output on the iPad (Pro) and can connect a display. With IOS 12 you can now also push data back and forth. This works very well. Furthermore, the audio output was as expected. Other adapters which I already had to send back could not do this unfortunately. The HDMI output is practical. I now have a PS4 controller via BT on the tablet and the HDMI on the TV. Simultaneous charging is no problem. Sound is delivered via HDMI. For what I still use my PlayStation :P There was a small adapter which can be attached to the tablet. This is supposed to bring stability and also has a magnetic holder. With my sleeve does not fit with the adapter. Well holds even so secure and has contact from therefore ... All in all, although a bit expensive but justified by the full range of functions. In addition, very small the whole and made in an aluminum piece stable. Price performance fits.
Lots of power
Top device. Runs for months without problems. Is not exactly light or quiet but brings decent performance. I find the middle position of the temperature (Tp setting) rather a bit too cool and am therefore always on level 2. Has also fallen several times on the tile floor and has survived it well. And I also like the simple design. Competitor products like to look like spaceships.
Very good
The processing of the brush head has left a very good impression, although the price difference compared to the original is very large, but does not make a cheap impression. In use, the feeling of a high-quality process is confirmed. Overall, I found these brushes very good and can be recommended without reservation.
Great product with weak battery
We have the tracker for about 6 months and are positively surprised in live mode, the location is accurate to 0.5m felt. In offline mode when the dog is in the house, he jumps but like once a few meters which is not disturbing. Would buy it again at any time. What would be great, however, would be a battery that lasts longer. Currently, he keeps about 1.5h days through. Here would be a solution super which would create 7-14 days. There is an XL version but unfortunately this is too big for our taste, as long as the battery would not have to hold out with us and change daily we also find impractical. You should deal with the dog not with his collar :-) . The app also worked perfectly.
After a few weeks garbage
We have already ordered the shoes in several sizes. They fit well and also seem to be comfortable. However, the life span is decreasing more and more. Although my son only wears the shoes in sports lessons, the sole breaks after just a few weeks and the shoes can no longer be used. With the last pair it was in normal use also so that they did not last very long, but I thought for the lessons it will be enough. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The shoes are expensive garbage and absolutely not recommended.
Fits perfectly - but original? My last pair of Crocs is unfortunately broken after 5 years, so I have ordered me with pleasure new. These are unfortunately poorly made at first glance. Comfortable they are just like the ones I owned before. At first glance, no difference seems to be noticeable, but at second glance you can see that the edges are poorly finished and the retaining strap at the heel sits quite loose and very likely will not last five years like my previous ones. I am curious!
Surprisingly good
Since there are hardly any reviews to read here, I was only very skeptical. However, since I'm going to a festival this year and would like to sleep in the car, I ordered it then but times on good luck. The mattress and a car air pump were included in the delivery. About the mattress: I have test laid out in the car (Citroen Berlingo). I noticed that there is some mold on one side. I wiped it off and hope that it will not reappear. In the inflated state, a lie down test was carried out directly. It can lie well on it and fits super to the festival. Of course, this mattress can not replace your own bed, but the for days at the event it is pure luxury. The mattress fits wonderfully in my car. Previously, we took out the seats in the back. So it fits perfectly. The air pump: the air pump has different adapters. The mattress requires two different adapters, which can also be found on the pump. The pump plugs into the car's cigarette lighter. However, the plug was defective (something at the solder joint). Since my friend is handy, he was able to fix it and reassembled the good part worked great and pumped up the mattress in no time. Overall, I am very excited about the mattress. I am then curious about the endurance test at the festival. I hope that it does not lose air and also lasts a long time. Likewise, that he mold does not reappear. After the test I can recommend it in any case already times. If I should make other experiences, I will revise the review accordingly (if possible).
Definitely not worth more than 10€... Unfortunately, the calendar gets only two stars from me. :( 1. for the fast shipping. 2. for the idea of the toy. Unfortunately, the calendar is torn open by the läppische processing directly on day 1 over several Türchen. On 21. Türchen were no more doors on it and I had to more or less allow my son that he may accordingly take out the remaining parts because they came to him quasi already fallen. The parts often come out mixed up which often means that you have to disassemble the car again to put the parts on. After the car is completely assembled parts fall off while playing. (Mostly the windshield. This is also very difficult to reattach). In itself, I would no longer buy this calendar and also recommend no one. Maybe the manufacturers rethink the way they designed the calendar for the next edition and make it better. :\
a real drone
I am thrilled with the drone. My 7 year old daughter flies with it. Indoors flies the very good and the 5 min. flight time is usually quite enough. The hair is jammed in it and the drone is broken very quickly I have not expected otherwise at the price, but falls from the ceiling to the floor, whether tiles or carpet, are no problem. For questions nice contact.
Game ok but only playable with forcing to Steam. Did not see when buying that it is not a game CD but only a code with which you can download the game. That would be fine as far as it goes, but you are forced to install Steam to play it at all, which is an outrage. Since then, the computer hangs constantly, which would certainly not be the case with a pure installation of the game.
Unfortunately, it fails due to the battery runtime
I was really looking forward to the watch. Design and optics great, messages etc were displayed without problems. Operation worked well.... and yet I send it back. Drr big hook: the battery and its runtime. Charged in the evening, just lay on drm cabinet overnight and in the morning 11% less battery when not in use. Came during the day many messages, the battery was already at noon / early afternoon at the end and then you can not even read the time. Therefore, for me not usable. Very sad.
Noble casing with limitations
You should definitely get a case for the slippery Samsung Galaxy S10+. I have recently liked cases in which you can also insert the credit card. This is what the case here offers. If you put cards in all 3 compartments, it becomes too much, then the lid stands a bit high. One is enough for me. The leather case makes a robust impression and seems to be well made. It looks classy. The phone is embedded all around, unlike many other cases, there are only cutouts at the ports. Otherwise, you can operate the on-off switch and volume control on the sides well through the case. The disadvantage is that it is not possible to charge the phone on some QI chargers due to the thickness of the case. Even the leather QI charging station from TORRO does not work. Accessories - like the Galaxy Buds - can only be charged when the case is removed. Otherwise, really chic and well made!
high quality case with bulletproof glass film
Robust case mt a real bulletproof glass to protect the screen in a classic design provides all-round protection for the whole iPhone 11. Fits very well and can also be easily put on. The material is comfortable to hold and does not get dirty. A really successful and beautiful product with a very good price-performance ratio. This case gives the phone some support. It is not too bulky and fits tightly to the phone. Overall a good buy.

U.S. President Obama also called for a transparent investigation into the attack that night.
He tried to blackmail BitDefender instead.
For example, the company has sold just over 50 million units of its 3DS since its launch in early 2011, while Apple sold around 74.5 million iPhones in the last quarter of 2014 alone.

"The most beautiful day in my life" For a few days now, Miroslav has been the new employee at the Hartl company.
The treatment of extensive or complex hand injuries places special demands on the functional and esthetic outcome.
In this type of injury, primary soft tissue coverage is of particular importance, as it can significantly improve the initial situation for recovery of function.
The diagnosis of a floating thrombus in the patent foramen ovale (so-called transit thrombus) without arterial embolism is rare.
In the case described here, the diagnosis was made by routine transthoracic echocardiography.
Persistent cellular microchimerism may play a role in the pathogenesis of systemic scleroderma (SSc).
Microchimerism results from the transport of fetal cells across the placenta during pregnancy into the maternal circulation and their survival due to extensive HLA class II compatibility.
In female SSc patients, the presence of fetal CD3-positive T cells in the maternal circulation and of fetal cells in the affected skin tissue was detected in the form of Y-chromosome-specific DNA sequences.
Persistent microchimerism could trigger SSc in certain patients via a fetoantimaternal graft-versus-host-like response.
Autologous blood collection prior to elective surgical procedures helps to reduce perioperative risk, but may itself cause side effects.
Are there any particular patient characteristics that influence the frequency and severity of adverse events?
Still's disease was originally defined for childhood as chronic rheumatoid arthritis with initial systemic symptoms.
In rare cases, however, the disease does not set in until adulthood, in which case it is referred to as adult onset Still's disease.
Diagnostic criteria include characteristic exanthema, joint symptoms, fevers, and leukocytosis, as well as liver dysfunction, sore throat without detectable infection, enlargement of lymph nodes or spleen, and absent titers for rheumatoid factors or antinuclear antibodies.
We report on two adult patients who had been ill for some time and whose skin symptoms led us to the diagnosis of Still's disease.
The exanthema of Still's disease is a symptom of high sensitivity.
It manifests as red, sharply demarcated macules that are very transient.
Mild friction can induce erythematous Köbner's phenomena in the exanthema episode, which, as we describe here for the first time, sometimes persist longer than the rest of the exanthema.
An androgynous symbol is interpreted by means of paintings from the unconscious in the course of a psychoanalytic process.

To improve eyelid closure in lagophthalmos due to facial nerve palsy, gold implants are often used for eyelid weight loss.
The compatibility of the implanted material does not always meet expectations.
We therefore investigated whether better results could be achieved with the very well tolerated platinum implants.
The evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most important and urgent aspects of routine diagnostics in dermatohistopathology.
Uniform and reproducible histologic criteria are required for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma or differential melanocytic nevus.
The prognostically relevant tumor parameters and those important for the therapeutic procedure must be recorded completely and consistently in the histopathological report of malignant melanoma.
The recommendations of the working group on histopathological diagnosis of malignant melanoma are summarized below.
Acute respiratory symptoms in immunocompromised children present a diagnostic challenge.
Early and accurate diagnosis can lead to rapid and effective therapy and avoid unnecessary but potentially harmful therapies.
Causative factors include infections with a variety of pathogens; in addition to the usual bacterial pathogens, Pneumocystis carinii (Pc), cytomegaloviruses (CMV), fungi, tubercle bacilli and respiratory viruses are in the foreground.
However, in 25-30% of cases, non-infectious causes underlie the respiratory symptoms.
To establish the diagnosis, medical history, X-rays of the lungs and blood tests are often of little help.
Often, however, analysis of material from the respiratory tract leads to the diagnosis:
Nasopharyngeal secretions, sputum (possibly induced by saline inhalation), and especially bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage results in diagnostic clarification in 60-80%; the remaining cases must be diagnosed by lung biopsy, usually open, if the clinic is appropriate.
Mostly younger to middle-aged women are affected.
In German-speaking countries, this clinical picture has not yet been mentioned in the literature.
We describe a patient, now 60 years old, with the typical picture of IMDE (type I).
The particular interest of this casuistry is that there is no light dependence, as evidenced by the fact that no deterioration occurred under PUVA therapy.
It is likely that IMDE is a special disease from the group of elastolytic diseases, in which immunological mechanisms in the etiopathogenesis can be discussed.
Using the preoperative and postoperative computed tomograms (CT) of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar vertebral fractures treated by USS (universal spine system), we performed a planimetric evaluation of the spinal canal.
Our aim was to evaluate the efficiency of direct reduction of stenosing posterior edge fragments performed under intraoperative sonographic control.
51%) than in cases without neurological disorders (reduction ASP:
Below L 1, the spinal canal is wider than between Th 11 and L 1 and thus tolerates greater constriction.
In fractures without neurological signs of failure, fragment reduction promises to prevent late damage to the spinal cord in the sense of myelopathy and spinal claudication.
A preliminary investigation should clarify whether there is evidence of ultrasound analgesia in patients with nonradicular back pain under serial application as a function of prescribed power density (LD).
A review of the existing literature shows that complicated and difficult-to-reduce mandibular fractures have a significantly lower complication rate after compression osteosynthesis, whereas simple and only slightly dislocated fractures in the distal portion of the mandible can also be successfully treated using monocortical miniplate osteosynthesis.
The survey of pre- and intraoperative parameters, which describe the character of a mandibular fracture and additively form a ranking value for the classification of a trauma, seems to be the guiding principle for a suitable differential indication between both therapy concepts.
However, with only 7 individual parameters - as in the mandibular fracture score - there are already so many combinations for describing mandibular trauma that all the studies conducted to date, with their small numbers of cases, can at best provide a rough differential indication.
As long as no prospective multicenter study is available that could provide decision support in the choice of osteosynthesis procedure, preference should be given to functionally stable compression osteosynthesis with its significantly lower incidence of postoperative complications in the fluid range between "simple" and "difficult" fractures.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a molecular cytogenetic technique that allows comprehensive analysis of a tumor genome for over- and under-representation of DNA segments.
In order to be able to make quantitative and reproducible statements about the genetic aberrations, software was developed that allows the objective recording of the location and type of changes.
The result is presented in the form of a CGH sum karyogram, which documents the genetic changes as color-coded chromosomes.
The aim of these studies is to establish a correlation between genotype and phenotype based on sum karyograms and thus to achieve a genetic characterization of tumors that complements the morphological description.
Surgical interventions can be accurately planned and simulated with the aid of three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of the anatomical bony structures, created from a patient's tomography data.
Computer-assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can provide assistance in the intraoperative implementation of what was previously planned and in spatial orientation in the surgical site.
After successful centralization of laboratory analytics for more than 30 years, advances in biosensors, microprocessors, measurement in undiluted whole blood, and downsizing of laboratory analyses are now increasingly leading to renewed re-decentralization in laboratory medicine.
Point-of-care testing (POCT) is performed close to the patient outside of centralized or decentralized laboratories.
The theoretical advantages of POCT are faster turn-around times (TAT), faster medical decisions, avoidance of sample identification and sample transport problems, and the need for only small sample volumes.
While these benefits are often highlighted, they are not accompanied by a clearly identifiable clinical benefit.
The disadvantages of POCT, such as improper handling and/or maintenance of analytical instruments by untrained station personnel, lack or absence of calibration and/or quality control, cost of maintaining multiple instruments and more expensive reagents, insufficient documentation, and difficult comparability between POCT results and routine laboratory results, are also apparent.
In the opinion of the authors, the decision to establish a POCT should only be made in close cooperation between clinicians and laboratory physicians to ensure meaningfulness and high quality of the analyses.
Considering the local situation (24 h central laboratory, etc.), the parameter spectrum of the POCT should be strictly limited to vital functions.
The analytes needed for this should be:
Hemoglobin or hematocrit, Activated Whole Blood Clotting Time, blood gases, sodium, potassium, ionized calcium, glucose, ammonia, and lactate.
The concept of guiding invasive diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures by MR tomography is based on the combination of excellent morphological and functional imaging.
The prerequisite is adequate patient monitoring and compliance with safety aspects.
Fast and ultrafast imaging, temperature quantification, visualization of intravascular instruments, thermostability of contrast agents, and thermosensitive contrast agents will be discussed.
Clinical applications range from biopsies, thermal ablation procedures, vascular applications to intraoperative use of MR tomography.
Interventional MR imaging is still in the very early stages of development.
It is possible that MR tomography may gain significant importance in the field of interventional radiology and minimally invasive therapy.
Patients with chronic renal failure have characteristic skeletal changes.
The aim of the present studies was to completely assess the bone mass changes of the spine during long-term hemodialysis from C2 - L5.
Spines of 9 autopsy cases with dialysis duration ranging from 4 to 15 years were examined completely.
With a newly developed preparation technique, combined two- and three-dimensional analysis is possible, so that the underlying three-dimensional structure can be analyzed directly in addition to the histological image.
Vertebral body heights (SDI), bone volume (BV/TV), and intertrabecular linkage (TBPf) were evaluated quantitatively.
The "spine deformity index" (SDI) shows vertebral body fractures in types I and II of renal osteopathy (ROP), despite a trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) in the normal range.
BV/TV shows a distribution across the spine known from the skeletally healthy control collective.
However, the plateau-like curve decreasing from the cervical to the lumbar spine is 5% lower in the ROP.
The BV/TV of the 2nd LWK ranges from 51.2% to 74.1% of that measured in the corresponding iliac crest biopsy.
The cases with prolonged hemodialysis have higher BV/TV values regardless of age and sex.
Normal BV/TV is not synonymous with physiological connectivity of cancellous bone and functional statics.
Three-dimensional analysis in ROP reveals much more architectural restructuring than can be inferred from 2-D sectional planes and trabecular bone volumes compared with controls.
The findings underscore the importance of effective prophylaxis to maintain an orderly and thus functional cancellous bone architecture in patients on chronic hemodialysis.
In 1700, the French surgeon Alexandre de Littré described for the first time a form of inguinal hernia, which did not correspond to what was previously known due to its course of disease as well as the dissection findings made by Littré himself.
100 years later, Meckel provided the pathogenetic explanation for this bulging of the intestinal wall.
Shortly before, Richter described the intestinal wall hernia in a scientific paper on "hernias" and thus probably provided the starting point for the misleading use of the clinical entity of "Richter-Littré hernia" in German-speaking countries.
A case report is used to provide a historical review of this type of hernia.
Asperger's syndrome is an autistic disorder first described by Hans Asperger in 1944, but received little attention in the decades that followed.
It was not until the 1980s that the clinical picture received increasing attention and was not included as a diagnosis in the ICD-10 until 1988 and in the DSM-IV until 1994.
The cause of the malfunction is unclear.
A patient with the typical features of Asperger's syndrome is presented, who also had epilepsy and internal abnormalities.
Possible concomitant disorders of Asperger's syndrome such as epilepsies are discussed along with diagnostic criteria and therapeutic procedures.
Yersini infections usually manifest as febrile gastro-enteritis or pseudoappendicitis in childhood.
A child is reported in whom Yersinia infection manifested as tumor-like lymphadenitis localized in the mesenteric root with long-lasting persistence.
The diagnosis was established by the repeated detection of specific antibodies against various outer yersiniamembrane proteins.
Only after therapy with ciprofloxacin for 16 weeks did all clinical findings normalize.
The use of pulse oximetry in cardiopulmonary resuscitation was prospectively studied among 23 prehospital resuscitations.
The questions were investigated, which conclusions can be drawn from the O2 saturation values obtained during resuscitation and which consequences result from these findings.
The study shows that pulse oximetry appears to be suitable for quality control of the resuscitation measures performed in a high percentage.
Pulse oximetry is a useful monitoring measure under resuscitation and should be used as early as possible.
Intensive epidemiological and pathophysiological research over the past 30 years has successfully contributed to a better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of sudden infant death (SID).
This also applies if an autopsy could not clarify the cause of death.
A wealth of scientific data was presented at this workshop, highlighting the enormous potential of embryonic stem cell technology for future tissue transplantation.
In a 58-year-old female patient, signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with consumptive coagulopathy and fever developed in the early postoperative period after vaginal hysterectomy and, in the further course, the picture of septic shock.
Staphylococcus epidermidis was also detected in this autologous blood unit, and Propionibacterium acnes in the second.
The source of contamination of the canned food was not identifiable.
It has been shown that autologous hemotherapy also involves a risk of infection that should not be underestimated, and that retransfusion of autologous blood requires a strict medical indication.
Fungal fungal infections in the renal pelvis are an uncommon manifestation of severe Candida albicans infection.
We describe a mature neonate with VACTERL association who developed fungal zooids in the renal pelvis after candidasepsis, leading to hydronephrosis with onset of postrenal renal failure.
Normalization of excretory function occurred with antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and fluzytosine and direct irrigation with amphotericin B after percutaneous nephrostomy.
With the increasing frequency of systemic candida infections, especially in neonatology, the possibility of bezoar formation should also be considered as a differential diagnosis to nephrolithiasis in order to initiate early and effective therapy.
High-dose UVA-1 therapy is an effective method for the treatment of acute exacerbated atopic dermatitis.
In the meantime, it has become apparent that some of the patients do not respond to this therapy or respond only inadequately.
In the present retrospective study, 2 groups of 20 responders and nonresponders, respectively, were compared.
No significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the following parameters:
Skin type, minimum erythema dose, single and cumulative doses of UVA1, eosinophils in peripheral blood.
In contrast, the non-responders were found to have a significantly increased atopy score, increased titers of total IgE and of specific IgE compared to the responders.
In addition, the non-responders were comparatively more likely to have severe bacterial colonization of the skin with Staphylococcus aureus and of the intestine with Candida albicans.
These findings indicate that high-dose UVA-1 therapy is not effective in all patients with atopic dermatitis.
Non-responders are characterized by a particularly severe atopy syndrome on the one hand and complicating superinfections on the other.
The latter finding indicates that for these patients, a combination of high-dose UVA-1 therapy with antibiotic or antifungal treatment may be beneficial.
Lupus erythematosus profundus represents a rare variant of lupus erythematosus.
Two typical case reports are used to demonstrate the association of lupus erythematosus profundus with features of discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus.
Clinically, subcutaneous nodular and squamous infiltrates are present, which can lead to ulceration and scarring retractions.
Histologically, lobular panniculitis is found.
Positive direct immunofluorescence examination (lupus band test) with deposits of IgG, IgM, and complement components at the dermo-epidermal junction and vessels is also considered a further diagnostic clue.
Knowledge of the clinical picture and histopathology are of particular importance, as lupus erythematosus profundus may precede systemic lupus erythematosus by years.
Reported are clinical and morphologic findings in an 81-year-old female patient with many years of chloroquine treatment for rheumatoid arthritis that had been present for more than 45 years.
The patient died with clinical signs of cardiac low-output syndrome secondary to vacuolar chloroquine-induced cardiomyopathy confirmed by autopsy and toxicologic analysis.
The pathogenesis and morphologic and clinical characteristics of cardiotoxic chloroquine effects are presented.
In the last 5-7 years, there has been intense research interest regarding the mechanisms of AF development and the development of new treatments for this arrhythmia.
One of these new therapeutic procedures is the implantable atrial defibrillator.
This review summarizes the results of experimental and clinical studies regarding the development of optimal electrode configurations and shock pulse shapes for internal low-energy atrial cardioversion.
As a result of scientific progress in medicine, more and more patients with pre-existing conditions, old age, restricted cardiac pump function, after previous cardiac surgery, and under emergency conditions are being operated on.
This requires risk stratification, which can be used to classify the surgical risk into "low", "medium" and "high"‰ﬂt.
Pr‰-, intra-, and postoperative patient-, structure-, and treatment-related factors can be distinguished.
Based on this prediction, the perioperative course can be optimized by individually tailored, pr‰-, intra- and postoperative, multiprofessional and interdisciplinary‰r organized management.
Patients show an increased incidence of skin and mucosal tumors, especially spinaliomas and basaliomas.
We report a 65-year-old female patient who developed 15 malignant melanomas, one spinalioma, and one lymph node metastasis from a malignant melanoma.
The clinical diagnosis of xeroderma pigmentosum was confirmed by complementation analysis, which resulted in assignment to complementation group D.
Occasionally, patients with malignancies of the chest, thoracic wall, and/or abdominal wall that have been untreated for years and have exulcerated in the meantime present plastic surgeons with the need for large defect coverage following successful tumor resection.
The use of silver-containing activated charcoal fleece (Actisorb 3) in combination with hydroactive polymer overlays (Allevyn) prevented infection after flank replacement by omentoplasty in the course of resection of an extensive basal cell carcinoma.
After secondary mesh graft coverage, fibrosis and calcification of the omentum resulted in a stable torso wall even without the use of synthetic mesh.
The 2000 health care reform in Germany does little to change the structural deficits of the German health care system.
The monopolies of hospitals for inpatient care and of contract physicians for outpatient care are not affected.
Hospital budgeting remains.
In the future, mandatory catalogs will be specified for outpatient surgeries that may not be performed as inpatient procedures.
The obligation for quality assurance is specified and tightened.
A new DRG-based pricing system is being introduced for hospitals.
Sepsis and its potential degradation to multiple organ failure represents a complex immunologic process that is influenced by local and systemic proinflammatory stimuli, occurs system-wide, and whose activity is minimally reflected in the amounts of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators found in the blood.
At the cellular level, sepsis involves the upregulation of pro- and anti-inflammatory activators.
Inflammation is enhanced by activation of intracellular promoter protein nuclear factor B (NF-B), which induces synthesis of mRNA coding for many of the pro-inflammatory mediators, including TNF-, IL-8, and inducible NO synthetase.
Similarly, the same stimuli cause parallel activation of the heat shock protein (hsp) cascade, which inhibit NF-B activation and minimize the inflammatory response.
The balance between these two processes appears to control cellular immunoreactivity, both locally and system-wide.
Characterizing this immunoreactivity may ultimately lead to a better understanding of the determinants of the inflammatory response and potential immunotherapy.
The symptoms of odontogenic tumors are usually nonspecific.
Radiographically, often only brightenings in the bone are visible, sometimes also scattered or diffuse radioopacities.
Root tip resorption can be another important finding.
After a brief historical overview, the current state of knowledge is briefly discussed for each individual type based on the currently valid WHO classification.
From this, the currently valid therapy concept is developed, in which all 22 tumor entities are divided into a total of 4 groups:
malignant, locally aggressive, recurrent and non-recurrent tumors.
Generalized cheerfulness disorder (GHKS) is a mental disorder that is often recognized late and is characterized by a uniformity of mental experience in the face of circumstances that are usually the cause of depressed mood, despair, great anxiety, self-accusation, or aggression directed against others.
Early diagnosis and targeted treatment can significantly improve the quality of life of the affected person and prevent adverse individual and societal long-term consequences.
Acute suppurative meningitis is still a life-threatening disease that requires rapid diagnosis with immediate therapy.
Despite effective bactericidal antibiotics, mortality has remained constant over the past 20 years.
Only a therapeutic regime that specifically intervenes in the pathogenesis of the inflammation is capable of minimizing neurological sequelae and preserving the patient's life.
In this article, we review the current status of both antibiotic and adjuvant therapy with particular reference to molecular pathophysiologic processes in CNS inflammation.
CT with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaw (dental CT/ denta scan) is the method of choice for radiological examination of the mandible and maxilla.
It is particularly useful in differentiating bony lesions from adjacent anatomic structures.
Therefore, this technique allows precise evaluation of the intricate details of the oral cavity.
The use of this technique allows accurate characterization of pathologies, including infectious, metabolic, congenital, and neoplastic lesions.
In ignorance of the etiology and pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis (IC), causal treatment is currently not possible.
The majority of currently available studies on oral IC therapy were neither randomized, double-blind nor placebo-controlled and thus do not meet the requirements of evidence-based medicine.
Therefore, to date, there is no uniform standard for oral therapy of IC.
We report a 39-year-old Turkish man who developed multiple verrucous papules on his back after a severe sunburn.
Clinic and histopathology show the typical picture of disseminated epidermolytic acanthomas of the skin.
These are benign skin lesions and clinically resemble dyskeratosis follicularis Darier, seborrheic keratoses or plane warts.
Ultrastructurally, the keratinocytes show premature and defective keratinization.
Epidermolytic acanthomas are harmless, acquired skin lesions and must be differentiated from severe, congenital keratinization disorders, which show the same histologic phenomenon of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis.
Today, antifibrinolytic agents are frequently used in cardioanesthesia for procedures with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) to reduce intraoperative and postoperative blood loss.
However, there are concurrent concerns about their potential to trigger thrombotic complications.
Therefore, the present study aimed to compare the efficacy of aprotinin and tranexamic acid on fibrinolysis and thrombin generation during cardiac surgery under ECC.
Imaging diagnosis of manubriosternal joint arthritis in the setting of psoriatic arthritis in a 64-year-old patient is described.
Involvement of the manubriosteran joint (synchondrosis sternalis) is a rare manifestation of psoriatic arthritis.
The findings of skeletal scintigraphy, conventional radiography, and arthrosonography of manubriosternal joint arthritis are demonstrated and discussed.
Between January 1994 and June 1996, 18 patients underwent vitrectomy for endophthalmitis at Leipzig University Eye Hospital.
All patients received intravitreal and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first patient group of the "Endophthalmitis vitrectomy study".
This retrospective work aimed to investigate the functional outcomes of surgical treatment.
Heinrich Heine experienced the episode of a pseudologia phantastica in his childhood.
The conditioning factors of this psychopathological phenomenon are discussed in this paper.
The efficacy and tolerability of sulfasalazine in the early and late forms of juvenile chronic oligoarthritis will be tested, as well as the therapeutic effect depending on the HLA B27 trait.
In the present study, the medical history of a patient with severe obsessive-compulsive symptomatology since the age of 14 is presented.
It is not an independent obsessive-compulsive disorder, but a schizophrenia masked by obsessive-compulsive symptoms.
During therapy of schizophrenic symptoms exacerbating at 31 years of age with clozapine, neither psychotic symptoms nor significant obsessive-compulsive symptoms are found in the one-year history.
While the literature increasingly refers to obsessive-compulsive symptoms as a side effect of clozapine medication, mostly in the indication area of chronic schizophrenic psychoses, the rare case of obsessive-compulsive symptoms ameliorated by clozapine in schizophrenia is described here - as far as the author is aware.
The importance of differential diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive phenomena for adequate pharmacotherapy is discussed using the example of individual cases.
An isomorphic stimulus effect (Koebner phenomenon) is a disease-specific skin response to nonspecific skin stimuli.
The induction of such a Koebner phenomenon in a 32-year-old female psoriasis patient by UV-B light testing with intensities above 0.055 J/cm2 is reported.
Furthermore, the case of a 28-year-old patient is described, in whom new psoriasis lesions developed in the viral florescences after a varicella infection.
Since the affected person was planning to spend several months abroad in Africa, a detailed medical history, clinical and laboratory chemistry examinations were performed.
The presentation was made to rule out oligosymptomatic rheumatic disease, to ask about genetic risk factors for developing such a disease, and to ask whether rheumatoid factors can occur as a vaccine reaction;
Initial experience and results with 13 single-stage reconstructions of large complex defects of the head and neck with 8 microvascular anastomosed forearm grafts and 5 myocutaneous pectoralis major island flaps are reported.
Complete flap losses did not occur in any case.
Better functional and aesthetic results were obtained with the free forearm graft, but the surgical times required for reconstruction were relatively long.
Disadvantages of the pectoralis major flap are mainly poor modelability and a limited radius of rotation.
It has been used in cases where, due to local and general problems, the use of a free microvascular graft would have been associated with greater risk.
The skin is exposed to a variety of exogenous stimuli that can trigger specific inflammatory dermatoses in predisposed individuals.
This typically involves activation of endothelial cells in dermal vessels, characterized by increased expression of adhesion molecules.
This allows the adhesion of circulating immune cells to the endothelium and thus the formation of inflammatory, perivascular cell infiltrates in the affected tissue area.
Whereas the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines was previously considered to be the primary prerequisite for the development of inflammatory responses, evidence has recently emerged that exogenous factors can induce endothelial cells to enter an inflammatory state even without the mediation of cytokines.
Endothelial adhesion molecules can be induced, for example, by chemical or physical stimuli such as changes in metal ion concentration or oxygen partial pressure, as well as by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation or mechanically effective shear forces.
Endothelial cells are therefore not only subject to the control of tissue-own mediators (cytokines, biogenic amines, etc.), but their function can also be directly influenced by external skin stimuli.
Therapy-resistant fibrin reactions in the anterior chamber of the eye, especially after combined cataract/glaucoma surgery, are an indication for local administration of rTPA.
We report our findings.
A case of benign hemorrhagic spindle cell tumor of the lymph node (synonym:
This rare primary benign mesenchymal lymph node tumor occurs almost exclusively in the inguinal region.
Diagnostic criteria include the structure of myofibroblastic cells arranged in sections like palisades (with immunohistological positivity for vimentin and actin), hemorrhagic zones accentuated toward the periphery, and the presence of characteristic amianthoid structures ("amianthoid fibers"), which ultrastructurally correspond to a dense meshwork of collagen fibrils.
Knowledge of this tumor entity is significant for the differential diagnosis of malignant primary and metastatic mesenchymal lymph node neoplasms.
The increased strength of 2 parallel internal splints reduced obstruction and kinking and achieved regression of congestion of the proximal hollow system.
Furthermore, in addition to the flow of urine within the rails, this technique allows increased flow between the rails, which is considered a crucial mechanism of urine passage in recumbent ureteral rails.
In cases of extrinsic ureteral compression in which the insertion of a singular internal splint does not achieve sufficient regression of ectasia of the upstream intra- and extrarenal cavity system, simultaneous insertion of 2 ipsilateral internal double-J ureteral splints should be considered as a technically simple, low-complication therapeutic alternative that may spare some patients the insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomy catheter or more invasive measures.
Of the so-called minimally invasive procedures available for the treatment of lumbar disc herniations (percutaneous endoscopic nucleotomy/APLD/laser decompression/chemonucleolysis), the intradiscal application of chymopapain represents the method with the longest clinical application time and experience.
Long-term studies have shown good clinical results.
With careful attention to the indication and the few contraindications - namely allergic diathesis - chemonucleolysis provides an efficient, low-risk minimally invasive therapy that closes the therapeutic window between conservative and open surgical treatment.
To investigate in a prospective study the value of diuresis sonography compared with the diuresis nephrogram ("gold standard") in children with urinary transport disorders.
Micrographic surgery is now an indispensable therapeutic procedure in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma.
The method has been further developed and modified over the last 20 years.
Currently, there are three variations to choose from:
All three procedures have the same goal:
radical tumor removal while sparing the surrounding tissue that has not been affected.
However, they have significant differences with respect to the technique of tumor excision, preparation of histologic sections, and histologic specimen evaluation.
A methodological inventory is made and differences as well as advantages and disadvantages are presented.
The latency period between primary trauma and malignant transformation is approximately 30 years.
Marjolin's ulcer is characterized by a more aggressive behavior compared to other squamous cell carcinomas.
In a case of a 65-year-old patient with the lesion on the right dorsum of the hand and regional lymph node metastases, we report combined radiation and surgical therapy.
The extensive soft tissue defect after appropriately wide local excision was covered with a retrograde pedicled radial artery flap.
Spinal opioids provide good analgesia for a wide variety of surgical and nonsurgical pain conditions.
Fewer central and systemic side effects occur than with epidural administration of local anesthetics or parenteral opioid administration.
The effectiveness of this technique and the combination of opioids and local anesthetics in postoperative pain management is presented, including in the context of patient-controlled epidural on-demand analgesia (PCA, "patient controlled analgesia").
The intrathecal mode of administration is considered to have several advantages over the epidural mode.
A variety of factors play into the choice of opioid.
It appears that the neurotoxicity of opioids is dependent on different routes of administration.
In terms of quality of analgesia, serious side effects, amount of opioid administered, or postoperative pulmonary function, there is no clinical advantage of thoracic over lumbar injection.
Arguably, there is evidence that the type of pain management has a significant impact on the incidence of postoperative complications.
Epidural analgesia with local anesthetics and/or opioids is the method of first choice for patients at high preoperative risk and is also cost-effective.
Through the cooperation of the German Contact Dermatitis Group (DKG) with the Information Network of Dermatological Clinics (IVDK), the results of standardized epicutaneous tests are centrally recorded at the participating centers in Germany.
For the present study, data from 24 clinics (19678 patients) were retrospectively analyzed separately for 1995 and 1996.
In descending order, nickel, fragrance mix, perubalsam, and thiomersal showed the most frequent reactions;
For 1995, differentiated allergen lists for defined patient groups (according to sex, age, eczema localization, geographic region, occupation, sensitization) and special questions were also prepared.
The percentage of positive reactions for nickel, fragrance mix and Peru balsam was strikingly lower in men than in women.
Younger patients were more likely to react to thiomersal, and older patients to medical externals.
Medical allergens were also frequently positive in patients with leg eczema, whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in hand eczema patients.
Nickel and fragrance mix allergic patients were found to have higher percentages of positive reactions to unrelated allergens compared to the overall population.
However, the relevance of thiomersal reactions was often not apparent.
Differentiated allergen lists can be used to improve quality in the diagnosis and prophylaxis of contact allergies.
In about 95% of all persons infected (in contact) with M. leprae, the disease does not overtly erupt.
The clinical presentation is determined not so much by the direct effects of bacterial infection as by the T-cell mediated immune response.
In this review article, current aspects of the epidemiology, transmission, bacteriology, clinic, reactions, treatment, and diagnosis of leprosy are considered.
Recently, a large number of studies have been presented on the quantitative investigation of the tyndall phenomenon in aqueous humor (KW) using laser tyndallometry.
By measuring the diffusion coefficient of BKS in comparison to the tyndall intensity in KW in uveitides of different localization, we aimed to investigate exemplarily to which extent the tyndall increase is actually caused by a BKS disturbance in each case.
The present experimental study investigates the effect of acamprosate, a glutamatergic modulator, and the lipid peroxidase inhibitor U-101033E on neurological deficit after incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats.
Attempts to bridge nerve defects with so-called nerve prostheses have failed to date.
The use of silicone tubes, polyglactides, caprolactones, and other polyglactin-containing substances has not solved the fundamental problems of nerve regeneration.
The pronounced defense reaction against foreign substances leads to the destruction of the ultrastructural units, which are mandatory for the regeneration of the neurites.
Positive animal experimental results do not stand up to clinical scrutiny because inferior regenerative performance can occur in animal experiments despite an impaired regenerative pathway.
Morbidity from acute and chronic genital infections and their late sequelae constitute the greatest gynecologic risk for HIV-infected women.
Two-thirds of women with HIV infection developed symptoms of genitourinary infections, and one-third developed cervical dysplasia.
One quarter experienced chronic symptoms and late sequelae of ascending genital infections during the course.
Although the increased incidence of cervical carcinoma (up to 5%) has been incorporated into the AIDS case definition, its occurrence is rarely associated with other AIDS-typical opportunistic infections, but it usually occurs before the actual symptoms.
Menstrual disorders such as amenorrhea (17%) or hypermenorrhea were observed more frequently.
Complications of pregnancy are mainly premature labor (up to 15%) and, depending on the social structure, prematurity.
Progression of maternal HIV infection through pregnancy was not observed.
Risks for peripartum transmission of infection to the fetus include advanced maternal HIV infection with high HIV RNA viral load, p24 antigenemia, and CD4+ cell depletion, and obstetric factors associated with delivery such as prematurity, preterm labor, amniotic infection, duration of rupture of membranes and labor, and amniotic fluid contaminated with maternal blood.
These risks of increased maternofetal HIV-1 transmission rates can be avoided by antiretroviral prophylaxis (6-8%), by primary low-contamination cesarean delivery (4-6%), and most successfully by primary sectio and concurrent prepartum, intrapartum, and postnatal administration of AZT (<2%).
Dendritic cells occupy a central position in the initialization of the immune response because they are the most potent subpopulation of the mucosal immune system that can activate T lymphocytes via MHC receptor.
Initial clinical studies in patients with refractory melanoma and lymphoma show that dendritic cells sensitized in vitro with tumor antigen can be successfully used in vivo for immunotherapy.
Since little basic data on the occurrence of dendritic cells in tumor tissue and their function are known for laryngeal carcinoma, the localization of dendritic cells and other subpopulations of the mucosal immune system, such as T and B lymphocytes and macrophages in squamous cell carcinomas of the supraglottis and glottis, was investigated immunohistologically in the present study.
The results show that dendritic cells, in contrast to T lymphocytes, are mainly detectable in the epithelial compartment of squamous cell carcinomas.
Comparison with clinical parameters shows that the patients in whom the number of dendritic cells in the carcinoma was low (<100/cells/mm2) had the lowest postoperative survival (1 year).
This suggests that a high number of dendritic cells in laryngeal carcinoma is a favorable prognostic factor of the disease.
Elevated homocysteine is considered a major factor in the increased incidence of atherosclerosis in patients with chronic renal failure.
In the present study, in addition to homocysteine, metabolites of its two degradation pathways transulfuration (formation of cystathionine, cysteine) and remethylation (formation of methionine, methyl malonate and 2-methyl citrate) were determined in patients with renal insufficiency.
We report 2 cases of cat scratch disease.
This disease is one of the rare causes of lymphadenopathy.
The tentative diagnosis is based on cat scratch history and typical findings with lymph node swelling in the area of the primary lesion.
To gain insight into the frequency and clinic of cold urticaria in Central Europe, an analysis of patients cared for in 1984-94 at a university polyclinic or dermatology practice was performed using patient records and, in some cases, follow-up examinations.
The incidence of cold urticaria was then 0.05%.
Of a total of 56 affected patients (31 women, 25 men), 49 suffered from the idiopathic form of the disease.
Mean age was 41.0 +/- 15.6 years, and mean disease duration was 7.9 +/- 5.8 years.
Atopy was present in 46.4% of patients, and 23.2% suffered from other forms of urticaria (cholingeric, chronic idiopathic, dermographic, aquagenic, and heme-induced urticaria).
Laboratory tests were positive only in isolated cases.
44 patients were treated with antihistamines, with mostly only moderate symptomatic improvement.
During treatment with antibiotics (penicillin 1-2 million IU/d for 2-4 weeks, n=18 or tetracycline 2 g/d for 2 weeks, n=10), full remission occurred in 13 patients and improvement was achieved in 8.
Spontaneous remission occurred in 20 of the symptomatic patients (46.5%) over a 6.5-year follow-up period.
The surprisingly good treatment successes using antibiotic therapy underscore the need for further elucidation of the pathogenesis of this disease, also with regard to a possible infectious cause.
Abstract The case of a 56-year-old female patient who presented primarily with lumbalgia is reported.
Both laboratory, radiological, and histopathological findings were primarily in favor of the presence of spondylodiscitis.
Due to the destruction of the fifth lumbar vertebral body, dorsoventral stabilization was performed.
Histologically, the picture of nonspecific inflammation was found in the repeatedly obtained specimen excisions.
It was not until the biopsy performed in the course of the implant removal that a highly malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma could be detected histologically.
Chemotherapy according to the CHOP regimen and radiotherapy treatment were given.
Spinal lymphoma should be considered as a rare differential diagnosis of spondylodiscitis, especially in progressive courses.
Fractures of the nasoethmoidoorbital complex (NEO fractures) are associated with midface fractures and/or frontobase fractures in over 90% of cases.
Concomitant skull base fractures run through the roof of the ethmoidal cells or the lamina cribrosa in up to 70% of cases.
Different concepts exist for the treatment of isolated NEO fractures and combined NEO and skull base fractures in midface fractures.
In the period 1990-1997, 50 patients with isolated and combined nasoethmoidoorbital fractures were treated at the Clinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Cantonal Hospital Lucerne.
In the remaining 25 patients with NEO and midface fractures without skull base involvement, reduction and treatment were performed via a subcranial approach.
47 patients could be followed up for up to 4 years and their data analyzed.
The Lucerne therapy concept for extra- and transcranial treatment of fractures of the os ethmoidale involving the skull base and midface is presented.
however, it is associated with a high risk of bleeding intra- and postoperatively.
In an obese 50-year-old female patient with familial hypophosphatasia and v. a. phlebothrombosis, a femoral neck fracture was to be surgically treated.
Intraoperatively, there was a sudden drop in end-tidal partial pressure of CO2, an increase in paCO2, and circulatory arrest.
Resuscitation measures with cardiac massage and intravenous application of epinephrine and orciprenaline were initiated immediately.
Under resuscitation conditions, the procedure was completed with a provisional wound closure and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.
If fulminant pulmonary embolism was present, systemic lysis with 100 mg rt-PA was performed with continued chest compressions.
After 21/4 hours of cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 11/2 hours after initiation of lysis, moderately stable hemodynamics were achieved with continuous, highest-dose catecholamine administration and volume substitution.
Massive transfusion was required as a result of lysis and loss coagulopathy.
On the 28th day after resuscitation, the patient could be transferred from the intensive care unit.
The diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was made on the basis of the clinic, capnometry, blood gas analysis, and ECG.
Because of the emergency situation with ongoing resuscitation, further diagnostic procedures were not performed.
During anesthesia with the new inhalation anesthetic sevoflurane, approximately 5% of the total amount delivered is metabolized.
The magnitude of the resulting peak serum levels of inorganic fluoride is determined primarily by the hepatic defluoridation rate, the total amount of anesthetic administered, and the solubility of the anesthetic gas as expressed by its blood-gas partition coefficients.
A large number of experimental and clinical studies have addressed the question of whether fluoride exposure to sevoflurane could lead to increased renal complications.
However, neither in animal experiments, nor in routine clinical use or protracted anesthetic duration, nor when used in renally insufficient patients, could an increased renal hazard potential be demonstrated for fluoride exposure after sevoflurane.
The recently demonstrated low intrarenal metabolism of sevoflurane - in contrast to enflurane and especially methoxyflurane - is considered an important explanation for the lack of nephrotoxicity of sevoflurane.
The threshold value for fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity of 50 µmol/l still used in the literature to date was derived from historical experience with methoxyflurane, but has no validity in connection with the anesthetic gases sevoflurane, but also enflurane and isoflurane.
Fluoride levels, such as those encountered following anesthesia with sevoflurane, can thus be classified as clinically harmless.
There is also no experimental or clinical evidence for direct hepatic toxicity of sevoflurane or its metabolites.
For the morphological analysis of myocardial and vascular changes in ischemic heart disease, the choice of macroscopic preparation method has fundamental importance.
The best results are obtained by base-parallel lamination of the cardiac ventricles after fixation and by transverse lamination of the possibly additionally decalcified coronary arteries, even if postmortem coronary angiography cannot precede.
With this approach, distribution patterns of disseminated myocardial necrosis, length, circumferential, and transmural extent of infarcts, their age, and sequelae can be better recorded and assigned to the respective coronary supply area than with conventional opening of the unfixed heart following the blood flow.
On the coronary arteries, the degree and extent of atherosclerotic stenoses, plaque hemorrhages, parietal and occluding thromboses can be assessed intact, as can therapeutic effects and complications of angioplasty procedures and bypass surgery.
This approach is particularly important in cases of acute cardiac death and territorial ischemia survived only briefly.
By systematically collecting transmural samples for histology, early myocardial damage can be detected in correlation with coronary morphology and coronary supply area.
However, recent prospective randomized trials show that adjuvant postoperative radiation or chemotherapy after R0 resection does not confer an additional survival benefit.
In contrast, the available data on neoadjuvant preoperative therapy for both squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus, esophagogastric junction, and stomach have been inconclusive.
In patients with potentially resectable tumors, several phase III trials have failed to demonstrate a convincing prognostic gain with preoperative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or combined radio/chemotherapy compared with resection alone.
However, survival benefit with this multimodality approach is expected only with response to pretreatment followed by complete tumor resection.
Compared with preoperative chemotherapy alone, combined radio/chemotherapy improves response rates, at least in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, but also results in increased postoperative morbidity and lethality.
Neoadjuvant therapy concepts should thus only be performed in the context of prospective studies on strictly selected patients in specialized centers with sufficient experience.
Carpal tunnel syndrome in childhood is a rarity.
This condition, unusual for childhood, is usually associated only with certain metabolic diseases.
Increasingly, the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders, eating disorders, or "hysterical" symptom formations can be understood as processing traumatic childhood and adolescent experiences such as abuse or maltreatment.
Dissociation with induced depersonalization, derealization, and personification of only good and only bad objects is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience.
Memories of trauma that cannot be assimilated have a retraumatizing effect and must be warded off, for example, through eating disorders, substance abuse, self-injurious behavior, or social "acting out."
On this psychodynamic background we present a trauma therapy that implements experiences of hypnotherapy and catathym-imaginative psychotherapy:
In the preparation phase, a safe inner place and contact with inner helpers is created in the imagination in a resource-oriented way.
The actual trauma work consists of a dosed, stably confronting, but as little as possible retraumatizing approach to the traumatic scenes, followed by inner consolation and leaving behind.
In the final phase, the focus is again on resource-oriented turning to creativity and concrete life planning.
The aim of this study was to record the developments at a state school for the blind and visually impaired over the last 20 years with regard to diagnoses and the proportion of multiple disabilities.
Chronic benign intracranial hypertension can have multiple causes.
Besides the etiologically unexplained occurrence in obese young women ("pseudotumor cerebri"), venous outflow obstruction is a possible cause.
The extent to which visual acuity remains stable in the long-term after vitrectomy for diabetic retinopathy was investigated, and what causes and risk factors for worsening visual acuity could be identified.
HIV is easily inactivated by the majority of disinfectants.
The human infectious dose is about 100 to 1000 HIV particles, depending on the virus and the entry site.
After inoculation, HIV replication may have started after 24 hours, and HIV spreads throughout the body within one to two weeks.
Antibody tests can detect the incipient HIV infection within four to twelve weeks, and the antibody response is weakened under therapy;
with nuleic acid tests, detection is successful from about the eleventh day.
In a nearly 100-year evolution, countless autologous, exogenous, and synthetic tissues have been used to replace the cruciate ligaments of the knee joint.
Among the autologous tissues currently favored, the central patellar tendon third, a quadruple pes anserinus tendon graft (semitendinosus/M. gracilis muscle), and a central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance.
With some limitations, the use of cadaveric grafts is also justified.
Individual grafts have specific differences in terms of biomechanical properties, primary fixation, and healing in the bone canal.
In clinical studies, a clear superiority of one of the mentioned transplants could not be verified.
Graft selection must take into account the different anatomic and functional requirements of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments.
Careful, preoperative planning with modified graft selection, if necessary, is required when treating complex ligament injuries and revision cases.
The rare course of development of myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma of the minor salivary glands of the oral mucosa is presented.
In the course of 2 and 5 years, a pea-sized recurrent tumor developed 2 times in the area of the left corner of the mouth.
Histologic workup showed myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands in each case; portions of pleomorphic adenoma could no longer be detected.
The clinic, diagnosis, therapy, and histologic features with reference to the literature are discussed.
Coronary calcification is indicative of an arteriosclerotic process and can be detected very accurately with electron beam tomography.
The clinical value differs depending on whether calcium screening is performed in patients with already known coronary artery disease or in asymptomatic patients for primary prevention.
Silent myocardial ischemia is a clinically significant aspect of coronary artery disease.
In this paper, frequency, diagnostic and methodological aspects, with regard to ergometry, are presented as well as indications for prognostic evaluation and consequences for practice.
We report 3 patients with a combination of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and type I diabetes mellitus (IDDM) or prediabetes.
In the 3 patients, both diseases occurred in the setting of autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II.
In contrast, we did not observe any case of ITP among approximately 250 children and adolescents with isolated IDDM.
Therefore, in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and type I diabetes mellitus, other diseases from the autoimmune polyendocrinopathy type II group should be excluded.
Securing the airway after upper airway surgery can be problematic in certain patients.
Therefore, care must be taken to ensure safe reintubation when necessary.
Reported are two patients who had significant intubation difficulties due to papillary thyroid carcinoma recurrence and inoperable hypopharyngeal carcinoma, respectively, and thus had high-risk factors for intubation and possibly reintubation under general anesthesia.
A fiberoptically placed endotracheal guide wire served as a postoperative or preoperative reintubation aid.
Both CT and MRI are indispensable additional examinations for the diagnosis and staging of tumors of the larynx.
A very precise knowledge of submucosal tumor spread pathways, diagnostic signs of tumor infiltration, and their consequences for staging and therapy are indispensable for CT and MRI interpretation.
Both CT and MRI are highly sensitive studies for detecting neoplastic infiltration of the pre-epiglottic space, paraglottic space, subglottis, and cartilage.
However, specificity with both methods is less than initially expected, resulting in a tendency to overestimate tumor spread.
The very high negative predictive value of both cross-sectional imaging techniques is important from a clinical point of view, as it allows the exclusion of neoplastic cartilage infiltration.
In the presence of submucosal tumors, both CT and MRI provide valuable information regarding possible etiology, extent of submucosal growth, and appropriate biopsy site.
Cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implantation reduces cardiovascular mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias.
Patients with ESRD have an increased incidence of coronary artery disease.
Only small numbers of cases are available on myocardial revascularization by PTCA in patients requiring chronic dialysis, suggesting an overall high periinterventional complication rate and a high restenosis rate.
We studied the restenosis rate in 23 ESRD patients (17 men, 6 women, mean age:
52.5 +/- 18.3 years).
After primary successful PTCA, all patients underwent recoronary angiography within 6-12 months.
Before angiographic control, 12 patients complained of recurrence of pectanginal symptoms.
Laboratory chemistry revealed hypertriglyceridemia (265 +/- 160 mg/dl) and hypercholesterolemia (258 +/- 53 mg/dl) with low HDL fraction (34 +/- 14 mg/dl) with marked increase in fibrinogen concentration (481 +/- 114 mg/dl).
The case of a 64-year-old female patient is described who developed complete pelvic instability within one year as a result of increasing fatigue fractures of the anterior and posterior pelvic rings.
The precipitating event was retrospectively assumed to be a minor trauma to the pelvic region.
Due to the radiographic morphology of the multiple pseudoarthroses, the suspicion of a malignancy was initially at the forefront of the differential diagnosis.
Hip pain in childhood can be caused by a wide range of different medical conditions.
Emphasis is placed on non-traumatic causes in differential diagnostic considerations.
Depending on age, medical history, clinic and laboratory parameters, a diagnostic imaging algorithm is designed in order to avoid unnecessary examinations on the one hand and not to miss necessary therapeutic steps on the other hand.
Through exemplary examples, some common, as well as rarer, clinical pictures are demonstrated.
Iatrogenic break-off of the greater trochanter during prosthetic treatment of femoral neck fracture appears to be a rare complication.
The osteoporotic bone of the often elderly patients and the maximum internal rotation of the leg during prosthesis implantation from the so-called "posterior approach" could be predisposing factors.
In the few literature sources, early functional conservative treatment is recommended for the isolated traumatic trochanteric dislocation used for comparison here, even with significant fragment dislocation.
The value of patient satisfaction in psychotherapy care continues to be controversial.
This paper presents the role of the construct in the interplay between effectiveness, economy, and acceptance of therapeutic interventions.
After an overview of different methods for measuring patient satisfaction, three validity aspects of patient satisfaction are examined in more detail using data from quality assurance.
Using the ZUF-8, relationships between patient satisfaction and treatment outcomes, patients' continued utilization behavior, and aspects of the therapeutic working relationship are examined.
This shows that the relationship between treatment outcomes and satisfaction is not particularly strong.
In the further utilization behavior, dissatisfied patients differ from satisfied patients.
The correlation between satisfaction and the therapeutic working relationship is here partly clear for individual aspects of the working relationship.
The effects found are very large in relative terms, but in absolute terms these effects turn out to be rather small.
This is mainly due to the fact that very few patients express dissatisfaction following their treatment.
Changes in the aging process in men resemble changes in younger, hypogonadal men.
Although testosterone levels on average decrease with age, correlations between middle-aged and older complaints and testosterone levels are inconsistent and low.
This is due, among other things, to methodological limitations of existing studies, the high variability of testosterone levels with age, unclear reference values for older men, and multiple influences (health status and behavior) on testosterone levels.
A 68-year-old patient with dyspnea for five days underwent sonography before planned lysis therapy after nuclear medicine evidence of stage II-III pulmonary embolism.
This revealed a right atrial floating thrombus.
In the presence of acute vital danger, ultrahigh-dose streptokinase short-term lysis (UHSK) with 9,000,000 units of streptokinase over 6 hours and parallel intravenous anticoagulation with heparin was initiated.
After 3 cycles, the transit thrombus had completely resolved and the thrombosis of the leg had largely resolved.
The patients treated were predominantly male (70.6%) with an average age of 36.6 years and were mostly injured in traffic accidents.
Single fracture was found in 50% of the patients, the remaining patients had either concomitant injuries or polytrauma.
Hospitalization time averaged 17 days and crutch use averaged 21 weeks, indicating a relatively rapid recovery.
In the majority (85%), treatment proceeded without complications.
Chronic posttraumatic osteitis developed in 9 (1.8%) cases in patients with open fractures and in only 2 cases (0.4%) in patients with closed fractures, which is within the usual norms.
Based on our results and experience, we believe that the treatment of fractures of the femoral diaphysis with osteosynthesis plates and screws is a good method and has comparable results compared with other treatment methods.
The extent of distant metastasis diagnosis in head and neck tumors remains controversial.
In the present retrospective study, the courses of 1087 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract were used to investigate the factors that influence the frequency and location of distant metastasis.
A total of 130 patients (12.0%) were diagnosed with distant metastases during their lifetime, including 17 times (1.6%) at the time of primary tumor diagnosis.
The distant metastasis rate correlated positively with the initial tumor stage (p<0.00001) as well as with the manifestation of a local and/or regional recurrence (p<0.00001) or a second tumor outside the ENT region (p<0.0005).
In contrast, the parameters 'primary tumor location' and 'histopathological tumor grading' had no independent predictive value, but essentially reflected different frequencies of tumor stages.
At the time of initial diagnosis, the search for distant metastases in T1-3 N0 tumors may be limited to chest radiography.
Further diagnostics, consisting of abdominal sonography, skeletal scintigraphy, and/or computed tomography (CT) of the thorax, are indicated for locoregionally advanced tumors, recurrences, and second tumors outside the ENT region.
However, the question of the therapeutic consequences should always be asked in each individual case.
This article briefly reviews the history of spine surgery from the end of the 19th century to the present day.
Ernst Simmel belonged to a small circle of early psychoanalysts who, with great enthusiasm and in "productive orthodoxy," strove for the clinical application of psychoanalytic principles in medicine.
Consequently, he is the founder of a first psychoanalytic polyclinic in Berlin in 1919 and of a first psychoanalytic hospital ("Sanatorium Schloß Tegel") in Germany in 1927.
Furthermore, rediscovering him as a pioneer can be understood as an attempt to overcome the trauma of National Socialism with the consequences of various historical divisions in the professional societies.
He is a credible professional identification figure across generations, especially for the new specialist in "psychotherapeutic medicine."
Nevertheless, the emphasis on Simmel should not lead to the fact that the approximately 60 other pioneers of a psychotherapeutic medicine, who had to leave Germany forcibly because of their Jewish descent, are no longer commemorated properly.
Basically, 4 posttraumatic conditions of the proximal femur can be influenced by osteotomies:
Recurrent hip dislocations and subluxations, femoral head necrosis, pseudarthrosis, deformities.
Clinical, survey radiographic, and computed tomographic/sonographic analysis of leg geometry is of central importance in this regard.
Given the variety and complexity of post-traumatic conditions of the proximal femur, only a perfectly tailored solution can be the answer to a very individual problem.
The aim of the study was to metaanalyze all available randomized controlled trials in which dexamethasone was used alone or in combination with other antiemetics for the prophylaxis of nausea and vomiting in the postoperative period (PONV).
Scleritis and episcleritis can occur in the setting of numerous systemic diseases.
In certain cases, subjective symptoms and visus-threatening complications can be addressed in the long term only by systemic immunosuppression.
Movement disorders of the vertebral joints lead to unilateral compression and rotation of the intervertebral disc.
Since the herniated disc occurs on the side of compression in more than 80% of cases, a causal relationship can be assumed.
Since this disruption also reduces the size of the intervertebral foramen, the space constraint becomes even greater in the case of disc herniation.
Treatment of the disorder is recommended.
This operation, developed for malignant changes in the area of the pancreatic head, is very extensive and burdened with a high perioperative morbidity as well as lethality.
The aim of this study was to determine whether the more organ-sparing duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection is also a sufficiently radical procedure for benign tumors of the pancreatic head.
This operation could be performed in patients without blood loss and almost without complications.
At a median follow-up of 3 years, 6 of 7 patients were symptom-free; one patient operated on for gastrinoma was still found to have elevated gastrin levels late postoperatively.
Compared with preoperative functional testing, both endocrine and exocrine function were found to be only slightly affected by surgery.
Thus, when strictly indicated, benign tumors in the area of the pancreatic head can be treated adequately by duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection, with sufficient radicality, few complications, and without permanent restriction of exo- and endocrine functions.
Modern pacemaker therapy is considered a safe and reliable procedure in the treatment of symptomatic and/or prognostically significant bradycardic arrhythmias.
Approximately every sixth patient dies of sudden cardiac death after pacemaker implantation, which is predominantly due to progression of the pre-existing underlying cardiac disease.
In recent years, however, it has also become clear that permanent electrical stimulation of the heart may carry the risk of triggering and/or aggravating life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.
Particularly in advanced myocardial damage, stimulation-related R-on-T phenomena, "short-long" sequences, and perceptual defects, for example, during ventricular arrhythmias or transient myocardial ischemia, can trigger stimulation-related secondary life-threatening tachyarrhythmias, among others.
Considering that such pacemaker-related events are a preventable cause of sudden cardiac death, an improved understanding of the pathomechanisms involved and a corresponding awareness should be the best prerequisite for making modern pacemaker therapy not only more reliable but, above all, even safer for the patient.
Staging, i.e. determining the extent of the disease, is used to select patients suitable for surgical therapy with curative goals, or to define those carcinoma carriers who do not benefit from surgical intervention and are referred to alternative forms of therapy (chemotherapy, radiotherapy).
Computed tomography (CT) of the thorax (including liver and adrenal glands), sonography of the upper abdomen, and skeletal scintigraphy are the standard radiologic examinations for staging bronchial carcinoma.
For specific questions, e.g., the one following thoracic wall infiltration, and in patients with an allergy to contrast media, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be performed in addition to or as an alternative to CT.
Nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography with [18F]2-flouro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG-PET) for the evaluation of lymph nodes and distant metastases, In-111-octreotide/somatostatin scans for staging/diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma, and thallium-201 SPECT, the clinical value of which is currently being evaluated in numerous studies, are also increasingly used for staging lung tumors.
Methods that are currently still being tested in experimental studies, such as genetic molecular MRI contrast agents or nuclear medicine methods based on tumor re optors, may play an important role in the staging of bronchus carcinoma in the future.
After tumor surgery in the abdomen, retroperitoneum and pelvis, damage to the nerves and vessels of the sexual organs may occur.
Since these are often patients of sexually active and also reproductive age, particular importance is attached to the prevention of such concomitant symptoms during tumor therapy.
Impairment of erection or disorders of ejaculation may occur after surgical, radiotherapeutic or drug therapy of various tumors.
With a thorough understanding of neuroanatomy and modern surgical techniques, these disorders are now preventable in a high percentage.
If damage to the corresponding nerve tracts cannot be avoided due to the radical nature of the surgical intervention required to treat the tumor disease curatively, sexual dysfunction is a significant limitation of the quality of life for these patients of sexually active and also reproductive age.
However, both ejaculatory dysfunction and erectile dysfunction can be treated by a number of therapeutic modalities in almost all cases.
The subclavian artery is increasingly used for arterial cannulation during extracorporeal circulation.
Little is known to date about the perfusion characteristics of neck vessels at different cannulation sites.
A truck driver after crush trauma to both legs who developed atypical heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) while on drug thromboprophylaxis with unfractionated heparin is reported;
in addition to thrombosis, he showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin with thrombocyte increase with positive antibody detection to heparin:
At our first patient contact on the 6th day after the accident, deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and a threatening compartment syndrome was also surgically split on the left lower leg.
After exclusion of possible other causes for these reactions, antibodies against heparin (heparin-platelet factor-4 complex detection) were detected 2 days later.
Immediately after flushing an intravenous line with less than 50 IU of an unfractionated heparin 36 days after the accident, the patient showed the full pattern of an anaphylactic reaction, which was immediately broken by cortisone administration.
We postulate that thrombocytopenia, which is otherwise characteristic of HIT, is only one of the possible forms of allergic reaction to heparin.
The cause of thromboembolic complications is an antigen-antibody reaction to heparin that occurs on the cell surface of thrombocytes.
Accordingly, a proposal is made for a new classification of the various forms of heparin allergy types I-IV.
Type I and II correspond to the previous HIT I and II. Type III is the antibody reaction without thrombocyte drop and type IV is the antibody reaction with general allergic symptoms.
Basal cell adenocarcinoma was included as an entity in the 2nd edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) "Histological typing of salivary gland tumors" in 1991.
The initial description is due to Ellis u. Wiskovitch (1990) of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP).
This tumor entity accounts for approximately 2.9% of all malignant tumors of the salivary glands.
The gl. parotis is the seat of this tumor in 90% of cases.
Enoral manifestations are described only as casuistry;
The case presented here involves a middle-aged woman with basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate.
Therapy consists of surgical tumor extirpation with a sufficient safety margin and histologically controlled tumor freedom of all resection margins.
Basal cell adenocarcinoma is associated with a local recurrence rate of 25-50% and a predominantly lymphogenic metastasis rate of 10% occurring up to 10 years after initial manifestation, according to current knowledge.
The 10-year survival rate is 75%.
In the present work, a modified animal model of renal xenotransplantation was developed within which the course of hyperacute rejection is highly reproducible.
In this model, guinea pig kidneys were transplanted as donor organs to Wistar rats as recipient animals, using end-to-side vascular anastomoses with donor aorta, or vena cava, and ureteral drainage by splinting for diuresis monitoring.
The aim of the present study was to analyze the protective effect of complement modulation using soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) on renal xenografts.
A total of 24 xenografts were performed and randomized to treatment with 3 ml 0.9% NaCl (control group), or 50 mg/kg sCR1 as a 3-ml bolus (treatment group).
Soluble complement receptor type 1 (sCR1) was effective in prolonging graft survival (from 10.5 +/- 2.1 min in the control group to at least 2 h in the treatment group) and its function.
Serologically, a significant reduction in complement activity was detected in the sCR1 group, which was attributed to a modulatory effect of sCR1.
As early as 10 min after the start of reperfusion, histological evidence of platelet aggregates, fibrin deposition in capillaries, and interstitial infiltrates was seen en masse in the control group.
In contrast, kidney grafts treated with sCR1 showed significantly reduced intravascular thrombus formation and less interstitial infiltration after 120 min.
The immunohistochemical study suggested an equally decreased deposition of C3 in the glomeruli and interstitium in the therapy group.
To date, 52 laparoscopic gallbladder, gastric, colon, and inguinal hernia procedures have been performed in our hospital using the robotic arm for optic guidance controlled by the surgeon's voice.
The field of view is directly determined by commands from the operator.
In all interventions, the control of the robotic arm was precise, the speech recognition accurate and without technical problems.
29 procedures could be performed by one surgeon alone as "solo surgery".
In another 20 procedures, only one assistant was used in addition to the surgeon.
The robot can be easily and successfully used by any laparoscopic surgeon and in any operating room.
Clarification of vascular complications by DSA in renal and pancreatic transplantation requires invasive intervention in usually diabetically pre-damaged vessels, and the use of iodine-containing contrast agents may show nephrotoxic effects.
The possibility of a specific genesis of joint infections and spondylitis must be included in the differential diagnostic considerations.
This is demonstrated by a case of coxitis tuberculosa, which was treated in cooperation between the Department of Trauma Surgery and the Medical Clinic of the Minden Hospital.
A differentiated diagnostic approach with imaging and microbiological methods allows targeted planning and implementation of combined therapy consisting of surgical endoprosthetic hip replacement and antituberculous chemotherapy.
After critical evaluation of the therapeutic outcome and discussion of the literature, the presented procedure is successful in terms of both local remediation of the infection and functional outcome.
Atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients.
Methods for safe and effective treatment of these arrhythmias are currently the subject of intense investigation.
Internal electrical cardioversion is an effective nonpharmacologic treatment option for atrial fibrillation.
Electrical atrial cardioversion is used clinically without a clear understanding to date regarding the mechanisms underlying the procedure.
Recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using advanced optical mapping techniques have shown that internal cardioversion shocks lead to changes in cellular repolarization that favor disruption of the wavefronts underlying AF.
Thus, the mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to those of ventricular defibrillation.
Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the cardioversion mechanisms in chronic AF differ from those in acute AF.
Neurologic complications of clavicle fractures are rare.
They occur as primary lesions, more often as secondary lesions;
Weeks to months after the accident due to excessive callus formation with narrowing of the costoclavicular space.
Casuistically, the observation of a late lesion of the brachial plexus due to a clavicle fracture with pseudarthrosis and excessive callus formation is reported.
Diabetes mellitus type I belongs to the autoimmune diseases and often occurs together with other autoimmune diseases.
The object of our investigations was to determine the coincidence of celiac disease and type I diabetes in the patient population of the diabetes outpatient clinic of the Children's Hospital of the TU Dresden.
A granulomatous inflammatory reaction after use of absorbable interference screws for fixation of a patellar tendon graft in anterior cruciate ligament arthroplasty resulting in spontaneous fracture of the tibia is reported.
Radiologically, osteolysis was seen in the area of the inserted screws.
Histologically, there was sterile inflammation with evidence of foreign body giant cells.
Prim‰re plasmocytomas of the kidney represent a groﬂe rarity‰t.
So far, only 6 clinical F‰lle have been described in the literature.
Presented is a 64 yr old patient in whom an operated renal tumor was histologically found to be a plasmacytoma.
This case is used to discuss the procedure for this condition.
In multiple myeloma with renal involvement, nephrectomy is indicated only for renal complications.
The prognostic significance of primary‰renal involvement by plasmacytoma is unclear.
A multicenter, prospective, clinical study from 17 German hospitals was conducted to select a treatment indication or procedure appropriate to the fracture type in 646 documented adult distal radius fractures.
The success of primary treatment was evaluated by creating a practice-based score.
To date, numerous genodermatoses and acquired skin diseases are known to follow the pattern of Blaschko lineages.
In 1992, Moulin et al. described.
[40] 5 patients with acquired striate, atrophic, and pigmented skin disease, which he found to be a new entity.
We report another patient with this dermatosis.
The essential criteria are striate skin atrophy with hyperpigmentation, without inflammatory antecedents and without subsequent sclerosis or other abnormalities.
The disease develops in children and young adults and follows the pattern of Blaschko lines.
We propose the name "Atrophodermia linearis Moulin" for this disease.
It includes rules of conduct and, to improve the muscular situation, a special exercise program that can also be performed safely as home training.
In a group instruction, coordination improvement and joint protection are trained by practicing simple movement sequences and basic knowledge about anatomy, arthrosis development and knee-friendly and relieving behaviors is imparted.
The efficiency of the "knee school" as a treatment concept for arthroscopically treated gonarthrosis was proven in a prospective randomized study.
Correct alignment and size of the implants is of outstanding importance for successful and durable knee joint replacement.
The effects of each component on the femoropatellar joint segment are presented.
In the Erlangen Glaucoma Study, the blue-on-yellow VEP has been shown to separate confirmed patients from confirmed controls.
Within the framework of a retrospective analysis of air rescue, the out-of-hospital first aid of 274 acutely injured (58%) or ill (42%) children up to 14 years of age was first examined. The retrospective analysis of the out-of-hospital care of 274 acutely injured (58%) or ill (42%) children up to the age of 14 years was based on emergency medical documentation and examined with regard to the time of deployment, compliance with the response time, age and gender distribution, severity, trauma causes and injury patterns, type of acute pediatric illness, prehospital emergency diagnostics and therapy, means of transport, and destination hospital.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the Orthopedic University Hospital in Mainz has been reviewing the clinical pictures in which low-energy extracorporeal shock wave therapy can be usefully applied.
The composition of bone marrow changes with age, but also with pathological processes.
As a basis for the interpretation of patient examinations in diseases of the hematopoietic system, the age- and sex-dependent changes in the proton spectrum from the bone marrow space were analyzed in the present study in volunteers.
Therapy monitoring is currently not possible in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and condition after cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.
Therefore, patients without an actual tendency to recurrence are sometimes unnecessarily exposed to an antiarrhythmic therapy regimen and thus to the risk of proarrhythmic side effects.
A mandatory prerequisite of P-wave analysis under sinus rhythm is an exact validation of the method.
P-wave triggering must be performed, and filtering of the P-wave must be performed bidirectionally or with an FIR filter.
A standardization of the method is urgently desirable.
Indeed, patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation differ significantly in P-wave duration from patients without this arrhythmia.
Sotalol, as a class III antiarrhythmic drug, does not affect P-wave duration, but spectral analysis of the P-wave is significantly different.
In conclusion, after optimization of the method, signal averaging of the P wave allows identification of patients with a high probability of recurrence of intermittent AF.
The chronic form of murine experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU) shows similarities to human chorioretinitis.
Every patient has the right to pain therapy according to the current state of knowledge.
A prerequisite for efficient pain therapy is knowledge of the genesis of pain.
In most posttraumatic pain, peripheral nociceptors are activated and nociceptive afferents are conducted through an intact nervous system.
In contrast, neuropathic pain is based on injuries to the nervous system.
Central sensitization mechanisms at the spinal cord level and sympathetic nervous system involvement can lead to chronification of such pain.
Therapy of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is presented using treatment algorithms.
In addition to classic non-opioid analgesics, coanalgesics and opioid analgesics are firmly established, especially for chronic pain.
Defined pain therapy standards must be followed when prescribing these substances.
Blockades with local anesthetics as monotherapy for chronic pain are obsolete today.
For post-traumatic pain, on the other hand, a defined series of peripheral nerve blocks or trigger point infiltrations may be useful as adjuvant measures.
Sympathetic blocks are particularly important in the diagnosis and treatment of sympathetically maintained pain (SMP).
The value of irradiation of the pelvic lymphatic drainage system in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is unclear.
Prospective studies on specific questions are not available or are methodologically controversial (RTOG 75-06 and 77-06).
In T3/4 carcinomas, additional irradiation of the para-aortic lymphatic drainage pathways compared with irradiation of the pelvic lymph nodes alone does not improve overall survival or progression-free or tumor-specific survival and is obsolete.
Data on long-term side effects are only available from studies using outdated irradiation techniques.
Radiation therapy of the lymphatic drainage pathways in lymph node-positive prostate cancer is not a standard therapy but an individual decision and should be performed in the context of studies (e.g., ARO 95-3).
However, because of the ambiguity of the clinical picture, only the pathomorphologic examination allows a reliable classification of the underlying disease process and thus a critical review of the indication for appendectomy.
In the following, the pathomorphologic criteria of acute appendicitis as well as its special forms are presented and especially the importance of neurogenic appendicopathy in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis is emphasized.
An uncomplicated primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax or a pneumothorax caused by accidental puncture of the pleura can usually be definitively treated by thin-gauge drainage.
In contrast, large-bore Bülau drainage is indicated for complicated pneumothorax.
The often acutely life-threatening tension pneumothorax with its typical clinic, e.g. in ventilated patients, must be relieved immediately before further diagnosis.
A hematothorax due to thoracic or abdominal trauma should be rapidly managed with a Bülau drain and, if necessary, surgically treated because of the risk of severe blood loss.
Spontaneous hematothorax also requires drainage as well as internal medicine evaluation.
The physician in an internal medicine intensive care unit must be proficient in the diagnosis and treatment of pneumothorax and hematothorax.
The question of this prospective single-case observational study in 12 ICU patients was whether routine determination of procalcitonin (PCT) in ICU patients adds information to clinical findings, routine laboratory investigations, microbiology, and radiology.
Similarly, lethality, overall injury severity, the likelihood of bleeding complications, and the proportion of concomitant pelvic injuries are also increased.
Complex pelvic injuries, i.e., pelvic injury with concomitant peripelvic soft tissue and organ injuries and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femur fracture (floating hip) represent a special situation.
Hemodynamic stabilization of the patient and treatment of organ lesions are the main focus of interdisciplinary therapy here.
Acetabular fractures present a special challenge as articular fractures.
Surgical therapy with anatomic joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has the best long-term results.
As the number of these additional pathologies increases, the long-term outcome worsens.
Primary accidental cartilage damage appears to have a significant impact on long-term outcome after acetabular fractures.
Isolated calcifying atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta with almost complete filling of the aortic lumen caused symptoms typical of aortic isthmic stenosis in a 56-year-old female patient.
What is remarkable about the case described here is both the atypical and isolated localization of the disease in the descending thoracic aorta and the extent of the calcifications.
Baseline findings on angiography and computed tomography (CT) of the thorax suggested differential diagnosis of calcifying aortic tumor, secondary calcified wall dissection, or expired aortitis.
The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regulates photoreceptor lipid metabolism by catalyzing outer segments and is exposed to blood lipid regulation via choroidal perfusion.
Because uptake of cholesterol and phospholipids occurs via specific low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, expression and regulation of this receptor type in the RPE were investigated.
With reference to the change in educational and social structures, the medical habilitation as an academic qualification has also been questioned recently.
In the discourse on the application and developments of reproductive techniques, the experiential aspects of those affected are relegated to the background.
Help outside of medical treatment is sought by many only at a time when they are exhausted or very disappointed by unsuccessful attempts at treatment.
The skeleton is among the most common metastatic sites in metastatic breast, prostate, and bronchial carcinomas.
The decision on systemic therapeutic procedures depends on histology, evidence of extraskeletal metastases, and the patient's general condition.
In receptor-positive breast carcinomas and in prostate carcinoma, hormone therapy is the treatment of first choice.
Chemotherapy is indicated for receptor-negative breast carcinoma, after failure of hormonal therapy, or when liver metastases are detected.
Chemotherapy should always be given for small cell bronchial carcinoma.
Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinomas are amenable to radioiodine therapy.
In metastatic non-small cell lung cancer or renal cell carcinoma, the indication for systemic therapy is rather cautious and is mainly limited to younger patients and patients in sufficiently good general condition.
Difficulties exist in imaging a response of bone metastases to systemic therapy.
Newer methods for determining bone resorption products in urine may prove valuable.
The differential diagnosis and treatment of childhood back pain with radicular symptoms or nerve extension pain should be investigated.
The risk of contracting HIV occupationally is often subjectively considered to be high.
This attitude ignores the fact that other viral diseases are much more common and also more contagious.
Hepatitis B, for example, is now the most common occupational disease in the medical field.
The most important measure in the prevention of nosocomial viral diseases is exposure prophylaxis.
Another important measure is vaccination; for example, there is a clear recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination of hospital employees.
Post-exposure combined active and passive vaccination is performed for injuries with HBV-containing material.
There is no drug post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis C.
Early therapy with interferon when HCV RNA is detected appears to have a high success rate.
In specimens from a lung biopsy obtained by videothoracoscopy, a 26-year-old woman was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
Pulmonary changes had resulted in recurrent pneumothoraces.
Two years earlier, a right renal tumor had been removed and diagnosed as angiomyolipoma.
Immunohistochemical studies with actin antibodies showed strong-positive reactions in both the muscular differentiated tissue of the angiomyolipoma and in the smooth muscle proliferates of the lung.
The specific search for further pathological organ changes led to the detection of a previously asymptomatic intracerebral malformation in the left frontal brain measuring up to 5 cm in diameter.
Polytopic organ manifestations and histomorphologic findings of benign mesenchymal predominantly myoproliferative neoplasms in the kidney, lung, and probably brain ultimately led to the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis.
The international discussion of assisted suicide issues, as well as developments in Australia and Oregon, point to an increasing tendency to favor physician-assisted suicide over active killing - not least for reasons of social acceptance.
The 1994 decision of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands on assisted suicide by a psychiatrist gives reason to examine this issue from a psychiatric perspective.
Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator for the regulation of biological processes in many organs.
In this study, histochemistry and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the localization and distribution of the two constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (bNOS and ecNOS) in 14 normal nonobstructive and 12 hyperplastic obstructive human prostate specimens.
Both by NADPH-diaphorase (d) reaction and immunohistochemistry, differential nitrinergic innervation of the prostatic glands, stroma, and vessels was demonstrated.
In the preparations with obstructive hyperplasia, there appears to be a marked reduction in nitrinergic innervation, although quantitative evaluation has not yet been performed because of the small number of preparations.
In the endothelium, differential expression of NOS depending on the vessel section could also be detected by NADPH-d reaction and immunohistochemistry.
However, the NADPH-d reaction could not be confirmed immunohistochemically in the region of the glandular epithelium with the specific antibody.
The distribution of NO synthases suggests a high importance of nitric oxide in the regulation of smooth muscle, regional blood flow and secretion of normal and hyperplastic prostate.
Because of heterogeneous patient groups and multiple causes of ileus, surgical indications and surgical procedure selection for small bowel ileus are difficult to standardize.
A uniform approach to intraoperative bowel handling (stripping, insertion of bowel splint) and abdominal wall closure (technique, suture material) would be desirable.
Adhesiolysis remains the most common surgical procedure.
Surgical techniques of small bowel plication continue to be used (in a relevant minority of clinics), with Noble's operation largely replaced by Child-Phillips' plication and its variants.
Due to the lack of controlled studies, there are no established indications or contraindications for either plicatures or long probes and other surgical procedures.
Given the frequency and socioeconomic importance of small bowel obstruction, it remains an important task for the future to change this.
The public's demand for information and transparency in the highly sensitive field of human reproductive medicine seems more than justified.
Only the reliable evaluation of the results obtained by reproductive medicine and their public discussion can allow to increase its social acceptance as a safe and successful form of treatment, and at the same time prevent misunderstandings.
Moreover, such an analysis is a valuable tool for reliable counseling of the affected couples.
Gait characteristics and decreased muscle strength of depressed individuals have often been described in the clinical literature, but have rarely been studied empirically.
We recorded various gait and strength parameters using simple and standardized procedures within a theoretical framework based essentially on classic clinical observations of depression.
Twenty hospitalized depressed subjects were studied using standardized isometric strength tests and gait analyses recording stride length, average walking speed, maximum walking speed, and 3-min walking distance and compared with 20 healthy subjects.
The examination procedure was repeated after 3 weeks of inpatient treatment and significant improvement of symptoms.
Significant improvements at the end of the third week of therapy could be demonstrated especially in knee and elbow extension and also in all gait parameters examined.
The methods used for the first time for psychiatric questions in the present pilot study are suitable for the reliable and low-burden investigation of relationships between depression and motor function and can thus be used in broader studies.
Iridodonesis is the clinical symptom of a subluxated lens.
In this case, an acute glaucoma attack in the sense of a ciliolenticular block may occur or a chronic glaucoma may exist.
YAG iridotomy or basal iridectomy rarely result in pressure regulation.
We report the results after cataract surgery for subluxatio lentis and glaucoma.
In 12 patients with progressive scleroderma (PS), the influence of autogenic training (AT) on plasma levels of neuropeptides, substance P, and vasoactive intestinal peptide was studied.
Compared with healthy controls (N), the scleroderma patients possessed significantly increased substance P plasma levels (x +/- s:
PS patients 7.1 +/- 3.2 pmol/l, N 1.6 +/- 1.6 pmol/l).
VIP plasma concentrations showed no significant differences from normal values, except for selective deviations (x +/- s:
PS patients 10.7 +/- 7.1 pmol/l, N 12.0 +/- 5.3 pmol/l).
We describe 2 unrelated German male patients with typical symptoms.
Both showed progressive neurological deterioration, severe mental retardation, signs of dysostosis multiplex, and storage phenomena in lymphocytes by 3.2 and 4 years of age, respectively.
The -L-fukosi- dase activity in leukocytes and fibroblasts was severely decreased (<3% of normal).
To date, the G401X mutation has not been detected in any other population.
Thrombi in the right atrium are a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ventriculo-atrial shunt systems.
We report a 4.6-year-old girl who presented for hospital admission with signs of subacute valve dysfunction.
Coagulase-negative staphylococci and elevated CSF protein were detected in the CSF.
The thrombus had to be removed by cardiac surgery.
The Keto-Diabur Test 5000 (Boehringer Mannheim) is a rapid test for the determination of glucose and ketone bodies in urine.
With this routine test, strong positive results for ketones were obtained in the autopsies of three individuals who had clearly died as a result of freezing or hypothermia, without concomitant elevation of urinary glucose.
Using headspace gas chromatography, excessive acetone concentrations of 140, 1004, and 2703 mg/L were detected in all three urine samples.
Thus, a strongly positive keto-Diabur test 5000 with normal urinary glucose findings may serve as a diagnostic aid to detect death due to hypothermia.
A prospective study of 94 patients with traumatic hemarthrosis of the knee is being conducted to determine the extent to which magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide information about the underlying source of bleeding and thus provide clues for the therapeutic approach.
Infantile acrolocalized syndrome (Gianotti-Crosti syndrome) is described in association with various infectious diseases.
In an 8-year-old girl, eruptive symmetrical papules and papulovesicles appeared on the extremities.
Viral serology indicated a fresh Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) primary infection; in contrast, serology was negative for hepatitis B virus.
TMJ dislocations occur as a result of trauma, articulation disorders, and changes in the muscular balance of the masticatory muscles.
The previous classifications are primarily based on the anatomical positional relationships of the dislocated temporomandibular joint surfaces such as dislocation, subluxation, and disc dislocation.
Etiologically, a distinction is made between traumatic and non-traumatic dislocations.
TMJ dislocations have been described as a complication in a number of neurological disorders.
Based on the case report of a patient who suffered recurrent temporomandibular joint dislocations as a complication of multiple sclerosis and the successful treatment of these dislocations with botulinum toxin, we justify the introduction of the term neurogenic temporomandibular joint dislocation.
Port-wine stains can cause significant psychosocial distress.
The present study investigated a) the coping behavior, quality of life, and body experience of patients with port-wine stains and b) the effects of pulsed dye laser therapy on psychosocial parameters.
A test psychological examination on the areas of coping with the disease, quality of life and body experience was carried out on 70 patients with port-wine stains as part of the therapy with the flash-lamp pulsed dye laser.
The clinical target criterion was the degree of lightening of the port-wine stain during the course of therapy.
Patients with port-wine stains showed comparably high stress levels with regard to social anxiety as patients with chronic skin diseases.
These correlated with size and darkness of the port-wine stain.
With regard to helplessness and anxious-depressive mood, patients with fire marks had significantly lower distress.
Impairments were also found in areas of quality of life and body experience.
Body experience is differentially influenced by illness coping.
Since lightening during the course of laser therapy correlates significantly with decreased psychosocial stress, flash lamp-pulsed dye laser therapy for port-wine stains can also be considered effective with respect to psychosocial factors.
The gastrointestinal tract is the organ most commonly affected by extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma (PGIL) represents a distinct disease entity because its biological behavior, prognosis, and treatment are different from nodal lymphomas.
Imaging techniques are important in the search and staging of PGIL.
Gastrointestinal lymphomas show a variety of pathohistologic appearances and a wide spectrum on imaging.
The increase in PGIL requires knowledge of the clinical and radiologic picture and therapeutic options.
A 43-year-old man had a nevus sebaceus in the area of the right temple since birth.
Histopatholo- gic examination revealed 2 adnexal neoplasms associated with the lesion:
a syringocystadenoma papilliferum and a trichoblastoma.
The combined occurrence of these 3 entities is described here.
The diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction has traditionally been based on history (typical nitrorefractory pain), ECG changes (ST elevations, T-wave changes, appearance of Q-waves, new onset left bundle branch block), and elevated levels of the "classic cardiac enzymes" creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB (WHO criteria).
Hypothyroidism is among the most important causes of reversible dementias.
This case report demonstrates the relatively rapid remission of dementia in a patient over 80 years of age that occurred within a few months.
At present, it is not so much the cross-sectional psychopathological picture as the therapeutic course of the disease that allows differentiation between primary degenerative dementia with concomitant hypothyroidism and dementia secondary to hypothyroidism.
In a 73-year-old patient with generalized atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and renal artery stenosis, a left subclavian artery aneurysm near its origin was successfully eliminated by implantation of a balloon-expandable JOSTENT© Peripheral Stent-Graft.
Follow-up over one year showed a very good long-term outcome with freely perfused stent lumen and completely obliterated aneurysm.
A control computed tomography scan revealed a completely thrombosed aneurysm sac.
Intravascular ultrasound showed no evidence of neointima hyperplasia within the stent.
Pyoderma gangraenosum was first described as a distinct entity by Brunsting, Goeckermann, and O'Leary in 1930.
Nevertheless, as early as the first half of the 19th century, there are illustrations in an atlas work by Marie Nicolas Devergie that almost necessarily suggest Pyoderma gangraenosum.
Devergie's "Clinique de la Maladie Syphilitique" contains casuistics of various forms of syphilitic affections of the skin as well as individual illustrations of gangrenous ulcers, which occurred completely unexpectedly under the mercury therapy in use at the time.
The rapidly enlarging ulcers were interpreted by Devergie as side effects of this escalating therapy with mercury, since they healed spontaneously after it was discontinued.
Thus, clinical descriptions and illustrations of Pyoderma gangraenosum can be found more than 100 years before it was first named.
However, the etiology of this clinical picture has not been adequately clarified to date.
Thus, the theory of a primarily bacterial genesis of Pyoderma gangraenosum persisted in several publications well into the 1960s.
Rapid awakening and rapid recovery of cognitive function are among the essential selection criteria of anesthetics for outpatient procedures.
The present study addresses the question of whether recovery of cognitive function is more rapid after TIVA with remifentanil/propofol (P/R) than after balanced anesthesia with sevoflurane/fentanyl (S/F).
Consistent estradiol concentrations as in the early follicular phase are achieved.
In oral estrogen replacement therapy, estradiol must be dosed 40-fold higher than in TTS treatment to achieve effective, yet highly variable, drug levels with supraphysiologic peaks and subnormal troughs.
The high estrogen doses with oral administration are necessary because of the marked estrogen metabolism that occurs during liver passage.
What is the value of ultrasonography of the fetus and newborn in the diagnosis and treatment planning of meconium peritonitis.
We describe an 18-month-old boy with congenital vitium cordis, small bowel atresia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphia, and psychomotor retardation who has partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8.
To measure the exercise capacity of patients with cystic fibrosis and to record exercise-dependent changes in oxygen saturation were the aims of the present study.
The reason for updating the WHO classification of urothelial lesions or tumors of the urinary bladder was to better reflect the biology of the various lesions as well as to make a sharper distinction between benign and malignant urothelial processes.
The significance for diagnostics and clinic in everyday life, taking into account current immunohistochemical findings, is critically reviewed.
Papillary urothelial lesions include papillomas, papillary urothelial neoplasms of low malignant potential, and papillary carcinomas.
Flat urothelial lesions include flat hyperplasia, atypia (reactive or of uncertain significance), dysplasia, and carcinoma in situ (CIS).
Long-term follow-up studies must show whether this subdivision is justified.
The present study attempts to show correlations between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammatory course of patients after cataract surgery.
Some neuropathic pain syndromes can be treated by intervention on the sympathetic nervous system.
One speaks then of a sympathetically entertained pain.
Typical disorders with a sympathetic pain component are the complex regional pain syndromes (sympathetic reflex dystrophy and causalgia), the territorial neuropathic pain syndromes, and acute herpes zoster.
There is a significant correlation between sleep quality and mattress quality for individuals with chronic sleep and back problems.
Routine diagnostic work-up for renal cell carcinoma staging includes multiphasic abdominal spiral CT and chest X-ray.
In the case of unclear spiral CT findings in the question of intravenous tumor extension, contrast-enhanced MRI can be a valuable diagnostic alternative.
The primary indications for renal MRI represent patients with absolute or relative contraindication to nonionic radiographic contrast agents, patients in the stage of compensated (not yet requiring dialysis) renal insufficiency, and patients with symptomatic polycystic kidney degeneration.
Conventional cavography is obsolete in the era of (multislice) spiral CT venography and MR venography.
The most common injuries to the eye in childhood are chemical burn, burn, eyelid injury, erosio corneae, corneal foreign body, eyeball contusion, blow-out fracture, penetrating eye injury, endophthalmitis, and traumatic retinopathy.
The number of serious eye injuries is about 12 per 100,000 population/year.
Thus, they represent the most common cause of unilateral blindness in childhood.
Known risk factors for childhood eye injury include age (<5 years), gender (male > female), and parental care.
The prognosis regarding visual rehabilitation after eye injuries is influenced by psychosocial factors (compliance with the use of visual aids or taping of the eyes for amblyopia prophylaxis) in addition to a rapid and adequate therapy.
Deficits and imbalances of the spine-stabilizing musculature are considered significant somatic risk factors for the occurrence of back pain.
Therefore, the preservation and restoration of the full capacity of the muscles stabilizing the spine must be the goal of prevention and rehabilitation, in addition to the training of coordinative skills and the learning of a spine-appropriate behavior.
In addition to the various pain therapy measures, physiotherapy treatment techniques including neurophysiological-based procedures, physical-balneological measures and supplementary behavioral training, medical training therapy represents an important procedure in the treatment of lumbar syndromes.
Medical training therapy encompasses the use of principles and methods of practice-oriented training theory and training science within medically indicated prevention and rehabilitation measures.
In its phase structure, different therapy goals, but especially the positive adaptation of the neuromuscular system according to the rehabilitation process, are presented.
The indication and monitoring of medical training therapy are medical tasks.
According to the underlying disorder and the course of therapy, therapy goals and treatment concept are adapted in cooperation between physiotherapists and treating physicians.
The surgical indication for spondylolisthesis results from pain, progressive slippage, and, in up to 60% of patients with advanced dislocation, radicular dysfunction.
Posterolateral fusion in situ is a low-risk procedure, but deformity persists and plastic deformation of the osseous spondylodesm may occur with further progression of sliding in spondyloptosis.
With the external fixator as a reduction instrument and the internal fixator for stabilization, the reduction of severe slips and the restoration of a normal spine and trunk shape with acceptable neurological risk is possible today.
Therefore, a treatment concept is proposed that, in addition to stabilization and nerve root decompression, also aims at anatomical reduction of the slipped vertebra in every case.
Depending on the extent of sliding, reduction and stabilization should be performed in 1, 2, or 3 surgical steps.
Dorsal or ventral fusion alone is sufficient for grade 1 dislocations.
For grade II and above, combined dorsoventral spondylodesis is recommended.
The aim of the evaluation study, selected results of which are reported in this article, is to assess the impact of a gerontological psychiatric center (GZ:
a combination of outpatient service, day clinic and counseling for the elderly) to the transformation process from "intramural" (inpatient) to "extramural" (day-clinical and clinical-ambulatory, i.e. home-based) regional care structures, as called for and justified in detail by the Federal Government's Commission of Experts, for the first time to be subjected to empirical testing.
On the basis of comprehensive cross-sectional and longitudinal data, changes in the regional care substructures of gerontological psychiatry (subsystem A), general medicine (subsystem B) and geriatric care (subsystem C) are analyzed by comparing the care region of the city of Bielefeld (without GZ) with that of the district of Gütersloh (with GZ).
With regard to subsystem A, the study shows that a CC has considerable influence on the intended structural form of intra- to extramural care, without segregating its clientele according to type and severity of mental disorder.
One effect of the GZ on the system of care for the elderly (subsystem C) is possibly expressed in the fact that in the Gütersloh service region the rate of institutionalization after clinical inpatient treatment is significantly lower than in the Bielefeld control region.
A 62-year-old female patient developed eosinophilic cellulitis of the right arm with systemic signs (fever, leukocytosis) and massive limitation of motion in the right shoulder joint.
Sonography and computed tomography demonstrated edema of skin and adipose tissue as well as extensive fluid collections around the deep muscle fasciae, in the interstitiae, and, to a lesser extent, in the shoulder joint.
Systemic corticosteroid therapy rapidly resulted in healing of the skin lesions, and in the further course also in restoration of mobility in the shoulder joint.
The case described was the first to demonstrate involvement of structures close to the joints in the context of eosinophilic cellulitis using modern imaging techniques.
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin/cyclophosphamide allows breast-conserving treatment for larger tumors that are not suitable for primary breast-conserving treatment.
The regression of the tumor can be monitored with mammography, ultrasound or MRI.
The good reproducibility and availability speak in favor of mammography.
Tumors that cannot be delineated by mammography can usually be visualized by sonography.
In MRI, tumor extension presents independently of the structure and density of the mammary parenchyma.
It additionally allows the detection of functional parameters. - The determination of the extent of tumor residues after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is limited with all available methods, since microscopic invasive and especially noninvasive tumor residues can hardly be detected.
These do not regress even with regression of the invasive tumor and typically indicate intraductal, noninvasive tumor residuals.
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system.
The disease presents clinically with symmetric paralysis, areflexia, and marked autonomic dysfunction.
Respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for transferring a patient with GBS to the ICU.
This report uses the example of a 33-year-old patient with Miller-Fisher syndrome (MFS), a special form of Guillain-Barré syndrome, to discuss the treatment of full-blown GBS in the intensive care unit.
Stent implantation without pre-expansion appears to be able to immediately create and thus prevent an emerging dissection in morphologically suitable stenoses.
Neurosurgical therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD) are experiencing a worldwide renaissance, building on advances in basic research.
Thus, for the first time, a two-pronged functional model specifies the pathophysiological significance of individual basal nuclei, making them potential targets for neurosurgical procedures.
its pathological disinhibition is caused, among other things, by overactivity of the nucleus subthalamicus (Nst).
Trial lesions of these nuclei have been successfully tested in the MPTP-damaged patient. - In the clinic, lesional as well as restorative and stimulative procedures are currently used.
The previously used techniques of pallidotomy and thalamotomy have become more precise thanks to better neuroradiological and -physiological target localization.
The former technique is used to treat rigor, hypokinesia, and drug-induced dyskinesia; the latter procedure has proven effective in treating tremor.
Only fetal cell transplantation has been documented to produce new sprouting of dopaminergic neurons and increased striatal dopamine release;
but the procedure raises ethical and immunological problems.
High-frequency continuous stimulation of single basal ganglia is the most recent procedure and is characterized by reversibility and adaptability as well as low morbidity.
The most common is the stimulation of thalamic nuclei for the treatment of tremor;
The animal approach includes xenotransplantation and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent stem cells.
However, many years of comparative studies between the individual procedures are necessary in order to be able to determine the ideal (combination) therapy of the future.
Subacute encephalopathy with epileptic seizures in patients with chronic alcoholism (SESA syndrome) is a rare alcohol sequela, along with more common conditions such as delirium tremens, alcohol withdrawal seizure, Wernicke-Korsakow syndrome, central pontine myelinolysis, and Marchiafava-Bignami syndrome.
Multiple neurologic deficits (hemiparesis, hemianopsia, or aphasia), recurrent focal and generalized epileptic seizures, and periodic side-onset steep potentials on EEG have been described in this syndrome.
A 72-year-old patient with chronic alcohol abuse was admitted after multiple secondary generalized focal seizures of the right side of the body with a suspected diagnosis of encephalitis.
Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of gamma-GT and MCV.
CCT and cerebral MRI showed microangiopathy and cerebral atrophy.
Despite intravenous treatment with acyclovir and vitamin B1 and 3-drug anticonvulsant therapy, epileptic seizures and deterioration of general condition continued to be observed.
Several EEG studies revealed periodic steep left parietooccipital accentuated waves.
Three months after the onset of symptoms, the patient died of pneumonia.
The described clinical picture corresponds to the criteria of SESA syndrome.
Solitary basal cell carcinoma in childhood and adolescence without association with basal cell nevus syndrome (BZNS), xeroderma pigmentosum, organoid nevus, or following radiotherapy is very rare (86 cases in the world literature to date).
Etiologically, it could be an abortive form of BZNS or the result of a somatic point mutation of keratinocytes.
Studies on repair mechanisms of UV-induced DNA damage are not yet available in these patients.
A 10-year-old boy with solitary nodular basal cell carcinoma of the right infraorbital region is reported.
Neither the history nor the clinical examination gave evidence of a genetic predisposition to basal moment development.
An immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed in 604 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using iliac crest biopsies to compare morphological and clinical findings and to clarify the effects of interferon (IFN) and chemotherapy.
Based on the morphometric analysis, significant correlations between the number of CD61+ megakaryocytes including their Vorl‰ufer cells with fiber density could be calculated.
This finding reflects the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts with respect to the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis development.
This was already evident in about 28% of patients at the time of diagnosis.
In a ‰similar manner, the number of CD68+ macrophages was correlated with the amount of Ret40f+ nucleated erythropoietic prel‰ufer cells, which may be related by the involvement of this cell line in iron metabolism, H‰moglobin synthesis, and degradation of the exuded normoblast nuclei.
The (-D-galactosyl residue-expressing) pseudo-Gaucher cells could beﬂen detected in 30% of biopsies before treatment.
Furthermore, significant relationships could be calculated between a reduction in erythropoiesis or an increase in fibrosis with clinical parameters such as H‰moglobin level, the percentage of myelo- and erythro-normoblasts in peripheral blood, and spleen size.
These variables obviously characterize more advanced stages of CML.
According to our morphometric evaluation, classification into three different histologic subgroups was performed:
Corresponding h‰matological data were associated with this simplified histological classification.
Sequence biopsies of 173 patients receiving monotherapy with IFN, hydroxyurea (HU), or busulfan (BU) showed a fibrogenetic effect of IFN in contrast to a more fiber-reducing property of HU.
The dynamics of myelofibrosis development and the corresponding changes in the main cell lines during treatment can be best illustrated by a calculation of indices.
These included the ratio of quantitative differences of each variable in the repeated withdrawals and the associated temporal differences.
Thus, in patients with complete h‰matologic remission after IFN administration, regeneration of erythropoiesis was evident along with an increase in the number of CD68+ macrophages including their activated subpopulation.
The histologic subgroups revealed a transition from both a granulocytic (non-fibrous) and megakaryocytic (non-fibrous) subtype to a myelofibrotic group in about 40% of the patients.
This ph‰nomenon was in contrast to a numerical m‰ﬂual reduction of myelofibrotic type mainly in patients receiving HU therapy in 17 cases (36%).
Taken together, the striking heterogeneity‰t of bone marrow findings in CML requires careful morphological evaluation of biopsies with appropriate methods to calculate relevant correlations between clinical data and thus gain better insight into the dynamics of disease development.
125 consecutively admitted patients in a medical-geriatric unit were to be diagnosed with respect to mental disorders using a naturalistic design.
On the basis of the clinical examination as well as the scores in the Mini-Mental State Examination (2), 51 ill patients were judged to be uninvestigable.
The remaining 74 patients were evaluated clinically and with screening scales (Geriatric Depression Scale (11);
Dementia development was detected or ruled out by neuropsychological testing, if applicable.
Mental disorders of illness value (mostly adjustment disorder or depression) were found in 41 patients, and in more than half of these the disorder was relevant to overall treatment in the hospital.
The screening instruments used proved to be reliable, so that they can be recommended for further use.
However, it remains open how the therapy of the mental disorder required for every 5th to 6th patient according to this result can be ensured in the setting of a medical-geriatric department.
Inflammatory involvement of the sacroiliac joints is the key symptom of spondyloarthropathies, especially in ankylosing spondylitis.
Conventional imaging diagnosis of sacroiliitis is considered problematic in the early stages because the sensitivity of conventional radiographs is very low here.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joints is capable of detecting both acute inflammatory and chronic changes at all stages.
Possible disadvantages of this method are investigator dependency, lack of standardization so far, and the still relatively high costs.
Therefore, the "Working Group Imaging Diagnostics in Rheumatology of the Regional Rheumatology Center Berlin", which is composed of experienced rheumatologists, skeletal radiologists and orthopedists, has developed an overview of imaging diagnostics of sacroiliitis, in which, in addition to the clinical background, technical details are also elaborated and radiation exposure and cost-effectiveness are considered.
Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (Job's syndrome, Job's syndrome, Buckley's syndrome) is a rare disorder of the immune system that can show characteristic manifestations in the ENT.
The clinical picture is characterized by recurrent urticarial exanthema, fever, lymphadenitis, hyperplasia of lymphoid organs, and bacterial skin and organ infections.
Highly elevated IgE concentrations in serum in the absence of evidence of allergic and parasitic diseases are diagnostic indicators.
Therapeutically, treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) proved to be excellently tolerated and well effective.
More than one year after the one-time therapy, the symptomatology is persistently improved.
The current state of knowledge and available therapeutic options in hyper-IgE syndrome are presented and discussed.
In hyper-IgE syndrome, a therapeutic trial with IVIG should be a first-line option.
This paper presents outcomes after laparoscopic "floppy Nissen" fundoplicatio in 70 patients using quality-of-life data 3 years after surgery.
The individual subdimensions of the GLQI record corresponding point scores.
More than 98% of all patients rated the success of the operation as very good or good and would undergo another antireflux operation if necessary.
Persistent but not quality-of-life-impairing side effects of surgery were reported by 4 patients.
No patient required repeat antireflux drug therapy.
Laparoscopic refundoplicatio was necessary in 2 cases within the first 3 postoperative months because of persistent dysphagia.
The effectiveness of surgical therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease using laparoscopic "floppy nissen" fundoplicatio can be documented and demonstrated in the longer term not only by objective findings but also by the patient's subjective assessment and measurement of quality-of-life data.
The clinical symptoms with neuroglucopenia are indicative, and the inadequately high insulin and C-peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the starvation test is conclusive.
Standard surgery is enucleation of the tumor or, depending on size and location, resection.
The treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia, which are burdened with a high recurrence rate, is problematic.
Subtotal resection plus enucleation appear superior to selective tumor removal.
In malignant insulinoma, usually with liver metastases, aggressive surgical therapy with liver resection and debulking, chemoembolization, and systemic chemotherapy are options.
Any form of active euthanasia is punishable under § 216 StGB;
it is also ethically unjustifiable from a medical point of view.
This is not changed by the various tendencies to make "killing on demand" exempt from punishment in Germany under certain conditions, as is the case in the Netherlands.
Nutrient components as well as nutrient-independent trophic factors influence both proliferation and differentiation of different cellular components of the intestinal wall.
The resorptive mucosa must be mentally distinguished from immunologically active cells of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).
Glutamine is the main oxidative energy substrate of enterocytes and an essential supplier of synthetic nitrogen.
This importance of glutamine is particularly evident in the critically ill.
The amino acids arginine and ornithine are important for the eutrophy of immunocompetent intestinal cells, especially as starting substances for NO and polyamine synthesis.
Fermentable carbohydrates are bacterially fermented in the lower intestinal segments to mainly the short-chain fatty acids acetate, propionate and butyrate.
Among other things, these exert a trophic effect on the colonic mucosa by improving blood flow.
Among the food-independent substances, it is mainly the hormones gastrin and enteroglucagon as well as various growth factors that contribute to the maintenance of a eutrophic mucosa.
The following article examines the effects of chronic stress on physical and psychological well-being.
By using a diary as a measuring instrument, it was possible to identify individual assessments of situational factors influencing nursing care on the one hand and stress-promoting factors in the nursing process on the other.
The results show large individual differences with regard to the evaluation of the stress factors as well as their effects on the physical and psychological well-being.
Continuous fractures of the talus are often overlooked and must always be considered as a differential diagnosis in acute and chronic ankle pain.
Early diagnosis enables differentiated treatment options and thus significantly influences the long-term outcome.
A computed tomography (CT) scan is indispensable for a definitive diagnosis and for the indication of the therapy to be adopted.
Dislocated fractures treated conservatively, as far as presented in the literature and according to own experience, lead to pain and limitation of movement and thus in the long term to arthritic remodeling of the subtalar joint.
In the indication for a surgical procedure, however, it can be seen from the sparse literature that large fragments should be refixed anatomically to allow healing without consequences.
Comminuted fractures and small dislocated fragments should be resected, although the long-term course cannot be assessed due to possible altered joint mechanics.
Although the etiology of urticaria remains largely unexplained, there are a number of recent findings on the basic pathomechanisms and causes of the disease.
Thus, an increase in dermal mast cells and an upregulation of endothelial adhesion molecules and cytokines can also be detected in unaffected skin and increased P-selectin in serum, indicating a systemic activation of the cutaneous inflammatory system in urticaria.
In cutaneous mast cells, we further demonstrated activating point mutations of mast cell growth factor receptor c-kit in lesional skin mast cells in adult indolent mastocytosis but not in childhood forms.
Acute urticaria, in contrast to common belief, is rarely based on IgE-mediated allergies (0.9%), whereas associated acute respiratory infections (39.3%) and drug intolerance (9.2%) are more common.
In chronic urticaria, on the other hand, pseudoallergies to food (73%) and, less frequently, chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (11%) usually play a role, with long-lasting remissions when the triggers are avoided (diet) or eliminated.
In contrast, autoantibodies in chronic urticaria are mainly secondary and not disease-causing.
Scapulothoracic dissociation (SD) is a complex injury to the shoulder girdle, most commonly associated with vital threatening injury patterns in the setting of polytrauma.
The 3 case reports are intended to show the variability of possible injuries along with scapulothoracic dissociation.
The diagnostic and therapeutic options and procedures are described for this relatively rare injury, most of which can only be treated in trauma centers.
The 3 cases are reproduced in the chronological sequence of polytrauma management, and the differentiated possibilities of care are pointed out.
Reports of previous working groups in the context of multicenter studies with only a small patient collective show that it is problematic to recognize homogeneity and thus to define it as standards. The currently valid guidelines for this are explained, with cross-references to the management together with the mostly polytraumatized and accordingly vital threatened patients.
In a retrospective study, the prognostic relevance of e-cadherin in papillary thyroid carcinoma was analyzed.
Of 74 of these 78 patients, the postoperative course is known to be 2 months to 35.2 years (median 3.6 years;
Weak or negative e-cadherin expression (<= 20%) was found in higher T stages, and there was increased synchronous lymph node and distant metastases.
In statistical analysis, e-cadherin expression (<= 20%/ > 20%), synchronous distant metastasis (M0/pM1, cM1), and radicality of surgery (R0/R1, 2) were found to be prognostically relevant.
Our data support a prognostic significance of e-cadherin expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
Measles, mumps, and rubella are becoming more of a threat to adults as the age peak shifts.
The MMR combination vaccination is an effective method of preventing this disease and its sequelae.
With 2 times of consistent MMR vaccination, measles and mumps can be eliminated and rubella embryopathy can be made a disease of the past.
The goal of the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adulthood (ILSE) is to determine indicators of healthy and satisfied aging in both middle and older adulthood.
A comparison of age groups revealed personality differences in neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness.
Regional comparisons revealed personality differences in the areas of neuroticism, openness, and conscientiousness, as well as in subjective well-being.
Significant interactions between age group and region emerged for openness and in some subtests of the cognition measure and in physician judgment.
Intra-abdominal abscesses originate from an intra-abdominal organ in over 80% and the majority arise after abdominal surgery.
In terms of anatomy, they are divided into intraperitoneal, visceral, and anterior retroperitoneal space-related abscesses.
Today, sonographically or CT-guided percutaneous abscess drainage is a low-complication and effective procedure with a success rate of approx. 80% when the indication is defined.
Liver abscesses are predominantly treated interventional, pancreatic, splenic and Crohn's abscesses almost always surgical.
Specific infectious diseases with intraabdominal abscess-like conglomerate tumors (tuberculosis, actinomycosis, amebiasis) are diagnosed late because of their rarity and offer pathologic-anatomic, diagnostic, and therapeutic features.
Since the mid to late 1980s, different research groups have attempted to improve the prediction of preterm birth in preterm infants through immunological diagnostics, particularly cytokine detection.
However, it proves to be a disadvantage that this prenatal diagnostics can so far only convince from the amniotic fluid, i.e. by amniocentesis, but not from the serum of the pregnant woman.
The reason for this is that the placental barrier is almost impermeable to cytokines, as demonstrated in the placental perfusion model.
Another disadvantage of cytokine diagnostics is the high variability of individual biomediators.
Therefore, attempts were made to establish other detection methods or to develop a cytokine pattern.
It is possible that cytokine detection from the pregnant woman's cervix, guided by PCR technology, is a viable avenue for the future.
The load of the internal fixator for the spine was measured with instrumented implants in 10 patients for different activities.
The highest loads were found during walking and lateral flexion during standing.
During ventral flexion of the upper body, implant loading changed only slightly.
No higher fixator loads were measured in sitting than in standing.
There is therefore little to be said against allowing patients in whom the spine has been stabilized mono- or bisegmentally to sit as soon as they are allowed to stand up.
Additional ventral stabilization with bone chips often significantly changed the loading of the bisegmental implants.
Especially in patients with degenerative instability, it was often much higher after ventral stabilization than before.
A corset or girdle did not reduce the implant load.
It is therefore not necessary to fit patients with a brace after mono- or bisegmental stabilization of the thoracic or lumbar spine.
Meningiomas are among the most common intracranial tumors in adults.
The so-called atypical meningioma was additionally included in the revised version of the WHO classification for tumors of the central nervous system in 1993 and is intended to denote meningiomas with an increased tendency to recur compared to usual meningiomas.
Because the same qualitative histologic criteria are given for this meningioma as for anaplastic meningioma, a purely histologic diagnosis appears to be fraught with some uncertainty.
We searched for other prognostically relevant parameters:
Using the morphometrically determined nuclear area-based Ki-67 (MIB1) index, 95% confidence intervals could be calculated for meningiomas of all 3 grades (N=160), which proved to be valid when compared with the "recurrence"-free intervals.
Histologically, so-called atypical meningiomas are characterized by a poorly structured, "syncytial" growth pattern and large prominent nucleoli.
Optional nuclear pleomorphism, necrosis and mitotic figures were found.
Cytogenetically, apart from the typical loss of a chromosome 22 and nonsystematic clonal changes, the so-called atypical and anaplastic meningiomas showed distal piece loss on the short arm of a chromosome 1 (1p-) in 50% of cases.
Histochemically, we demonstrated that in meningiomas the tissue nonspecific form of alkaline phosphatase (ALPL), whose structural gene is located on 1p, can be used as a progression- and recurrence-associated marker enzyme (loss of enzyme activity in 30/39 intermediate and 8/8 anaplastic meningiomas).
Instead of the term "atypical", which is ambiguous in clinical practice and may give rise to misinterpretation in connection with tumor grading, we propose the term intermediate-type meningiomas for this group of relatively recurrence-prone tumors, which lies between the usual and the anaplastic meningiomas.
The articular process fractures occupy a special position within the mandibular fractures due to the special anatomical situation.
Computed tomography and MRI have significantly improved diagnostics.
Surgical treatment is indicated for severely dislocated or luxated fractures.
The preauricular, subimandibular, perimandibular, retromandibular, and oral approaches have been established as surgical approaches.
Only functionally stable methods, such as the miniplate or lag screw, should be used to fix the fragments.
To analyze the diagnostic value of contrast-enhanced biphasic spiral CT compared with native and SPIO-enhanced MRI in patients with V.a. focal liver lesions before possible liver surgery.
We report the manifestation of malignant porocarcinomas, multiple precancerous keratoses and basal cell carcinomas, and palmoplantar keratoses after treatment of psoriasis vulgaris 30 years ago with arsenical CSF Fowleri (Fowler's);
In addition, a Laugier-Hunziker-Baran syndrome was diagnosed as an incidental finding.
Background and Question.
Despite the great importance of dermatoses in sub-Saharan Africa, dermatology is woefully underrepresented in the basic health services established there.
To investigate the long-term effects of a dermatology project integrated into the primary health care system in relation to the prevalence of skin diseases.
Growth velocity and its possible influence by cyanosis and body time volume in children with cyanotic heart defects are presented.
The objective of the study was to determine acute and long-term outcomes after cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) within and outside a single critical care hospital.
The PhotoDermVL allows a wide range of individually selectable treatment parameters due to the variability of wavelength spectrum, pulse duration, pulse sequences and energy densities.
Both superficial and deeper vascular malformations (essential telangiectasias, nevi flammei, erythrosis interfollicularis colli, spider nevi, cavernous venous malformations) and cosmetically disturbing hypertrichoses can be successfully treated with this high-energy flash lamp.
Breast carcinoma metastasis is the most common malignant intraocular tumor in women.
The aim of the study was to determine the incidence, identify risk factors regarding the occurrence, and evaluate the benefit of early therapy of this initially predominantly asymptomatic tumor manifestation.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a potentially life-threatening disease in acute relapse.
Even with the use of potent immunosuppressants, severe systemic courses are often hardly controllable.
In addition, numerous therapy-induced side effects occur during the course of the disease, which is often controlled with high doses of steroids in combination with other immunosuppressants.
We report 2 cases of acutely exacerbated systemic lupus erythematosus that were barely controlled even by administration of high doses of prednisolone and cyclophosphamide/azathioprine.
Both cases were treated with IgM-enriched high-dose intravenous immunoglobulins in addition to the immunosuppression performed.
In both cases, the initial high-dose immunosuppressants (prednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and azathioprine) could be phased out to minimal maintenance therapy.
After each of 9 cycles of therapy, patients remained free of symptoms during the 1-year follow-up period while receiving minimal maintenance immunosuppressive therapy with prednisolone.
Our observation shows that IgM-enriched immunoglobulin preparations are suitable for the therapy of systemic lupus erythematosus.
10-25% of all school-age children complain of recurrent abdominal pain, making it one of the most common complaints in childhood.
Nevertheless, our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete in many areas.
The long-wave UV A light emitted by a Wood lamp (340-450 nm, Max.
365 nm) is mainly used in the diagnosis of dermatoses associated with typical fluorescence (tinea capitis, erythrasma, tinea versicolor, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, porphyrias and pigmentary changes).
In addition to the detection of systemically administered drugs (tetracycline), fluorescence under Wood's light has been applied in the application control of topicals by the addition of fluorescent markers.
Endocardial mapping is possible when hemodynamically tolerable and monomorphic forms are induced during programmed ventricular pacing.
The most important component of localization diagnostics is the identification of critical parts of the circular excitation by stimulation maneuvers ("entrainment mapping") and analysis of the "post-pacing" interval.
In clinical occurrence and induction of only singular ventricular tachycardia, acute success with termination and suppression of inducibility is possible in about 60-70% of cases by radiofrequency current catheter ablation.
This success rate is much lower in multiple forms of ventricular tachycardia.
In about 20-30% of cases, recurrence must be expected.
Incessant ventricular tachycardia and frequent ventricular tachycardia after implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator are indicated for early catheter ablation.
Currently, catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia is a complementary therapeutic procedure to drug treatment and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator.
It is expected that the effectiveness of this method can be further improved in the near future by new mapping and ablation techniques.
From 1/1/1985 to 12/31/1995, the influence of the number of dissected lymph nodes on tumor staging and local recurrence rate was retrospectively studied in 386 patients with UICC stage I-III rectal carcinoma after conventional surgery and R0 resection of the tumor.
In univariate analysis, we found a significant association between the number of dissected lymph nodes and the number of affected lymph nodes, and concomitant significant increase in UICC stage III (p = 0.013) and pTxpN2 category (p = 0.000).
A significant reduction in the local recurrence rate as a function of the number of dissected lymph nodes was demonstrated only for UICC stages I and II.
In the overall hospital population and in multivariate analysis, the number of dissected lymph nodes had no effect on the local recurrence rate.
Our results show that the reduction in local recurrence rate in UICC stages I and II is not due to a therapeutic effect, but to stage shifting in the context of more accurate tumor staging.
This indicates the influence of other surgically modifiable factors, especially total mesorectal excision for the development of locoregional recurrence.
In echocardiography, uniform standards for the documentation of findings have been lacking up to now.
However, these standards are necessary to enable comparability of findings and to ensure optimal electronic communication of findings so that the requirements for quality assurance in echocardiography are met.
Declining incidences of active tuberculosis in industrialized countries have pushed this disease out of the consciousness of many.
Nevertheless, tuberculosis continues to be the most fatal infectious disease worldwide.
In industrialized countries, factors such as immigration movements, increasing impoverishment, and the increase in immunocompromised patients, particularly from the HIV epidemic, contribute to maintaining a reservoir for tuberculosis.
Cicatricial pemphigoid (CP) is a rare autoimmune disease associated with subepidermal blistering and scarring that manifests on the skin and mucosa.
Ocular involvement is present in approximately 70% of patients.
Aortic root abscesses have long been recognized in the literature as a relatively common and serious complication of endocarditis (2, 17, 18).
The detection of these abscesses by echocardiography has been described previously by Mardelli (12) and others (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16).
Although asymptomatic courses have been reported in endocarditis, as in other diseases (18, 19, 20, 21), clinically asymptomatic abscesses have not been reported.
The wealth of knowledge that has accumulated about interleukin-7 (IL-7) in the few years since it was first described is increasingly touching areas of dermatology.
Due to its special effects on the immune system, IL-7 is particularly prominent in 2 areas of dermatology:
First, sufficient knowledge exists to suggest IL-7 as an interesting immunotherapeutic agent, particularly in combating melanoma.
A first pilot study with IL-7 gene-modified autologous tumor cells for the treatment of metastatic melanoma is therefore currently initiated by the authors.
On the other hand, IL-7 is produced by keratinocytes and seems to be able to significantly influence the residence and growth of normal T cells as well as lymphoma cells in the upper layers of the skin.
The purpose of this review is to outline molecular, immunological, and preclinical properties as well as perspectives for potential applications of IL-7 in dermatology.
To investigate whether high-dose administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA (gadodiamide, Omniscan) is suitable for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and whether dynamic studies at this dose allow assessment of response to preoperative chemotherapy.
This paper aims to make a conceptual contribution to the construct of everyday competence.
Following an introductory discussion of reasons for increased attention to everyday living skills in gerontology, a first section outlines six research streams relevant to everyday living skills:
In a second part, two influential models of everyday competence, those of Margret Baltes and Sherry Willis, are presented and discussed.
In a third part, an integrative conception of everyday competence is presented, which interlocks aspects of the six research streams with essential elements of the two everyday competence models.
A number of experimental studies and randomized clinical trials show a decrease in local tumor control with increasing total treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy.
The most likely cause of this time factor is the proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during therapy.
Targeted inhibition of clonogenic cell proliferation during radiation treatment could therefore potentially lead to substantial advances in radiation oncology.
A brief overview discusses ways to minimize the time factor.
Inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy, by blockade of proliferation-stimulating signal transduction pathways, or by pharmacological inhibition of tumor neoangiogenesis is of scientific interest, but its efficacy in minimizing the time factor on the results of radiotherapy has not been proven so far.
The only currently validated method is to deliver radiotherapy in the shortest possible total treatment time, e.g., by accelerated fractionation and by avoiding or compensating for unplanned treatment interruptions.
The acute inflammatory response probably plays an important role in the pathogenesis but also the diagnostic finding and prognostic assessment of acute coronary syndrome.
We examined 50 patients with acute coronary syndrome (59.4 SD 13.9 years) within one hour after admission and in the interval of 4-24h with regard to TnT (Elecsys, Roche Diagnostics) and CRP (biokit, modified Quantex CRP plus, analytical sensitivity 0.02mg/dL).
All patients were followed until 6 weeks after discharge for the primary end point of death or recurrence of acute coronary syndrome.Results:
The cumulative event rate was 62.5% in patients with positive CRP and TnT 42 days after discharge compared with 35.3% of TnT positive and CRP negative patients.
Logistic regression with respect to the primary endpoint with TnT and CRP (both after 4-24h), age, sex and diagnosis showed an independent influence of TnT (cutoff 0.1µg/L, p=0.048, odds ratio=7.5) and CRP (cutoff 0.862mg/dL, p=0.026, odds ratio=5.3).
Sensitivity/specificity for the diagnosis of AMI were 69.6%/75% for TnT and 12%/72% for CRP in the first hour, respectively, and 91.3%/68.2% for TnT and 68%/72% for CRP in the 4-24h course.Conclusions:
Highly sensitive CRP- determinations are not very helpful for acute infarct diagnosis besides troponin T.
However, the assessment of patients' prognosis by TnT is significantly independently supplemented by CRP 4-24 h after admission and thus substantially improved.
A 51/2-year-old girl with optic glioma and resulting hydrocephalus internus developed progressive ascites 7 months after implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
A high protein content was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and ascitic fluid.
For the first time, a disturbance of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier was found to be the cause of the elevated CSF protein by CSF protein electrophoresis.
The ileum conduit is a simple and safe form of supravesical urinary diversion with a low rate of postoperative complications.
However, liver injury with portal hypertension increases the risk of recurrent, peracute conduit hemorrhage requiring transfusion.
While diagnosis is simple, different treatment options are available.
Usually the source of bleeding is in varicose dilated vessels in the stoma, so local sclerotherapy with 3% ethoxysclerol or ligation of the bleeding vessel is an option.
Resection of the varicose conduit portion is an option for life-threatening bleeding or when the source of bleeding cannot be localized.
In cases of frequent recurrent bleeding, the removal of the conduit must also be considered.
Malignancy must be excluded as a cause in any bleeding.
The biological properties of tumor cells are determined by mostly acquired alterations of proliferation-relevant genes - protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes - whose detection can provide novel diagnostic and prognostic parameters.
Meningiomas and gliomas are among the most genetically characterized solid tumors:
A number of specific primary and secondary genetic aberrations are known species-specifically, which are associated with clinical parameters such as recurrence of meningiomas or malignant progression of astrocytomas.
The focal progression with the consequence of intratumoral heterogeneity, which is typical especially for gliomas, is due to complex secondary mutation and selection mechanisms between tumor cells, which are also co-determined iatrogenically by radiotherapy or chemotherapy.
A 48-year-old woman presented with increasing dyspnea due to thrombosis of a mitral cap prosthesis.
The patient had undergone mitral valve replacement (St. Jude Medical) 6 years earlier for mitral stenosis III.
Valve thrombosis occurred 3 years later, requiring valve replacement (St. Jude Medical).
Over the past 10 years, the molecular mechanisms of tumor progression, including metastasis and angiogenesis, have become increasingly well understood.
The formation of metastases is based on a cascade of complex, interacting individual steps.
The metastatic cascade begins with the detachment of carcinoma cells from the epithelial association by loss of cell-cell adhesion, invasion of the extracellular matrix by proteolysis, and entry into the blood or lymphatic system.
Intravasation of tumor cells is favored by angiogenic factors, which may lead to degradation of the basement membrane of blood vessels.
Adhesion to endothelial cells, exit from the vasculature, and induction of angiogenesis constitute other important steps in the metastatic process.
Furthermore, when a tumor cell enters the circulation, it will only survive if it escapes immunological defense.
The systematic identification of tumor antigens has opened up new possibilities for immunotherapeutic interventions.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1) is an autosomal dominant tumor disease of the neuroendocrine cell system with multiple functional and nonfunctional manifestations in parathyroid glands, pancreas, duodenum, and pituitary gland, and rarely in stomach and thymus.
The MEN 1 gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 11.
This gene is thought to be one of the tumor suppressor genes whose allelic loss triggers the development of neoplasia.
The tumors in the pancreas, duodenum, and thymus can metastasize, but most have a low malignancy potential.
Clinically, MEN 1 manifests most commonly between the ages of 20 and 35, primarily by hyperparathyroidism and/or Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
Many clinical studies addressed the reduction of endothelial cell density after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods of donor tissue.
In this case, the interpretation of the results was usually problematic, since highly variable follow-up intervals were pooled despite the long-known dynamic cell loss.
The aim of this study was to perform long-term endothelial assessment at the same dates considering 2 different preservation techniques.
Patients on long-term oral anticoagulation with coumarin preparations have varying degrees of perioperative thromboembolism risk, requiring continuation of prophylaxis.
The overlapping effect of coumarin and heparin therapy requires close daily monitoring of anticoagulation (PTT, thromboplastin time, thrombin time).
In elective procedures, coumarin administration is discontinued 2-3 days preoperatively; in emergency procedures, the need for vitamin K or fresh frozen plasma substitution arises.
Surgery in patients on heparin therapy or prophylaxis is less problematic because the heparin effect wears off within a few hours when discontinued.
Results from various epidemiological studies are available on the prevalence of multiple sclerosis in Germany.
Transferring the prevalence rates of recent epidemiological studies to the total population of Germany yields estimates of 67,000-138,000 multiple sclerosis patients.
The very different results of the epidemiological studies may be due to problems of patient ascertainment, epidemiological area, and the structure of the respective population.
To avoid these problems, the number of diagnosed multiple sclerosis patients was assessed by a representative survey of physician groups relevant to the treatment of multiple sclerosis patients.
The disadvantage of this survey method is the lack of possibility to clarify the diagnosis.
Extrapolation and subsequent pooling of the results of the survey of the individual physician groups resulted in a number of approximately 122,000 multiple sclerosis patients in Germany.
This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149.1 per 100,000 population and is within the range reported by Poser et al.
127 without the diagnostic category "questionable MS" and 170 including this diagnostic category.
What was examined here was how emergency medical care is provided and whether relevant constellations of findings can be found.
Gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technique based on the idea of supporting biological tissue healing.
To achieve this, external gene segments are transferred to cells, which subsequently produce increased growth factors in the area of the fracture.
The effect of growth factors on fracture healing is well documented.
Gene transfer can be considered as a new promising technique of in situ tissue engineering, whose clinical application can be expected in the next decade.
Only 50% of these patients are adequately diagnosed by their primary care physician.
The quality of the doctor-patient discussion is of crucial importance for diagnosis and therapy.
Whereas in the 1970s the physician's conversational style was viewed as a personality variant, recent empirical studies on the physician-patient conversation suggest that the physician's conversational behavior should be understood as an interactive process in that both communication partners (physician-patient) coordinate their conversational behavior.
Training programs to improve basic family medicine psychosomatic competence often show little success because they do not adequately address the importance of improving interpersonal competence.
This is the focus of the Düsseldorf training and education program for basic psychosomatic care.
The training concept and experiences with it will be presented and discussed.
To date, data on the prognosis of heart failure have been based on population epidemiologic and retrospective hospital epidemiologic studies and clinical intervention trials.
All of these sources have limited applicability to clinical practice.
Programming the speech processor of a "cochlear implant" (CI) in young children, specifically determining the stimulation level that corresponds to the maximum acceptable loudness (MAL), is often difficult.
Overstimulation must be avoided at all costs, as this can have a traumatizing effect on the child.
The aim of this study was to analyze the intraoperatively recorded stapedius reflex (SR) thresholds elicited by the CI and the MAL and hearing thresholds established during postoperative speech processor adjustment in 27 wearers of three different implant types.
It was investigated whether the ESR threshold provides an applicable, objective tool for simplifying, refining, and accelerating speech processor programming in practice.
Here, for the Med-El and Clarion implants stimulated in monopolar mode, the mean MAL was calculated as the percentile of the mean ESR threshold current level across all implant electrodes.
The MAL values calculated on the basis of the intraoperatively registered stapedius reflex thresholds showed in some cases large deviations from the thresholds effectively determined by behavioral audiometry.
Thus, no safe and simple computational determination of MAL and hearing threshold based on intraoperative SR threshold was possible.
However, the intraoperative determination of the ESR threshold, in addition to an intraoperative functional check, can contribute to a computational limitation of the area to be tested.
However, the determination of the exact MAL will have to be done by other, preliminary behavioral audiometric means.
A 35-year-old patient developed pruritic swelling in the red portions of a multicolored decorative tattoo.
Histologically, a lichenoid, pseudolymphomatous inflammatory reaction appeared, which could be differentiated from a true lymphoma by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry and molecular biology.
The detection of numerous dermal dendritic cells in the infiltrate may be a consequence of dermal allergic inflammation in the non-granulomatous tattoo reaction.
The treatment of choice is surgical removal of the inflamed areas.
To demonstrate new diagnostic capabilities in the kidney using fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
In a 34-year-old female patient, a supernumerary mammary gland the size of a chicken egg had developed in the left anterior axillary line over a period of 8 years, protruding the skin with no buds or warts.
Early diagnosis and correct excision are desirable.
In connection with endoprosthetic operations, damage to arterial vessels adjacent to the joint may occur.
With the help of 4 case examples, both highly acute and masked complication possibilities as well as the applied therapy are described.
Vascular status of the extremities should be obtained before and after endoprosthetic surgery.
Delusion is understood as intersubjectively alienating beliefs with a tendency to subjective certainty, which as the object of psychiatric experience lose their alienating character with the knowledge of their dependence on mental disorder.
Imaginations from which delusions arise are dynamically freighted according to their position in the structural context.
The pressure to actualize, which weighs on the imaginations and is increased in psychotic states, is a precondition of madness.
To this must be added the failure of disactualization brought about by the psychotic disorganization of the structure.
Considerations explained by a casuistry, starting from the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion, are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions of chronification.
Inflammatory pseudotumor usually occurs singularly and is a benign tumor first described in the lung.
The case of a 24-year-old woman with progressive nasal obstruction due to thickening of the anterior septum is described.
Macroscopically, a cauliflower-like tumor was seen in the region of the anterior septal cartilage, which was completely resected.
Histologically, it was an inflammatory pseudotumor.
Differential diagnoses are discussed based on a review of the relevant literature.
The treatment of choice is complete surgical resection of the tumor.
Therefore, in the presented study, we present examination possibilities of finger and fingertip arteries in healthy subjects with color-coded duplex sonography.
The question was whether standardized imaging of such small vessels is technically possible with the color Doppler system we use.
As a result, we found that presentation was possible in all subjects studied (n=10).
Furthermore, it is shown exemplarily in a patient with endangiitis obliterans that pathological variations in vessels of this size can be detected with the method - with appropriate equipment and examination technique.
The purpose of this retrospective study is to assess the need for cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) generator reimplantation in patients with pulse generator battery depletion and no clinical arrhythmia episode during the functional life of the first-implanted system.
The use of new technologies of extracorporeal circulation, new special instrumentation, as well as the use of intrathoracic visualization systems allows the performance of surgery on the mitral valve via a limited right anterolateral thoracotomy.
Extra-abdominal desmoids belong to the group of deep or musculoaponeurotic fibromatoses.
These are aggressive, locally infiltrating but non-metastatic tumor-like lesions with a 40% recurrence rate.
Trauma, endocrine and genetic factors play a causative role.
Preferred localizations are the trunk and the portions of the extremities near the trunk.
By combining different imaging techniques, the number of differential diagnoses can be narrowed down to a few, in addition to determining the size and extent of the tumor.
Whereas in earlier years surgical resection had a monopoly position, adjuvant therapy measures such as radiation, hormone therapy and chemotherapy are becoming increasingly important.
Mutilating interventions and interventions with subsequent loss of function are justified only in the presence of repeated, unmanageable recurrences.
The treatment concept of atopic eczema includes continuous topical dermatological basic therapy in combination with time-limited exacerbation-directed anti-inflammatory therapy.
In the treatment of exacerbated atopic eczema, systemic therapeutics are often used to support a rapid and effective response to topical therapy or to achieve remission in therapy-resistant courses.
In addition to adjuvant therapy with antihistamines, oral antibiotics and aciclovir are used for microbial superinfections.
In many cases, an exacerbation can be successfully counteracted by phototherapy, in particular by UVA1 treatment.
The use of systemic immunotherapeutics such as glucocorticosteroids, ciclosporin or azathioprine can usually be dispensed with in the treatment of atopic eczema or represents a therapeutic alternative only in a few exceptional cases.
The present case report describes the case of a 35-year-old patient who presented to the ENT department of the BwK Ulm for evaluation with watery nasal secretion, recurrent epistaxis, and a slowly progressive, left-sided nasal airway obstruction.
Clinical examination and CT of the paranasal sinuses revealed a tumor filling the entire left nasal cavity and apparently originating from the middle nasal meatus.
The tumor was resected in toto via midfacial degloving.
Histologic workup revealed a diagnosis of neurinoma.
Based on this case report and a review of the literature, the diagnosis and therapy of this rare nasal tumor are presented.
Chemonucleolysis is a controversial treatment modality for lumbar disc herniation.
Statistically, complications occur less frequently after chemonucleolysis than with surgical therapy procedures for lumbar disc herniation, but they do lead to considerable impairment in some cases.
The most severe complications include allergic reactions, cerebral and spinal hemorrhage, and transverse myelitis.
This must be taken into account when determining the indication for chemonucleolysis and when informing the patient.
Six patients with granuloma eosinophilicum faciei, including patients with multiple lesions, were successfully treated with cryosurgery.
Granuloma eosinophilicum faciei is refractory to many forms of treatment.
Cryotherapy is an effective and low impact treatment for this granulomatous inflammation.
It should be considered as a therapeutic alternative to systemic treatment with dapsone.
Based on questions about the need for, use of, and effectiveness of psychosomatic consultation/liaison services, the present study was the first to examine the effectiveness of a psychosomatic dermatology consultation service in more detail.
The extent of compliance after treatment recommendation was recorded and its association with possible influencing factors such as frequency of consultation contacts, default setting and satisfaction with the consultation, and clinical and demographic characteristics was examined.
Two years after the consultation, catamnesis questionnaires were sent out for this purpose and medical records were evaluated.
In a sample of a total of n=69 patients with a recommendation for action, the compliancerate was 78.3%; in relation to the subgroup with a psychotherapy recommendation, the rate was 69%.
There was no significant association with clinical or demographic characteristics, nor did the frequency of interview contacts have an influence.
In 70.5% of the cases, only one interview was conducted.
A positive attitude towards the consultation and a pleasant experience during the consultation had a positive effect on compliance.
Overall, therefore, a high level of effectiveness was achieved with relatively little time and effort.
A 29-year-old female patient with an unusual pigmented mark of the face is reported.
In the clinical aspect the pigment lesion corresponded to a nevus spilus, in the histological diagnosis the existence of multiple blue nevi could be confirmed, in addition there was a slightly pronounced lentiginous component as well as a dermal melanocytosis.
Immunohistochemically, melanocytic cell elements showed expression of S-100 protein and the melanocyte marker HMB-45.
The change thus proves to be the unusual combination of lentigo simplex with aggregated blue nevi and dermal melanocytosis.
Patients undergoing vascular surgery often require far more fluid intraoperatively than would be expected from preoperative fasting, intraoperative fluid losses, and ventilation.
Changes in Starling forces - especially vascular permeability - may play a role here, although these have not yet been studied in detail.
In the past, the discussion about the results of open surgical procedures on the spine, especially about surgery-related complications, e.g., the so-called postdiscotomy syndrome, has led to the search for and use of less invasive methods, especially for the treatment of lumbar disc herniation.
Percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are techniques that build on various intradiscal diagnostic and therapeutic methods, such as discography, retroperitoneal disc fenestration, or chemonucleolysis.
Mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy, automated percutaneous nucleotomy, intradiscal laser procedures, and partially endoscopic intradiscal surgical procedures have been developed to clinical readiness since the 1970s.
Patient treatment results vary from approximately 30% good and very good to near 100% good and very good depending on the author and study.
It is striking here that prospective randomized studies that have comparison groups-whether conservatively or surgically treated patient groups-are very rare.
Here, the results of intradiscal treatment procedures are more often assessed more critically and with lower success figures than the partly retrospectively examined presentations of individual techniques, which often have very large case numbers, but do not stand up well to hard scientific criteria of study design.
Overall, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can treat only a subset of lumbar disc disease because a limited indication is required for successful therapy.
At this point in time, percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be limited to a rather smaller number of cases compared to endoscopic and microsurgical procedures.
With over 1 million applications worldwide, arterial occlusion systems have established themselves as an essential component of invasive cardiology.
This review compares the four closure systems available today, VasoSeal (VS), Angio-SealTM (AS), Perclose, Inc.
(PC) and DuettTM (DU) in their place in use after coronary interventions.
Published application success rate data for VS, AS, PC, and DU are 88%, 91%, 90%, and 98% to 100%, respectively.
Hemostasis times are 5-13', 2-4', 11-19', and 4-14' with mobilization times of 6-9 h, 6-8h, 4-7h, and 2-6h, respectively.
Minor complications were described in 8%, 5.9%, 5.3%, and 2.1%, and major complications in 5.3%, 1.3%, 4%, and 2.6%.
Although none of the closure systems demonstrated a reduction in relevant peripheral complications compared with manual compression, all documented a significant decrease in hemostasis time.
Increased patient well-being is largely due to airlock removal immediately after coronary intervention.
Arterial occlusion systems reduce the workload of medical staff and can reduce hospital costs by shortening length of stay.
For the treatment of penetrating macular holes, it is generally recommended to remove the posterior vitreous cortex and, if necessary, epiretinal membranes from the retina during vitrectomy to relieve the macula of the presumed intravitreal traction forces.
In addition to these structures, for some time we have also been able to detach the membrana limitans interna (MLI) in the vicinity of the foramen from the retina.
The clinical results and ultrastructural findings of the removed MLI are reported.
The randomized trials comparing thrombolysis and prim‰r-dilation in acute myocardial infarction did not include patients with left bundle branch block, nondiagnostic first electrocardiogram, Pr‰hospital time of >= 12 h, or unknown Pr‰hospital time.
To describe these patient groups and compare the Influﬂ of lysis and Prim‰r dilation, we examined data from the Maximum Individual Optimized Therapy in Acute Myocardial Infarction (MITRA) trial.
Drug addict who died of fulminant viral hepatitis in hepatic coma 5 days after the onset of initial symptoms.
Serological diagnostics revealed cured hepatitis A, persistent hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and superinfection with delta virus (delta hepatitis detected only postmortem).
This has resulted in protracted fat embolism (over days) into the pulmonary circulation with consecutive extravasation and deposition of the fat into alveolar macrophages.
In 40 Alzheimer's patients, 5 patients with dementia of other causes, and 36 cognitively unremarkable control subjects, tau protein was determined in cerebrospinal fluid.
Of the Alzheimer's patients, 19 were in a very mild stage of the disease (Mini-Mental State Test sum score 25 to 28 points).
A significant increase in tau was also measured in these compared with control subjects.
A less pronounced increase in tau was seen in patients with other dementias.
In the Alzheimer's patients, no quantitative correlation was found between the elevation of tau and the severity of dementia or cerebral perfusion deficit as determined by SPECT.
The results are an indication that tau may also be elevated in the predementia stage of Alzheimer's disease and may be useful as a biological indicator for early detection.
In the last decade, an unusual amicrobial intertriginous dermatosis was described in a total of 16 female patients suffering from autoimmune disease.
The clinical characteristic was a sterile pustular dermatitis especially in intertriginous regions, which could be improved by local or mostly systemic steroid therapy.
Histologically, subcorneal partially spongiform neutrophilic pustules appeared.
The present paper describes another patient with this unusual dermatosis.
Restenosis remains a significant problem after reconstructive vascular procedures.
Proliferation of smooth muscle cells, extracellular matrix formation, and remodeling processes are accepted as underlying pathogenesis mechanisms.
Decreased programmed cell death (apoptosis) could also contribute to restenosis by prolonging the survival of intimal cells resulting in cell accumulation and the development of hyperplastic lesions.
For this purpose, human atherectomy specimens from 25 primary and 14 residual osseous lesions of coronary and peripheral origin were analyzed by TUNEL assay (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling;
Intimal hyperplasia correlated more with re- than with primary stenosis origin and was thereby due to increased smooth muscle cell density (mean cell densities:
As a major finding of this study, hypercellular restenotic tissue showed fewer TUNEL+ cells than hypocellular plaques (14% vs. 27%;
Ultrastructural studies here interestingly indicated a significantly lower proportion of intimal plaque cells, particularly smooth muscle cells, with distinct morphological features for apoptosis (3% vs. 13%;
In contrast, no difference was apparent in the incidence of necrosis between the two plaque types (0.13 vs. 0.12 necrosis/cell;
Thus, our data point to apoptosis rather than necrosis as the underlying cell death mode with differences between the two lesion types in significantly decreased apoptosis in cell-rich restenoses.
The present findings suggest that decreased apoptosis is an important regulatory mechanism leading to intimal hyperplasia, as commonly detectable in human restenosis after angioplasty.
Cytotoxic lymphomas are peripheral T and natural killer cell lymphomas that can manifest either primarily or secondarily in the skin.
on cytotoxic lymphocytes is followed by a detailed description of clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and genetic characteristics of cutaneous cytotoxic lymphomas.
The current incidence of microbially caused (infective) endocarditis (IE) is assumed to be seven cases per 100,000 population per year and has been steadily increasing for years.
The prognosis is largely dependent on rapid diagnosis and initiation of adequate therapy.
In cases of unconfirmed suspicion of endocarditis, transesophageal echocardiography is indispensable in addition to the clinical examination, which is usually diagnostic.
Culture-negative endocarditis requires either cessation of untargeted antibiotic therapy and review of the blood culture techniques used or the use of serologic/molecular biology techniques to identify the causative pathogen.
The frequent involvement of the kidneys in the disease process and the occasional impairment of liver function require drug monitoring, especially when substances with potentiating toxic effects are used.
Large (>10 mm) vegetations on the mitral valve are associated with a high risk of thromboembolism, so they usually represent an independent surgical indication, especially if the minimal bactericidal concentration of the most favorable antibiotic combination is greater than 2 µg/ml.
In the first three weeks after manifestation of typical endocarditis symptoms, embolisms are associated with a high risk of recurrence.
Cerebral emboli are not a contraindication to heart-lung machine surgery if primary cerebral hemorrhage has been ruled out by cranial computed tomography and surgery is performed early before the development of postapoplexy blood-brain barrier disruption (< 72 hr).
Significant prognostic improvement with early surgical intervention has also been demonstrated for disease courses complicated by myocardial insufficiency (particularly secondary to acute valvular regurgitation), the occurrence of acute renal failure, a clapped-on infection of primary aortic valve vegetations onto the anterior mitral leaflet, or sepsis persisting for more than 48 hours despite antibiotic therapy.
Transvaginal ultrasound is particularly useful for examining the embryonic brain because the large, "cystic" brain ventricles can be imaged relatively easily.
However, sonoembryology describes not only normal embryonic anatomy but also the development of malformations.
2. altered appearance of cerebral ventricles with disproportion of brain sections where one finds either increased or decreased amount of fluid.
4. irregularity of the contours of the back.
The Infection Protection Act puts the system of notifiable diseases in Germany on a new footing.
Both certain disease patterns in the case of suspicion, illness or death are reportable (essentially by physicians) and the laboratory-diagnostic detection of pathogens (to be reported by laboratories).
The law regulates what information must be provided by those required to report with the notification.
It also specifies what information from it may be further transmitted by the health department.
Particularly in the case of suspicion reports or the reporting of evidence of pathogens, not all of the information that must be transmitted will already be available as a result of the report, so in these cases the health department must conduct its own investigations in order to be able to transmit the relevant information.
The health offices also have the task of combining the incoming reports from physicians and laboratories and forwarding them as individual reports.
Case definitions have been developed for this purpose.The Robert Koch Institute also provides a data definition in electronic form, which makes it easier for the health department to compile the information that must be transmitted.
Transmission to the RKI then takes place via the competent state authority designated by the state.
In Germany, as in almost all industrialized countries, there has been an increase in the number of tumor cases and cancer mortality.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, nearly 213,000 people died as a result of malignant disease in 1998.
People with cancer usually suffer from a variety of physical and psychological dysfunctions that, if not treated adequately or at all, lead to a significant loss of quality of life.
Pain is the dominant symptom, with correspondingly serious effects on the patient and his or her relatives.
Although there are therapy concepts for sufficient pain therapy from various organizations, these are often not implemented to a sufficient extent.
This article therefore comprehensively presents pain management as a critical cornerstone in palliative care.
Because of the central importance of the liver as a site of synthesis of essential hemostasis components and its functional role in the reticoendothelial system, liver disease leads to decreased levels of hepatically synthesized hemostasis factors and signs of increased turnover of plasmatic coagulation and fibrinolysis by laboratory analysis.
In compensated hemostasis disorders, there is usually no need for symptomatic therapy of the hemostasis disorder.
If this labile state is further disturbed by various noxious agents, bleeding with more or less consumption coagulopathy or hyperfibrinolysis-like constellation of findings and only exceptionally thromboembolism occur clinically.
Avoidance of astigmatism induction after sutureless corneal cataract surgery.
One of the requirements of fall prevention is routine medication review.
A random sample of 276 hospitalized patients over 75 years of age was used to investigate the frequency of prescriptions for drugs that may increase the risk of falls via the possible triggering of dizziness.
Between cardiac centers, the amount of bleeding differs up to 8-fold from the same mediastinal drainage after cardiac surgery in adults.
Excessive rebleeding leads to increased blood transfusion rate in 29% of patients.
There are several strategies to reduce perioperative bleeding and thus the transfusion rate of allogeneic blood products.
These strategies are critically evaluated in detail.
Avoiding preoperative anemia, tolerance of low hemoglobin, use of autologous blood, and strict adherence to a transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogeneic transfusions.
Perioperative maintenance and rapid restoration of normothermia significantly improves hemostasis.
The recognition of a medical discipline as an independent specialty at the European level depends on its inclusion in the medical directives of the European Union.
Oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the EU achieved this goal in 1989 with perseverance and great effort.
The forum for discussion of the pertinent problems among the representatives of the member states and with the services of the European Commission was the UEMS Section for Stomatology and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery.
Thanks to their work, today, at the end of the 20th century, maxillofacial surgery is recognized as an independent specialty in 11 European countries with about 3800 specialists.
The development of otomycosis, especially after local antibiotic therapy, is not uncommon.
However, spread of fungi to the middle ear can result in serious complications.
Therefore, especially preoperatively, a sanitation of the external auditory canal is absolutely necessary.
However, all antifungal ear drops currently available on the market contain ototoxic substances.
As an alternative, we recommend a 0.5% aqueous miconazole solution.
Three comparative solutions, "E 153" (3), a whole-electrolyte solution for i.v. infusion, and Alcon-BSS (1) and Alcon-BSS-Plus (2), 2 balanced solutions developed for surgical procedures on the eye, were reviewed for their possible influence on the postoperative inflammatory course after cataract extraction.
From February 1991 to May 1998, 340 patients had a cardioverter/defibrillator (ICD) implanted.
The mean age was 64 +/- 9 years, 278 were male and 62 were female.
The underlying cardiac disease was coronary artery disease in 60% and dilated cardiomyopathy in 31%.
The ejection fraction was 38 +/- 14%.
Indication for an implantable cardioverter/defibrillator was ventricular tachycardia in 57% and survived ventricular fibrillation resuscitation in 43%.
A single-chamber cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in 298 patients, and an AV-sequential or dual-chamber cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in 42 patients.
Implantation of a subcutaneous patch or array system occurred in 25 patients and of an epicardial patch system in 2 patients; the site of implantation was abdominal in 92 patients and pectoral in 248.
A total of 34 probe-related complications occurred during the course of 33 patients (9.7%).
18 of the patients with a probe-related complication had an abdominal aggregate, corresponding to a complication rate of 19.6% of all patients with an abdominal aggregate.
In patients with a pectoral aggregate, the rate of probe-related complications was three times higher for dual-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators at 12% compared with 4% for single-chamber cardioverter/defibrillators (p = 0.05).
In more than half of the patients (55%), the diagnosis was made primarily on the basis of routine radiographic examination, in a quarter (24%) clinically (inadequate therapy delivery, pain), and in a fifth (21%) on the basis of electrical parameters.
The effectiveness of radiosynoviorthesis in the therapy of chronic inflammatory joint diseases, especially chronic polyarthritis, was investigated.
Unlike conventional computed tomography (CT), electron beam tomography (EBT) does not involve an X-ray tube rotating mechanically around the patient; instead, an electron beam is directed at targets arranged semicircularly around the patient, at which the actual X-rays are then produced.
With this ultrafast technique, it has become possible to generate axial cross-sectional images of the heart in 50 or 100 ms and to precisely image all structures of the heart with a spatial resolution <0.5 mm2.
Acquisition of 30-40 axial ECG-triggered cross-sectional images (slice thicknesses 2-3 mm) in short breath-hold allows complete, three-dimensional imaging of a patient's heart.
The detection of coronary calcification with EBT must be considered as the most sensitive noninvasive marker for the presence of coronary atheromatosis including its early forms at present.
The method is particularly suitable for assessing the progression after angioplasty and aortocoronary bypass surgery.
The main problems and limitations of the method, assuming stable sinus rhythm, are respiratory and motion artifacts and overlap of coronary arteries by veins and by marked coronary calcifications.
Nevertheless, clinically assessable noninvasive imaging of coronary arteries has already become possible with EBT to date, which may be further optimized by further technical progress.
The use of the internal thoracic artery for coronary revascularization has become the vessel of choice over the past 25 years.
In addition to the established procedure of angiography, duplex sonography has been increasingly used in recent years as a noninvasive imaging modality to study this vessel.
Preoperative evaluation of 117 patients showed concordant examination results in a high proportion of patients compared with angiography.
Whereas in the preoperative phase the current pulse curve profile is dominated by a high systolic component corresponding to the arterial supply of a skeletal muscle, a postoperative adaptation to the coronary arterial current bed occurs in the form of an increased diastolic flow component.
These noninvasive findings of transthoracic duplex sonography could be confirmed by invasive intravascular Doppler measurements.
As with the preoperative comparison, there is a high degree of agreement between angiography and duplex sonography in assessing revascularization outcomes postoperatively.
In view of the increasing use of the internal thoracic artery as a bypass vessel, this noninvasive procedure should become increasingly important.
Dissections of peripheral arteries particularly affect male hypertensive patients older than 60 years who characteristically have cystic median necrosis as a predisposing underlying disease.
In contrast, aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are a distinct rarity.
Here, young patients with or without an immediate history of trauma predominate.
Based on a case of traumatic dissection of the middle cerebral artery in a 7-year-old girl, the etiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, and morphologic findings of aneurysmal dissections of intracranial arteries are discussed in light of cases reported in the literature.
The paper shows the importance of new organizational concepts for the structural adaptation of nursing homes and homes for the elderly.
The adjustment is intended to strengthen the customer orientation of the homes, to profile their core competencies and to force the management of core processes.
It is not enough to copy supposedly ideal models; rather, it is the task of the management bodies to develop and implement home-specific solutions, taking into account the respective framework conditions.
Reported is a phenotypically female neonate of 37th SSW who died under the picture of renal insufficiency on the 14th day of life.
The child showed a normal male chromosome set of 46 XY and unusual diffuse mesangiosclerosis with interstitial nephritis.
Molecular genetic testing secured the diagnosis of Drash syndrome.
Since the late 1960s, accidents have been among the leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality in Western industrialized nations.
While accidents in older children and adolescents mostly occur in road traffic and are consistently recorded or documented, there are no current epidemiological data in Germany for accidents in infancy and toddlerhood, which preferentially occur during domestic activities.
As part of a study on the efficacy of an acellular pertussis vaccine, we prospectively recorded and analyzed the frequency of accidental hospitalizations in 10,271 infants and young children in Germany between 1991 and 1994.
2 cases (female, 37 and 47 years) of sacral intradural arachnoid cysts that had caused a long-standing lumbalgiform complaint are reported.
In both cases, micturition dysfunction in the sense of pollakiuria was present.
Both cysts were self-contained and had no communication with the rest of the subarachnoid space.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can demonstrate the passage of contrast-enriched blood through the myocardium and even allows quantitative assessment of myocardial perfusion.
The clinical use of this method is delayed on the one hand by the difficulty of image evaluation, and on the other hand by the fact that only one slice per heartbeat can be imaged with conventional techniques.
New developments in both MRI and accelerated imaging strategies allow assessment of perfusion across the entire myocardium with resolution in the range of 2 mm.
As an example of such an imaging technique, a fast (130 ms per frame) segmented gradient echo planar sequence preceded by a saturation pulse is discussed and results in an infarct patient are presented.
The clinical utility of MRI-assisted determination of perfusion for the diagnosis of coronary disease is enhanced by the diversity of MRI methods for determining cardiac function parameters.
Since the perfusion conditions in ligament ruptures represent an essential parameter, especially with regard to the prospects of success of surgical treatment, the vascularization of the medial knee ligament should be presented in the present work.
The specific blood flow situation was investigated by microangiography on 21 cadaveric specimens.
This showed a supply from proximally by 1 or 2 main vascular trunks, which ran preferentially in the ventral portions of the ligament.
Vessel density decreased from proximal to distal and from ventral to dorsal.
Given the lower vascularization of the distal portions of the ligament, we would recommend ligament reconstruction here using fibrin sealant, which allows atraumatic recovery without the risk of suture-induced vascular strangulation.
Approximately 75000 patients with coronary heart disease (about 75% of all heart operations) are treated surgically in Germany every year.
Arterial grafts and autologous veins, predominantly the great saphenous vein, are available as bypass material.
In recent years, minimally invasive vein harvesting techniques are revolutionizing bypass surgery, yet most saphenectomy today is performed by continuous incision of the skin from the ankle to the groin for open dissection of the great saphenous vein.
Wound healing problems after open saphenectomy are repeatedly discussed and are the subject of every cardiac surgical follow-up after coronary surgery and the reason for the appreciation of new, minimally invasive harvesting techniques.
The presented technique (modified "bridge" technique) shows desirable results, especially a very high patient satisfaction regarding the cosmetic result and the only minor limitation due to the saphenectomy wound(s).
Poland syndrome is characterized by a unilateral malformation of the ventral thoracic wall with aplasia of the sternocostal portion of the pectoralis major muscle, ipsilateral symbrachydactyly, and occasionally associated other defects of the thoracic wall, nipple, and mamma.
To our knowledge, a total of seven cases of co-occurrence of dextrocardia with Poland syndrome have been described to date.
We report another patient with this rare combined malformation.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether sICAM-1 and sE-selectin levels can predict early impending sepsis and the severity of sepsis progression.
The range of ophthalmic journals available on the World Wide Web (WWW) is already very extensive.
However, the online offerings of the various magazines and publishers vary greatly in terms of quality and quantity.
Online publications offer many advantages over conventional publications, including low production costs and rapid availability of information regardless of time and place.
It can be assumed that the online publications will not replace the print versions, but will be a useful addition to the existing range of information.
We report on a 61-year-old patient who developed the rare form of purely lateral elbow dislocation after a "police grip."
This case report describes the case of a 52-year-old patient who developed a secondary‰re aortoenteric fistula type 2 to the duodenum 33 months after implantation of an aortic tube prosthesis.
The pr‰operative diagnosis was made by upper endoscopy and abdominal computed tomography.
The value of pr‰operative diagnosis and the 2 alternative surgical therapeutic procedures, in situ reconstruction and extra-anatomic revascularization, are discussed.
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is currently not performed in Germany.
According to opponents of PGD in Germany, the Embryo Protection Act prohibits such diagnostics.
Proponents believe that under certain legal perspectives, the Embryo Protection Act would not prevent PGD.
Against the background of this situation, PGD has not yet been performed in Germany.
The discussion, which has been heated in Germany for some time, is difficult to communicate in scientific circles abroad.
Based on casuistry, it was suggested that the muscle-relaxing potency of atracurium is reduced in the presence of an intrathoracic suppurative focus.
A prospective, clinical investigation should test this hypothesis.
Petersdorf and Beeson defined fever of uncertain origin (FUO) as an illness developing over at least three weeks with a rectal temperature above 38.3 degrees C on at least three days that remains etiologically unclear even after one week of inpatient workup.
One quarter of such cases are caused by infectious diseases, most commonly hidden abscesses, endocarditis lenta, and tuberculosis.
In this paper, profilometry, a modern method for determining skin surface structure, is presented.
With the aid of a rapidly hardening plastic material applied to the surface of the skin in a defined measurement area, impressions are made of the skin that correspond to its negative image.
In the subsequent metrological procedure, the "roughness" of the skinprint is measured with the "profilometer" and the result is recorded as a diagram.
By means of a statistics program, the metrological data can be analyzed, stored and compared.
We tested this method to demonstrate possible improvements in skin surface texture after application of estrogen-containing creams to the face.
Summary The distribution ratio of water between serum and whole blood has been set at 1.2 in the guidelines for blood alcohol determination for forensic purposes for converting serum alcohol to blood alcohol.
In a large multicenter study of 833 cases, which are also representative of the group of persons for whom blood draws are ordered in connection with offenses under the influence of alcohol, a mean distribution factor of 1.16 was measured, with extreme values of 1.08 and 1.21.
In 96% of the cases, the quotient was between 1.13 and 1.19. In relation to the mean value, the deviation of the quotient is less than 3% in 96% of the cases.
Paradoxical emboli are well known in theory but quite rare in practice.
Pathophysiologically, the constellation of venous thrombosis, increased right atrial pressure, and consecutive right-to-left shunt via a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect typically underlies.
Polymorphic disease patterns of children that change during growth due to reinnervation, plexus surgery, and replacement surgery are difficult to classify.
A significant comparison of the different forms of therapy is only possible by using generally accepted evaluation standards.
Vascular injuries were diagnosed after hospital admission by palpation of the wrist pulses, clinical assessment of vascularity, and Doppler signal derivation over the wrist arteries.
The emergency operations performed in all 10 children included fragment reduction and fixation with crossed K-wires via an extensor approach in the first step.
Subsequent assessment of blood flow revealed pulse return in 2 of the 10 children (passaged, dislocation-related vascular occlusion).
In 8 of the 10 children, the pulse remained absent, so the vessel had to be explored on an emergency basis.
Intraoperatively, we saw vasospasm with functional vascular occlusion in 1 of these 8 children.
In adventitial strangulation (2 of these 5 children), pulse transition to the hand occurred immediately after severing the connective strangulating tissues.
In cases of intimal damage (3 of these 5 children), the affected vessel segment was resected and reconstructed, usually in the form of a primary end-to-end anastomosis with vein patchplasty.
We saw combined vascular occlusion (mechanical-functional occlusion) in 2 of these 8 children.
On follow-up, wrist pulses could be palpated in 9 children; color duplex sonographically, 9 children had a physiologic signal, and 1 child had a pathologic, monophasic signal over the brachial, radial, and ulnar arteries.
Ischemic late damage (cold intolerance, claudication, Volkmann contracture) was not seen in any of the children.
Elbow joint mobility assessment revealed a median extension deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-10 degrees), a median flexion deficit of 0 degrees (range 0-15 degrees), and side-to-side normal pro- and supination.
The weight-bearing joint axis was normal in all children compared laterally.
Cultural detection of Bordetella pertussis is of little use to pediatricians, as pathogen culture is successful in only 30-60% of pertussis patients and the result is available after 3-5 days at the earliest.
Regional deep hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced, deep-seated tumors.
In a randomized, double-blind, parallel group comparison, the efficacy and tolerability of high-dose vitamin E (3x400mg RRR--Tocopherol acetate/d) versus diclofenac sodium (3x50mg/d) was evaluated in hospitalized patients with confirmed chronic polyarthritis.
After three weeks of treatment, significant improvement in all clinical parameters studied was observed under both vitamin E therapy (n=42) and diclofenac treatment (n=43).
The duration of morning stiffness decreased from 90min to 68min under vitamin E therapy and from 68min to 30min under diclofenac use.
Ritchie's joint index decreased from 56 to 46 (vitamin E) and from 49 to 34 (diclofenac), respectively.
Grip strength increased in both the vitamin E group and the diclofenac group.
Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the severity of pain, as assessed by a 10cm visual analog scale, in both groups.
The overall assessment of the physician and patient on the success of the therapy was similarly positive for the two drugs.
Especially against the background of the risk profile of NSAIDs in the long-term treatment of chronic polyarthritis, the intake of high-dose vitamin E represents a possible alternative in the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.
However, they may be air-filled or even hyperinflated if there is a fistula to the esophagus or stomach.
Such an observation in the newborn is presented.
This very rare malformation is usually referred to as a communicating bronchopulmonary foregut anomaly.
It must be included in the differential diagnosis of multicystic lung processes.
The diagnosis can be confirmed preoperatively by esophageal break closure and Doppler sonography.
A 24-year-old type I diabetic repeatedly experienced severe diabetic ketoacidosis (serum bicarbonate 7.9 and 4.3 mmol/l) within a few weeks in the context of intoxication with synthetic drugs ("ecstasy" and "speed").
In decompensated diabetic metabolism (HbA1c initial 11.7%), insulin injections were omitted in each case under the influence of drugs.
In addition, at the manifestation of the first ketoacidosis, the patient had danced for hours at a techno party without adequate fluid intake.
The clinical picture showed peritonitic symptoms in addition to exsiccosis and tachycardia;
Disorders of consciousness with agitation or hallucinations and persecutory delusions are essentially related to drug intoxication.
Therapy included intravenous fluid, electrolyte, and insulin substitution.
The courses were uncomplicated.
Reported is a case of ball variance of a Smeloff cutter prosthesis in aortic position 24 years after implantation.
After previous embolic complications, the patient died in cardiogenic shock.
The silicone rubber ball of the prosthesis showed marked degeneration with yellowish discoloration, scoring and cracking with swelling and subtotal fracture.
This resulted in terminal prosthetic dysfunction with complete thrombosis of the valve.
In a prospective study, 36 patients underwent outpatient arthroscopic treatment for osteochondrosis dissecans of the talus pulley and were monitored according to a standardized protocol at 4 and 12 months.
It was shown that the conventional radiological preliminary examination allows a statement about the stage of osteochondrosis and its localization.
Although more than half of the foci were in the dorsal portions of the talus roll, they could be reached without ankle osteotomy, cannulation of the tibia, or distraction.
Arthroscopy also allows partial synovectomy for concomitant synovitis and removal of osteophytes at the tibial crest.
The low complication rate, the short rehabilitation period and the objectively and subjectively good surgical result make arthroscopy a serious alternative to arthrotomy of the upper ankle.
Acute heart failure includes acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock in addition to decompensated chronic heart failure.
The former can be treated with relatively little therapeutic effort, whereas this is already greater in the case of pulmonary edema.
Therapeutically, various mechanical support systems are used in addition to positive inotropic substances and phosphodiesterase inhibitors.
Nevertheless, the mortality of cardiogenic shock whose cause cannot be treated is >85%.
In a double-blind study with 31 subjects, cognitive performance impairment was quantitatively assessed by applying a standardized and validated test procedure (SKT) after a single oral intake of a therapeutic dose of 15 mg midazolam.
Some of the disorders corresponded to the clinical picture of a moderate to severe transit syndrome or organic psychosyndrome.
In addition, complete anterograde amnesia without a tendency to clear occurred in all subjects.
Motor coordination deficits were particularly evident with evidence of gross rotatory nystagmus, which was prolonged in 25 subjects.
All subjective and objective effects were limited to the period of the first 3 to 6 hours after midazolam ingestion.
To present the state of development and clinical suitability of solutions using Internet technology for image and findings distribution and videoconferencing applications.
The introduction of fast gradient systems allows very good quality imaging of the extracranial carotid stroma in magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and finds application in clinical routine.
With the preferred time-of-flight (TOF) technique, vessels can be imaged without contrast agents.
The use of ultrafast gradient echo sequences (GES) allows first-pass imaging of the carotids from the aortic arch to the skull base in less than 30 s of measurement time with intravenous bolus injection of gadolinium.
In this paper, the advantages and disadvantages of both techniques are discussed.
For optimal quality contrast-enhanced MRA (CE-MRA), proper timing of the amount and flow rate of contrast medium (KM) injection and tuning of the sequence parameters to the relatively rapid return of blood from the venous sinuses to the jugular veins must be considered.
First, a model and computer simulation were used to determine the optimal timing of data acquisition with respect to the presence of KM in arteries.
This showed that 90% of the contrast is defined in the middle 16% of the symmetrically acquired k-space rows.
By stepwise variation of spatial resolution, measurement time, and KM injection parameters, a measurement protocol was developed in volunteers and some patients, allowing clinical use of CE-MRA in the area of the extracranial carotid stroma.
The best qualitative results were obtained with a double-dose technique at 2 ml/s injection speed.
The time reserves of ultrafast sequences should be invested in improving the resolution.
Further studies on the optimal KM application at the still very early state of the art are still pending.
Various pre-, intra-, and postoperative measures are used to prophylaxis this complication.
Preoperative measures include delaying the date of surgery until the end of the inflammatory phase after initial trauma, a preoperative physiotherapy program, and appropriate patient selection and education.
Intraoperative measures include precise placement of the drill channels including arthroscopic and radiological exclusion of graft impingement.
Furthermore, excessive graft tension at the time of tibial graft fixation must be avoided.
Postoperative measures include immediate passive bracing of the knee joint, early initiation of an exercise program, and regular clinical follow-up.
From the experience of our own clinic, the development of arthrofibrosis after surgery on the anterior cruciate ligament can be largely avoided if the above measures are taken into account.
In the context of interdisciplinary treatment strategies for palliation of gastrointestinal neoplasms, surgical treatment options have essential roles to play.
Restoring passage, ensuring secretion drainage, and reducing pain are the primary goals.
Conventional, minimally invasive and endoscopic procedures are used in isolation or in combination, integrating all conservative treatment options.
Thus, in many cases, unnecessary laparotomy with high morbidity, mortality, and long hospitalization can be avoided.
This paper describes and discusses the current surgical-operative and endoscopic techniques for palliation of patients with gastrointestinal malignancies.
Malnutrition in the ill elderly is one of the most common and understudied conditions in hospitals, nursing homes, or home care.
Depending on the type and composition of the patient population studied, the prevalence of malnutrition has been reported to be as high as 60%.
This leads, especially in times of increased energy demand, such as acute or chronic illness, to energy deficiency and thus combined to general malnutrition.
To accurately diagnose malnutrition, it is helpful to determine several biochemical nutritional parameters.
These allow for tailored nutritional therapy.
The most important deficiencies in sick elderly people concern proteins, iron, zinc, selenium, vitamin B12, vitamin B1, vitamin B6 and vitamin D. Malnutrition prolongs hospitalization, causes enormous healthcare costs and is associated with a high mortality rate.
With the rapid increase in the elderly, the problem of malnutrition will become more acute.
More attention should therefore be paid to malnutrition by taking it seriously as a disease in its own right and integrating it into the curriculum of training for physicians and nurses.
Cox multivariate hazard analysis identifies ELND as an independent prognostic factor along with tumor thickness (Breslow) (alternatively pT category), tumor location, and sex of the tumor carrier.
In the stratification according to the prognostic parameters mentioned above, the "observed survival curves" according to Kaplan Meier "with" and "without ELND" differ significantly from each other in the following risk groups (5% probability of error):
Women with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas on head, neck, chest and acras;
Men with >1.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the same location and with >2.5 - 4 mm thick melanomas of the arms, legs, and abdomen (except acral and genitoanal locations).
The limits of the risk range with prognostic benefit can be further specified by testing specific risk constellations, taking into account additional parameters for the indication.
Driving license applicants are required not only to have adequate vision, but also legally to "reliably use" it.
The nystagmus patient strives for this by, for example, adopting a head-gaze forced posture or using other compensatory mechanisms.
However, it is precisely these that are not permitted to him in accordance with the applicable examination guidelines (Annex XVII, §§ 9 a ff. StVZO).
Eruptive vellus hair cysts are rare epidermal cysts with retained vellus hairs in children and young adults.
Reported a 23-year-old patient with asymptomatic comedone-like papules on the face, neck, and chest.
Histopathologically, there were epidermal cysts in the mid corium with preserved stratum granulosum, centrally retinulated keratin, and numerous vellus hairs.
Despite some common clinical features, eruptive vellus hair cysts and steatocystoma multiplex differ histopathologically and therefore represent distinct clinical pictures.
Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a very rare infectious disease that occurs very predominantly in HIV-infected patients.
Using molecular biology methods, both Rochalimaea henselae and Rochalimaea quintana were identified as possible pathogens.
The bacteria can be visualized histologically by Warthin-Starry staining or electron microscopy.
The clinical picture was characterized by cutaneous or subcutaneous nodules, some of them ulcerated.
In addition to the skin, other organ systems such as bones, liver or spleen may also be affected.
We describe the case of a 39-year-old HIV-positive patient with BA who had multiple cutaneous nodules as well as bony changes.
Treatment with erythromycin resulted in regression of all disease symptoms.
Stabilization and spondylodesis of the ventral column was performed in 163 patients with unstable spinal injuries using a thoracoscopic technique.
Increased experience has led to a significant reduction in operating times.
At the beginning of the series, conversion to the open procedure occurred in 2 patients.
Our own experience proves the basic feasibility of minimally invasive treatment.
Major advantages over the open approach include reduced access morbidity, reduced analgesic requirements, early functional recovery, and shortened inpatient stay.
Operative objective Practice stable osteosynthesis of the humerus with solid intramedullary locking intramedullary nail using a non-reamed technique.
Mechanical irritation of the supraspinatus tendon due to constriction of the subacromial space is considered a possible cause of supraspinatus-outlet syndrome.
The aim of the present study was to develop a method for improved spatial measurement of acromiohumeral distances and assessment of acromion shape in three-dimensional reconstructed computed tomography (CT).
Acromiohumeral distance was measured in 3 reconstructed frontal sections and compared on the healthy and diseased sides.
The acromion shape was contrasted with the Bigliani classification in conventional radiographs.
The term primary chronic osteomyelitis covers various clinical pictures that should be separated for therapeutic reasons.
Unifocal forms can be distinguished from multifocal manifestations.
While the former are often bacterial, no pathogen can be detected in the 2nd group.
Especially the multifocal forms (chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, CRMO) are prone to recurrence, long course and may additionally show skin involvement (SAPHO syndrome).
The biopsy is primarily used to exclude tumors and to obtain material for bacteriological examination.
Histologic differentiation between these chronic forms of osteomyelitis does not exist.
Social work for the elderly is not justified per se in a demographically aging society, but must prove its social usefulness under the changing conditions of age structure change.
In practice, this has led to a corresponding need for professional orientation and triggered the search for a consensual and more attractive service profile in the fields of action of social work for the elderly.
Using the method of direct immunofluorescence, we succeeded in detecting linear deposits of IgG-lambda-L chains, an early component of complement C1q, and discrete C3 deposits along preserved elastic fibers in the dermis, especially in the stratum papillare, at the dermoepidermal border, along the basal sweat and sebaceous glands, and in the walls of small vessels.
In this respect, our case can be considered unique in the literature.
The hand is extraordinarily exposed in daily use and thus also highly exposed to injury.
The diverse functions of the hand require not only vitality and sensitivity, but also undisturbed motor skills and stability.
In the case of the most severe injuries, very often only residual or replacement functions can be gained.
Complex trauma to the hand results in combined extensive damage to the soft tissues and bony skeleton with acute threat to the vitality or essential functions of the hand.
In principle, the aim is to provide comprehensive initial care.
Because of the multiple lesions, extensive debridement is the priority.
The destroyed tissue parts are primarily reconstructed as far as this is possible.
This is followed by microsurgical reconstruction of the vessels and nerves.
For exposed bones or tendons, the skin mantle is replaced with a pedicled or free microsurgical skin flap.
If the ischemia time is long, this concept is departed from in that blood flow is restored first.
Our results of restoring vitality and sensitivity are presented in an overview.
In the healing outcome of a complex hand injury, every hand function regained or created counts.
Therefore, it is not justifiable to care for such a serious injury without the necessary knowledge and the personnel and local requirements a special department.
Treatment of symptomatic multivessel coronary artery disease with balloon dilatation (PTCA) or bypass surgery is feasible with comparable clinical success and risk, according to the results of 5 large randomized trials.
However, after PTCA, the number of reinterventions is significantly higher.
In the long-term follow-up, according to the BARI study in diabetic patients, the lethality was lower in the operated group.
The individual therapy recommendation by the treating physician has also proven to be an important factor for the patient's prognosis.
The impact of the newer techniques (stents) is currently being investigated in further large-scale randomized trials.
A 34-year-old patient with the rare clinical picture of parakeratosis variegata is reported, which occurred after a period of 4 years following pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta.
To investigate a possible pathogenetic relationship of these diseases from the group of parapsoriasis lesions among each other and with regard to their relationship to low-malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the T-cell type, we performed histological, immunohistochemical and molecular genetic analyses.
While both diseases had characteristic histologic changes and a predominant lymphocytic epidermotropic T-cell infiltrate, a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor could not be confirmed within either change.
Thus, we interpret both diseases as separate entities and in this case unrelated to low-malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the T-cell type.
A histologic statement regarding the location of a tumor-suspected lesion in the biopsy specimen and its relationship to the resected margin (R 0 or R 1) must be as accurate and free of doubt as possible.
We report 2 technical tools that, in our experience, are particularly useful on mammary excisors:
1) Radiopaque sutures, applied intraoperatively, facilitate correlation of postoperative radiographic findings and biopsy.
Contact of sevoflurane with the CO2 absorbers of the anesthetic circuits produces compound A, which may have nephrotoxic potential in humans.
Several studies have recently been conducted in volunteers aimed at analyzing the effects of Compound A on renal function.
A total of three studies investigated the effects of 8-hour anesthesia with a sevoflurane concentration of 3% by volume in volunteers, using fresh gas flows of approximately 2 L/min each.
The first published study by Eger et al. described increased excretion of protein, glucose, and enzymes from renal tubule cells in the urine of subjects after sevoflurane.
Subsequent studies then found either irrelevant or even no changes in renal excretion of these renal function parameters.
Another study also investigated 3 vol% sevoflurane administered over 4 hours at a fresh gas flow rate of 1 L/min in volunteers.
Here, no significant excretion of protein, glucose, or renal enzymes was found.
In any case, the experimental nature of the anesthesias performed in these studies must be taken into account when translating these results into clinical practice.
Although the issue of low-flow anesthesia with sevoflurane is still controversial, studies in volunteers, as well as the results of recent clinical investigations, indicate that renal function after surgical procedures under low-flow conditions behaves similarly to that after isoflurane.
So far, there is no published experience in the German-speaking world in the therapy of paraphilias (pedophilia, sadism) and sexually aggressive impulsive acts with LHRH (lutein-releasing hormone) agonists.
In this study, we describe 11 patients treated with the LHRH agonist leuprorelin acetate over a 12-month study period.
During the treatment period, there were no further sexually aggressive acts and, according to the patients, a significant reduction in erection, ejaculation, masturbation, sexually deviant urges, and fantasies.
One patient died by suicide.
Overall, LHRH agonists in combination with other therapeutic procedures appear to be a promising alternative to cyproterone acetate with its potential carcinogenic effects.
Therefore, we investigated five different intraoperative warming measures for their effectiveness.
Baker and colleagues first used a CO2 laser for blepharoplasty in 1984.
With the Ultrapuls-CO2-Laser a further developed device is available, which enables other applications in ophthalmology.
Diagnosis of thrombosis in the peripheral veins is now possible with almost 100% certainty by both phlebography and duplex sonography.
It is linked to the high qualification of the investigator.
In Germany, both procedures are available nationwide.
Both methods are suitable for primary diagnosis, but duplex sonography has gained paramount importance due to its lack of invasiveness.
When it comes to specific issues, phlebography is not to be missed.
Discrepancies between the clinical aspect and a duplex finding are also considered an important indication for phlebography.
In many institutions, the use of the two procedures is practiced as a "golden partnership" when comprehensive documentation is important.
Chronic rejection is the most important unresolved problem in kidney transplantation today.
The objective of the present study was to clarify whether reendothelialization or reepithelialization by extrarenal cells occurs after transplantation or whether the graft remains allogeneic.
With this in mind, we examined 9 explanted transplant kidneys from opposite-sex donors using nonradioactive in situ hybridization (NISH).
We used biotinylated centromere-specific DNA probes for human chromosome Y and X. In a further step, mono- or polyclonal antibodies against CD45, CD3, CD20, CD31, CD1a, S100, -actin, factor VIII, and UEA were used to characterize the infiltrating cells and the cells involved in graft vasculopathy.
Our study demonstrated that even several years after transplantation, the glomerular, tubular, and endothelial cells retained the sex of the donor.
The only recipient cells detectable in the graft were inflammatory cells composed primarily of T lymphocytes and macrophages.
In 1991, Doppler sonographic detection of cerebral circulatory arrest was recognized by the Scientific Advisory Board of the German Medical Association as one of the methods that shorten the waiting time until the final diagnosis of brain death.
A survey was conducted to clarify the extent to which Doppler sonography has been used in this context since then and what experience has been gained.
400 questionnaires were sent to all neurology (272) and neurosurgery (128) departments in Germany.
In 71 departments, Doppler sonography is also used in terms of decision support to determine brain death, and usually in conjunction with other methods.
In response to the question whether false positive findings had occurred, "yes" was ticked 5 times.
The discussion revealed that the investigators deliberately reported borderline situations, in some of which the preconditions were not fully met.
In none of these cases was ultrasonography used to determine brain death.
Doppler sonography is used by a not inconsiderable number of neurology and neurosurgery departments to determine cerebral circulatory arrest and as a decision aid in the diagnosis of brain death, essentially to further confirm the diagnosis, and less frequently as the sole method reducing waiting time.
The microsomal heme oxygenase (HO) is exclusively responsible for the endogenous formation of CO, which exists as a constitutive enzyme (HO-2) as well as in a stress-inducible isoform (HO-1 or heat shock protein 32).
Therefore, in the present work, the organ-specific expression pattern of the stress-inducible isoform of the enzyme was investigated after hemorrhagic shock and volume therapy.
Glycerol leads to a transformation of crystalline lipid structures in the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states.
Especially when used in O/W emulsion, it improves horny layer hydration to a considerable degree and significantly above the urea effect.
It also promotes the dissolution of desmosomes in the upper layers of the stratum corneum and thus horny layer exfoliation.
especially with long-term use, glycerine can increase the deformation of the skin in the suction test.
The roughness of the skin surface is also influenced by glycerine-containing preparations in the sense of smoothing.
Glycerin also leads to a protective effect against surfactant action and against lipophilic pollutants when used in O/W emulsions.
This is probably due to the fact that the hygroscopic effect of glycerol leads to a flux from the depth of the epidermis to the surface, which in turn triggers barrier regeneration.
Finally, similar to urea, glycerol can lead to improved drug penetration.
Surgical Objective To stabilize posterior shoulder instability in adolescents by posterior bone block and capsuloplasty.
Complications of the long-term course resulting from degeneration of venous grafts can be reduced with this surgical procedure.
Due to prolonged surgical times and increased surgical trauma when using multiple arterial grafts, these have been used only in exceptional cases.
We present our results of complete arterial revascularization using new techniques (skeletonization of arterial conduits/T-graft configuration).
Material and Methods:
Between 3/96 and 7/99, 405 patients with coronary multivessel disease underwent complete arterial revascularization in our hospital.
All operations were performed with a maximum of 2 skeletonized grafts, bilateral internal thoracic arteries in 105 patients (25.9%), internal thoracic artery and radial artery in 299 patients (73.8%), and 1 radial artery in 1 patient (0.3%).
In 346 patients (85.4%), implantation of both arterial grafts was performed in T configuration.
On average, 4.1 +/- 0.9 coronary vessels were anastomosed per patient.
Hospital mortality was 2%.
Sternal wound healing disorders occurred in 0.8% of patients.
There were no complications after radial artery harvest except for temporary paresthesias.
At angiographic follow-up 1 week postoperatively, 96.7% of coronary anastomoses were free of stenoses >50%.
Complete arterial bypass surgery using skeletonized arteries and the T-graft technique is a safe procedure for the treatment of multivessel coronary artery disease.
The low morbidity and mortality in the perioperative course allow their routine use.
The different treatment procedures for periprosthetic femoral fracture after endoprosthetic replacement of the knee are discussed.
A new method of treating such periprosthetic fractures with the LIS system (LISS, Synthes) is described and initial clinical results are presented.
The measurement of intracranial pressure has acquired a key position within neuromonitoring, although the actual metabolic processes at the central neuron cannot be registered directly by the intracranial pressure and also only with a time delay.
Prerequisite for reliable intracranial pressure measurement are specific properties of intracranial pressure probes, which will be investigated in the following.
These are to be analyzed and categorized from a metrological point of view in order to gain a better understanding of their different modes of operation and measurement properties.
We practice partial sphincterectomy as part of cataract surgery for very narrow pupils (< 3 mm).
We hypothesize that the narrow pupil is mainly due to a fibrosing ring of the sphincter pupillae muscle.
While the health-related quality of life of adults has been increasingly researched, the quality of life of healthy and chronically ill children and adolescents has only recently been addressed.
In this paper, published works in the literature on the topic of children's health-related quality of life are evaluated with regard to foci and methods of research.
The review shows that empirical work to date is scarce, and the existing measurement tools for children's quality of life are described.
Increased research activities are needed in order to be able to use the recording of children's quality of life in prevention, health sciences, therapy evaluation and rehabilitation.
7 of these patients were recorded during the last 5 days before the onset of acute renal failure and compared with a control group.
Andy Warhol underwent dermabrasion in 1957 due to skin changes that, based on the available biographical material, must be interpreted as incipient rhinophyma.
Throughout his artistic career, the artist's preoccupation with aspects of plastic surgery, particularly in the area of the nose, can be demonstrated.
As a founder of Pop Art, Warhol's oeuvre has had a significant impact on modern society and, in the process, has influenced our expectations of aesthetic forms.
In an interdisciplinary approach, the program HepaVision (MEVIS, Bremen, Germany), which was specifically developed for 3D visualization of the liver, was used and evaluated for individual planning of extended liver resections and living liver donations.
Experience with the program to date is available for >50 volume datasets of biphasic spiral CT examinations.
After adjuvant and palliative active nonspecific immunotherapy favorably influenced survival times of melanoma patients, gene therapy now offers the possibility of active specific immunotherapy.
It involves gene transfer, which can be viral or non-viral, in vivo or ex vivo.
For melanoma, offer:
Vaccination with tumor-specific, HLA-associated antigens using peptides or "naked DNA", vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with a cytokine gene or with B7, adoptive immunotherapy with specific T cells propagated in vitro, transfected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or transfection of tumor cells in vivo with a tumor suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a central role in melanoma.
The influence of falsification tendencies ("defensiveness") of some patients on the evaluation of therapy results could not be accurately assessed so far.
Using 309 inpatients treated with conversational psychotherapy and followed up one year later, the extent to which raters can be influenced by patients' defenses on the scales CGI, HAMA, HAMD, BRMES, as measured by validity scales of the personality tests MMPI-K, FPI-R, and Giessen Test, is shown:
the tendency to put oneself in a favorable light ("social desirability") and the tendency to appear inconspicuous-normal.
Their relative improvements (effect size rating scales) decrease as their openness increases (validity scales). - Inpatient talk psychotherapy strengthened defensiveness in aggravating and decreased it in dissimulating patients.
Despite early conservative and subsequently timely surgical treatment of congenital clubfoot adapted to the severity of the deformity, approximately 25% recurrences and residual deformities requiring treatment have been reported.
The main cause seems to be the lack of concentric reduction and subsequent retention of the subtalar joint complex.
The most common deformity is forefoot adduction and supination.
From the experience of 94 operated recurrent/residual clubfeet (patients < 10 years), the age-dependent surgical approach is presented.
Beyond the age of 8 to 10, metatarsal osteotomies, Ilizarov correction with the external fixator and, as ultima ratio, triple arthrodesis are used.
Nevus cell nevi show marked variability in their clinical morphology.
We report a 77-year-old female patient with a pedunculated, lobular, intradermal nevus cell nevus on the trunk.
We propose the term "nevus corymbiformis" for this grape-shaped appearance.
For ethical and socioeconomic reasons (cost explosion in transfusion, individual patient fate), the further development and consistent application of foreign blood-saving measures in medicine represents a challenge to anesthesiologists, surgeons, and transfusion physicians.
The combination of different procedures, such as preoperative autologous blood donation, preoperative hemodilution, choice of anesthetic procedure, controlled hypotension, intraoperative application of antifibrinolytics, and machine autotransfusion of autologous wound blood, allow sparing transfusion of allogeneic blood even for patients with large intraoperative blood losses.
Prof. Gustav Adolph Michaelis (1798-1848), director of the Kiel Birth Center and Midwifery School, is considered one of the founders of scientific obstetric medicine.
He oriented his research and teaching to the empirically tangible.
His major work on the narrow pelvis sums up his clinical experience as an obstetrician.
Determination of pelvic measurements and inspection of the Michaelis rhombus named after him provided him with a reliable prognosis about risks of the birth process.
Honesty and conscientiousness characterized his research:
Self-critically he published medical failures, critically he examined new theories.
Thus, he was the first in Germany to confirm Semmelweis' teaching on the prophylaxis of puerperal fever.
In despair over the deaths of many female patients in childbirth, for which he was partly responsible, he chose suicide in 1848.
In one case, the tumor was likely responsible for long-standing conduction disturbance (AV block) and sudden onset of death.
Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive, painless procedure that can be used to elicit temporary stimulus effects in circumscribed cortex areas in humans.
New applications for functional anatomical questions on language lateralization, memory functions, and visual perception are presented.
Possible therapeutic effects for the treatment of movement disorders and depression are described.
Based on theoretical considerations and previous experience, the risk of rTMS-induced epileptogenic effects is discussed and recommendations for safety of use are given.
Neurinomas of the facial nerve are rare, benign tumors that occur mostly in the course of the distal intratemporal segment of the nerve, grow forward to the extratemporal and are then noticed extracranially as a mass.
The most common symptom is progressive peripheral facial nerve palsy.
The patient complained of diffuse vertigo, progressive left sensorineural hearing loss, and mild peripheral facial nerve palsy without deficit of lacrimal secretion.
Neurinoma was detected by computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
The tumor was removed via an extradural "middle fossa approach" without injury to the motor facial nerve.
This is the first report of an isolated neurinoma of the petrosal major nerve without affection of the facial motor nerve.
Status epilepticus (SE) is when there is one continuous seizure or multiple seizures between which the patient does not regain consciousness.
However, current treatment strategies are still based almost exclusively on theoretical considerations and small case series.
Initial treatment is with benzodiazepines and is successful in most patients; phenytoin and phenobarbital are used if unsuccessful.
Refractory SE has a poor prognosis and must be treated in a specialized intensive care unit with the possibility of EEG monitoring.
At this stage of the disease, the most appropriate course of action is not yet known;
Barbiturates, midazolam and propofol are alternative effective substances.
Either tendon transposition or tendon grafting is recommended for the treatment of an obsolete rupture of the anterior tibialis tendon.
A case study is used to describe the surgical treatment with an augmented inversion plasty;
3 years after surgical reconstruction, the patient was subjectively symptom-free with good functional outcome.
Reverse plastic surgery has the advantage that there is no functional loss compared to the operations described so far.
The analysis of the sympathetic-vagal balance provides valuable information regarding prognosis and treatment strategies in many clinical pictures.
Analysis of heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity, which are well-defined and proven in large prospective studies, are the main tools used to assess this parameter in ICU patients.
In contrast, ventilatory and cardiac chemoreflex sensitivities as potential predictors of malignant cardiac arrhythmias and prognosis in chronic heart failure are currently the subject of intense research activity.
The aim is to validate the significance in these clinical pictures.
Sepsis and MODS, as conditions of particular relevance to critical care medicine, are also associated with impaired autonomic function, measured as a reduction in heart rate variability.
The limitation of heart rate variability in such patients is indicative of the loss of neuro-humoral organ interaction ("uncoupling of biological oscillators").
This idea seems to have increasing appeal in the pathophysiological concept of sepsis and MODS.
We report 3 patients with acquired green discoloration of scalp hair.
The medical history revealed that all 3 patients regularly bathed in the private swimming pool.
Examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy detected excessive copper content as the cause of the green discoloration.
On the basis of our observations, we would like to point out the characteristic association of this exogenous hair discoloration with the uptake of copper by swimming water of domestic swimming pools.
The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to compare quality of life, life satisfaction, and subjectively assessed health before and at different time points after heart transplantation (HTx).
German SF-36, disease-specific complaint questionnaire, global quality of life assessment, Munich Quality of Life Dimensions List (MLDL), expected or experienced changes after HTx.
In the evaluation, individual measurement values were represented by median (Me), mean (M), and standard deviation (SD).
Preoperatively, 84% of the terminal heart failure patients rated their quality of life as very poor;
as early as 6 weeks postoperatively, this parameter improved, and 74% of transplant recipients perceived their quality of life as very good to excellent.
Patients were also very dissatisfied with physical performance (87%) and health status (80%) preoperatively.
Six weeks after transplantation, these areas improved significantly, with 76% of patients showing high levels of satisfaction with health status and 51% with physical performance.
Although patients rated their psychological well-being as good already before HTx, this parameter improved even more postoperatively and reached significantly higher values after one year (preop.
Range (R)=3.78 vs. 12 mon. postop.
Quality of life correlated best with health status before HTx (r=0.61, p<0.01), and best with satisfaction with health status 6 months after transplantation (r=0.76, p<0.01).
The areas of sexuality, occupational situation, and leisure time activities improved in only about 28% of patients after HTx.
90% suffered from one or more complaints after transplantation, mostly side effects of immunosuppressive therapy.
The study shows that for patients with terminal heart failure, all domains of quality of life, with the exception of psychological well-being, improve significantly as early as 6 weeks after HTx.
Despite excessive expectations and postoperative discomfort, heart transplant recipients are significantly more satisfied with their postoperative living situation.
A 36-year-old man sustained an isolated traumatic brain injury (SHT) with skull base fracture, epidural and subdural hematoma, and contusion hemorrhage after a bicycle fall [Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS):
The space-occupying hematomas were evacuated by craniotomy.
High ICP values necessitated barbiturate coma for 10 days.
To make matters worse, the patient developed septic respiratory failure on day 8 after trauma.
The patient showed a protracted course and could not be transferred to neurorehabilitation until 57 days after the accident.
Subsequently, the patient developed massive limitation of mobility in both hip joints (extension/flexion:
0 degrees/10 degrees/20 degrees, left:
Abduction/ Adduction:
10 degrees/0 degrees/25 degrees, left:
Pelvic survey and computed tomography showed ankylosing heterotopic ossification (HO) of both hip joints (Brooker type IV).
The HOs were each removed bilaterally via a Smith-Petersen approach 2 years after the accident.
HO recurrence prophylaxis was performed by a single preoperative irradiation (8 Gy) and postoperative administration of indomethacin (150 mg/day) for 3 months.
The range of motion at the hip joints 15 (left) and 12 (right) months after resection are as follows:
20 degrees/0 degrees/30 degrees, left:
Abduction/Adduction:
30 degrees/0 degrees/40 degrees, left:
Radiologically, there has been no recurrence of HO to date.
The patient can perform light activities as a farmer 3 years after the accident.
A detection system for dermatophytes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed.
Primers "TR1" and "TR2" flank a 581 bp sequence within the gene encoding fungal small ribosomal subunit (18S rRNA).
By PCR, the DNA of isolates of the 7 most common dermatophytes could be amplified, in addition to that of some yeasts and molds.
Hybridization with specific detection oligonucleotides successfully identified dermatophytes and Candida albicans.
Restriction fragment analysis allowed the differentiation of dermatophytes from yeasts and molds.
The specificity of PCR for fungi was tested on human DNA from 42 dermis and epidermis samples and on selected animal and plant DNA.
To evaluate the clinical relevance of the procedure, 69 routinely obtained skin and nail samples were examined by PCR and culture.
PCR detected dermatophytes in 35 and culture detected dermatophytes in 28 of the total 38 patient samples evaluated positive.
The sensitivity of PCR (92%) was higher than that of culture (73%).
The result of this study shows that PCR has advantages over culture in the detection of dermatophytes.
Wrist arthroscopy has helped to develop a better understanding of wrist anatomy and pathology.
A special diagnostic task of radiocarpal and mediocarpal reflections is the assessment of kinematic stability.
Wrist arthroscopy is crucial in this regard, along with functional radiology procedures.
Injuries to the ulnar disc and scapholunate ligamentous apparatus are the most common arthroscopic surgical indications.
The analysis of mitochondrial DNA has found increasing application in forensic practice, archaeology, and evolutionary and population genetic studies during the last decade.
The structure of mitochondrial DNA with special reference to the noncoding hypervariable regions is described.
Furthermore, the importance of sequence polymorphisms for evolutionary biology studies is discussed.
The forensic value of sequence databases and requirements for their scope and their structure are explained.
Results of experimental work aimed at recovery of mitochondrial DNA from soil deposited teeth, hair shafts as well as contaminated traces are presented.
Finally, three trace cases that could be clarified using mtDNA analysis are presented.
The aim of the presented work is to present the findings reported in the literature as well as own observations.
Microperimetric studies after surgical extraction of choroidal neovascular membranes (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have shown that a deep scotoma develops in the area of the resulting pigment epithelial loss.
The surgical expense must be weighed against the potential functional outcomes of both forms of therapy.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with its high soft tissue contrast, is the imaging modality of choice for visualizing the intra-articular structures and surrounding soft tissues of the joints.
However, native MRI is not suitable for the diagnosis of labral lesions of the hip joint.
MR arthrography (MRA) of the hip joint allows direct visualization of labral lesions by distension of the joint space and marking of the lesion.
Multiplanar three-dimensional (3D) sequences allow assessment in crucial cranioventral sections.
Labrum lesions can be classified into different, clinically relevant stages with MRA.
In addition, imaging of concomitant lesions (intra- and extraosseous ganglia, stress edema) is also possible.
In a study we performed with surgically verified cases, MRA showed excellent sensitivity (90%) and accuracy (91%).
In the more than 100 arthrographies performed to date, no complications have occurred.
Based on this experience, MRA represents the method of choice for imaging diagnosis of labral lesions.
In this review, we present the technique and results of the MRA method we used.
It was found that the varicose vein wall was more rigid than the wall of normal veins, of which the vein wall below a still intact venous valve was also affected.
The change in the vein and thus the cause of the change in tensile strength was in the vein wall and here in particular the components of the extracellular matrix.
In the synopsis of the mechanical experiments and the immunohistochemical results, the theory of primary valve destruction and subsequent varicose remodeling of the vein cannot be confirmed; it is much more likely that a change in the vein wall occurs first, leading to valve insufficiency.
Arterial injury as a direct result of trauma usually leads to hemorrhage or ischemia.
Acute ischemia may be absent in the area of the hand supplied by 2 arteries.
Hypothenar hammer syndrome represents occlusion of the distal ulnar artery secondary to trauma.
Depending on the type of injury, the clinical onset is usually insidious and only a specific duplex sonographic or angiographic examination leads to the diagnosis.
There are no proven treatment recommendations.
The diagnosis of the occlusion of the ulnar artery as a result of an accident is important for the patient and makes a therapeutic approach possible.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the medium-term eye pressure regulation after combined glaucoma and cataract surgery.
The direct antiemetic effect of propofol is already known.
Combinations of induction of anesthesia and maintenance of anesthesia with propofol result in a decreased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) compared with other anesthetic drugs or techniques.
In this article, we show how best to take advantage of the antiemetic effect of propofol.
The possible effect of propofol on the cortex cerebri and its interaction with the dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems are discussed using results from clinical and basic research.
Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of propofol in terms of incidence reduction of PONV in clinical practice are discussed.
Prediction of postoperative soft-tissue esthetics after combined oral surgery-prosthetic treatment of the extremely atrophic edentulous maxilla by a repositioning osteotomy with sinus lift and placement of endosseous implants is rarely included in preoperative planning.
In a prospective study since 1993, the treatment concept was determined in 23 patients on the basis of the fabrication of a medical rapid prototyping model of the facial skull and soft tissue profile prognosis with video imaging, with special attention to anterior esthetics.
In 8 patients, the surgical and/or prosthetic treatment concept was modified based on the preoperative planning.
All patients were very satisfied with the functional and esthetic results achieved.
Profile prognosis with video imaging means a useful decision support in planning the rehabilitation of the atrophic maxilla to take into account the mutually influencing factors - extent of maxillary advancement, direction of insertion of endosseous implants and type of superstructure.
A large-nodule multicentric juvenile xanthogranuloma is reported whose unusual clinical and histologic aspect initially precluded diagnosis.
The now more than 2 years of spontaneous regression with the change of the primarily monomorphic fibrocytic to a polymorphic histiocytic aspect with numerous fat-storing giant cells as well as the lack of evidence of specific cell organelles could secure the nature of the disease.
Thymus preparations, among others, are offered on the German pharmaceutical market for the treatment of rheumatic diseases.
The published findings on thymus preparations are based on individual case reports, studies with inadequate and sometimes ethically questionable study designs, and studies that do not allow scientifically substantiated conclusions due to short study duration and low patient numbers.
A medically justifiable therapy recommendation for thymus preparations in rheumatic diseases (e.g. in rheumatoid arthritis) cannot currently be derived on this basis with sufficient positive benefit-risk assessment in accordance with the current state of knowledge, taking into account the possible risks associated with the treatment.
We report an intrahepatic aneurysm in a peripheral branch of the dextra hepatic artery in a 64-year-old female patient.
After initially uncharacteristic upper abdominal symptoms, repeated acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding up to shock symptoms had occurred, the cause of which was difficult to determine in the condition after Billroth II gastric resection.
Superselective angiographic embolization of intrahepatic aneurysms is a low-risk and promising therapeutic option.
Studies on the pathophysiology of acute ischemic insult have shown that optimal conditions exist when early symptoms of stroke are recognized quickly and treatment is initiated within 3 h of the onset of initial symptoms.
Valuable time is often lost between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy.
Symptoms are not noticed or trivialized by patients, relatives, or witnesses.
Increasing this number must be achieved through intensified training efforts that consider both the public and emergency medical personnel.
The applicable standard of care in acute therapy includes adequate cerebral oxygenation, treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, blood pressure management, and therapy for hyperglycemia and hyperthermia.
In the context of maintenance treatment with synthetic opioids, the efficacy of sublingually applied buprenorphine in tablet form was compared with orally administered methadone in 40 opiate-dependent patients over a study period of 24 weeks.
In the randomized study, the target parameters were defined as the retention rate (=percentage of patients who remained in the study program for the entire duration of the study and completed it as planned), additional consumption, and length of stay.
There was a trend with respect to retention rate (p=0.06) in favor of the methadone-treated group at a mean daily dose of 7.3 mg buprenorphine and a mean dose of 63 mg methadone.
The failure rate in the buprenorphine-treated group (n=20) tended to be higher, with 11 patients compared to 5 patients in the methadone-treated group (n=20).
No significant difference was found between the two during the course of treatment with regard to the additional use of opiates, benzodiazepines and cocaine.
Methadone turned out to be the more successful substance in terms of length of stay in the study (p=0.04).
How important and how meaningful are clinical parameters and locoregional treatment failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinoma for the probability of occurrence of hematogenous metastases?
Between Aug. 1, 1990, and Oct. 1, 1998, 139 consecutive patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma were treated with radical radiotherapy in a prospective study and evaluated for clinical parameters, reflexotalgia, predominant structure of tumor growth, T category, lymph node involvement, and indulgence habits.
29 patients received concomitant chemotherapy.
In 25/139 patients, radical neck dissection was performed after completion of radiotherapy, according to the therapeutic concept.
10/139 patients were later treated with an "opération de rattrappage".
The median follow-up was 24 months (range, 4 to 74).
In 77/139 (55%), the condition could be controlled locoregionally.
Tumor was not controlled in 62/139 patients (45%).
The two patient groups, 62 patients with local treatment failure and 77 patients with locally cured tumor, were comparable with respect to Karnofsky index, age, sex, histologic differentiation, alcohol consumption, pretherapeutic diagnosis, total dose (Gy), and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles.
Tumor control was significantly co-determined by reflexotalgia (p < 0.0078), growth structure (p < 0.012), T category (p < 0.03), and smoking (p < 0.0285) parameters.
The median survival time of patients with locoregional treatment failure was 17 months.
At this time, 81% of locally controlled patients were still alive.
Distant metastases were detected in 23% (14/62) of locoregionally uncontrolled patients, compared with only 4/77 (5%) of locoregionally cured patients (p < 0.0026).
Local control probability and distant metastasis, most commonly lung metastasis, reached a plateau at 24 months.
Locoregional tumor control, determined by multiple clinical parameters, is a key indicator of the likelihood of distant metastasis.
Failure of therapy is due to the biological aggressiveness of the tumor.
The introduction of multiline detector CT (MDCT) into clinical practice adds a new dimension to volume acquisition and spatial and temporal resolution in CT.
However, the new technical capabilities of MDCT require a redefinition of examination strategies to improve existing CT applications and to open up new areas of application.
The literature between 1990 and 1997 and 3 own case observations were evaluated according to symptomatology and current therapy of adder bites (Vipera berus).
The main toxic effect is the development of sometimes threatening edema;
If there are still no signs of poisoning more than 2-3 h after the event, the probability of severe poisoning is very low.
Part II reports on the clinical use of external patellotibial transfixation (EPTT) with the MPT fixator in 67 patients with a wide range of reparative and reconstructive procedures on the distal extensor apparatus of the knee.
In 44 patients, the MPT fixator was applied in assembly form A and in 23 patients in assembly form B.
Deep infection occurred in 4 patients, which was due to the fixator in 2 cases.
The 63 patients who were treated with the MPT fixator wore the system for an average of 7.3 weeks.
Follow-up studies included 5 patients with partial patellectomy and transosseous refixation of the patel ligament for caudal comminuted fractures and 12 patients with transosseous suture refixation of the patella ligament for avulsion and avulsion at the inferior patellar pole or suture adaptation of the patella ligament for intraligamentous rupture, who had no knee joint care other than extensor surgery.
In 2 patients, the outcome was classified as normal according to the IKDC score, in 10 as almost normal, and in 4 as abnormal.
Isokinetically, only 5 of the 17 patients had an extensor strength deficit of 10-20% on the operated leg compared with the opposite side.
In summary, EPTT with the MPT fixator has been proven to be effective in continuity-restoring procedures of the distal extensor apparatus of the knee and is a powerful alternative to patellotibial crushing with wire or synthetic ligament material.
Thromboembolic diseases of the venous system are often difficult to diagnose.
Nowadays, newer diagnostic possibilities as well as the development of diagnostic algorithms make it possible to reduce the error rate in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
This article presents the methods currently used to diagnose acute and chronic pulmonary embolism and describes diagnostic strategies whose utility has been investigated in clinical trials.
Based on the case history of a 6-year-old boy, hydroa vacciniformis, a rare dermatosis triggered by UVA exposure with possible ocular involvement in children, is presented.
In light-exposed areas, numerous hemorrhagic vesicles occur acutely at the beginning of the light-rich season, recurrently until adulthood, and heal scarred.
During a field test, we gained experience in using the MEDICUS teleradiology system in almost daily teleconferences between a radiology department and clinics for internal medicine, urology and gynecology.
The central imaging modality in X-ray diagnostics in oral and maxillofacial surgery is the panoramic tomographic image.
The reduction in dose requirements has further been made possible by advancements in equipment technology, X-ray films, and new detection systems such as sensors or imaging plates.
Diagnostic inadequacies of conventional imaging modalities make imaging by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging unavoidable for numerous clinical issues in oral and maxillofacial surgery.
Although magnetic resonance imaging is primarily suitable for soft tissue diagnostics, it now also allows cortical changes to be imaged due to the shortening of measurement times.
For certain issues, such as changes in bone metabolism, differentiated nuclear medicine procedures enable image-supported functional analysis.
Today, body-oriented psychotherapy is used in inpatient and outpatient settings, individually or in groups, alone or in combination with other methods.
These methods are especially important for patients whose body awareness is diminished, whose emotionality is limited, or who, due to character resistance, are difficult to reach in verbal psychotherapy.
The methods most commonly used today are given with brief examples, and other methods are referred to.
Among others, the connection of affects to the vegetative and voluntary nervous system is mentioned as acting factors, as well as the close connection of mental and physical processes, especially existing at the beginning of life, which is connected with the respective experienced form of interaction and has psychobiological effects.
In further development, the body and certain body regions also acquire a symbolic and important meaning for therapy.
The relationship of body-oriented methods to verbal psychotherapy, especially psychoanalysis, is discussed.
Approaches to empirical research are indicated.
Psychotherapists live in a field of tension between family ideal and reality, which have been shaped by various current and past experiences.
The role and function in one's family of origin not infrequently influence career choices and personal life plans.
Although psychotherapeutic activity gives the individual a lot of leeway to find a compromise between professional and family life, it is still not easy, especially for female psychotherapists, to realize a family model that suits them and their partners.
Three models are presented and their implications described.
Finally, positive and negative aspects of psychotherapeutic activity on one's own couple and family relationships are discussed.
In their training and continuing education, psychotherapists should give the same attention to their personal relationships as they do to their therapeutic relationships with patients.
Advanced heart failure, with a prevalence of 0.1%, is gaining increasing importance within the patient population with cardiovascular disease.
The 6- to 12-month survival probability is significantly reduced at 50-75%.
Since the introduction of triple immunosuppression with cyclosporine, azathioprine, and cortisone, heart transplantation has been considered the treatment of choice for heart failure refractory to medical therapy.
However, the growing mismatch between supply and demand of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients who can be transplanted and requires a more restrictive listing for heart transplantation.
In recent years, promising new conservative and alternative surgical therapeutic approaches have emerged.
Conventional drug therapy has been improved with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and anticongestive beta-blockers.
Surgical therapy for advanced heart failure has expanded with the introduction of high-risk bypass surgery, high-risk valve surgery, mechanical assist devices, implantable cardioverter defibrillators, ventricular reduction plasty, cardiomyoplasty, and multisite pacing.
These therapeutic options are used either as a bridging measure or as mid- and long-term alternatives to heart transplantation.
The success of treatment depends crucially on the selection of suitable patients for the respective therapy.
This requires the establishment of risk scores based on national and international patient registries.
Using the example of a 30-bed ward at the Orthopedic University Hospital in Bochum, the volume of TLA procedures is compared with manual therapy hand grips over a period of one year.
On the other hand, 122 manual therapies were performed on the cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine by the respective ward physicians who had completed further training.
While TLA focused on the main predilection site of the respective clinical picture (pseudoradicular cervical and lumbar spine syndromes), manual therapy primarily referred to secondary findings in other spinal floors in patients with the aforementioned diagnoses or with postdiscotomy syndrome.
The migration of a retained mandibular tooth from its site of establishment to ectopic areas is usually described for canines.
With this case report, we present the case of migration of a retained lower premolar to the processus muscularis documented over a period of 14 years.
Migration along the ascending mandibular branch into the muscular process occurred after completion of root growth, after the patient was 20 years old.
Neither radiologically nor clinically were specific causes for such extensive migration found in this patient.
The incidence of prostate cancer and cases treatable curatively by radical prostatic vesiculectomy is increasing.
The exact pathological examination of the surgical specimens determines the staging and thus the assessment of the prognosis as well as the further clinical procedure.
The lack of a standardized method for processing the preparations internationally makes it difficult to compare different scientific studies.
The well-defined rational preservation of specimens that we propose is intended to address these problems and help improve interdisciplinary dialogue.
The flood of requirements for documentation, performance recording, profitability and quality control, require the use of EDP tools in the clinic.
In the Orthopedic Clinic of the Justus Liebig University, Giessen, a client-server-based surgical planning and documentation system (MedXS) has been in use since 1992 and has been continuously developed.
In addition to the legal requirements, special consideration has been given to the clinical-scientific demands of the clinically active physician.
The application includes the basic functions of patient master data management, OR planning (scheduling of procedures, resource planning), OR documentation (coding of diagnoses and procedures), quality assurance, clinic communication (e-mail, information systems) and clinical word processing.
Due to the simultaneous integration of the WEB server in MedXS, content and functions can be accessed simultaneously via any web browser (NetscapeTM, Internet ExplorerTM) from the intranet or Internet.
With the use of the application, important simplifications of clinical processes have been achieved and far better conditions for budget negotiations with health insurers have been created.
The phenotype of interstitial deletion 4q- is characterized by nonspecific neurological symptoms and facial dysmorphic signs.
However, the presence of congenital leukoderma (piebaldism, partial albinism) is considered relatively typical and usually indicative.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVCM) is a cause of ventricular tachycardia (VT) that should not be underestimated, especially in young patients.
The main focus of therapy is the treatment of ventricular tachycardia and prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death.
In individual patients with pronounced and progressive ARVCM, there is manifest heart failure, which is treated with medication according to standard therapeutic guidelines.
Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a new method to screen a tumor for genetic aberrations.
These are classified as DNA gains and losses and result in a genetic pattern that captures alterations at the chromosomal and subchromosomal levels.
The question of a necessary patella replacement in the context of total knee arthroplasty is generally still very controversial.
In this context, our need to obtain more information about the spontaneous development of a non-replaced patella in the prosthetic setting than just in comparison to the prosthetically fitted patella.
The fact that we have been performing patella replacement only in special cases for almost 5 years has provided us with a patient population on which this issue can be studied.
Using 30 total prosthetic knees documented with 2-year follow-up, we performed a targeted survey of patella shift and tilt, first to the natural and then to the prosthetic femoral patella glide bearing, and related the results to the range of motion achieved after 2 years and to persistent pain symptoms.
Regular adaptation of the bony patellar silhouette to the prosthesis bearing was observed with compression of the marginal bone contact zone with or without a fibrous placeholder layer;
7 patients were classified as a "residual problem group" based on their clinical follow-up because they had residual symptoms (n = 3) or mobility of only 90/0/0 degrees of flexion/extension or less (n = 5).
Only in this group were cases with postoperative shift greater than 5 mm (n = 2) and cases with postoperative tilt greater than 15 degrees (n = 3).
Within this group, discomfort also correlated with a pronounced preoperative tilt and decreased mobility with a severe preoperative shift, also with significant difference to the problem-free collective.
A special case is a patient with severe secondary deterioration of the patellar process (16 mm/39 degrees) due to aseptic tibial prosthesis loosening.
After an axis-correcting change of the tibial components, this patient also regained pain-free and good mobility, without any surgical intervention at the patella and although a considerable residual tilt remained.
It can therefore be concluded that a greater effort is justified for recentering to achieve a residual shift of less than 5 mm:
In addition to common surgical steps during implantation that favorably influence the course of the patella, a high quadriceps displacement or a medially offset refixation of the detached tuberosity may be required, for example.
In contrast, a residual tilt of up to 15 degrees is well tolerated because the non-prosthetic patella has an amazing ability to adapt to the prosthetic bearing by remodeling the bone contour and structure.
However, in the included cases with severe preoperative malalignment, in whom we did not perform replacement because of good peroperative bone quality, we had to accept more late problems even with normalized patellar course.
Whether there is an extended indication for patella replacement in such cases remains an open question.
The VDR quality assurance program and the DGRh quality assurance publications provide the framework for external quality assurance measures.
The introduction of a comprehensive quality management system in a rehabilitation clinic resulted in a measurable increase in quality.
The improvements were achieved by implementing targeted measures and changing clinic structures.
So far, the focus has been on measures related to patient needs and the reappraisal of internal treatment processes.
Rehabilitation-specific training series were conducted to increase employee satisfaction and qualification.
New forward-looking perspectives could be developed together with other partners.
Surgical goal Avoidance or elimination of compression on the nervous structures.
This paper reviews oncocytic metaplasia and neoplasia.
In particular, biochemical, cytochemical and molecular genetic results are discussed.
It is known that defects in the respiratory chain occur more frequently in oncocytic cells of the parathyroid gland and also in the liver in cirrhosis.
However, the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear.
It is likely that oncocytic metaplasias are pathogenetically distinct from oncocytic neoplasms.
In addition, there are organ-dependent differences in the prognosis of oncocytic neoplasms.
For example, oncocytic carcinomas occur preferentially in the thyroid gland, whereas they are comparatively rare in other organs.
The molecular genetic mechanisms responsible for this are still largely unknown.
We present a case of acrodermatitis enteropathica-like skin lesions in a patient on long-term parenteral nutrition.
Similar to autosomal recessive acrodermatitis enteropathica, this patient's skin lesions are also due to zinc deficiency of the organism.
The substitution of zinc leads to an impressive improvement.
Fifty-three patients with psoriasis, 24 patients with atopic dermatitis, and a skin-healthy sample of 52 individuals are compared with respect to their sexual behavior.
The test procedures used were questionnaires on sexual behavior according to Arentewicz and a separate questionnaire on sexuality and partnership.
The examined skin patients differ significantly from skin healthy persons in the sense of impaired sexual life.
The exchange of tenderness is highly significant in both sexes, and the ability to orgasm is highly significantly reduced in female patients.
Psoriatic patients feel more impaired compared to patients with atopic dermatitis.
93% of psoriasis patients and 96% of neurodermatitis patients have never been asked about their sex life by their treating physician.
However, for all the problems of addressing this intimate area, the doctor of skin and venereal diseases should be a competent interlocutor for questions concerning the skin disease and its consequences for sexual life.
The conventional radiograph must still be considered the basic examination when there is a clinical question of inflammatory rheumatic disease.
Its information potential not only includes bony inflammatory destructions, but also allows their current activity to be assessed.
Furthermore, the radiograph is able to indicate a clinical relapse situation via the collateral phenomena and to directly and indirectly depict the inflammatory volume increase of the joints and tendon sheaths.
In addition, high-resolution computed tomography, particularly through the detailed imaging of cortical bony structures - complementary to MR -, offers highly specific information for some special questions, especially at the trunk skeleton and at individual large joints, partly for definitive diagnosis, partly also for surgical planning.
This includes the sacroiliac joints, the sternoclavicular joints, and the upper cervical spine.
Nowadays, the treatment of open II degree and III degree tibial fractures with concomitant soft tissue damage includes a wide range of surgical options for primary osteosynthesis.
Via the external fixator, the undrilled intramedullary nail to primary bone shortening with subsequent callus distraction, this is done under the primacy of soft tissue coverage.
Only through the successes associated with this has it been possible in recent decades to significantly reduce the previously high rate of invalidating amputations and infections.
While initially only isolated observations were made, there was increasing evidence that these patients frequently had soft tissue problems in the lower leg, ranging from recurrent swelling to leg ulcers.
Based on a clinical examination using venous occlusion plethysmography in 80 patients from the injury years 1985-1994 and in comparison with 50 healthy subjects, it was shown that more than 50% of all patients suffered clinically relevant damage to the venous system as a result of the accident.
The severity of this damage ranges from a simple swelling tendency to leg ulcers, which gain in clinical relevance with increasing temporal distance to the accident event.
Strict adherence to surgical guidelines in primary care is required to prevent further damage, including iatrogenic damage, and postoperative prophylaxis is indicated.
Operative objective Correction of bony meta-epiphyseal malalignments of the tibia by corticotomy and gradual distraction.
Restoration of form and function of the limb.
Mucins are highly glycosylated glycoproteins that have a variety of antigenic determinants consisting of carbohydrates and/or peptide sequences.
The use of monoclonal antibodies and lectins in immunohistochemistry provided extensive insights into their topography in the context of histogenesis.
In addition, typical changes in antigen profiles during neoplastic transformation of cells and tissues could be described.
A number of recent findings further suggest that mucin-associated antigens play a significant role in tumor biology, for example, in metastasis and as prognostic markers.
The present work, including our own findings, reviews gastrointestinal mucin antigens in experimental and clinical pathology.
The establishment of rheumatism centers in Germany in recent years has made it possible to network outpatient and inpatient care with the general practitioners, internal medicine and orthopedic rheumatologists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and psychologists working in these centers, as well as acute care and rehabilitation clinics.
In the long term, rheumatology control centers can help to further improve cooperation between all physicians, therapists and clinics involved in the care of rheumatism patients and to ensure continuous and long-term treatment and care of chronic rheumatism patients in the sense of comprehensive rheumatology quality management, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Despite an increasing incidence of medicolegal problems, knowledge about the nature and frequency of medical errors after thyroid surgery is low.
Analysis of a collective of 21,515 complaint cases from the period 1975-1998 in the area of the medical associations of North Rhine and Baden-Württemberg revealed 222 complaints (1%) after thyroid surgery.
The number of complaints increased exponentially during the observation period.
In 36 cases (16%), the expert committees found treatment errors.
The complaint involved the surgeon in 95%, the anesthesiologist in 2%, both disciplines in 3%, and an otolaryngologist once.
Of the complaints, 90% related to complications after routine thyroid surgery.
Complications typical of surgery, such as recurrent paresis (50%), hypoparathyroidism (14%), postoperative hemorrhage (3%), and late recurrence (1%), together accounted for 63% of treatment error allegations but only 31% of confirmed treatment errors.
Atypical complications such as neurologic deficits (10%), infections (5%), left nodes (4%), scar problems (5%) accounted for 37% of allegations but 70% of treatment failures.
Educational deficiencies were present in only 11% of the treatment errors identified.
A finding of treatment error was particularly common when a repeat surgery was required (p < 0.001), when the surgical goal was not achieved (p < 0.001), or when a complication was followed by an error in postoperative care (p < 0.001).
The field of "environment and health" is characterized by an interdisciplinary character and a resulting high need for communication.
To make matters worse, there are sometimes significant problems in obtaining information.
A comparison of national problem-solving strategies in the form of electronic networking activities in this field has led to the development project for a European information and communication platform for this area.
Recognized indications include bilateral renal tumors, renal tumors in patients with functional and anatomic single kidneys, and in patients with impaired renal function who are at risk of renal failure requiring dialysis after tumor nephrectomy (imperative indications).
Surgical strategy improvements - such as perfusion in hypothermia and work-bench surgery can also save patients with multiple and advanced renal tumors from nephrectomy with subsequent dialysis in over 95% of cases.
Influenced by the excellent five-year survival rates of more than 80% after organ-preserving renal tumor surgery in imperative indications, more and more centers recommend the extension of parenchymal-sparing renal tumor surgery to a selected patient population with contralateral healthy kidney (elective indications).
However, with an incidence of bilateral renal carcinomas of only 2%, the benefit of elective resection appears small.
The prognosis after manifestation of local recurrences is in most cases infaust.
Carcinoma-associated retinopathy (CAR) represents a rare paraneoplastic syndrome that has been most commonly described in small cell lung cancer.
We report 3 patients with CAR in the presence of breast carcinoma and carcinoid of the cervix uteri, respectively.
Background and Question.
In order to develop rational treatment guidelines, the pathogen and resistance situation of potentially bacterially caused skin diseases was recorded.
The combination of UVB therapy with topical application of vitamin D analogues is a recognized standard procedure for the treatment of psoriasis.
This regime is not only effective, but above all has few side effects.
The following is a report on a patient who experienced pronounced, long-lasting hyperpigmentation in the healed psoriasis lesions as a result of this combination treatment.
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the standard therapy for urolithiasis.
With largely the same technical principles, different lithotriptors have been developed.
Current discussion focuses on the so-called clinically insignificant residual fragments and the likelihood of recurrence, which make appropriate metaphylaxis further useful.
While the side effects are known and calculable, comparative studies on the use of ESWL alongside other forms of therapy are still pending.
After treatment of a fibrin reaction in the anterior segment of the eye by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), acute corneal calcifications were observed clinically in isolated cases.
The previously unknown pathomechanism prompted us to conduct the following investigations.
The co-occurrence of pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF-ET) and active tuberculosis disease can have far-reaching, life-threatening consequences.
In our case report we present the symptoms, diagnosis and therapy of a patient with exacerbated tuberculosis after IVF pregnancy.
various options are discussed.
The AB0 blood groups, first described by Karl Landsteiner in 1901, can be genotyped using a method developed by Lee and Chang [6] using the polymerase chain reaction.
By using two primer pairs, allele-specific sequences can be amplified and visualized after restriction digestion on a polyacrylamide gel using silver staining.
The following allele frequencies could be determined in a southwestern German population:
Allele A = 0.2704, allele B = 0.0741, and allele 0 = 0.6556.
In 10 of 280 individuals examined (3.57%), the assay method chosen here, which considers only nucleotide positions 261 and 703, showed a deviation of the AB0 genotype from the phenotype, since differentiation between the A and 02 alleles is not possible.
Chondropathia patellae does not usually require arthroscopic evaluation.
The fact that exceptions must apply is demonstrated by the following case studies.
A 12-year-old boy complained of pain at the proximal/lateral patellar facet after a soccer game.
Arthroscopically, it was a firm, nodular, connective tissue-transformed hematoma that could be easily removed with a Hol :
During the soccer game, there had been an apparent hemorrhage due to contusion or patellar subluxation.
The boy was symptom-free after arthroscopy, and the muscle atrophy regressed rapidly.
Two-thirds of all patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) develop radiologically detectable erosions during the course of their disease.
Glucocorticoids initially have a rapid and sustained effect on the symptoms of inflammation in the short and medium term.
Data are presented that suggest a more long-term effect (longer than one year).
Recent studies clearly demonstrate a retarding effect on joint destruction in RA.
By distinguishing the short-term effects of anti-inflammation from the long-term effects on joint destruction, these recent studies provide additional insight into the pathophysiological processes underlying the disease.
The results of these therapeutic clinical trials support the view that inflammation and joint destruction are parallel processes that are loosely connected by the underlying causes of RA, but to some extent develop independently.
It is interesting to speculate whether these different effects of glucocorticoids might relate to different mechanisms, illustrated elsewhere in this symposium.
Ejaculated sperm and spermatogenesis cells express - and -chains of 1-, 3-, and 4-integrins and their ligands fibronectin and laminin.
Adhesion molecules (AM) show marked intra- and interindividual variation and different localizations on the sperm surface.
The "nested" polymerase chain reaction was able to detect mRNA transcripts of these molecules in ejaculated human sperm.
To date, it is unclear whether AMs have functional relevance for sperm-oocyte or other sperm-contact cell interactions or represent only "biological redundancy" or final insurance.
Sperm AM labeling was modified by progesterone, human follicular fluid, disintegration of sperm plasma membrane in seminal plasma, and microorganisms.
Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a hormone with a diverse spectrum of action produced and secreted by the pineal gland under the influence of -adrenergic receptors.
The release of the hormone follows a circadian rhythm with low, steady levels during the day and an evening rise and nighttime peak between 2:00 and 4:00 am.
In addition, independent of a receptor system, melatonin has the ability to diffuse freely across cell membranes and act as a free radical scavenger in both the extracellular and intracellular space due to its strong lipophilic properties.
The affinity for the highly damaging hydroxyl radical is particularly high.
In dermatology, there are prospects for melatonin in some skin diseases such as atopic eczema, psoriasis and malignant melanoma.
The influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect.
In topical application, melatonin has a suppressive effect on the formation of UV erythema.
Some evidence is available on penetration properties through the skin and oral availability, which can be supplemented by further studies of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.
The importance of nuclear medicine diagnostics in chronic inflammation lies, on the one hand, in the availability of highly sensitive radiopharmaceuticals that allow localization of a focus of inflammation when the focus is unclear, given the possibility of whole-body scintigraphy and the SPECT technique, and, on the other hand, in the availability of highly specific radiopharmaceuticals that allow, for example, evidence of leukocytic infiltration.
Both of these procedural approaches are each complementary to radiographic morphologic procedures, which can further specify a focus found or follow up with inflammatory scintigraphy if the findings are unclear.
Background and Question.
Cryosurgery has long been established as a method of treating capillary infant hemangiomas.
Surprisingly, however, detailed studies demonstrating its effectiveness in tumors regularly subject to spontaneous regression are lacking to date.
The patient's prognosis depends on both the primary, mechanical brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage.
Causes of secondary brain injury are discussed as inflammatory processes in addition to intracranial space-occupying lesions due to posttraumatic hemorrhage and edema, and the resulting ischemia.
In both isolated SHT and after polytrauma with and without brain injury, an inflammatory "systems response" (SIRS) involving cytokines and other inflammatory mediators can lead to single- or multiple-organ failure (MOF).
Individual injury components and functional disorders can usually be survived, but their combination and accumulation can be fatal.
Hypermetabolic states after SHT are also conceived as interactions of the CNS with the whole organism involving the neuroendocrine axis.
These effects of SHT on the rest of the organism must be contrasted with the impact of multiple injuries to a polytrauma injured person on brain function, where shock-related perfusion abnormalities may cause prognosis-limiting hypoxia of the brain.
In addition, the generalized "whole body inflammatory response" affects blood clotting, metabolism, and fracture healing.
Knowledge of trauma-induced, bidirectional, inflammatory interactions between the brain and the whole organism, as well as the influence of currently applied therapeutic measures, is still insufficient and requires further elucidation.
Ultimately, from this point of view, the choice of the right time for secondary interventions that do not directly serve to preserve life and lead to an additional burden on the patient due to the surgical trauma must also be reconsidered.
This paper attempts to summarize important aspects in this field.
For better differentiation between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, but also for early detection of prostate cancer, molecular forms of PSA and more recently human kallikrein 2 (hK2) have proven to be valuable decision support tools.
Children with facial clefts are at increased risk of further malformation.
The heart and most other organ systems can be affected.
Literature data on the incidence of cardiac defects vary considerably.
46 psychotherapy dropouts have been contrasted with 599 completers and examined with regard to conspicuous personality traits.
They were also asked by questionnaire about their personal reasons for dropping out.
Erythrokeratolysis hiemalis, keratolytic winter erythema, or Oudtshoorn skin has been described as an early childhood manifest dominant hereditary dermatosis with partial circine reed erythema particularly in families from the Oudtshoorn district of South Africa.
The seasonal association with the winter months and the characteristic histologically multiforme findings distinguish this dermatosis from other erythematosquamous diseases of childhood.
We demonstrate clinical, histologic, and initial immunohistologic findings in a 4-year-old patient that fit well with erythrokeratolysis hiemalis.
Ancestors from the endemic area could not be determined.
17 studies on the efficacy of acupuncture in chronic polyarthritis (CP), spondarthropathies (SPA), lupus erythematosus (LE), localized and systemic scleroderma (SD) were reviewed for their results and scientific quality.
The vast majority of the papers reviewed reveal significant deficiencies.
The purpose of this study was to examine whether visual acuity decreases as a function of presentation time and whether normal subjects and nystagmus patients are disadvantaged by these rules in driving assessments.
Sudeck's syndrome affects an extremity after microtrauma or surgery.
Currently, there is no consensus on the pathogenesis of Sudeck's syndrome.
In 1942, Paul Sudeck postulated that the symptomatology of Sudeck's syndrome was caused by an excessive inflammatory response to injury or surgery to an extremity.
His theory did not find supporters, as most of the medical profession believes that Sudeck's syndrome is caused by a hyperactive sympathetic nervous system.
We performed various clinical and experimental studies and also recorded the effects of antiphlogistic therapy.
The results of these studies support the theory put forward by Paul Sudeck.
In this paper, we present methods for applying fast multislice spiral CT for cardiac imaging using ECG-synchronized spiral acquisition.
Computed tomography enables superimposition-free imaging of the maxilla and mandible in addition to the radiological examination procedures commonly used in dentistry.
In addition to the already established use of CT in malignant diseases, its use in other problems has proven successful.
If the examination is performed with a layer thickness of less than 1.5 mm, the shape and position of impacted teeth in the jawbone and the damage to permanent teeth caused by impacted teeth can be assessed, so that early therapy is possible.
If the periodontal gap of the impacted tooth can be demarcated, orthodontic classification is possible.
In the case of inflammatory dental diseases, the horizontal and vertical bone resorption must be determined precisely.
The morphology and extent of benign cystic space lesions can be assessed by CT.
Before an intended implantological treatment, the therapy can be optimized by precisely considering the remaining bone substance and the location of nerves and foramina.
If implantation is possible, the location, shape and number of implants can be determined.
Septic encephalopathy (SE) occurs in up to 70% of patients with sepsis.
Case studies are used to describe the symptomatology of SE.
The leading symptom is a clouding of consciousness up to coma.
Cranial computed tomography is also usually normal; generalized cerebral edema may occur.
The electroencephalogram shows a general change, the extent of which correlates with the degree of SE.
Mediator-mediated defense responses of the organism to bacterial products as well as bacteremia itself are major etiologic factors.
Due to a disturbance in amino acid metabolism, the neurotransmitter profile in the brain is altered.
A variety of other factors such as electrolyte shifts, hyperthermia, hypoglycemia, shock and ischemia, and hepatic and renal failure may be involved in the development of encephalopathy.
Since early adequate therapy of sepsis is of crucial prognostic importance, SE as a possible initial symptom of sepsis is of particular diagnostic significance.
Endogenous endophthalmitis in severe general disease and reduced general condition has a ‰uﬂvery poor prognosis despite modern antibacterial, antifungal, and surgical therapy.
Films tell stories.
The scenes in which people are confronted with decision-making conflicts are particularly suspenseful.
Medical-ethical conflicts do not only appear in medical series or disease portrayals, but often in genres in which this topic is hardly suspected:
Comedies, westerns, romance films, gangster and crime films.
By staging such conflicts and offering solutions, films draw on moral values and at the same time are seismographs for the social relevance of medical ethical topics.
However, in film, ethical principles of decision-making can fall victim to the dramaturgy of the plot.
An analysis of the conflict situations presented is similar to a medical ethics case discussion and is a helpful supplement for teaching analytical and communication skills.
The reduction in the rate of restenosis compared with conventional PTCA has resulted in stent implantation becoming the most commonly performed initial intervention.
Therefore, in-stent restenosis - especially the long-stretch form - is a significant clinical and economic problem today.
We developed an analytic model to compare the consequences of initial stent implantation and initial angioplasty with respect to these aspects, taking into account the differences between focal and diffuse in-stent restenosis.
The prehospital management of amputation injuries places great demands on the emergency medical services.
In addition to the initial treatment of the injured person, the initial treatment of the amputee in amputation injuries is often decisive for the success of the reconstructive measures.
The primary goal of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is to analyze the submucosally located structures that are not accessible to laryngoscopic evaluation.
Accordingly, the general rule is to perform diagnostic imaging of the larynx with knowledge of the findings of endoscopic diagnostics.
The topographical-anatomical relationships of the skeleton, internal structures, and surroundings of the larynx will be synoptically presented.
Transpedicular stabilization with a screw-ring ligament system resolved the instability with segmental functional preservation.
In recent years, new insights have been gained into the posttraumatic changes following traumatic brain injury (SHT) and the associated pathophysiological relationships.
In addition to appropriate changes in neurotrauma intensive care management, this has led to the development of pharmaceuticals designed to reduce the incidence of secondary damage in the brain-injured patient.
In the context of this work, the recent findings of the pathophysiological changes after SHT and the principle pharmacological intervention options are discussed.
While some of the drugs are already in clinical use, others are in variously advanced experimental and clinical trial stages.
Background and Question.
Stage IV melanoma patients with progressive disease present a significant problem for the oncologic dermatologist.
The aim of the present work was to review the effects of mild oral chemotherapy with trofosfamide on the disease course of out-of-treatment melanoma patients.
A well-known side effect of minocycline is hyperpigmentation of the skin.
The 54-year-old patient had been taking minocycline prophylactically for pulmonary silicosis for more than 3 years before symptomless blackish spots appeared on his face.
In the other patient, gray-black spots appeared on both lower legs after only 6 months of minocycline because of folliculitis.
A trial treatment with the ruby laser resulted in regression of pigmentation in the treated area in this patient.
The different clinical and histological forms of minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation are discussed based on the case reports.
Operative objective Elimination of the deformity of a digitus quintus superductus et varus.
Microsurgical techniques have led to improvements in functional and morphologic reconstructions in the facial region in recent years.
A major factor in this is the recovery of neuronal abilities.
In this study, the sensory regenerative capacity of the inferior alveolar nerve was followed up after partial tumor surgical resection and reconstruction with the vascular pedicled thoracic longus nerve.
Sensation of pressure and pain could be felt as early as 3 months, touch and vibration as early as 5 months, and thermal stimuli as early as 7 months postoperatively.
Thus, the vascular pedicled thoracic nerve longus represents a suitable nerve graft for bridging resection-related defects of the inferior alveolar nerve in tumor patients.
Ingestion of acetaminophen (acetaminophen, N-acetyl-aminophenol) has been shown to be the most common cause of intentional overdose of the drug in the United States and the United Kingdom, yet only a relatively small number of overdoses result in serious complications.
Severe liver toxicity must be expected in any patient in whom the standard dosage has been exceeded and the minimum hepatotoxic dose is 125 mg/kg (7.5 g or fifteen 500 mg tablets in a 60 kg patient).
In such cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated as soon as possible.
Furthermore, any patient in whom the magnitude or timing of overdose is unknown should be treated completely with N-acetylcysteine regardless of their serum levels.
In all cases, treatment with N-acetylcysteine must be continued if liver function worsens.
At the onset of severe hepatotoxicity, a specialist should be consulted to ensure optimal therapy or immediate transfer in case of acute liver failure.
In the most difficult cases, liver transplantation has remarkably improved the fate of a previously incurable group of patients, but further improvement can only be made by closer cooperation between the referring hospitals and the specialized facilities for liver disease.
Background and Question.
Itching is an accompanying symptom of numerous dermatoses and internal diseases that is difficult to treat.
In recent years, capsaicin, an alkaloid from the bell pepper plant, has been recommended as an alternative treatment option.
Capsaicin, when applied topically, blocks unmyelinated polymodal C and A nerve fibers after an initial phase of neurogenic inflammation, thereby selectively suppressing itch and pain.
Chronic testalgia represents a urologic clinical picture that is problematic both diagnostically and therapeutically.
The success rates of conservative and surgical treatment options are low, 55-73% and 10-40%, respectively.
We report microsurgical testicular denervation as a surgical alternative for refractory testalgia.
12 patients were treated surgically by spermatic cord neurolysis after adequate environmental diagnosis:
The cremasteric muscle is transected using bipolar diathermy, and the adventitia of the testicular artery is detached under microsurgical conditions over a stretch length of 2-3 cm.
At a median follow-up of 20.6 (4-62) months, 11/12 patients (92%) are symptom-free.
Intra- and postoperative complications were not observed.
Based on our experience, microsurgical spermatic cord neurolysis should be included in therapeutic considerations for patients with chronic testalgia.
However, the high success rate of our surgical procedure can only be maintained if the indication is precise, so that an exact surrounding diagnosis to exclude a specific genesis of the testalgia is indispensable.
In neurosurgery, too, the trend is toward less and less invasive surgical techniques to avoid major trepanations, minimize preparative traumatization of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, and thus minimize the risk of neurological and psychological disorders.
Hospitalization and incapacity for work can thus often be shortened.
Essential "minimally invasive" procedure is neuroendoscopy.
With its preformed cavities, the cerebral ventricles and the subarachnoid space, the brain offers good conditions for the use of the endoscope.
The most common indication for neuroendoscopic surgery is occlusive hydrocephalus.
However, arachnoid cysts, cystic tumors, and smaller intraventricular masses can also be effectively treated endoscopically through a small burr hole.
By using special instruments, lasers and bipolar electrodes, even highly vascularized processes, such as cavernomas, can be completely removed.
In addition, endoscopes are also used for a number of spinal conditions and carpal tunnel syndrome, as well as adjunctive microsurgery.
The aim of this work was to measure the diffusion coefficient (ADC) by diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in vertebral metastases and in MR-morphologically inconspicuous vertebral bodies.
DW-MRI measures the ADC specific to a tissue, which corresponds to the self-diffusion of hydrogen molecules.
In cell-rich tumor tissue with numerous intracellular and intercellular membranes (i.e., diffusion barriers), a low ADC is expected; in cell-poor or necrotic tissue, a high ADC is expected.
A 53-year-old man was found to have a melanotic lung tumor that had completely occluded the left main bronchus and whose base was located in the bronchus of the left lower lobe.
Laser therapy was followed by cuff resection of the left lower lobe of the lung.
Based on histologic and immunohistochemical findings, the tumor was classified as malignant melanoma.
The medical history did not reveal any evidence of previous removal of a skin, mucosal, or ocular lesion.
Targeted examinations of the skin and eye also revealed no evidence of a primary tumor localized there.
Thus, the neoplasm is considered a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract, of which 21 cases are considered confirmed to date.
The patient is tumor-free after the relatively short observation period of about 10 months.
To date, no experience is available on twilight vision after LASIK.
We therefore examined twilight vision before and after LASIK to correct myopia.
In recent years, dobutamine street echocardiography has become established as a standard method for noninvasive ischemia diagnosis.
With ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging, identical pharmacologic stress protocols currently used in echocardiography can be performed.
HLA-DR antigens of the cornea are lost during organ culture storage.
This work investigated whether this was a down-regulation of HLA-DR antigen or a loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans (LZ) cells.
DNA cytometry has become a routine diagnostic technique used preferentially in breast carcinoma to assess ploidy and proliferation kinetics (cell cycle analysis).
In this context, static cytometry (microscope cytometry) is inferior to flow cytometry for reasons of lower informative value.
Flow cytometry requires a standardized and methodologically sound technique with a low coefficient of variation (CV) for S-phase determination.
The obtained parameters, in 1st line the S-phase and the proliferation index, in 2nd line also the ploidy, represent prognostically and for therapy planning important factors.
A thorough knowledge of the method and the possibilities of error is essential for the interpretation of the results.
The extent to which immunohistological techniques for determining proliferation kinetics provide equivalent information must be considered unresolved at this time.
Further developments concern the introduction of multiparametric investigations and improvement of the mathematical analysis of the measured values.
Injection therapy has significant value in cervical syndromes.
This article deals on the one hand with general requirements and on the other hand with the various practical procedures for injection.
Abstract The coverage of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for HIV by public health insurance is unclear, although the question of coverage by private health insurance will not be considered.
The regulations on disease prevention (§ 20 SGB V), preventive medical services (§ 23 SGB V) and health examinations (§ 25 SGB V) will not be considered as legal bases for the assumption of costs.
PEP is health treatment in the sense of § 27 SGB V. However, the special form of treatment PEP has not yet been included in the regular financing of health insurance, as corresponding recommendations of the federal committees are missing.
It would be desirable if appropriate recommendations were adopted soon to eliminate legal uncertainty in this area.
Under certain circumstances, an obligation to assume costs may be considered according to the principles of the legal concept of so-called new examination and treatment methods.
In themselves, however, the German-Austrian recommendations on PEP need to be concretized with regard to indication and mode of application and freed from ambiguities.
If a physician does not use PEP for an indication according to the German-Austrian recommendations, this will not be a treatment error, because from a scientific point of view there are still too many uncertainties.
The HLA-DR antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology.
Organ culture storage results in loss of HLA-DR-positive corneal Langerhans cells.
The present work investigates the significance of prolonged corneal storage time for the success of penetrating keratoplasty.
Based on our own experience with 3-dimensional echocardiography, we also attempted to reconstruct ultrasonographic transfontanular studies in 3 dimensions and to investigate their information content.
Hypopyon uveitis has been described as a dose-dependent side effect in AIDS patients treated systemically with rifabutin for Mycobacterium avium complex infection.
We report a 37-year-old female patient who developed heterotopic ossifications at 5 major body joints with almost complete stiffening after intensive therapy for a total of 105 days with 72 days of ventilation.
The reason for intensive therapy was a double lung transplantation for severe pulmonary hypertension.
Resection of the ossifications in the right shoulder and equilateral elbow and both hip joints restored mobility.
Heterotopic ossifications are common and occur especially post-traumatically, after spinal cord injuries, after SHT, in intoxications and in long-term coma.
Although the exact pathomechanism is unknown, a transformation of mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts and chondroblasts is assumed, which then cause new bone formation.
The diagnosis is made with the help of imaging techniques.
Prophylactic drug treatment using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), radiation, or a combination of both procedures can be performed.
We report on a patient with chronic discoid lupus erythematosus (CDLE) in whom we first used the argon laser for local therapy.
The patient suffered from long-standing skin lesions that could not be influenced by established treatment strategies, if at all.
After application of the argon laser, complete and permanent healing occurred in the area of the treated lesions.
Histologic and immunohistologic findings suggest that vascular-mediated effects of the argon laser are important for the observed effect in LE-related discoid lesions.
In these case reports, the efficacy of argon laser in the treatment of refractory discoid skin lesions in lupus erythematosus is demonstrated for the first time.
Complications of viral hepatitis represent the most common indication for liver transplantation overall.
For the affected patient, it is often the only life-saving option.
Prophylaxis of HBV reinfection by polyclonal human antibodies to HBsAg alone or in combination with the nucleoside analog lamivudine is effective but expensive.
Reinfection in hepatitis C occurs regularly in all patients and has a more favorable prognosis compared with HBV reinfection.
Effective reinfection prophylaxis for hepatitis C has not yet been established and requires extensive study.
In hepatitis C, after reinfection, the prognosis for the graft is less favorable, whereas the 5-year survival rate is comparable to other benign nonviral indications.
Paratesticular sarcomas are rare.
We discuss this entity using a case study as well as the existing literature.
Therapy for these tumors consists of surgical resection and possibly adjuvant radiotherapy.
An exception is rhabdomyosarcoma, which also responds well to chemotherapy.
Catheter ablation for preexcitation syndrome is an interventional treatment with curative intent.
Accessory pathways between structures of the specific or working myocardium are the anatomic prerequisites for orthodromic or antidromic reentrant tachycardias of varying incidence, duration, and frequency.
Understanding the mechanism of tachycardia and the role of the accessory pathway in tachycardia, identifying its topography, the function of the other structures of the excitation conduction system, and detecting other para-specific fibers are prerequisites for successful catheter ablation.
Abnormalities of the tricuspid valve or coronary sinus and coincident diseases of the heart should be investigated by echocardiography before the intervention and, if necessary, with contrast imaging at the beginning of the procedure.
In 300 patients with different variants of preexcitation syndrome own results of catheter ablation are presented.
In order to achieve a qualitatively better recording of complication occurrences in orthopedics and to have comparable statistics over years, a standardization of the nomenclature and classification of complication diagnoses is necessary.
The Heidelberg University Orthopaedic Hospital Foundation has maintained a complete consented registry of all early complications of all inpatients since January 1, 1997.
Complications are prospectively recorded by the medical staff in a complication program according to a standardized nomenclature, and the information is checked, corrected, supplemented and classified by the hospital's quality management department.
The guideline is intended to contribute to the discussion on a standard in the recording and evaluation of complications in orthopedics with the aim of building consensus.
Acrobullous PUVA-induced dermatosis is characterized by the appearance of blisters on the acral area in the advanced stages of PUVA therapy.
Pathophysiologically, an impairment of dermoepidermal coherence, which obligatorily occurs in the course of treatment, is likely to underlie this, which becomes clinically manifest in the form of bulging blisters as a result of mechanical stress.
Acrobullous photodermatosis must be differentiated from phototoxic reactions that occur as a result of excessive UVA irradiation or excessive psoralen concentrations.
Based on two cases, the clinic, pathophysiology and differential diagnosis of this clinical picture is presented.
Apart from autopsy-proven findings of fibrolipomatous replacement right ventricular myocardium, no confirmed clinical signs of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy (ARVD) currently exist.
In 1994, criteria for the clinical diagnosis of ARVD were developed by members of the working groups of the ISFC and the European Society of Cardiology.
These criteria include structural, functional, histologic, and electrophysiologic features, which have been divided into major and minor criteria.
The following study of 24 patients with histologically confirmed diagnosis of ARVD from the Jean Rostand Hospital in Ivry-sur-Seine, France, will be used to verify the value of the developed criteria.
Global or segmental dilatations of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be detected in 20 patients (83%) by angiography, or echocardiography.
4 patients (16%) had only incidental criteria on radionuclide scintigraphy or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental right ventricular kinetics abnormalities.
In all patients, typical fibrolipomatous replacement of right ventricular myocardium was detected histologically.
T-inversions in right precordial leads as secondary criteria were present in 17 patients (71%).
Localized QRS widening of more than 110msec in V1 to V3 was found in 8 patients (33%), and an epsilon wave in 6 patients (25%) as major criteria.
Late potential analysis by signal-averaging ECG was present in only 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases (50%) in terms of minor criteria.
Left bundle-branch block-like ventricular tachycardia, classified as incidental criteria, was detected in 23 patients (96%);
only one patient died of progressive right heart failure without proven arrhythmias.
A history of unexpected sudden cardiac death in the family as a secondary criterion was obtained in 3 of 19 patients (15%).
The developed task force criteria for the diagnosis of ARVD led to the diagnosis of the disease in all 24 cases, although the importance of a confirmed histological diagnosis was of particular value.
Without adding histologic data, the clinical diagnosis could be made in only 10 cases.
The question remains whether a more favorable classification of findings into major and minor criteria makes a purely clinical diagnosis more feasible.
Clear data demonstrate that severe hypoglycemia worsens the prognosis of acute stroke.
In contrast, the impact of acute hyperglycemia in cerebral ischemia is controversial.
The conflicting results of clinical and experimental studies can be partially explained when different stroke types are considered separately and the time course of blood glucose levels during the acute event is taken into account.
Hyperglycemia appears to increase neuronal damage in the subacute phase of cerebral ischemia if insufficient collateral supply is present.
Furthermore, the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is increased during this period.
In contrast, acute elevation of blood glucose may protect nervous tissue from structural damage by improving substrate supply if there is only a moderate decrease in cerebral blood flow.
This situation is present in the penumbra region and with a good collateral supply.
We therefore hypothesize that both the negative and positive effects of acute hyperglycemia are dependent on local cerebral blood flow.
We present a noninvasive protocol for epilepsy surgery diagnosis, according to which 50 of 173 patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies underwent resective epilepsy surgery.
Localization agreement of findings from noninvasive EEG video monitoring, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), interictal positron emission tomography (PET), and ictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) formed the basis of focal localization.
78% (n=39) of all 50 patients became seizure-free or had seizures very rarely.
Extratemporal resections could be performed without invasive EEG studies if circumscribed MRI lesions were present and the resections could be performed at a sufficient distance from the eloquent cortex.
We conclude from our results that in a number of selected patients with pharmacoresistant focal epilepsies, especially temporal epilepsies, noninvasive EEG recordings are sufficient in presurgical diagnosis and thus the risk of invasive EEG examinations can be avoided.
Medical history and clinical findings:
A 61-year-old male patient presented to an out-of-hospital clinic with new-onset tachyarrhythmia absoluta.
Echocardiographically, an intracardiac mass was initially suspected, which should be further clarified by transesophageal echocardiography.
The ECG showed tachyarrhythmia absoluta with frequencies up to 146/min, and sinus rhythm was also documented intermittently.
This was also confirmed on chest radiography as a large mass in projection to the posterior mediastinum, projecting laterally beyond the right mediastinal margin.
Due to the displacing growth of the cyst with triggering of atrial arrhythmias and to exclude malignant degeneration for sure, the cyst was removed surgically by anterolateral thoracotomy.
The patient has been in sinus rhythm since then and complains only of isolated "dropouts" most likely in the sense of isolated ventricular extrasystoles.
Primarily harmless atrial arrhythmias may also be due to rare causes such as thoracic, extracardiac or even intracardiac masses, which require specific therapy.
An overview of the development of intrathoracic cysts is provided.
Acute cranial nerve palsies can have a variety of causes.
A rare trigger of paresis of one or multiple cranial nerves is a dissection of the internal carotid artery.
Early recognition of carotid dissection even in the presence of atypical symptoms is important because timely initiation of anticoagulant therapy may prevent stroke secondary to dissection-related embolism.
We report 2 patients with lesions of the paracavernous cranial nerves (Raeder syndrome) and the caudal cranial nerves (Collet-Siccard syndrome) secondary to dissection of the internal carotid artery.
In addition to the cranial and caudal cranial nerves involved in our cases, deficits of the middle cranial nerves (VI-VIII) have also been described, so that any painful sudden cranial nerve deficiency must also suggest carotid dissection.
The malapposition of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the rarest coronary anomalies, often remains asymptomatic until old age, but can also become clinically manifest in infancy and lead to sudden cardiac death.
We report on the diagnosis and surgical therapy in a 15-month-old asymptomatic child, as well as the need for surgical correction.
The tentative diagnosis arose incidentally during echocardiographic procedures, and the confirmatory diagnosis was made by coronary angiography.
The operation consisted of replantation of the coronary artery defect without the use of extracorporeal circulation.
The postoperative course was without complications.
The indication for surgical correction is recommended even in asymptomatic cases, because of the coronary steal phenomenon and the associated coronary risk.
Surgical treatment of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement (AO classification 41 A1, B1-3, and C1-3) places high demands on traumatologic management.
The use of modern, minimally invasive surgical methods in the treatment of fractures close to the joint offers, among other things, the possibility of achieving a good functional result through minimal soft tissue trauma caused by surgery.
The goal is to achieve at least exercise stability, even in comparison with standard procedures.
Thus, in addition to the low operative soft tissue trauma, the exact intraoperative assessment of the joint surfaces and the possibility of simultaneous treatment of intra-articular concomitant injuries are of particular advantage through arthroscopy compared to conventional procedures.
Of a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures, arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients in our clinic between September 1993 and January 1998.
Follow-up of a total of 17 patients showed overall good results according to the Lysholm and Delamarter scores.
In a select patient population, we consider arthroscopically assisted minimally invasive osteosynthesis to be appropriate even for fractures of AO classification 41 C1-3.
We report a 72-year-old patient who developed bilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy without other neurologic deficits after moderate traumatic brain injury, which resolved completely clinically within 3 months.
Because computed tomography did not demonstrate a basilar skull fracture in the posterior fossa, we discuss bilateral strain of the hypoglossal nerve as a possible pathogenetic mechanism.
Chronic venous insufficiency refers to a pathological situation in which blood can no longer be pumped out of the leg veins to a sufficient extent under the conditions of daily life.
The backwater propagates from the large conducting veins through the smallest venules to the area of microcirculation and eventually affects the metabolism of the tissues.
Typical clinical features that can be confirmed secondarily with a simple objective measurement procedure are the most suitable as a basis for classification principles.
Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is defined as angiodermatitis that develops at the base of arteriovenous short circuits.
In the lower extremities, there are usually unilateral skin lesions resembling Kaposi's sarcoma (pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma).
These are accompanied by edema, often severe pain, and rarely hypertrophy of the affected limb.
The clinical picture is often rapidly progressive, leading to ulcerative nodules with bleeding and infectious tendencies.
Causal therapy consists of elimination of the arteriovenous shunts.
Surgery is rarely feasible because of the large number and often small caliber of arteriovenous fistulas.
Superselective embolization is more suitable, but with the risks of ischemia and necrosis.
The successful embolization treatment performed 8 times so far in a 32-year-old female patient with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is reported.
Until now, the exact diagnosis of the very rare primary histiocytoses of the skin was based on electron microscopy (Birbeck granules) and immunohistology on frozen section (CD1a) in addition to clinic and histology on H&E section.
Advances in the development and analysis of paraffin-embedded markers now enable (also retrospective) workup and accurate classification of these diseases on formalin-fixed material.
With antibodies against S-100 protein and by means of the lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA) and PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), the classical cells of Langerhans cell histiocytoses (LZH) can be distinguished from other histiocytic cell systems.
In the so-called non-Langerhans cell histiocytoses (non-LZH), there have been no uniform electron-optical and immunohistochemical characteristics to date.
The infiltrates consist of multiple cell populations that are important for cellular pathobiology (subtypes of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells).
Frequencies and distributions of the different monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and their responses with the corresponding kerosene immunohistochemical markers can vary widely within different clinical entities.
Antibodies against factor XIIIa (shown in the example of xanthoma disseminatum) and the monoclonal antibody Ki-M1P (shown in the example of juvenile xanthogranuloma) seem to have diagnostic significance with regard to differentiation from Langerhans cell histiocytoses.
Both markers show a positive reaction pattern with epithelioid cells typical of the disease process.
In the following, we present a patient who developed an acute GvH-like drug reaction after several weeks of application of allopurinol as well as after re-exposure to this drug.
Verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder (pT4N0M0, G1) developed in a 66-year-old female patient who had chronic interstitial cystitis (IC) with Hunner's ulcers for 10 years.
To date, 7 case reports of non-bilharziasis-associated verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder have been published in the world literature.
Although the development of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder as a complication of IC has not been described to date, the pathomechanism of verrucous carcinoma development appears to be chronic irritation of the urinary bladder.
After exhausting conservative therapeutic options, radical cystectomy and supravesical urinary diversion were performed.
"NoToX Histological Fixative" is offered as a substitute for formalin/formaldehyde for the fixation of tissue samples for histological examinations.
Intraoperative tissue and autopsy-derived organ samples were used to test NoToX.
Conventional histological stains and accepted immunohistological stains, especially for tumor diagnosis, were used.
As a result of these studies, which were performed independently at 3 different institutions, it was found that tissue specimens fixed with NoToX did not show any differences from formalin-fixed tissue specimens with respect to the reproducibility of conventional staining or visualization of immunohistochemical reactions.
NoToX has proven to be a viable substitute for formalin.
Dose quantities such as computed tomography dose index (CTDI), multiple scan average dose (MSAD), and axis dose free in air are commonly used to describe patient radiation exposure in computed tomography.
The CTDI and, derivable from it, the MSAD are a good measure of the absorbed energy doses in the examination volume, but say little about the doses relevant from the physician's and patient's point of view according to the radiation sensitivity of the organs and about the risks.
Axis dose alone is not a good measure of effective dose that allows estimation of risk.
The specification of an upper guide value for the axial dose should take into account the dose requirement of the examination region in order to ensure acceptable image quality on the one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other.
As physical quantities, all 3 quantities are useful for characterizing and differentiating various examination programs and devices with respect to radiation exposure.
Following a report by the World Heart Federation/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (WHF/ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of Cardiomyopathies, the definition of inflammatory myocardial disease was expanded in 1995.
Idiopathic, autoimmune, and infectious forms of cardiomyopathy were newly included in this definition.
Accordingly, a number of infectious agents, such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, cytomegaloviruses, as well as herpesviruses, appear to be involved as important pathogenetic factors in the development of inflammatory myocardial disease and dilatation of the ventricles.
It seems reasonable to assign an independent place to shame as a general human emotion in distinction from guilt.
In addition to the defensive character, the "self"-preserving function of shame should also be taken into account.
The appearance of shame always indicates the protection of the sense of worth, even if it should not be currently apparent in the patient.
The signaling nature of shame is discussed and the question of whether shame symptoms have disease value is considered.
Attention to psychogenesis and unconscious shame dynamics broadens the view of potentially shameful situations in therapy.
This review provides a literature overview of the very inhomogeneous treatment focus of acute psychosocial crises, both in terms of crisis understanding and therapy methods as well as professional competence.
In detail, general treatment models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention, special disorder- and event-specific concepts and work on crisis intervention with children, adolescents and adolescents from the last 10 years are described.
In addition, contributions of empirical psychotherapy research, as far as they are relevant for crisis intervention, are presented with their results.
The definition of cardiomyopathy with and without inflammatory response and the possible involvement of effector mechanisms of the humoral and cellular immune systems in its pathogenesis have been the subject of research in recent years.
Atherosclerotic plaques in acute coronary syndrome show increased inflammatory cells and lower smooth muscle cell density.
The underlying pathogenetic processes are unclear;
increased programmed cell death (apoptosis) is postulated.
Coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina (group 1) and from 24 patients with stable angina (group 2) were examined by immunohistochemistry (TUNEL test for detection of fragmented DNA) and electron microscopy.
The aims of this study were to evaluate possible group differences in the cellular composition of plaques, detect and quantify cell death events, and distinguish apoptosis from necrosis.
In a study in vivo and on - according to the techniques developed by Thiel 1992 - specially fixed cadavers, it was investigated in which positional relation to the balloon the fascia transversalis is located and what happens to it during inflation of the balloon.
In TEP, the fascia can be used at most laterally to the artery as reinforcement of the posterior wall of the inguinal canal or as an abutment for fixation of foreign material (mesh).
We present 2 patients, aged 50 and 84 years, who presented with marked, pruritic, generalized eczematous skin lesions.
The detection of numerous mites in the scale crusts resulted in the diagnosis of scabies norvegica;
an underlying disease could be excluded in both cases.
It is assumed that the therapy of the eczema lasting for months in the sense of an immunosuppression led to the exacerbation of the clinical picture.
Hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers.
The efficacy of hemoglobin solutions in terms of O2 transport and, in particular, effective O2 delivery to tissues has been demonstrated in a variety of situations such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock.
The hemoglobin molecule can be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications.
This results in a clinically useful intravascular half-life of approximately 8-24 h, adequate O2 affinity, and lack of nephrotoxicity.
Some vasoconstriction must be mentioned as a remaining side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated today.
Nevertheless, hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated by humans.
Fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are thus well suited for the transport of O2 and CO2.
This was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution, during extracorporeal circulation, and also under resuscitation.
Perflubron, the most important member of the fluorocarbon emulsion group, has also been used successfully in humans and is well tolerated.
The introduction of artificial oxygen carriers into clinical practice will significantly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of injured patients.
It is expected to be introduced in the next few years.
It is strictly based on clear physical laws and defined physiological regularities.
According to international recommendations, there are a number of generally accepted indications for HBO therapy in which it is either the only causally effective, life-saving form of therapy or an essential, often crucial, therapeutic component of comprehensive, interdisciplinary intensive care therapy.
Among the potential side effects, in addition to barotrauma of the lungs, special consideration should be given to the possibility of central nervous oxygen intoxication.
The clinical application of HBOT therefore requires specific knowledge of its effects, side effects, and risks, a targeted and critical indication, and the skills and abilities to safely manage any complications that arise with intensive or emergency medical measures.
The clinical application of hyperbaric oxygenation with its interdisciplinary, emergency medical or intensive therapeutic character should therefore be able to be an additional, extremely interesting field of activity for the anesthesiologist.
We are interested in the interaction of high-energy ultrasound waves with biological tissues with respect to oncological therapy.
In this paper, the physical and biological aspects are discussed and summarized.
The preliminary results give reason to hope that ultrasound could be used as an additional therapeutic technique for sonically accessible tumors because of its good depth focusing ability.
The experimentally observed ultrasound-induced effects are a function of the applied ultrasound parameters.
New results show that magnetic resonance imaging is suitable for "on-line" monitoring of ultrasound-induced high-temperature hyperthermia.
The possibility of noninvasive MRI temperature measurement may become an important tool for safe and reliable ultrasound therapy.
We recommend that the role of ultrasound therapy of human tumors be reviewed in carefully designed clinical trials.
To demonstrate the long-term effects of prematurity on ophthalmic and otolaryngologic status in a group of extremely small premature infants.
At the orthopedic university hospital in Homburg/Saar, an EDP system has been in use since 1993 for OR and outpatient documentation and to support general clinic organization.
The hardware is a Novell network with DOS or Windows-based PCs as servers and workstations.
The software is a special database application for medical documentation with a module for menu-based coding of diagnoses and procedures according to the requirements of the GSG.
Since its introduction, the data of 31,500 patients have been entered into the system and 8,500 operations have been documented.
If the software is flexible enough, both the requirements of the medical field and those of the administration can be taken into account.
Through further, clinic-wide networking, there is also the possibility at Homburg University Hospital of interdepartmental data exchange and the use of scientific networks as well as the Internet.
As a result of a critical literature review and a survey of German epilepsy centers on the usual pre- and postoperative drug treatment, the following approach is recommended.
The aim of the study was to determine whether dorzolamide affects accommodation or pupillary response.
Reference is also made to non-medical reasons for the dissatisfaction of (mostly innocent) accident victims with current compensation practices.
The purpose of this study in sheep was to clarify whether the intraarticular concentration of free sulfated and nonsulfated glycosaminoglycans shows a correlation with the extent of experimentally induced arthritic damage, whether there is a temporal correlation, and whether the results can be used to suggest the use of GAG as a prognostic criterion or marker of arthritis.
21 Sheep are randomly divided into 3 groups of 7 animals each:
Knee joints from the contralateral side and knee joints from animals in other approved projects served as controls (n = 54).
Radiological score values between TD vs ME and MV groups were statistically significantly (p < 0.01) different.
Compared to the control group, HA shows a significantly increased value in the ME and MV groups.
For CS, there is a significantly increased level (p < 0.01) both for the measurement 6 months postoperatively in group ME and one year after partial transection.
Clinical consequences:
The HA level allows - at least experimentally - possible, to some extent, a description of the degree of arthrosis.
The concentration increases with greater postoperative interval and increasing degree of damage.
Idiopathic long-QT syndrome may present in childhood with cardiac arrest, syncope, and seizures.
Therapy with -blockers is considered standard therapy for symptomatic patients.
In case of therapy failure, pacemaker implantation or surgical sympathetic blockade may be considered as options.
We report the successful implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in a 95/12-year-old patient.
Described are additions to and use of an epidiascope which, after minor modifications, is suitable for the presentation of organ or organ slices in courses in general and special pathology and saves costly video installations with additional lighting, etc.
Narcissistic problems are common in older age and are of far-reaching significance.
These problems are here related to the instance of the ego ideal and examined from the perspective of the increasing discrepancy between ego and ego ideal in old age.
In three aspects, pathological peaks of the aging process, often present in elderly patients, are shown.
Narcissistic forms of transference in these patients are then described and possibilities and goals in the treatment of elderly patients are discussed.
The treatment results of the Muscle energy technique according to Mitchel for spinal complaints are presented.
Disorders of joint mobility at the pelvis, spine and ribs can be diagnosed with the Muscle energy technique.
The therapy has a high success rate.
The frequency of treatment is low.
The therapy is risk-free for the patient.
It is an alternative to chirotherapeutic techniques with impulse.
We report a 26-year-old female patient with dermatitis herpetiformis Duhring, known since the age of 10, complaining of arthritic knee joint pain, recurrent diarrhea, and sicca symptomatology.
Clinical picture, serological findings and histologies of duodenal mucosa and lip biopsy result in a diagnosis of celiac disease and Sjögren's syndrome.
To our knowledge, a common occurrence of these different clinical pictures has not been described so far.
The introduction of a gluten-free diet leads to a rapid improvement of the clinical symptoms, so that celiac disease can be regarded as the actual disorder in the structure of the individual immunological clinical pictures.
In industrialized countries, it is medical conditions rather than lack of food that contribute to the development of malnutrition.
Malnutrition is particularly prevalent in the elderly population, occurring in 5-12% of those living independently, 30-61% of hospitalized elderly, and 40-85% of elderly placed in long-term care homes.
The multifactorial nature of malnutrition in the elderly requires a structured differential diagnostic method to clarify its causes.
Heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment are essential to prevent the sequelae of malnutrition.
This structured approach to differential diagnosis is important with regard to the evaluation of potentially reversible causes of malnutrition.
From light microscopic comparison of 60 malignant melanomas with 130 junctional/compound nevi, there were statistically significant differences for 12 structural features.
digitiform radial spurs, blue-gray reticular patterns, opaque alabaster gypsum-like lacunae, brown/black dots against a blue/gray background, pseudopodia-like marginal zones, and so-called blue-in-pink areas.
Nevertheless, specific reflected light microscopic phenomena have not yet been reported.
Therefore, a diagnostic evaluation of the malignancy of a melanocytic tumor is based on several individual features suspicious for malignancy occurring in combination.
This article provides a general overview of the current state of development of gene therapy techniques in the context of cartilage regeneration.
Commonly used vectorial transport systems and strategies to integrate therapeutic genes into their respective target cells are presented.
Furthermore, gene transfer of anti-inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory receptor antagonists provides new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
Initial clinical applicability studies in which such a gene (IRAP) was transferred are a significant step forward towards clinical gene therapy of osteoarthritis.
In recent years, distraction osteogenesis has become an established treatment procedure for the correction of hypoplastic mandibles.
We report our experience with uni- and bidirectional distractors in both intraoral and extraoral application in 4 selected patients with mandibular hypoplasia in the context of syndromal clinical pictures.
These were 1 boy with Pierre Robin syndrome, 1 girl with unilateral mandibular hypoplasia in Goldenhar syndrome, 1 infant with Nager syndrome, and 1 rare case of midline defect in 18p syndrome.
Distraction time ranged from 6-30 days, with bone gain of 6-28 mm.
Older people interested in further education are increasingly recognizing the wide range of opportunities that the Internet offers them in terms of information, communication and cooperation.
Further education institutions and institutions for the education of the elderly are challenged to make it easier for older people to access the world of digital media through target group-specific offerings, to support them in acquiring media skills, and to design interesting virtual learning opportunities for them.
Based on experiences from the "Senior-Info-Mobil" information campaign, ways are described to pave the way for people over 50 to access the new communication technologies.
Using the example of the European network "Learning in Later Life" (LiLL) and other projects, it is further shown how spatially and temporally decoupled "research-based learning" of older adults in the sense of virtual working groups and networks could become the motor of a "new learning culture", which also includes those who do not live in the immediate vicinity of a university or further education institution or who cannot participate in local offers for health and other personal reasons.
The introduction of MR tomography has led to a profound change in the radiological diagnosis of many diseases.
In the field of vascular diagnostics, invasive digital subtraction angiography has already been largely replaced by noninvasive MR angiography.
The rapid technical development of MR tomography in recent years has additionally opened up the possibility of new functional examination methods.
MR tomography of the heart is characterized by the combination of simultaneous acquisition of morphological and functional parameters by a noninvasive procedure without radiation exposure.
Due to its high spatial resolution and reproducibility, cine MRI is the gold standard for functional analysis.
With the further development of perfusion and vitality diagnostics, there is now the possibility of clarifying many cardiac diseases in one examination procedure.
MR spectroscopy is the only technique that provides insight into the energy metabolism of the heart.
Newly developed methods for vascular imaging and flow quantification complete the overall concept of MR cardiac diagnostics.
MR tomography is the only diagnostic procedure that offers the complete clarification of cardiac diseases in one examination procedure, both as an initial examination and for follow-up.
Due to the fast progressing development, still existing limitations especially in the field of MR coronary angiography will be solved in the foreseeable future.
An overview of 30 years of development of documentation and EDP at the Orthopaedic University Hospital Heidelberg will be given.
Since its foundation in 1967, 4 development phases can be distinguished:
first medical initiatives, establishment of basic documentation for scientific purposes, strategic information system planning, realization of information systems with the possibility of medical controlling and thus controlling the performance of services.
Planning and realization were carried out in compliance with the framework plans and concepts of the university hospitals of the state of Baden-Württemberg.
We report deformation of a coronary stent as a result of extracorporeal cardiac massage.
This is the first published case.
We report a case of bacterial arteritis after PTA and stent implantation in an iliac artery with consecutive septic embolization, ipsilateral knee joint empyema, and formation of an infected spur aneurysm.
The cause must be assumed to be contamination of the stent with Staphylococcus aureus.
Treatment consisted of resection of the inflamed vessel segment with stent removal and autologous reconstruction.
The problem Six-year-old boy with unilateral type II cleft foot with oligodactyly and clinodactyly of the second toe.
This review article addresses the current status of the controversy surrounding the indication for posterior surface replacement of the patella.
The current state of knowledge in the experimental and biomechanical field is described, as well as design features of the different implant types and specifics of patella preparation.
In addition, the author addresses the major clinical studies on the topic of patellar resurfacing and attempts to provide the reader with criteria for classifying the study results.
Finally, we discuss why the indication for posterior surface replacement is so controversial and how a differentiated indication for patellar posterior surface replacement could be formulated.
The biomechanical causes for the migration and loosening behavior of hip joint endoprostheses are still unclear.
In particular, chronic mechanical overloading of the boundary layers due to changed stiffness and damping properties of the overall system cannot be ruled out.
Arterial hypertension is commonly observed after organ transplantation in adults as a result of treatment with the hypertensive drugs cyclosporine A, tacrolimus (FK 506), or prednisolone.
There has been little research on the behavior of blood pressure in children after liver transplantation.
The term "occult fracture" denotes the absence of visible fracture signs in the conventional radiography performed for the initial diagnosis when a fracture is nevertheless present.
The diagnosis can only be made during the course of the disease or by means of further diagnostics.
However, the scintigraphy and CT (computed tomography) examinations performed for this purpose have only moderate sensitivity and specificity.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a technique that allows both early diagnosis of the "occult fracture" and diagnosis of any associated chondral and ligamentous injuries.
In the present study, we report 23 patients with a traumatic fracture in 5 different anatomic regions in whom the diagnosis could be made with MRI in the presence of negative radiographic findings.
Athero-arterial embolism is an early described phenomenon.
Histologic evidence of cholesterol crystals in small end-stream arteries coined the term cholesterol embolism.
Because of the highly variable clinical presentation and the diagnosis that can only be confirmed invasively or post mortem, cholesterol embolism was considered a rare complication of severe atherosclerosis of the aorta.
In longitudinal studies, the risk of embolism in patients with these lesions was greater than 10% per patient-year.
Pathological studies consistently confirmed the importance of complex and ulcerative plaques in the aortic arch as an independent risk factor for arterial embolism.
In addition to spontaneous embolism, atherosclerosis of the proximal aorta is the cause of embolic complications during surgical procedures or catheterization of the aorta.
In patients with a particular variant of atherosclerosis in the aorta with pedunculated and motile thrombi arising from circumscribed plaques, anticoagulants proved effective.
Embolic recurrences were prevented and regression of thrombi was observed.
A 62-year-old female patient with a pronounced valgus deformity and extension inhibition of the right knee joint secondary to a supracondylar femoral comminuted fracture treated osteosynthetically by dynamic condylar screw 2 years ago is reported.
Here, the indication was for a varicose and extending corrective osteotomy and osteosynthesis using a retrograde femoral nail.
The patient was able to bear full weight on the right lower extremity within the 1st postoperative week with successful axis compensation.
The principle of retrograde locking nailing is a suitable procedure for achieving good and load-stable osteosyntheses even in corrective surgery.
Tear duct operations at the University Eye Hospital Münster of 296 children from 1987 - 1992 were studied.
Histologic diagnosis of prostate carcinoma is based on a combination of histoarchitectural and cytologic criteria.
Pathologic secretions (eosinophilic secretions, crystalloids, luminal, basophilic mucus) are always suspect, but are not themselves probative of carcinoma.
Cytologic criteria (nuclear size, hyperchromasia, nucleoli, cytoplasmic changes) must always be evaluated in comparison with preexisting benign glands.
Immunohistochemical findings with basal cell-specific cytokeratins must be critically evaluated in each case and can at best confirm or (if basal cells are positively detected) reliably exclude a cancer diagnosis.
In the present review, the different diagnostic criteria are compiled and their value for routine diagnostics is evaluated.
In another German study, maintenance therapy of 20mg TNFR55-IgG1 i.v. every 14 days was compared with monthly administration of 50mg.
Previously, the 60 patients in this study had received an initial dose of 100mg.
In all three studies, patients treated with TNFR55-IgG1 showed a rapid and significant improvement of all measured parameters already one day after the first administration.
Subsequently, despite further administration of the test substance, there was an increase in inflammatory parameters.
In parallel, anti-TNFR55 IgG1 antibodies were detected, which accelerated the clearance of the test substance.
Reported is a 13-month-old female patient who developed Kasabach-Merritt syndrome due to sinusoidal hemangiomatosis.
The combination of coagulopathy and splenic tumor already suggested a vascular process.
The healthy newborn is also entitled to optimal care so that any disruption in postnatal adaptation is detected in a timely manner.
The introduction of painless simple yet reliable methods such as pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening has greatly simplified the situation for all responsible persons.
Background and Question.
In view of increasing reports of resistance increases in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the current resistance situation in gonococcal strains isolated in Berlin should be determined.
Aquajogging is a technique used for years in sports and rehabilitation, in which jogging-like movements are performed in deep water, supported by a buoyancy aid (vest or belt).
In sports, aqua jogging is used as regeneration training and as "low-impact alternative training" in strength endurance and endurance training.
In rehabilitation, aqua jogging is excellent for rheumatic diseases, in the pre- and post-operative phase for diseases of the musculoskeletal system, and as endurance and light strength training for internal diseases.
Surgical treatment options for erectile dysfunction are vascular surgery or prosthetic.
According to the current state of vascular surgery, penile revascularization surgery has its place as the only causal therapy in a selected patient population.
The most important criteria are age under 50 years, no more than 2 of the classic risk factors for impotence, exclusion of diabetes mellitus.
The long-term results had to be corrected from initial short-term successes of over 80% to approx. 53-55%.
Vein surgery has lost its importance due to a drastic loss of long-term success (less than 40% on average).
Penile prosthetic surgery shows higher success rates with 85-90% long-term implant survival rates and 89% patient satisfaction.
Nevertheless, the irreversibility of the procedure often forces this therapeutic option to the last place in the therapeutic cascade.
Device type-dependent complications can occur such as cylinder defects and perforations with 5-year implant survival rates between 65-90%.
This cause can never be eliminated by penetrating keratoplasty alone, but only by additional limbal grafts, which, however, are highly immunogenic.
We report on our now 3 years of experience with the homologous central limbokeratoplasty method we developed.
Pentosan polysulfate is relatively commonly used for bladder instillation and significantly reduces nocturia frequency, while daytime micturition frequency remained unchanged in a controlled study.
Heparin also reduced nocturia frequency in an open prospective study.
Both heparin and pentosan polysulfate have virtually no side effects.
The popularity of the Internet is increasing in all areas of use, and this is also true for radiology applications.
Thousands of Web sites with radiological information have sprung up and are now available online, with competition from commercial offerings.
After the initial experience, the task today is to critically evaluate the opportunities and risks of using the Internet as a distribution medium for radiological knowledge.
Grief and depressive syndromes are among the normal reactions of parents after sudden infant death (SID).
We report below from a psychiatric and forensic point of view 2 cases in which the mothers reacted with exceptionally severe depression after SID and accused themselves of having killed their child.
Finally, some recommendations for the care of affected parents are shared.
Review of the cases of 110 children admitted with Burkitt's lymphoma within a 7-year period at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital, Enugu, showed a preponderance of males over females (1,9 :
1) and an age peak of 5 years.
The areas first affected by tumor were, in order of frequency, the face and abdomen.
The spine, spleen and lungs were less affected.
It is believed that an interaction between infections caused by malaria and Epstein-Barr viruses and malnutrition may play a role in the etiology of the tumor.
The most important drug is cyclophosphamide.
The combination of this drug with vincristine and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing disease regression, but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse.
Follow-up examinations of the patients showed a good survival rate.
Since its construction by Heinrich Braun, the creator of modern local anesthesia, the Zwickau clinic has been a widely known surgical center.
His direct successors Kulenkampff and Mayer have preserved, continued and supplemented Braun's life's work.
Important impulses for general and local anesthesia, for hospital construction and clinic organization as well as for surgical teaching in words and pictures emanated from Zwickau surgery.
After a brief review of the literature, the aspects of psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania that have been little described so far in an adolescent patient will be presented.
On the background of early abandonment fears, the renewed threat of being dropped occurs in the context of the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness.
The symptom, which previously served to regulate diffuse inner tensions and anxieties, can thus be abandoned.
Seborrheic eczema is a pathogenetically unexplained erythematosquamous skin disease with a prevalence of about 2.5%.
The skin lesions, which are often difficult to treat, occasionally respond well to topical application of low doses of dithranol, a substance that can, however, trigger pustular dermatitis as an adverse effect depending on the concentration used and individual sensitivity.
We report the occurrence of pustular dermatitis after the use of a dithranol preparation of the magistral formulation that was erroneously 50-fold too highly concentrated in a 30-year-old patient with seborrheic eczema.
Renovascular hypertension is of particular importance because it is a secondary form of hypertension that can be successfully treated and in some cases cured by interventional radiological or surgical measures.
The incidence and course of intraoperative and postoperative complications after LASIK should be investigated.
An andrologic patient is reported in whom the initial examination led to the discovery of high-grade oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and ureaplasma infection.
The elevated FSH level and testicular size substantially below the normal range were suggestive of marked testicular parenchymal damage.
The detection of macrophages in the ejaculate smear can be taken as an indication of chronic epididymitis.
After antibiotic couple therapy with doxycycline followed by a 3-month recovery period under a combination treatment with vitamins C and E and the trace element zinc, there was a significant spermiogram improvement.
After another 2 months, intrauterine insemination resulted in pregnancy and subsequent birth of a healthy daughter.
At this time, the patient was found to have only mild teratozoospermia.
In a quality control study, 239 patients were assigned to four subgroups of surgical procedures and two different established standard anesthetic procedures.
Changes of the retinal pigment epithelium in the sense of a central serous chorioretinopathy during systemic therapy with corticosteroids will be described.
X-ray of the pelvic overview still has its indication in the diagnosis and treatment of hip dysplasia in infancy, in addition to sonography.
The infant's legs should be kept in the middle position.
Lateral rotations and increased inclination of the pelvis should be avoided.
Review of 150 years, including 50 years of personally experienced development of septorhinoplasty, which finally took a step back into the 19th century in the "open approach" with folding up the tip of the nose.
This technique should not be practiced again in the era of minimally invasive surgery;
a sublabial approach to septorhinoplasty in terms of minimally traumatizing surgery is recommended.
In the imaging diagnosis of thoracic pathologies in mature and especially immature neonates, the chest radiograph is of primary importance.
Profound knowledge of the normal thoracic image and possible physiological peripartum changes is a prerequisite for the interpretation of the neonatal chest radiograph.
Childhood pathologies:
A variety of congenital and acquired changes encountered by the radiologist in neonatology are unknown in the radiodiagnosis of the adult patient.
Many of these changes are life-threatening for the patient or can affect the quality of life in the future.
Early diagnosis in close cooperation with the pediatrician is therefore essential.
An overview of the major pathologies that the radiologist may encounter in daily routine is provided here.
Primary tumors were breast carcinomas (n = 34), leiomyosarcomas (n = 20), pancreatic carcinomas (n = 16), hypernephroid carcinomas (n = 13), melanomas (n = 9), gastric carcinomas (n = 9), bronchial and adrenal carcinomas (n = 6 each), and 14 other tumors.
Extrahepatic tumor involvement (including synchronous primary tumors) was present in 69 of 140 (49%) cases, and extrahepatic tumor was present in 51% (n = 61) of the 120 initial resections.
Of the 120 initial resections, 82 (68%) were classified as R0, 13 (11%) as R1, and 25 (21%) as R2 resections.
Median survival was 20 months overall after initial resection, 28 months after R0 resections, and 8 months after R1/2 resections.
After second resection (n = 14), the median survival was 28 months for all patients and 41 months after R0 resection.
In patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of initial liver resection, median survival was 32 months after R0 resection (5-year prognosis 25%) and 7 months after R1/2 resection.
The present results show that resection of even noncolorectal nonneuroendocrine liver metastases does promise prognostic gain.
As with colorectal metastases, patients with hepatic recurrences may even benefit from second or third resections of the liver.
In some cases, impressive long-term progress was observed even in rather unfavorable initial situations.
Therefore, the indication for surgical therapy should be reviewed in each individual case.
A 32-year-old man is charged with attempted rape.
He himself remained perplexed regarding the act, which was foreign to his personality and for which he had no explanation.
Three months later, he suffers a massive subarachnoid hemorrhage from a large aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery while in custody.
For the assessment of culpability, this course of events in connection with the witnessed behavioral conspicuousness shortly before the crime therefore allows the possibility of a pathological mental disorder at the time of the crime to be considered.
This may have been an epileptic twilight state as a prodromal symptom of later SAB.
Liquid perfluorocarbon (PFCL) has also proven useful for elevation and subsequent removal of an intraocular lens (IOL) dislocated in the vitreous, among other applications.
Due to the high specific gravity of PFCL, the IOL is floated and can be repositioned into the anterior segment of the eye, where it can be refixed, for example, in the sulcus ciliaris.
What type of contact PFCL makes with the IOL is unclear.
Because biotoxicity of PFCL is likely if it remains intraocular for a prolonged period, it is removed as completely as possible at the end of surgery.
A rare case of solitary subcutaneous skin metastasis of chondrosarcoma is reported.
The metastasis occurred after a seven-year appearance-free postoperative interval.
In the course of further examinations, no clinically detectable metastases were found.
Taking into account the cases described so far, the prognosis is nevertheless very poor.
Developmental abnormalities of the pancreas are due to the embryonic formation of the organ and are caused by malfusion (pancreas divisum) or malrotation (pancreas anulare) of the two anlagen.
Pancreas divisum and pancreas anulare can ultimately only be confirmed by ductal imaging of the pancreatic duct.
In congenital diseases, genetic defects are present in which other organ systems are usually also affected and in which extrapancreatic damage is usually in the foreground of the clinical picture.
Both developmental abnormalities of the pancreas and congenital diseases result in a wide variety of morphologic changes of the organ that can be detected with modern imaging techniques.
Books often contain not only the material written by the author.
On the basis of the table work of Bärensprung and Hebra it is shown that they reveal on the second view also some further medical-historically relevant facts.
Approximately 5% of all patients with congenital diaphragmatic hernia/defect are asymptomatic at the time of birth and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period.
We report unusual findings in late-presenting congenital diaphragmatic defects, namely the association with primary funnel chest and a lethal course in acute gastric volvulus.
The usefulness of sonography in bacterial koxitis was reviewed.
259 children with hip pain, bacterial coxitis (n = 14), coxitis fugax (n = 120), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), Perthes disease (n = 92), and epiphyseolysis capitis femoris (n = 21) underwent sonographic examination.
In the ultrasound image, the joint capsule, femoral head surface, and periarticular structures can be assessed in the DEGUM standard section planes.
An intra-articular mass (synovitis, effusion) can be detected sonographically as joint capsule distension.
This capsular detachment has been demonstrated sonographically in bacterial coxitis, coxitis fugax, juvenile rheumatoid coxitis, and early stage Perthes disease.
Since joint capsular distension does not show significant differences in the individual diseases, it is not possible to differentiate between these diseases on the basis of the sonogram in the presence of capsular distension without bony changes.
Thus, bacterial koxitis cannot be sonographically distinguished with certainty from koxitis of other etiologies;
capsular distension is considered a nonspecific sonographic sign.
In case of clinical suspicion of bacterial koxitis, immediate diagnostic puncture is required, if necessary under sonographic control.
Because of additional bony changes besides capsular distension, epiphyseolysis capitis femoris and Perthes disease in the condensation and fragmentation stages can be distinguished sonographically from both bacterial koxitis and koxitides of other etiologies.
The diagnosis of rare gliomatosis cerebri can only be made in synopsis of clinical, radiological and histopathological findings.
Because both cases had tumor cells that were unusually highly dedifferentiated for gliomatosis cerebri, diagnosis was complicated by atypical findings such as contrast MRI uptake and clinical signs of intracranial pressure increase.
Clinical course, differential diagnoses, and literature are briefly reviewed.
Different trial designs such as cohort study, case-control study, and randomized clinical trial are presented, explained, and problems are pointed out.
Important aspects of randomized studies are discussed in detail and it is shown that they are the only way to reach conclusions about causal relationships in an empirical science such as medicine.
It is argued that the biometric requirements of clinical research cannot be met by the application of complex statistical procedures, but that in this sense good clinical research depends very primarily on careful study design.
A possible influence of tricyclic antidepressants on anticoagulant therapy has been evaluated differently so far.
In particular, the anticoagulant phenprocoumon, which is used therapeutically in Germany, is virtually ignored in studies.
The present retrospective study was conducted with the question of a potential drug interaction between phenprocoumon and tricyclics.
Abstract From April 1, 1996, to June 30, 1998, 7 patients aged 61-85 years with symptomatic infrarenal aortic stenosis due to arteriosclerosis were treated by transluminal angioplasty and primary implantation of a Palmaz stent.
Simultaneously, thromboendarterectomy of the external iliac artery with profundaplasty was performed in one case, and angioplasty with stenting of the common iliac artery was performed in another case.
The technical as well as clinical success was given in all cases.
No occlusion or clinical restenosis occurred during a median observation period of 23 (7-33) months.
Transluminal angioplasty with stent implantation for segmental abdominal aortic stenosis is a less invasive and safe procedure with good long-term results.
Abstract A patient is reported who underwent infertility treatment for several years and became pregnant although she did not actually want a child.
The various species of Aspergillus occur ubiquitously as pathogens.
Aspergillus flavus has historically been classified as rather apathogenic to humans.
The case of a 72-year-old patient in whom Aspergillus flavus was culturally detected in tracheal secretions after aortocoronary bypass surgery in the intensive care unit is described.
The serological test procedures performed, indirect hemagglutination test with antigen and (Author:
is "monoclonal antibodies" correct or with monoclonal antibodies?) monoclonal antibodies covered latex particles, were negative several times.
Postmortem aspergillus testing with a newer method, antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay, showed a positive result.
There was no evidence of systemic infection in clinical and radiographic findings.
The patient died before the use of antifungal therapy, and autopsy showed disseminated mycosis of both lungs by Aspergillus flavus.
The possibility of more sensitive antigen detection by enzyme immunoassay may facilitate the diagnosis of systemic aspergillosis.
By correctly assessing the pathogenicity of Aspergillus flavus, intravenous antifungal therapy with amphotericin B should be initiated even with a single cultural detection of Aspergillus flavus in the trachea.
Epidemiologic data show a decline in incidences for appendicitis and appendectomy in developed countries.
The peak age is 10-19 years, but the rate of perforation is highest in the extreme age groups.
The high rate of appendectomies without histologic evidence of acute inflammation-especially in young women-and the high rate of perforation in young children and the elderly demonstrate the low diagnostic confidence.
The analysis of epidemiological data does not allow a clear conclusion on the etiopathogenesis of appendicitis acuta.
After corneal refractive surgery and cataract surgery, ocular image defects (aberrations) may occur that cannot be corrected with spherical or astigmatic lenses and are probably the reason why maximum retinal visual acuity is often not achieved despite optimal correction.
Detection of these image defects under clinical conditions would be an important first step toward documentation and correction of these aberrations using modern photorefractive techniques.
For both methods, only static unidirectional tensile load tests had been performed experimentally so far.
Ecke and Hofmann thus came to the conclusion that a comparable stability could be achieved with flexible fixations compared to rigid procedures and that these should be preferred for the prophylaxis of ankylosis due to the preservation of mobility in the symphysis.
Simultaneous multidirectional dynamic experimental investigation under gait simulation conditions was used to comparatively test symphyseal stabilizations using DC plates, reconstruction plates, wire tension straps, and PDS bandings.
The symphyseal preparations were loaded synchronously in the sagittal and vertical directions at a frequency of 1.5 Hz for 55 500 load cycles (steps during 6 weeks of mobilization).
Neither wire traction taping nor PDS banding was sufficiently stable, although these procedures allowed symphyseal mobility beyond physiologic limits immediately after the start of the trial.
As the trial progressed, instability increased due to cutting of the cerclages and bandings into the bone or fracture of the wire cerclages in general until complete failure.
In contrast, for DC plate and reconstruction plate stabilizations, stabilization success was dependent on primary screw anchorage stability.
With primary overtightening of the bolts, the plate stabilization became increasingly unstable under dynamic loading.
With primary stable anchorage of the plate screws, the fixation remained fully stable over 55 500 load cycles with a load corresponding to an average of half the body weight.
For clinical application, it can be deduced from these results that neither bridging tension strapping with wire cerclages nor PDS banding stabilize the ruptured symphysis sufficiently for early postoperative mobilization under partial weight-bearing.
If the DC plate or the reconstruction plate can be used primarily to achieve secure stabilization of the ruptured symphysis by good anchorage of the screws in the non-osteoporotic bone, the injured person with "open-book injury" can be mobilized with partial loading corresponding to half the body weight.
Multifocal intraocular lenses (MIOL) have been implanted for years with good success.
Due to the distribution of light over several focal points, a smaller amount of light is available for each image.
An additional reduction in the amount of light or stray light effects due to capsular fibrosis may lead to visual deterioration at an early stage.
In a 69-year-old female patient, a 5-cm, moderately pleomorphic spindle-cell thyroid tumor was initially misdiagnosed as primary anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.
It was not until an anemia workup performed 17 months later that a 7-cm-diameter duodenal leiomyosarcoma was discovered and resected via duodenopancreatectomy.
Reassessment of primary histology led to revision of the initial diagnosis and classification of the thyroid tumor as metastatic leiomyosarcoma.
The patient died of an apoplectic insult another 6 months later.
Autopsy findings confirmed the assessment of the tumor condition as an intestinal sarcoma initially manifested by thyroid metastasis.
Drug therapy of erectile dysfunction includes oral as well as local application of pharmaceuticals.
At this time, the only approved oral agent with proven efficacy is yohimbine, a centrally acting alpha receptor blocker.
Other oral medications with a central target include trazodone and apomorphine, and apomorphine was significantly more effective than placebo.
Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase isoenzyme V inhibitor with a predominantly peripheral mechanism of action, also showed encouraging results in clinical trials.
Both intraurethral (MUSE) and intracavernosal modes of application are available for local application.
At the present time, prostaglandin E1 (Caverject) has largely replaced other pharmaceuticals as the substance used.
Currently, several promising compounds with different modes of action and different dosage forms are under development as therapeutics for erectile dysfunction.
A form of non-verbal psychotherapy is presented, the work with sound, pulsation and rhythm instruments:
They change the patient's state of consciousness, contribute to a multimedia therapeutic flow, which is especially significant for more severely disturbed patients who cannot be adequately reached by words alone.
Perinatal, transpersonal, and death experiences are within their natural range.
One of the most important long-term side effects of medulloblastoma therapy in children is growth hormone deficiency.
The immunogenicity of renal cell carcinoma and the resistance of its metastases to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy led to the establishment of a variety of different strategies grouped under the term immunotherapy.
The achievable remission rates are usually between 20 and 40%.
In addition, in 30-40% of patients, the disease stabilizes for a limited period of time, in some cases for years.
Most of these are results of uncontrolled phase II studies.
Cures are usually not expected, long-term remissions are rare (5%), and high remission rates can only be achieved in selected patient populations.
Some authors describe a survival advantage for immunotherapy-treated patients over non-treated or chemotherapy-treated patients.
Assured survival benefit for patients with objective remissions.
A standard therapy cannot be defined at present.
Even assuming a survival benefit, the loss of quality of life due to the toxicity of current treatment protocols and their high cost must be considered.
Given the lack of therapeutic alternatives, an expected improvement in currently achievable remission rates, and the survival benefit for immunotherapied patients reported by some authors [15, 16, 26, 30, 31], we consider immunotherapy to be an essential component in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
The use should usually be in the context of clinical trials.
In 501 subjects of both sexes, namely 262 men (about half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 63.0 +/- 0.9 years old) and 239 women (half 44.4 +/- 0.9 and 62.8 +/- 0.8 years old), laboratory indices are calculated from the measured values of 12 clinical-chemical parameters and checked for correlations with biological age according to Ries.
Alkaline phosphatase, iron, total protein, total cholesterol, glucose, uric acid, urea, HDL cholesterol, creatinine, LDL cholesterol, transferrin and triglycerides are included in the calculation of the index.
Significant correlations between laboratory indices and biological age are found only in the group of younger women.
In the same group, several individual parameters also correlate significantly with pre-aging.
These include alkaline phosphatase, LDL/HDL quotient, bilirubin, triglycerides and glucose.
A 2-cm cystadenofibroma of the appendix epiploica of the distal sigmoid is described, which was discovered as an incidental finding during hysterectomy with adnexectomy for endometrial carcinoma in a 72-year-old female patient.
It showed the same histology as analogous tumors of the ovary and was associated with endosalpingiosis.
There were also extensive adhesions between the appendices epiploicae and the left parietal peritoneum and cytologic atypia in the peritoneal lavage fluid.
These findings are likely due to occult peritoneal endosalpingiosis.
The histogenesis, histology, and localizations of primary Müller-type peritoneal neoplasms are discussed.
Initially, it was hoped that this procedure would provide advantages in terms of stability, postoperative pain reduction, and restoration of proprioception in addition to an optimized position of the patellar tendon graft, although the superiority of the endoscopic technique has not yet been proven.
Fifteen endoscopically and 14 openly operated patients were examined preoperatively and after 3 and 6 months postoperatively.
Lysholm and Tegner scoring systems, ligamentous stability (KT-1000), operative time, and proprioception using the angle reproduction test were collected.
Absorbed dose from spiral computed tomography and orthopantomogram (OPG) was determined at 16 positions in the head region using thermoluminescence dosimeters and a phantom head.
The tube power recommended by the CT scanner manufacturer for dental CT was gradually reduced.
A 76% reduction in radiation exposure was achieved without loss of diagnostic information.
The measured absorbed dose of computed tomography was 0.30 mGy (thyroid gland) to 29 mGy (skin surface in the beam path) at 187.5 mAs and 1-mm slices (25-mm scan length in the maxilla, 30 mm in the mandible).
When reduced to 45 mAs, 0.07 mGy (thyroid) to 6.9 mGy (skin surface) were measured.
Length measurements on sawed jaw specimens were compared with corresponding CT measurements on a workstation.
The average measurement inaccuracy was 0.1-0.3 mm.
The dose reduction of CT by approximately 76% had no effect on length measurement accuracy.
However, the absorbed doses of the 76% dose-reduced CT scans are still on average a factor of 10 higher than the absorbed dose of an orthopantomogram.
The significance of enteroviral infection of the myocardium in dilated cardiomyopathy could only be objectified by the introduction of molecular biological techniques (polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization) into virological diagnostics.
The introduction of histologic and especially immunohistologic techniques for the detection of inflammatory changes in the myocardium, in patients with a suspected clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, allows a subdivision into inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (no evidence of inflammatory changes in the myocardium) according to the 1995 WHO classification (31).
Inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined as myocardial dysfunction in combination with a myocardial inflammatory response, which can be detected by histological and especially immunohistological techniques.
Only by combining histological, immunohistochemical, and molecular biological techniques was it possible to perform a subgroup analysis regarding the frequency of detection of enteroviral RNA in the myocardium of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy compared with patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
In addition to bacterial exogenous (posttraumatic/postoperative), bacterial endogenous (hematogenous) osteomyelitis and the rarer group of abacterial, primarily chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis can be distinguished, which, in contrast to the others, manifests preferentially in the clavicle.
From the group of 17 patients with clavicular osteomyelitis we treated from 1978-1996, 3 patients with primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis are presented as case histories.
Differentially, primary chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the clavicle must be considered despite its rare occurrence, since it is - after bioptic diagnosis confirmation - a domain of conservative, medicinal therapy.
Infectious exogenous endophthalmitis is a serious complication after cataract surgery.
It is often difficult to treat despite modern drug and surgical treatment methods.
The treatment of malignant tumors rests on the four pillars of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.
This paper uses a literature review to examine the role of overall treatment duration and dose intensity in optimizing chemotherapeutic protocols using three major oncologic diseases as examples.
Both tumor models and the hypotheses that follow from them and, most importantly, well-designed clinical trials can enable advances in the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumor diseases.
Castleman's disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) is a heterogeneous, histologically defined clinical picture belonging to the group of lymphoproliferative diseases.
Paclitaxel, a very potent antiproliferative agent, promotes the formation of unusually stable and dysfunctional microtubules, thereby altering cellular mechanisms that ultimately lead to decreased proliferation, migration, and signal transduction.
This paper presents the in vitro and in vivo results from our research on paclitaxel.
After comparing 3 different catheter systems (porous balloon, microporous balloon, and double balloon), the double balloon was favored for in vivo use.
On the basis of staining of the cytoskeleton as well as electron-optically, evidence of paclitaxel action in vascular smooth muscle cells was obtained.
In rabbits, locally applied paclitaxel significantly inhibited neointimal proliferation and widened vessel diameter compared with balloon-dilated control animals.
Additional experiments demonstrated a dramatic reduction in vascular contractility after paclitaxel administration.
In addition to an age-dependent deposition of waste products between the cytoplasmic and basal membrane of the RPE cells ("basal laminar deposits"), a splitting of Bruch's membrane between the basal membrane of the RPE cells and the inner collagen layer is evident in various manifestations of early and late AMD such as drusen, choroidal neovascularizations, and pigment epithelial detachments.
Since the different membranes and layers are connected by adhesion molecules, we investigated whether an age-dependent regression of the adhesion apparatus is detectable.
Recent studies make it clear that vertebral arch dysplasia and spondylolysis develop as a result of impaired spinal growth.
To determine the symptomatology of rheumatoid hand flexor tendon disease as a function of lesion location and type of vision affection in order to allow early surgical therapy with preservation of hand function through improved clinical diagnosis.
For the majority of even common dermatoses, suitable animal models occurring in nature are lacking.
Transgenic technology, founded in the 1980s, fills this gap.
It was initially an instrument in the hands of pure basic scientists, but in the last five years it has also found its way into clinically oriented specific dermatological basic research.
It has made it possible to mimic HIV-associated diseases as well as genodermatoses in the murine model and to gain insights into their pathogenesis.
Through targeted epidermal localized overexpression of growth factors and cytokines, the skin of transgenic mice exhibited similarities to psoriatic epidermis.
At the same time, mice generated in this way can be used to study the wound healing process.
The transgenic technology further enables the induction of cutaneous tumors.
The availability of animal models of human dermatoses also allows targeted research into experimental forms of therapy, such as somatic gene therapy.
The indications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in artificial heart valve carriers are critical.
A general contraindication to MRI is doubtful.
Some diagnostic issues, such as posterior fossa processes, spinal abscesses, and for conditions inside the knee, can be better studied by MRI than by other radiologic techniques.
MRI can directly affect carriers of artificial heart valves in three ways:
1) movement and dislocation of the prosthetic valve, 2) heating, and 3) induction of arrhythmias by electrical currents, and indirectly by distortion of the MRI image with the risk of diagnostic misinterpretation.
The current literature on safety aspects of MRI in artificial heart valve carriers appears inadequate.
Therefore, in 1998, a survey was conducted among twenty-five artificial heart valve manufacturers regarding the compatibility, safety, or contraindication of MRI of their respective prosthetic valves.
Some companies based their statements on studies that could not be viewed, or placed the responsibility on the physician performing the MRI.
Two valve manufacturers explicitly warned against MRI for certain types of prostheses.
Building on our survey, an overview of the technical aspects, clinical circumstances, and prerequisites for MRI safety standards in artificial heart valve carriers is provided.
In an experimental study, intravenous CO2 or argon embolization with 10, 20, and 30 ml of gas was performed in 10 pigs with a mean body weight of 18.9 (15-24) kg.
In the argon group (n = 5), two animals died after 20 and 30 ml bolus administration, respectively.
Another animal was successfully resuscitated after administration of 30 ml bolus.
In the CO2 group (n = 5), neither one of the animals died nor was resuscitation required.
Low-solubility gases such as argon should not be used in situations with increased risk of gas embolism.
We report a 56-year-old female patient with disseminated granuloma anulare in a known diabetic metabolic condition.
In addition, there was renal insufficiency, which made us refrain from oral photochemotherapy.
We performed balneophotochemotherapy with 8-methoxypsoralen whole-body baths using the foil method, which resulted in complete regression of the lesions on the trunk and neck and marked improvement of the skin findings on the extremities after 30 treatments.
Side effects did not occur.
Balneophotochemotherapy can therapeutically influence not only epidermal but also dermal localized processes.
Cat scratch disease (CSD) is an infectious disease little known in Germany.
It was only a few years ago that the pathogen, Bartonella henselae, could be isolated.
In the majority of cases, a typical clinical picture is found with skin lesions in the area of cat bite or scratch wounds and benign lymphadenopathy.
Less frequently, other organ manifestations occur.
We report a 47-year-old female patient who developed reactive spondarthritis with synovialitides of the finger joints, polyarthralgias of the middle and large joints, and inflammatory lumbaralgias after a cat bite.
Rheumatic symptoms were limited in time and responded well to NSAIDs.
To date, only a few cases of joint involvement have been described in the setting of CCC.
However, since the infestation of cats with Bartonella henselae is high in Europe, it may be a more common cause of joint problems than previously thought.
The diagnosis of CHD has been facilitated in recent years by the development of serological tests.
We provide an overview of the clinical manifestations and summarize the diagnostic criteria of this disease.
Due to continuous therapy optimization in recent years, the prognosis of Hodgkin's disease has improved significantly.
However, this improvement in overall survival also leads to an increase in a variety of potential long-term complications of which the physician providing care must be aware.
Due to often long-lasting fatigue symptoms, cardiopulmonary problems, hypothyroidism as well as damage to the gonadal system with azoospermia and ovarian insufficiency, the mostly young patients are permanently impaired in their quality of life.
In addition, the increased incidence of secondary neoplasia after primary successful therapy is a significant problem.
Based on attachment styles as circumscribed patterns of perception, thinking, feeling, expectations, and readiness to act in attachment-relevant situations (Bowlby 1975;
Main 1990), the goal was to operationalize these patterns appropriately in terms of their original definition, i.e., as specific feature configurations.
Descriptions of the three attachment styles, "secure," "avoidant," and "ambivalent," were translated into self-descriptions by clients at the beginning of a therapeutic relationship.
Three scales were formed based on factor analytic results:
374 inpatients (56.3% female, 43.7% male) completed the BFKE at the start of their psychotherapy.
Cluster analysis revealed five clusters that can be interpreted as attachment styles:
"secure," two variants of "insecure-ambivalent" ("closed" and "clinging"), and two variants of "insecure-avoidant" ("closed" and "cooperative").
Discriminant analysis of these clusters yielded discriminant functions similar to those of Collins u. Read (1990) and Ainsworth et al.
The presence of clinical symptoms of progressive sensorineural hearing loss, fluctuating vertigo, and concomitant radiological evidence of a contrast-enhancing mass of the internal auditory canal raise the suspicion of the presence of an acoustic neuroma.
We report on a 57-year-old female patient with a known history of Sharp syndrome and the initially typical constellation of findings.
The presented case report shows a case of a large lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle, which presented with peripheral cranial nerve loss in the ENT area and initially absent central neurology.
Neither the primary radiological diagnosis nor the failure of exclusively peripheral cranial nerves suggested the presence of lymphoma preoperatively.
The facial nerve paresis and the typical occipital cephalgia with radiation into the ear, which occurred within a few weeks, are rather unusual for an acoustic neuroma.
A suspicious constellation of findings as in the case described by us must challenge a differential diagnostic clarification despite the presence of leading symptoms.
Manifestation of solitary lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle is considered a rarity.
Further therapy options available to the gynecologist in the practice, clinic and in rehabilitation are balneotherapy and physiotherapy as primary or complementary treatment measures.
In gynecology, balneogynecology has become an integral part of therapeutic strategies as a natural healing method.
Balneogynecological and physiotherapeutic measures are to be used primarily as supplementary measures based on the indication.
Only in chronic conditions as well as acute muscular tension, they are suitable as primary measures, especially for pain reduction and positive tissue influence.
Conventional mycobacterial diagnostics currently require an average of four weeks until a positive tuberculosis culture and subsequent susceptibility testing are available.
Seven to eight weeks pass before a negative culture result is reported.
Faster results can be achieved in individual diagnostic steps by new methods such as nucleic acid amplification techniques, but these do not currently have the desired high sensitivity.
The worldwide alarming epidemiological situation of the risk of infection with tuberculosis leaves no doubt that the further development of methods is necessary, which allow in the shortest possible time to detect and differentiate mycobacteria with high sensitivity and specificity and to test them for their sensitivity to antibiotics.
A prospective randomized study compares nonunion-bridging mounting of the AO small external fixator for the treatment of distal radius fracture (A2/A3 according to AO classification) with treatment by percutaneous Kirschner wire osteosynthesis with plaster.
The collection of donated breast milk has a long tradition in Germany.
Modern screening methods are used to exclude the transmission of infections.
The incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis is low.
Because of its favorable composition, milk from donors who themselves have children born prematurely is preferred for very immature preterm infants.
Over the past 20 years, a large number of day care centers (TSn) and psychosocial contact and counseling centers (KBSn) have emerged in Germany as complementary day care facilities.
The widespread use of these facilities contrasts with the widespread lack of empirical studies on the characteristics of their visitors and on how they operate.
In the present work, 100 visitors to TSn and KBSn in Berlin were studied.
Characteristics of the social situation, psychopathological symptomatology and the visitors' views were surveyed.
Almost all of the visitors had previously received inpatient psychiatric treatment.
The current psychopathological symptomatology varied considerably with an average of moderate severity.
Two-thirds of the visitors were retired, most lived alone and had few or no friends.
As positive aspects of the facilities, the visitors mentioned above all the contact with other people and the daily structuring.
The most frequently mentioned negative aspect was the disturbance caused by other visitors.
TSn visitors were younger on average and had higher scores on the BPRS Anergy subscale.
Otherwise, visitors to the two facilities differed little in the characteristics studied.
The results suggest that both facilities do indeed serve chronically mentally ill patients with poor social integration, which they are also designed to serve.
For these sick people, they partially compensate for deficits in the social netwrk.
Limitations and consequences of the results are addressed.
For a long time, functional examinations of the brain were only possible with nuclear medicine methods such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
The use of fast imaging sequences, optimized contrast agent applications and special post-processing methods made it possible to observe physiological and pathophysiological processes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
T1- and T2*-weighted contrast-enhanced imaging sequences can be used to acquire information about tissue perfusion, microcirculation, and blood-brain barrier permeability using specific models, some of which are derived from nuclear medicine.
The self-diffusion of water molecules in tissue can be visualized with diffusion-weighted MRI, and the medullary vasculature, temporally resolved, can be visualized with MR angiographic techniques.
MR spectroscopic studies can detect metabolic distributions in normal and pathologic tissues in a multidimensional manner and observe metabolic processes as they progress.
The advantages of MRI are its low invasiveness, the possibility of a three-dimensional representation of the data and an arbitrary repeatability of the examination with no radiation exposure.
The functional methods that are already clinically applicable are described and their use in neuroradiology is also discussed in terms of value compared to nuclear medicine methods.
In tumor diagnostics, functional MR techniques provide important additional information for therapy finding, therapy planning, and therapy monitoring.
Initial studies have shown that the methods are able to sensitively detect pathophysiological changes in dementias and psychoses.
It is the declared aim of the World Health Organization (WHO) to place health protection as high as possible in everyone's consciousness in the countries of the European Region, also in the face of constant political and economic change.
Environmental factors that are detrimental to health are to be combated internationally or, better, prevented by concrete measures.
An indispensable prerequisite for this is agreement on international standards in the field of environment and health, as well as mutually coordinated risk assessments and problem-solving strategies.
Ensure that governments and the respective populations develop a collaborative perception for the important environmental health problem areas.
To ensure the smoothest possible flow of information and communication between environmental and health experts, the WHO Regional Office for Europe in Copenhagen (WHO/EURO) established a WHO Collaborating Centre for Information and Communication on Environmental Health at the Robert Koch Institute in Bonn in the summer of 1997, with financial support from the Federal Ministry of Health.
A 30-year-old patient is reported who had right-sided amaurosis fugax with concomitant frontobasal fracture after a fall event.
CT and MR angiography demonstrated occlusion of the ophthalmic artery due to dissection of the internal carotid artery with ascending thrombosis as the cause.
There were no other neurological deficits, as adequate cerebral artery perfusion via the cerebral arterial circulation was ensured.
In the etiologic diversity of posttraumatic amaurosis, such a rare cause should receive etiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic consideration, if appropriate.
Suspicion of acute aortic dissection requires immediate evaluation with appropriate imaging modalities, such as transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or aortography.
In the case presented here, an asymptomatic patient was suspected of aortic dissection on echocardiography.
Because of the discrepancy with the clinical picture, angiography was used along with other cross-sectional imaging techniques to diagnose evidence of haustration of the aneurysmally dilated thoracic aorta and to definitively rule out aortic dissection.
A 54-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of acute chest pain, increasing dyspnea, and with the picture of right ventricular cardiac decompensation.
On further evaluation by echocardiography, the cause was found to be a ruptured sinus valsalva aneurysm of the right coronary leaflet with left-to-right shunt into the right atrium by noninvasive means.
Cardiac surgery was performed without complications, preserving the aortic valve.
Six months later, echocardiographically, the right ventricular segments were normal in width, and no shunt was detectable on color Doppler.
Acute cardiac insufficiency can be a consequence of a congenital heart defect even in middle age.
Echocardiography and specifically transesophageal echocardiography provided a precise diagnosis by noninvasive means.
Characteristics of rodent syndrome are mandibulofacial and limb malformations.
Mandibular hypoplasia can lead to airway obstruction due to the tongue resting against the posterior pharyngeal wall, especially in infancy.
We present a patient with Rodent syndrome who received nasal CPAP and sedation for 5 months due to persistent dyspnea.
After the soft tissues were pre-expanded by extension treatment, mandibular distraction osteogenesis was performed at a body weight as low as 6 kg.
Both the functional and cosmetic results are good.
Airway obstruction and dyspnea were not observed after completion of therapy.
Successful thromboendarterectomies (TEA) of the internal carotid artery result in improved perfusion in the stromal territory of this artery.
However, it is difficult to make statements about cerebral and ocular blood flow during surgery.
Teleconsultation is the consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic-therapeutic procedure in the treatment of a specific case of illness by means of modern telematics.
Practical application will be increasingly facilitated by improvements in telematics (initially ISDN connections, later use of a national health platform).
The legal framework for teleconsultation in everyday clinical practice has been largely defined, but adequate remuneration for this independent medical service is still unclear.
The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of these lenses on vision.
Nowadays, there is no doubt that psoriasis vulgaris in loco can lead to reversible effluvium.
Whether scarring alopecia can be a direct consequence of psoriasis is controversial.
In the following, we present a 38-year-old female patient who had been suffering from progressive effluvium in psoriatic foci on the capillitium for years.
Histology revealed strand-like fibrosis instead of hair follicles, perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the upper dermis that sporadically spread to the epithelium of preserved hair follicles, and hallmarks of scalp psoriasis.
The clinical course and lack of evidence for another cause of scarring suggest a causal pathogenetic relationship between psoriasis and scarring alopecia.
Knowledge of this possible relationship is important in that consistent treatment of psoriasis can prevent effluvium and, presumably, the development of scarring.
Reduced production of growth hormone (GH) is observed in 30% of fibromyalgia patients.
Treatment of these fibromyalgia patients with recombinant growth hormone improves several clinical symptoms including the number of major pain points.
The reduced GH secretion is likely due to increased tone of somatostatin release in the hypothalamus.
The hypothesis is presented that this impaired GH secretion is caused by intermittent periods of elevated cortisol levels, which in turn increase the density of -adrenergic receptors in the hypothalamus.
The resulting increase in -adrenergic tone stimulates the release of somatostatin resulting in reduced GH secretion.
Neurobiological research indicates the primary involvement of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems in the pathogenesis of self-injurious behavior (SVV).
Nevertheless, the efficiency of classical neuroleptics is questionable.
In open-label and controlled trials, the serotonin 2A-dopamine D2 antagonist risperidone also effectively reduced SVV over the longer term.
The present study aimed to create an osteoporosis animal model using ovariectomy.
Osteodensitometric measurements of the maxilla and mandible by DXA were performed before and after ovariectomy.
A significant decrease in bone density after ovarectomy was seen in both the maxilla and mandible.
10 patients with idiopathic, nontraumatic hemarthrosis of the knee joint were evaluated and treated arthroscopically.
The causes of the hemorrhages were varied:
In addition to vascular abnormalities such as hemangiomas and meniscal lesions, we found evidence of hemorrhage from arroded subchondral vessels in areas of high-grade chondromalacia.
Surgical, mostly arthroscopic, therapy produced good results.
Toxic snakebite injuries in children are almost exclusively caused by adder (Vipera berus) in Germany.
The adder injects a venom consisting of various enzymes and hemorrhagic as well as neurotoxic factors.
Adder bites in children can be asymptomatic, but can also cause the most severe symptoms of poisoning.
In addition, pathological findings in their surroundings can be displayed on a large scale.
The transmission of the sonographic findings to the therapist who is not present during the examination and the control of a finding, e.g. a tumor, under therapy are thus considerably improved.
Viruses, for their part, have also become more mobile due to increasing human travel speed and activity worldwide.
At the same time, the rapid development of electronic communication technologies means that we are receiving more and more news about epidemics and diseases from all over the world in ever shorter periods of time.
This paper uses four case studies to examine the factors that may influence early or late timing of initial diagnosis of dementia.
We have indicated surgery in all of our cases.
In each case, the perforation site was primarily sutured over and extensively irrigated and drained.
In 2 cases, the suture site was additionally secured by fibrin gluing or with an omentoplasty.
All patients survived and recovered without immediate sequelae.
Based on these own results and after evaluation of the current literature, the following conclusions seem justified to us:
Definitive surgery is indicated when a perforation is secured at an early stage.
Suture closure of the perforation site should also be attempted in cases of delayed diagnosis with advanced mediastinitis.
An additional fuse is recommended in these cases.
Resecting procedures with or without simultaneous reconstruction should be reserved for a few exceptional cases because of the high surgical risk.
The standards and regulations applicable in the MRT for the protection of patients and users are compiled.
Wilms tumors are observed 2 to 8 times more frequently in children with horseshoe kidney.
Wilms tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that rarely have major adipose tissue-containing portions.
We report a 28-month-old girl with unusual Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney that could have been a teratoma based on radiologic criteria because of a large lipomatous portion with internal calcifications.
The radiologic characteristics of these differential diagnoses in various cross-sectional imaging techniques are presented.
Both differential diagnostic considerations found their correlate in the histologic diagnosis of a teratoid Wilms tumor.
Thoracic actinomycosis is a rare disease that is often misrecognized as a malignancy.
Because of the high lethality of untreated actinomycosis, this disease must be included early in differential diagnostic considerations.
Reported is a 58-year-old patient with a 6-month history of bloody lateral expectoration and significant body weight loss who was referred to us under suspicion of thoracic sarcoma.
Only by a diagnostic detour could the diagnosis of thoracic actinomycosis be made.
This was triggered by an aspirated chicken bone in the bronchial system.
Under antibiotic treatment, the symptoms quickly regressed and ultimately led to the patient's recovery.
Bronchoscopy is also an important component in the differential diagnosis of thoracic space-occupying tumors, which includes inflammatory diseases, lymphomas, thymus-associated and sarcomatous tumors, and germ cell tumors.
In hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT, Osler-Rendu-Weber disease), arteriovenous malformations of the liver represent a rare malformation.
In addition to local changes, such as fibrosis or cirrhosis, systemic sequelae, such as hypercirculatory heart failure, often require effective therapy.
The case of a 53-year-old female patient in whom percutaneous embolization failed due to unfavorable vascular anatomy is described.
Instead, adjustable "banding" of the hepatic artery was tried as a new treatment concept.
After minilaparotomy, an expander prosthesis was placed around the hepatic artery, and adapted hepatic artery throttling was performed via the implanted port system.
In this way, liver perfusion and cardiac output were successfully reduced and heart failure was treated.
Thus, the described technique represents an alternative to hepatic artery ligation when percutaneous embolization is not possible or is unsuccessful.
The diagnosis of mastitis has been made in 3% of biopsies of benign disease in our own study material in 20 years.
While puerperal mastitis occurs in approximately 1% in relation to the number of births today, the various forms of nonpuerperal mastitis have become quite prominent, both clinically and histopathologically.
In addition to inflammatory reactions as accompanying phenomena, the majority of currently diagnosable mastitis are chronic granulomatous forms with a broad spectrum of causes.
Only a small proportion is an expression of a pathogen-related infectious or specific disease, sarcoidosis or panniculitis.
Autoimmune mastitis represents B-lymphocytic mastitis with tumor-like fibrosis occurring in diabetes mellitus type I (diabetic mastopathy), endocrine and rheumatoid diseases.
In cases without features of secretory activity (lobular secretion) and when pathogen-induced mastitis is suspected, bacterioscopic and microbiological examinations should always be performed on fresh material.
Infectious colitis with the gram-positive bacterium Clostridium difficile occurs preferentially in immunocompromised patients or those receiving antibiotic treatment.
We report 2 boys, 5 and 14 years old, respectively, with Clostridium difficile-related colitis without the aforementioned preexisting conditions or a specific underlying condition.
The weaning process, if not carefully organized, prolongs the duration of mechanical ventilation.
Recent prospective studies show that the use of an appropriate protocol results in an earlier onset of weaning and a significant reduction in mechanical ventilation time.
Both daily screening of respiratory function and attempts at spontaneous breathing are valuable aids that should be included in a weaning protocol.
Once the condition and ability to breathe spontaneously are documented, extubation of ventilated patients should be encouraged, as sufficient evidence demonstrates that 65-70% of ventilated patients can be successfully extubated after an attempt at spontaneous breathing.
Gradual discontinuation of mechanical ventilation may be undertaken in patients in whom spontaneous breathing attempts have been unsuccessful.
Two randomized trials show that the strategy used to discontinue mechanical ventilation affects the speed and magnitude of weaning success and that SIMV is the least successful weaning technique.
Secondary septorhinoplasty in patients with cleft lip and palate is intended to improve the shape and function of the nose.
The aim of this study was to compare baseline findings and surgical outcomes in 30 patients with unilateral cleft LCG.
Open rhinoplasty was used to correct the nasal deformity.
Soft tissue analysis of the nose was performed by measuring standardized nasal grid photographs and lateral cephalometric radiography.
Deviations of the nose symmetry, the nose width and the nasal wing attachment line from the ideal shape were determined.
An assessment of the nasal profile was made by measuring the nasofacial, nasolabial angle, the angle between the upper lip and the Frankfurt horizontal, and the angle between the columella and the Frankfurt horizontal.
Anterior rhinomanometry was used to evaluate air patency.
The total flow (cm3/s) was determined, and the flow of the cleavage and non-cleavage sides were compared.
The examinations were performed immediately before and 6 months after the surgical procedure.
In the frontal plane, a significant correction of the nasal symmetry and an equalization of the nasal wing inclination are achieved.
Significant improvement of the acute nasofacial angle and the deep nasal wing was not achieved.
The intervention increased the total flow and achieved a correction of the quotient of the flows of the cleavage and non-cleavage sides.
The examination methods used allow the esthetically and functionally relevant findings to be objectified and thus serve as quality control.
Studies and reports of adverse events following manual therapy of the spine from 1989-1996 were examined.
No properly conducted prospective or retrospective studies of complications associated with spinal manipulative treatment can be found in the literature.
Because of its excellent soft tissue contrast, conventional MRI is the imaging modality of choice in the evaluation of ankle disorders.
Conventional MRI can reliably visualize normal and acutely injured ligaments.
However, in the subacute and chronic stages of injury, the joint fluid necessary for accurate delineation of the injured ligaments is often absent.
MR arthrography should be performed in these cases because intraarticular KM application distends the joint space with improved discrimination of intraarticular structures.
This joint distension with MR arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans, because in cases of unstable lesions, KM circumvagination of the dissect can be more easily visualized.
Finally, because of its high contrast and joint distension, MR arthrography also improves detection of intra-articular free joint bodies, which often require surgical treatment.
MR arthrography although invasive provides essential additional information in the study of the post-traumatic ankle joint as well as various ankle disorders.
The therapeutic goal of resuscitation after acute treatment must be the social reintegration of the person, ideally the state before the onset of the emergency.
The present study investigated the long-term outcome of patients resuscitated for out-of-hospital cardiovascular arrest of cardiac origin in a rural area.
Varicophlebitis is the most important acute complication of truncal varicosis of the v. saphena magna and/or parva type.
Ascension may result in migration of the thrombus into the deep venous system via the orifices of the truncal veins in the groin and popliteal fossa or via insufficient vv. perforantes, threatening the complication of pulmonary embolism.
Type I includes varicophlebitis of the truncal veins without involvement of the orifices of the great and/or parietal veins and the deep venous system.
In type IV, the thrombus migrates transfascially into the deep veins via insufficient perforating veins.
In these cases, the varicosis is surgically repaired only after the acute symptoms have subsided.
Surgery includes crossectomy, extirpation of the truncal vein via separate incisions, excision of all varicose branches, and ligation of insufficient perforating veins.
In type III, thrombectomy via the saphenous and/or parva vein orifice has priority over all other measures.
Pachydermodactyly is an acquired, symptomless thickening of the lateral parts of the fingers and occurs almost exclusively in young men.
Formalpathogenetically, the disease is based on benign fibromatosis.
Based on own observations and a literature review, exogenous factors in the form of compulsive acts seem to be the main cause of the lesions.
Microangiopathic hemolytic anemias (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura = TTP or Moschcowitz syndrome, hemolytic uremic syndrome = HUS) are often accompanied by central nervous system involvement.
Typical symptoms include irritability, restlessness, confusional states, clouding of consciousness, seizures, or focal neurologic deficits.
We report a 52-year-old patient with HUS/TTP due to pneumococcal sepsis.
She developed an acute brain-organic psychosyndrome with progressive disturbance of consciousness until coma.
Initial cranial computed tomography showed discrete generalized brain swelling, which resolved independently of clinical deterioration.
Cranial magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable.
Transcranial Doppler sonography revealed generalized flow velocity increases (middle cerebral artery, anterior and posterior bilaterally, and basilar artery).
The causal relationship between flow velocity increases and disturbances of consciousness is made probable by the observation that clinical improvement was analogous to the regression of flow velocity increases.
Pathophysiologically, impaired prostacyclin metabolism, elevation of serotonin and platelet factor IV, and leukocyte activation are discussed as causes.
Continuous follow-up of anterior cruciate ligament injuries confirms the correctness of the patient-adapted approach.
Although the gold standard for the treatment of ACL injuries is replacement arthroplasty, reinsertion with autologous reinforcement is an excellent option in adolescents.
We report a rare case of posttraumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk.
This was preceded by a blunt thoracic trauma in the context of a traffic accident.
A computed tomography (CT) scan failed to diagnose the vascular injury.
In patients with fractures of the cranial ribs after blunt thoracic trauma, angiography must be requested whenever possible to rule out life-threatening vascular injury.
The official German guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia by the former Federal Health Office (now Robert Koch Institute) are now 12 years old.
The recently published official recommendations of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are based on existing scientific data and categorized according to their value.
These comprehensive recommendations are much more detailed than the official German guidelines and in some cases differ considerably from them.
This brief presentation of the American guidelines is intended to provide the clinician with a sound decision-making aid for his or her own practical activities with regard to many everyday, but by no means incidental, problems.
A 57-year-old female patient with progressive systemic scleroderma underwent prolonged therapy with iloprost for 21 days.
The dosage was 2 ng/kgKGxmin over a phase-in period of 6 days.
Therapy resulted in improvement of inflammatory parameters, lung function, especially diffusion capacity, and marked acral circulatory disturbance.
Due to its central location, the elbow joint is considered the most important joint of the upper extremity from a functional point of view.
Bony and ligamentous injuries of the proximal forearm confront the treating physician with a number of diagnostic and therapeutic problems.
Post-traumatic conditions at the elbow joint, which are accompanied by chronic pain symptoms and movement restrictions, inevitably reduce the ability to use the entire arm.
Today, there is little doubt that in the majority of cases, primary definitive osteosynthetic treatment with exact reconstruction of the articular surface is as indispensable for a satisfactory result as an early start of physiotherapeutic exercise measures.
With increasing understanding of the anatomical and biomechanical features of the proximal forearm, a decisive change in therapeutic principles has taken place in recent decades, the current status of which is presented in the present paper, taking into account the relevant literature.
In ICD patients, electrode complications can have fatal consequences.
Manipulation by the patient of subcutaneously located electrode sections that can be felt through the skin can lead to damage to the probe.
We present a simple implantation technique to avoid both subcutaneous electrode runs and transmuscular subclavian puncture.
This drug is a further development of mycophenolic acid, which was already used successfully in patients with psoriasis in the 1970s.
In this review, the mechanism of action and pharmacology of mycophenolate mofetil are presented and the current experience with this drug in dermatology is summarized.
With the automatic scanning and storage of volumes, 3D technology now offers the possibility of tomographically analyzing structures in detail in individual steps.
Image planes that cannot be displayed using conventional technology can be reconstructed from the electronic memory without any problems.
Surface and transparency modes additionally allow a plastic representation of stored structures.
With these different imaging options and the lossless long-term storage of volumes, transvaginal 3D sonography sets new standards in the fine diagnosis of early pregnancy.
In a 65-year-old patient, 36 ml of a 7.45% potassium chloride solution was accidentally infused into a lumbar epidural catheter within 3 h on the first postoperative day.
After transient paresthesias, the accidental infusion resulted in burning pain in the legs associated with motor and sensory loss of innervation up to the TH 11 segment. The clinical picture was accompanied by vegetative symptoms such as hypertension and tachycardia.
Complications such as the one described are generally due to errors, the occurrence of which is not impossible, but can be made less likely by taking appropriate measures.
Such measures include color-coding lines, filters, and infusion solutions, and using syringe pumps with a larger drug reservoir to reduce the frequency of syringe changes.
The observation of alveolar ridge profiles and clinical experience show that the transversal dimension has been neglected in dental implantology so far.
With regard to a basic evaluation of the influence of alveolar ridge height and width, the analysis of 95 edentulous osseous maxillae from collections, which had been sawed, measured and classified in a standardized way, was carried out first.
For 4 implant types (10 mm minimum length), 1076 implantations were simulated on 269 cross-sections and evaluated according to implant type, cross-section position and atrophy class.
A similar procedure was followed in the clinical part of the study in 24 consecutive implant patients with edentulous maxillae.
Implant placement on the cadaveric jaw was possible in only 35% of the cross-sections, but could actually have been expected in another 4.5% if the jaw height was sufficient.
Implant length reductions were additionally necessary in 6%.
There were dependencies especially to the atrophy class.
Anterior cross sections offered much more favorable conditions than posterior ones.
In contrast, implantability was not present in any of the 24 patients.
Primary insufficient height was present in 22 cases, 2 times a transversal too narrow alveolar ridge was found only under surgery in case of sufficient height.
The results allow quantification of the importance of vertical and transverse maxillary alveolar ridge dimension.
This importance lies primarily with bone height, although reductions in implant length are often necessary even with sufficient height.
However, both the cadaveric jaw (12% of the sections with expected implantability) and the patient (8%) are left with alveolar ridge profiles for which the sole height measurement simulates incorrect conditions and an exactly planned surgical procedure may have to be aborted.
The complexity and price of implantological rehabilitation and the consequences of incorrect preoperative planning justify or even require extended sectional diagnostic measures.
Positron emission tomography (PET) represents a new imaging technique that can be used to study metabolic processes rather than morphological changes.
Since tumors exhibit increased glycolysis, they can be detected using radiolabeled glucose and PET.
This approach has already proven successful in different tumor entities.
This study investigated PET in lymph node staging of urinary bladder carcinoma.
In 64 patients, PET of the pelvis was performed preoperatively after i. v. injection of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) so that the PET findings could be compared with the histologic findings of the surgical specimen after classical surgical lymph node staging.
Lymph node staging correctly identified positive lymph nodes in 14 patients;
From these data, a sensitivity of 67%, a specificity of 86% and an accuracy of 80% can be calculated.
Thus, PET results are encouraging and appear to be better than classical staging techniques, such as CT and MRI.
Serum immunoglobulin levels and IgG subclasses were determined from 220 patients with chronic recurrent rhinosinusitis to reveal immune deficiency.
Only 9 patients had subnormal total immunoglobulin levels, but 21 patients had immune subclass defects.
It influences the decision whether antibiotic therapy and/or immunoglobulin administration is necessary.
If chronic infections of the paranasal sinuses persist despite conservative therapy, a mucosa-sparing paranasal sinus operation is indicated, which, however, cannot bring the desired success in this clinical picture alone.
Immune subclass deficiency should be considered as an indicator of a dysfunctional immune system.
Transitions to severe immune deficiency with development of malignancies are observed.
We report a 64-year-old female patient who had extensive erythematopapulosquamous lesions on the right half of the trunk and on the right leg along the Blaschko lines.
The clinical and histologic picture led to the diagnosis of lichen striatus, a dermatosis that usually occurs in childhood.
Treatment with acitretin resulted in a marked decrease in lesions.
Lichen striatus and its differential diagnoses-especially "adult blaschkitis," first described in 1990-are discussed.
Preservation of potency and urinary incontinence after rectal resection has increased after nerve-sparing dissection and complete excision of the mesorectum have become common.
Nevertheless, postoperative rates of impotence and urinary incontinence ranging from 25% to 67% are found in the literature.
Material and Methods:
Autonomic pelvic nerve fibers were visualized on 10 cadavers and 2 formalin-fixed isolated pelvic specimens.
Their positional relationship and possible sites of damage were visualized and photodocumented during surgical mobilization of the rectum.
The autonomic nerves in the pelvis are anatomically well-defined structures with little interindividual variability.
The inferior mesenteric plexus forms a dense fibrous network around the trunk of the inferior mesenteric artery (AMI) for a distance of 5 cm.
The distance between the lateral rectal wall and the pelvic muscle is only 2-3 mm.
The anterior surface of the rectum is separated from the neurovascular bundle only by Denonvillier's fascia.
The parasympathetic branches of the sacral roots S2-S5 cannot be isolated via the standard surgical approach.
1. the nomenclature of the fasciae and the course of the autonomic nerves in the lesser pelvis have not been clearly clarified in the literature.
2. high drop of AMI inevitably leads to damage of sympathetic nerve fibers.
3. the close positional relationship between rectum and autonomic nerve fibers makes sharp dissection under direct vision inevitable.
4. fasciae and nerves can be used as guide structures during preparation.
5. selective sparing of parasympathetic roots in the lesser pelvis is not feasible via the standard surgical approach.
Early detection of second cancers in the primary diagnosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma is significant for prognosis and is seminal for treatment planning.
In a prospective study, 83 patients with histologically confirmed primary squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and lip underwent panendoscopy during staging from 1993-1998 to determine whether this method could be used for early diagnosis of simultaneous secondary carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.
Panendoscopy was initiated with rigid tracheobronchoscopy, followed by rigid esophagoscopy.
This was followed by endoscopic examination of the naso-, oro- and hypopharynx.
The final step was microlaryngoscopy.
Biopsies and microbiological smears were taken from suspect areas.
The proportion of simultaneous second cancers was 8.4%.
Precancerous lesions could also be diagnosed by panendoscopy.
This study and 2 retrospective studies (1988-1994) from the Clinic and Polyclinic for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and the Tumor Center Regensburg (1993-1997) confirm the high proportion of second carcinomas in a primarius in the "head and neck area".
Based on the good experience to date and the complication-free course, this examination obviously does not pose any additional risk to patients, which is why panendoscopy can be recommended without restriction for the staging of tumors in the head and neck region.
The diagnosis of Huntington's disease can pose significant problems due to the high variability of the clinical picture, especially at the beginning of the disease.
We present a 21-year-old female patient with confirmed Huntington's disease in whom psychopathological changes formed the main symptomatology over 7 years and were misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.
The very early onset of the disease and the fact that the onset of the disease was significantly earlier than in other affected family members were unusual and therefore responsible for the misdiagnosis.
However, the phenomenon of bringing forward the onset of the disease is well documented in the literature for the case of transmission of the mutant gene from the father.
The differential diagnosis was guided by the attention paid to the initially discreet abnormalities in the patient's movement pattern and the subsequent detailed investigation of the family history.
Dermatologic inpatient rehabilitation can be provided with varying emphasis:
as climatic therapy, as (balneo-)phototherapy or in a psychosomatic framework.
Since certain patient groups benefit from this differently, indications for psychosomatic treatment are elaborated:
This applies to the simultaneous presence of a dermatological disease and a mental disorder.
Furthermore, such therapy is indicated in dermatoses of psychological genesis or with psychological involvement, when depressiveness, functional complaints, previous emotional stress or psychotherapy motivation are present.
In case of problems in processing the disease, other dermatoses, not least malignant neoplasms of the skin, should also be an indication for inpatient psychosomatic treatment.
In the following, the significance of orthopedic aids such as bandages and orthoses for functional disorders in the area of the lateral ligamentous apparatus of the ankle joint will be presented.
Subsequently, the mechanisms of action of orthoses described in the literature are explained in terms of joint stabilization, injury prevention, and influence on athletic performance and proprioceptive abilities.
The present work deals with long-term changes in cemented Mueller-type polyethylene cups.
Cold flow and abrasion cause changes in the shape of the polyethylene to varying degrees.
The amount of abrasion is detectable by the displacement of the femoral head in the cup.
Within the first few years postoperatively, there is a relatively high annual head displacement of 0.5 mm.
It levels off after about 5 years at values around 0.1 mm (ceramic head) and 0.2 mm (metal head).
Values for head displacement exceeding 0.2 mm per year are considered unfavorable with regard to prosthesis loosening.
In this study, the center of the femoral head was determined in relation to the cup marker wire in a total of 369 hip prostheses, and the head displacement was calculated.
After an average run time of 77 months, 96% of the ceramic heads (n = 109) had an attrition rate of less than 0.2 mm per year.
For the metal heads used (Protasul-2 and Protasul-10), this value was achieved in only 71% (n = 260) (duration 61.5 months).
The sliding pairing polyethylene - ceramic reduces abrasion by half compared to the pairing polyethylene - metal.
In younger patients, the use of a ceramic head is preferred.
If there is an indication to perform electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients who are incapable of giving consent, the consent of the guardian is required to perform the curative treatment.
With reference to the risk of persistent retrograde amnesia, the Hamburg Regional Court had assumed that there was a justified risk of long-term damage to health and had affirmed the requirement for approval.
However, electroconvulsive therapy is a safe and effective therapeutic intervention for the treatment of depression and schizophrenic psychosis, provided that contraindications are observed.
The use of unilateral short-pulse stimulation reduces the frequency and severity of cognitive side effects.
In particular, retrograde amnesias occur very rarely and to a degree that is negligible given the hazards of the underlying disease.
In the authors' opinion, a guardianship court approval requirement under the guardianship law must be negated.
Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is induced in genetically predisposed individuals and autosomal dominant inheritance by volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine, among others.
The in vitro contracture test (IVKT) according to the protocol of the European MH Group represents the "gold standard" of phenotypic diagnosis for MH predisposition due to its high sensitivity (97-99%) and specificity (93.6%) and the genetic variability of the disease.
On the other hand, there is a high coupling between mutations at the ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) and MH disposition.
After the C1840T mutation (Arg614Cys) at the RYR1 gene was detected in one individual of an extended family, the presence of this mutation in the remaining family members and the concordance with IVKT was of interest.
Ultrasound diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in children is described.
Lymphatic systemic disease of the child is relatively uniform sonographically:
initially, lymph node and organ enlargements, as well as disturbance of normal echotexture are found mostly in the form of hypoechogenic lesions.
On the parenchymal organs, 4 main infiltration patterns are observed sonographically:
diffuse, small-nodular, large-nodular and the "Bulcky type".
Successful therapy can be seen on ultrasound by normalization of lymph node and organ size, return of normal organ echogenicity, and regression of tumor- or inflammation-related complications.
Differential diagnostic clues are derived from the topographic distribution pattern and sonographic appearance of the lesions, and, with some reservation, from echogenicity and perfusion ratios that can be analyzed by Doppler sonography.
The primary diagnosis must always be confirmed histologically.
Background and Question.
In transient acantholytic dermatosis, first described by Grover in 1970, clinically there are usually pruritic, edematous or hyperkeratotic papules or papulovesicles predominantly on the trunk that heal spontaneously after weeks to months.
Histologically, acantholysis is typical.
With etiology unclear to date, light, sweating, and heat are discussed as provoking factors.
