Rabies cases increase in northeast Thailand
Dr. Tawichai of the Ninth Prevention and Disease Control Office revealed on February 9 that the number of rabies cases has increased in the northeast of Thailand in recent months, with a total of 74 cases.
As of the beginning of this year (October-September), 67 people have tested positive for rabies in the northeastern provinces of Srin and Brilam, and 74 in the northern provinces.
All of them had been vaccinated against rabies in the past.
The doctor urges people to get vaccinated against rabies with their pets and to avoid touching the saliva of suspected infected animals.
Rabies is not only transmitted to dogs, but also to cats and bats.
Although almost 100% of people who become infected die from the disease, vaccination can prevent death from the disease.

The Korean Peninsula
The Park Chung farm, located in the mountainous area of the Shikoku region, is mostly a steeply sloping field with poor soil.
These farms had the highest yields in any year.
The feeding and water supply of the Qingdao Central Zoo is highly regarded.
The business was launched in 2011 with the mission to deliver aquaculture products for feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
While over-performing the fishing program, in recent years, it has been supporting farms in the city of Qingdao, such as the procurement of farm equipment.
However, this time the company did not support the city of Qingdao, but a farm in the neighboring county of Mirage.
And I decided to help the "group" at Park Chung Farm, which is one of the toughest farms in the county.
I'm not going to let you go.

FUJI to prevent abandonment of accidents System development experiment with own vehicle and the Central Economic News of Aichi, Gifu, Mitsubishi and Shizuoka Economic information
Fuji, a manufacturer and distributor of electronic component-implemented robots and machine tools, has embarked on the development of a system to prevent "abandonment" such as children being left behind in cars.
It's a system that puts human sensors in cars, and when it detects a person's movement, it sends a notification to the phone and the chat.
Currently, the company is conducting demonstration experiments in its own facility's delivery vehicle.
Protect children in the event of a traumatic accident caused by abandonment.
Currently, two delivery vehicles of the Teracoya THANK (Terracoya Sank) after-school English-speaking school for children run by the company in Hokkaido are being tested.
The human sensors are installed in three ceilings of the car to detect the temperature difference between the person and the surrounding environment.
When a vehicle's engine is turned off and the doors are closed, it automatically sends a warning notification when it detects human movement after a certain amount of time has passed.
The engine and door are linked to each other to prevent mis-detection.
The warning is transmitted through the cloud.
The number is called by the user to the pre-registered number, and the message is displayed in the chat of the computer or smartphone.
It is possible to register multiple addresses, and to avoid mistakes such as omissions.
The proof-of-concept experiment will continue until the end of February.
Director of the Innovation Promotion Department, Shinori Ikegami, noted that "during the experiment, peripheral challenges outside the system have also been seen".
He said he was able to pick up on a number of issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers could focus on driving.
And if you want to spread the solution, you can do it.
The development of the abandonment prevention system was inspired by the nation's second consecutive bus abandonment accident.
We had suggestions from employees with young children about what we could do to protect their safety.
The company decided to use the know-how it had acquired through its FA (factory automation) related business, IoT (Internet of Things) and information management using sensors to develop.
FUJI's abandonment prevention system is a sell-out.
The sensor can be installed simply by sticking it to the ceiling with a pin.
The introduction of the new technology will be made easier by the ease of its installation in the delivery vehicle.
In the future, we will consider the commercialization of the project, while also seeking cooperation with kindergartens and kindergartens.
The construction of the new Tōhoku-Osaka line, which was scheduled to start in fiscal 2023, has been postponed and has begun to affect the urban development of Tōhoku-Osaka in Fukui Prefecture.
In the city of Kochi, where the new station will be installed, the location of the station is not shown in detail, but the city plan including the surrounding maintenance is underway.
The plan is considered to take a long time to develop and is expected to be published as soon as possible.
The station of the newly planned Northern Railway in Hokkaido will be the only new station in the west of Tōhoku.
In 19 the Railway Construction and Transportation Facility Maintenance Support Agency (RTSE) indicated that the radius of the station was about 2.5 kilometers, centered on the JR East Koyama station.
The exact location of the station and the route were to be determined in the winter of 22 years.
In the city of Kochi, the opening of the new railway line to Dongga and Kochi, which is planned to open in Kochi, will be realized in the 21st year.
The budget for the beginning of the 22nd fiscal year further increases the number of businesses and is trying to advance urban development that includes the location and publication of the new station.
However, the exact location of the new station is not yet known.
The city has allocated 3 million yen to the current annual budget to consider land use and maintenance concepts based on the location of the new station and to prepare a basic plan, but it is expected to be unenforced.
The city plan centering on the new station "will take time to reach a consensus among citizens" (the city official).
There are examples of new suburban stations in the prefecture that do not adjoin existing JR stations in the city of Taipei, but it seems that it will take a considerable amount of time to put together the overall concept.
The longer the delay in the announcement, the shorter the preparation period until the opening, and the impact on the surrounding development is feared.
Before the new station site, the extension west of Dunga is obscured.
In October last year, the citizens' organizations of the city of Kyoto on the extension route submitted their signatures to the Ministry of Transport and Land Transport requesting the withdrawal of the white paper of the extension plan.
The Shigawa Prefecture government has received a notice of construction, raised calls for reconsideration of the original Miyama route, and has made moves to return the settled route set to the original. The situation in the neighboring prefecture is difficult to say.
The reception of the citizens of Kochi to the construction inspection is relatively calm, but the location of the new station is unknown, and the opening time remains unclear, and there is concern that it will affect the future luck.
Mayor Matsuzaki Yagichi plans to continue his demands to the country for the early opening of the full line, but the voice of the coastal area demanding an early start of construction will be essential.
The indifference of the government and the neighboring prefectures to the idea that "Shinkansen will one day pass to the west of Dunga" does not move the government.
I want you to keep raising your voice.
The first time in three years that the tasting was resumed was at the February 9th chocolate sale for Valentine's Day at the Shizuoka Fuki shop in Fuki City, Fuki Prefecture.
Before Valentine's Day on February 14, the price of chocolate in the store has risen due to the increase in raw materials and packaging, and the sales of high-priced bars for "reward chocolates" for yourself, family and friends are going well.
In the retail and confectionery shops in Fukui Prefecture, they try to attract customers with products that showcase local colors, high-end feel, and an attachment to materials.
The Shibuya Fuki store in Fukui City opened a special sales area on the 6th floor of the event venue on January 25.
As of 14 December, the company sells about 40 brands and 450 varieties of sweets, including 10 sweets shops in the prefecture.
Chocolate with Fuji earth spirit, and sand products mixed with raw chocolate in cookies are popular.
According to the store's representative, the store prices of many of the products have increased by about 10% compared to the previous year.
This year's trend is "more products that are characterized by their focus on materials and packaging, and more products that are characterized by a sense of high-end. The trend of consumers is to buy, eat and enjoy for themselves and their families".
Despite the price hike, sales in the high-end segment are good.
The price of the product is going up by 25 yen per unit.
"We're thinking of creating a marketplace where people can enjoy the event itself", the person said.
The store has been selling sweets recommended for the day shift since January 26, and has resumed tasting meals for the first time in three years.
The Western Candy Company, headquartered in Sakayama City, Minato-ku, Japan, launched its original KISEKI series of chocolate to the Valentine trade fair at the end of last year.
It is characterized by its obsession with cocoa beans and its fruity taste, which is tempered with bitterness. It is sold for 1,000 yen in three pieces and 3,000 yen in nine pieces.
The company's director of purchasing, Takakura Toroma, says, "While the culture of bridal chocolates is gradually fading, there is a demand for a little luxury on Valentine's Day. We are increasing the added value of the goods and seeking to differentiate".
If you want to get chocolate from a woman, ask a question to a chatbot.
On the 9th, a 20-something female employee from Fukui City visited a shop in Fukui, Hokkaido, and stated that she "originally loved chocolate, but now that she has a job and can get money, she wants to buy it as a reward for herself".
A 30-something company employee who bought chocolate in her brother-in-law said, "It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolate, so I want to give it to my family or someone who usually takes care of me once a year. But maybe fewer people will give it".
Products made with Fukuoka mai and midizomato from the prefecture = February 9, Fukuoka Prefectural Office
Seven-Eleven Japan announced that on February 9, six new products including food products from Fukui Prefecture such as sweet potatoes will be sold in 339 stores in three prefectures of Hokkaido from the same day.
As a project to commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the comprehensive coordination agreement on the provincial government, we will appeal to the attractiveness of the provincial products.
The company also offers seafood, seafood noodles, and tamari sauce made from freshly fried sweet potatoes, salads made from local tomatoes, four new products of the doughnut cake and the peanut butter cream, and the sauce and sauce of the Fukui mai.
We're going to sell it until the 20th.

On the 9th, the Deputy Director of the Operations Headquarters, Akatsuki Ige, paid a tribute visit to the Governor of Sugimoto.
After tasting the juice, Governor Sugimoto said, "The sweetness of the sweet potato is so strong that it is delicious".
The company representative said that "we would like to continue to develop products using products from Fukui Prefecture".
The castle site of the Bukehara castle, which is said to have been built in preparation for the battle with the Hiroshigei temple.
The area of the city of Okano in Fukui Prefecture, formerly the area of the large Koikei-hara mansion.
In the Kamakura period, the castle was built in the middle of the potting hill in the district to prepare for the battle against the Hokage, which was in conflict with the castle.
The story is based on the military history of the country.
No records of the castle survive, but the 11th volume of the Taipei Chronicle, "The Passing of the Cow Ranch Homicide", states:
He was an official of the Takakura shogunate. He was sent to Odaichi as a head of the shogunate.
In 1333, the Six-Borō Endeavor, established in Kyoto to control the imperial court and the West, was defeated by the shogun, and the Shōkaku shogunate was destroyed by the shogun Shinta.
When the news of the Six Waves' destruction reached the family of the Emperor, they fled, leaving only about twenty men.
The monks of the Hokusai Temple have broken through the gap and invaded.
When he threw his wife and two children into the river, he killed himself.
⇒ The castle where the Emperor, Hideyoshi and his family were united
The "Some Things in the Dry Side History" was published in 2014 by the "Some Things in the Dry Side History" association, which is formed by local residents.
The story of the tragic death of the shogun is presented in a comic book so that even elementary school students can understand it.
Mr. Nagiokawa Nagiokawa, who was involved in the publication, said that he wanted "the people of the region to get to know the history of the region, and to tell it to posterity".

The Castle of the Bulls
The castle site is accessible by a hiking trail maintained by the dry-side maintenance society.
The summit is about 200 meters from the entrance.
The road leading to the pass is sometimes closed to vehicles in winter due to snowfall.
I'm gonna go to the dry cleaners.
About 220 households in the dry side district of Okano joined the group.
In the past, it has published "Trisets of the Dry Side", which introduced the ancient tombs, historical sites and sights in the district.
The station "Lotaku-ri-ahara" is under construction in the city of Kizi-zaki, Fukui Prefecture, and will open on April 22.
The opening of the new Hokkaido Shinkansen station in the spring of 2024 is anticipated to attract about 360,000 users annually as a new regional development and tourist destination in the northern area of the city.
The main dining and shopping facilities at the station are built of steel and plaster and have a floor area of 975 square meters.
The total area of the station including parking and children's park is 8137 square meters.
The facilities also have rest areas and tourist information booths.
Electric bikes are available for rent, and there is a shower room.
The two car parks can accommodate 66 small and large cars (including 3 for the disabled).
The mayor of the city, Mori Sushi, made this clear at a regular meeting on February 8.
In the food corner, they sell fruit-based paffets from the hills north of Sakai, and sweet pastries from the golden age of rice.
The company will develop a menu that uses local ingredients, such as egg-based dishes using Fukuoka chicken, autumn-winter-only dishes using Northern Hokkaido cucumbers.
The direct sales "Consignor Council" currently has about 60 members.
It also enriches the taste of processed products such as lunch and vegetables, and agricultural and horticultural products such as seedlings and plants.
The gift corner is where the works of the author residing in the Mori Museum of Kinjin's creation are exhibited and sold, as well as candy, wine, and traditional handicrafts.

The station is managed by the designated administrator, the Awa Running Joint Venture Company established by President Miyagi Satsuji, who runs the theme park "Land of the Hare" in Kaga City, Ishikawa Prefecture, which is accessible to rabbits.
During the meeting, Mayor Mori said that "we will restore and increase vitality and vitality throughout the city of Aomori, and connect it to improving the lives of local residents and revitalizing the community".
A cat-like delivery robot is being introduced at the "Iowa Salt-ripened Genghis Kanbun Fujiwara Station" store.
The family's facial expressions are well received by the family guests.
In the food industry in Fukui Prefecture, which suffers from a shortage of labor, there is a movement to introduce a delivery robot that delivers food to guests.
The company's efforts to reduce the cost of running the store, the "non-contact" reception of the new coronavirus infection, and the lovely face of the robot were well received by family customers.
Restaurant owners and stakeholders have said that "rural restaurants will have difficulty securing employees and part-time jobs, and delivery robots will become more widespread".
"Gin, gin, gin and gin and gin and gin".
A robot with a cat's face on the screen, carrying a load of food, runs smoothly through the store, playing light music.
When you arrive at the table, you say, "I have brought the food you ordered, Nia".
The second street of the main street of Fukui, the "Iwaki-salt-matured Jingis-kambo-bu Fukui station store", introduced a cat-like delivery robot in August 2022.
The robot, which is waiting near the kitchen, loads the food ordered by the customer, presses the table number on the screen, and it automatically runs to the table and delivers it.
The AI voice function is built-in, responds to the touch of the customer, and the cat facial expressions are also rich.
The "Bobby Group" which runs the store has introduced delivery robots in two stores including the store.
Minosuke Saito, the president of the company, says that the reason for the introduction of "the shortage of manpower is the biggest", and emphasizes that it is part of the productivity increase due to the reduction of manpower and digital transformation.
The proportion of the cost of human resources to the sales of the store is usually about 30%, but the introduction has been reduced to 21 or 22%.
Robots also have the role of collecting the dishes that customers have finished eating, leading to the efficiency of cleaning up afterwards, and "their family members and children can enjoy and promote", he adds.
The "Six-Star-Shan Fuki" restaurant for grilled meat and hormone-containing dishes in Araki-shi-Bō town, Fukui, also introduced a distribution robot in August 22nd.
The head of the Sonsan store, Sam Yung-Fuk, says: "It is not easy to recruit employees or part-time workers. I thought it would be absolutely necessary to solve the shortage of labor".
In Fukui stores, the distribution zone is divided into the employee and robot distribution areas.
The lease of the robot is equivalent to the salary of a part-time worker.
To save money, the store is considering the introduction of a robot ordering system, a tablet device, and a self-service system.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, the effective job search rate for the December 22, 2012 job category was 6.94 times that of "receptionist services" such as restaurants, which are the jobs with the highest labor shortage.
The representative of the net system (Fukuoka City, Takayuki Central 2nd Street), which is responsible for the sales agency of the distribution robot, says that "the shortage of food stores in the prefecture is getting more serious due to the impact of the coronavirus, and there are many inquiries for the introduction of robots".
"I think that it will be more difficult for suburban shops to secure employees in the future, and delivery robots will become widespread", said Mr. Sun.
The town of 越前 has created an ending note and distributed it to the townspeople who wish.
When I published a "Kukuyaumi Handbook" last year, which covered the procedures necessary when a family member died, written lists of inheritances, and family tree charts, many people came to receive it for themselves.
In the provinces, courses on how to write endings and life-long organizing are also often held. "Lifetime" seems to be firmly established in the people of the province.
The end note of the town of Waianui is 35 pages long.
The book is divided into five chapters, beginning with a review of his own history, his current health, his financial situation, his future care, his hopes for end-of-life care, and his wishes regarding funerals and graves.
There's also a section for things you want to do for the rest of your life, and a section for messages to your loved ones.
It's a lot of work to write 35 pages, but you don't have to fill them all.
What do you want to leave behind for your family and for the people around you?
The point is to make your goals clear.
In bookstores, for example, a variety of notes are sold for the purpose, and you can start writing easily from where you can write.
The term "employment" was coined in 2009.
Two years later, in the year 11, the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred.
It is said that more people have come to see the reality that "death comes suddenly", and more people are preparing for their own end or end.
It's been over a decade.
The new coronavirus that has struck the world is still not over.
The price of electricity has risen to an unexpected level this winter, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and other events.
Half the wages are not rising enough to keep up with the current price increase, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, the costs of funeral, care and burial, which were once shared by brothers and relatives, are now not uncommon for an only child.
And the dilemma is that life expectancy is much higher than it was a long time ago, and the older you get, the higher your risk of dementia and the need for care.
And I want to keep in mind that this is a rise in social anxiety, against the background of a lifetime of transience and settlement.
But, after all, we all want to avoid putting an undue burden on our partners and children.
"Be yourself at the end of your life" sounds like a popular end note, but don't get too lonely.
I don't want to write down my hopes and needs, but I want to consult with my family and calmly prepare for that moment.
Prime Minister Shidao Wenjio (second from right) and the Minister of Education and Science, Yōgō Kondo (third from right) in a memorial photo with the concerned people at the primary school.
The idea that masks are not required for students and teachers at graduation ceremonies is shown by the idea that masks are not required by principle.
The Ministry of Education and Science on February 10th, at the graduation ceremony, the policy of wearing masks for children and students is "basic not to wear".
The head of a large secondary school explains that "it is actually difficult to take the distance between students, and they are worried about how to respond. Some students feel uncomfortable about taking off the mask".
The news of the masks being worn at the graduation ceremony has raised the issue among faculty members.
On the other hand, one primary school principal said, "If the state decides it will be a form not to be worn, it is not realistic to be able to handle it, except for the chorus".
The graduation ceremony also recognized the participation of students who had been abstaining from drinking, resumed the graduates' choir, and sought to ease the measures in some schools in the province.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high school is scheduled to be held in early March, and the public junior high school in mid-March.
The provincial and municipal education committees will wait for the official notification from the Ministry of Education and Culture to decide on the response.
The Ministry of Education has also been cautiously criticised for its policy of not requiring masks in all school activities from the beginning of the new school term this spring.
The head teacher said, "Suddenly, one day, the children are confused by the response of not wearing a mask. After deciding that 'wearing is free', it is natural that more and more children take off their masks".
So let me write this down.
The Ministry of Education and Science decided on February 10 to no longer require masks in school activities from April, following the government's new guidelines for mask-wearing.
Choir, gym class, and group activities are all mask-free.
During the 2022 school year, we will seek infection prevention measures in accordance with the current sanitation management manual, and in the future, we will circulate to the education committee and school sites, such as the precautions after April.
Graduation ceremonies of junior high schools and universities are conducted during the 22nd year, with the implementation of measures such as ventilation. Graduates, faculty members, and participating students do not wear masks.
Hair atrium in Fukui Prefecture, Yamaguchi City, Japan, where the applicant (left) is cut by a scythe
The Hair Salon Elirim in the city of Tsuka, Fukui Prefecture, cuts the hair of the candidates using the annual examination season and the scissors that have been prayed for.
The students said that they felt confident and calm and went to the exam.
The director of the same salon, Yokota Kan, has seen and heard students opening textbooks while waiting for the cut, or expressing anxiety about the exam during the cut.
So I started a petition in 2014 called "If It Helps".
⇒ Final day of the national public tender
In the same year, on the first day of work, the same company in the city of Rakuen-ku, the same beauty salon, has been asked to pray for the passing of the exam.
Every year, 80 people get cut.
High school, college exams, job tests, driver's license exams, and so on.
I'm giving you a pencil that I prayed for.
"To you who's challenging me for the high school exams".
A 21-year-old man, who had received a cut and passed the Tokyo University in active duty, recalled: "I was happy to be supported. I used the gold pencil I received in the exam and was inspired".
The book, self-published by the NPO "Heart-Reacting Collection and Editorial Bureau", "Dear Prime Minister, The Life Dam" from Toshihiro Yume.
"Dear Prime Minister, I have self-published my tenth book, titled "The Life Dam" from Tōhoku Shinjō".
It's been picked up by newspapers across the country, and it's been commented on by many readers.
The purpose of this book is to share with you the causes of suicide in Japan, the "social and structural" environmental problems, and the things I have heard directly from people who have attempted suicide, and to create a "comfortable society".
We have been patrolling the waterfront of Fukui Prefecture and Tōhoku-Hiroi, which is called the suicide hotspot, for 18 years and 10 months to prevent suicide, to find and protect suicide attempters and to help them start again.
The book is a compilation of the issues raised by 784 people who have been protected so far and addresses the following seven points to the Prime Minister regarding the measures required by the country to prevent suicide:
(1) Suicide prevention is a life-saving activity.
(2) There is a "human rights violation" behind the suicide.
(3) Suicides are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) The administration treats and mistreats citizens living outside its jurisdiction as "foreigners".
(5) Drugs and suicide of people with mental illness such as depression are treated as "accidents".
(6) The "duty to take care of safety" in high-risk suicide areas has been forgotten and commercialism has been pursued.
(7) The doctrines of emerging religious groups that cannot be scientifically proven are deceptive, and the act of threatening and offering gold items to others by telling future gossip is blackmail.
The religious organizations that are committing these crimes of fraud and extortion should be disclosed and eliminated.
So, the comments that we have received from people who have subscribed to this book are: "I was impressed by the strong mentality of those who are working on this activity", "This former police officer is a witness in the police", "He is a living god who is so foreign and yet helps his own family as well", and here are some comments that we have received.
I saw the picture in the newspaper and I cried, "What do you think?"
Now, we hear that the number of suicides among people trapped by the coronavirus is increasing.
It's really sad.
Everyone is a person.
I want a society where people can live their lives happily.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude for all the staff who are devoting their hearts to those who have suffered so much that they want to die.
I think this activity is a mental and physical torture, but please continue to speak up for yourself.
Thank you.
I'm not going to.
I hope that you, the readers, will become gatekeepers to the lives of the community.

Since opening 18 years ago, Happijan has been raising three animals, one male and two females, which can be observed and fed at close range.
Mr. Yamada first learned about the capybara five or six years ago.
She said that she was shocked to see a video of her touching hot springs.
I was drawn to her affectionate expression and her humanity.
I was looking forward to seeing them in the near future, after hearing that they were going to be bred in Happijan.
I started taking photographs seriously about three years ago when I bought a one-lens reflex camera.
The capybara is used to capture the lovely image of the capybara, and the body is shaken bubbly to cut water like a drill.
The number of posts on Instagram is about 830, enough to make you look back and say, "I took so many good pictures".
Did you remember Mr. Yamada while you were walking along? The male or female came up and shouted "Kyuuroku-ryu".
"Cute and happy", says Yutaka, and his love for Kapipara grows.
Through social media, she enjoys interacting with capibarians from all over the country, showing them her best shots every month.
Takeda, who would go to the zoo in the nearby prefecture to see the capybara, smiled and said, "I want to photograph and broadcast the foothills of my home mainly from now on".
Instagram searched for "sweet".
The city of Tōkyō is demanding the return of the child support allowance.
On the 10th, the city of Hokkaido announced that there was a total of 600,000 yen in wrong allocation to 12 families for the special allowance for child rearing and family life support for the third year of the year.

According to the city, the discovery was made on January 27, 2005 by the parents of the children who verified the past deposits.
When we checked the total number of beneficiaries of 79 households in 182 households in the same year, we found that the amount of benefits paid on July 20 of the third year of the decree was doubled for 11 households and 12 people.
The city allocates 50,000 yen per child to high school students and under from households exempt from the tax.
The data was extracted from the children, but the data was added by the staff, who mistakenly added the data to the data, not including high school students.
The official of the city's child care support office said that "we will do everything possible to restore trust by taking it seriously, re-checking the data and preventing recurrence".

It's snowing again.
It's not a cold wave from the north, but a southern low pressure moving east over the Japanese archipelago.
After the unusual cold experienced on 24-26 of last month, the days are still light and unpredictable. Even with the same cold, the people of the Republic of Turkey, who were hit by a major earthquake, will be more tolerant.
The building collapsed in an instant.
So far, more than 20,000 people have been killed in Syria, a country known as the "pro-Japanese country", where many are still trapped.
The story begins in 1890, when the Ottoman Empire sent a warship to Japan, the Erturul, to a disastrous shipwreck.
The fact that the residents of the town of Okinawa and the town of Shandong helped and cared for the crew is presented in films and novels. After about 100 years after this accident, the rescue of foreign hostages by Iraq, which occurred on the eve of the Gulf War, has been rewarded by sending Turkish aircraft.
Those who have experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this pain.
I want to take care of you until things calm down, and you're rebuilt and restored.

Berlino Hotel subsidy, unfairly received, accommodation support business in the prefecture and city, already fully refunded
The prefecture and the city of Yakan announced that Berino Hotel Yakan (the city's second largest hotel) had been misusing its subsidies for about a year since October 2021 in their respective subsidy delivery businesses, deducting the cost of accommodation for travelers.
The company applied discounts for the lodging of non-employees, the name loan of employees, and so on.
The use of accommodation by employees was also confirmed in large numbers, which was not in line with the business purpose of "inciting tourism demand".
The total amount of 7.23 million yen has been returned by the 6th of this month, including the independent investigation by the prefecture, city, and hotel.
The unlawful allocation of subsidies was due to the accommodation allocation of the prefecture "Ayote Travel Support Project" implemented due to the spread of the new coronavirus infection and the emergency response project of the city's tourist accommodation "Tiki Accommodation Support".
The period from October 18, 21 to October 10, 22 (the lowest accommodation support quota was September 30, 22), according to the survey, inappropriate use outside the target area and unvaccinated, etc. outside the discount application, amounted to 95 and 587,000 yen, and use that did not correspond to the purpose and purpose of the business amounted to 1,239 and 664,000 yen.
The business commissioner of the prefecture was carrying out the settlement procedure. The user of the accommodation quota and the hotel's receptionist were the same person.
Detailed investigation of the prefecture revealed improper use, and the city that received this information also confirmed the facts.
The city's business has already been closed, and the registration for the prefecture's business was removed on December 2 last year.
In an interview, the director of the Berlin branch of the Tōhoku-Mōchō Order, which runs the hotel, said: "We are sorry to bother you, the people of the region, the prefecture and the city, and many others. We are very reflective. We are a hotel with people in the region, and we want to start again from scratch and work on restoring trust". He said that he plans to hold a training session for all employees once again.
The head of the promotion department of the prefectural tourism and promotion office, Chiba Kishimoto, said: "I sincerely regret. I would like to encourage the observance of the rules, the establishment of compliance, and call for proper use based on the purpose of the business".
Mayor Sato Shinrin commented that "it is truly regrettable that there was improper use of business in the city's accommodation facilities".
He began training in the horse racing arena in Hisao, Osaka.

The project exhibition "People who introduced the flowers of the Tōkyō Peak - Tōkyō Peak Plant Research Essay", which deals with the pioneers who laid the foundation for the study of plants in the Tōkyō Peak, known as the treasury of plants in the Tōkyō Peak, is open until 12 at the City Cultural and Cultural Center in Takayama City.
It collects 124 valuable specimens collected by the ancestors and presents the footprints of the ancestors involved in the plant research of Hachikō-ji.
The botanical research of the early Pike Mountain begins with the Russian botanist Karl Johann Maximovich (1827-91) and the Suzukawa Nobunaga of Suzukawa, who collected plants under the guidance of Maximovich (1842-1925).
Maximovich, who was not allowed to travel freely in the country for foreigners, asked Sokagawa to collect and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Susawa continued to support the research after Maximovich's return to Japan, leading to the release of the Hime-Kozaka-Kara, Nambo-Touchi-Sou, and Miyama-Mabuki-Shouma, which are endemic to the Hime-Ichi-Fukusa mountains.
Later, modern plant taxonomist Fujiwara Matsumoto (1862-1957) published "Nambutranō", "Kobano Tsumekasa", "Nambununazna" in 1903 based on the collected material of local researchers, and "Katoukhakōbe" in 1938 based on the collected material of local researchers.
The exhibition materials show that many researchers have been revealing valuable highland plants.
He was also the head of the Sakura elementary school and a plant researcher who accompanied the survey on the preservation of natural monuments in the year 27 (Showa 2) and also introduced Yukawa Suru (Yukawa Suru) who served as a member of the school staff of the Oton Municipal Mountain Museum and also worked on the publication of "The Plants of the Tōkyō Peak" (1914-88).
The researcher of the center, Yoshida Zong, says: "There is a lot of research behind the names of plants in the Hachikyu mountain, and there are many connections between people. We can trace the connections between researchers from the countryside to the whole country".
The exhibition is divided into four chapters, one focusing on the beliefs and history of Akita-ji, and the second on the characteristics of Akita-ji, based on the research of Heinrich Edmund Nauman (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundations of Japanese geology.

The second meeting of the Council for the Promotion of Decarbonisation, held at the airport of Konami, in the city of Nanhai, China.
The meeting of the Promotion Council discussed the decarbonization of the airport in Chiang Mai, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai.
The "Komichi Airport Decarbonisation Promotion Council" (Chairman, Director of Construction, Osaka Prefecture, 13 members) held its second meeting at the airport on 9th, aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the airport in the city of Komichi, the prefecture and airlines using the airport.
All members present, including online.
The meeting was attended by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, and the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport has set a global target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 46% by 2030 (as compared to the 13th year) for each airport, towards "carbon neutrality" to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In response, the council held its first meeting in November last year and aims to formulate a plan ahead of the other six airports in the province.
The second meeting was as secret as the first, except for the opening.
According to the chairman of the committee, Anjo, who spoke after the meeting, the meeting confirmed the greenhouse gas emissions of the airport.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also been consulted on the implementation of the renewable energy targets and guidelines.
According to the distribution material, the CO2 emissions of the airport equipment and vehicles for the 13 years as a reference are 1476 tons (excluding aircraft).
Of these, the emissions of lighting and air conditioning in seven facilities, including the airport terminal building, accounted for 1321 tons, about 90%, followed by 84 tons of aviation lights, and 71 tons of airport vehicles.
The Council will discuss the reduction of emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Chairman Anjo said, "Now the passage point. The direction of the committee is consistent, and first of all, we want to carefully organize the draft interim report".
In the future, after hearing the interim report at the third meeting and the final report at the fourth meeting, the promotion plan will be developed.
The opening of the "Saka-Tatsu Real Estate" branch in Okinawa, Japan, to attract people to the island, and the recruitment of people who want to rent a house.
Opening event: 8 days, well-known city
The opening event of the Okinawa branch of the real estate web service "Sakawan Real Estate" to visualize the thoughts of those who may want to challenge renting vacant houses and vacant stores, and recruit lenders, was the 8th day of the well-known community space "entaku".
The company will provide a brief overview of the service through a talk session.
The representative director of the branch, Tsujinova (北海道利尻郡) Daikoubuchi Akō, said that "by doing this effort on Okinawa Island, we can create a movement and flow that will attract people to the entire island".
The process of openly contacting the lender and reaching an agreement with the lender is the opposite of the usual real estate procedure.
The service was launched in June 2020 by On-Co Corporation (headquartered in Mitsubishi Prefecture) as a demonstration experiment to explore potential vacant houses and build relationships through vacant houses.
The branch is the seventh in Kyushu and the first in the country.
It's the first time in the whole country.
The event was attended by about 20 people from On-Co and Tsuginoba staff, Okoro, officials from the two cities, and local residents.
Director Daisuke Kubo explains the background of the branch opening: "While the movement to attract people from outside the island is being activated, I thought that if we could use the vacant houses and empty shops, then the town and the island would be more excited".
"We want to connect with people who have properties on the island and want to do something, and help them to do one or more things to help them do that".
On-Co's representative for the Watanabe Yūshitsu pointed out the need to "take care of each vacant house and discuss with the locals what they want to do with the area, who they want to come, and what criteria they choose".
"The deeper the connection between people, the more information they gather", he said, calling on the islanders to participate in the discussion and provide information.

We've arranged for the first special to be held.
I haven't used it yet.
I don't think the price of the products will go down yet.
Do you have any special offers or discounts?
Does the NSR250R light up when the engine is not running and I turn the key ON and control the winch?
If the battery is working, when you turn the key on, it's going to power the ACC, the accessories, so the winch, the brake light, etc. will go off.
I'll give you a horn.
But, you know, if you start the engine, the voltage goes up, and you're fine.
Can you mix the ADATA DDR4 with the Samsung DDR4?
It's a laptop.
In principle, if the pins, voltages, and frequencies are all the same, they can be used together.
And if you have a different frequency, you can also specify that it's going to work for the slowest, but it's not going to work for the best, because sometimes things don't work well for that part.
If you're going to be sleepy in the morning, why don't you get into bed early the day before?
That's right.
Sometimes I think so.
What's the deal with tonight?
It's a hot potato and a lot of chickpeas.
And then, you know, I'll do something about the frozen vegetables.
Why do DQN have so many muscle-bound characters in cartoons and comics?
I don't want to be killed and say, "Oh, my God!"
I don't know about the town detective.
I'm looking for a married man over 60.
You think my pension is all mine?
Don't you think it's a credit to the intern that you've worked for a year?
The pension is earned by the couple.
They're relying on their retirement savings.
Of course, I'll give you credit for the inside scoop.
I'm trying to play a repeating sequence from a certain part of an mp4 file, but is there any free software?
Or, can you do it with the software that's in Windows 10?
And the VLC media player can do this A-B loop playback.
But you can't get them to remember A to B, so you have to specify it every time.
I'm riding the H11 17 Crown Estate.
This is 1J Turbo.
I'm considering replacing the R154's MT, but how much would it cost to replace the mission?
I'm asking for your advice.
Do you ignore the harness, the controls, the settings, all of it?
I'd say it was about 300,000.
I think we should have a million dollars in our pocket.
I have fat on my belly and my buttocks, but do I look fat?
The upper half of the body feels like a middle-aged, fat belly, but the lower half feels like a fat one!
And I think that's a pretty big impression, if you look at it as a whole.
I'm sure my nephew is surfing the Internet, and this is what came up, but is it okay to be full-on?
If you haven't entered a lot of information from here, then you're not registered, so you can ignore it.
Is this a hairy one?
It's called "hairline fracture".
If you're going to keep doing this hairstyle, if you're going to be doing it the wrong way with your comb or brush, you're going to be very susceptible to hair loss, so be careful.
If I'm not mistaken, it's hard to be thin.
If you don't like the look of the epidermis, change it to a hairstyle that doesn't break, that's the solution.
Is this Dan Hill wallet real?
If you buy something from a reputable department store, like a high-end department store, you can get a warranty, so you can say it's genuine, but, "Isn't it?"
Is this a gift?
If you are unsure, check with your local pawn shop or branded store for details.
Didn't you work as a substitute teacher and a substitute teacher when you were a student?
If a student has no experience as a secondary school counselor, it does not necessarily mean that he did not work as a secondary school counselor during his student years, because there is no other person with experience (including those who already have other secondary school counselors).
I'm a high school student.
It's been a little bit colder lately, so I started wearing black stockings, but is it still early in the season?
If you think you're cold, you should wear it.
You don't have to match the time of day around you.
And then when he collapses, he's got no wife, no kids.
At night, my legs and feet are so sore that I can't sleep.
Why are my legs and feet so sore at night?
I'm sure Danny's with you.
It's better to dry the sheets once in a while.
Why is it that when you have a structure that's less than 1/20th the wavelength, you can approximate it to a continuous medium?
And we're going to do this in the form of a structure over λ, so we're going to be continuous with this value.
The lineage of the Fire Emblem Crusade.
Ares has been levelcast.
Did you set the parameters?
If it was less than three pins when you upgraded, it was pretty much reset.
The lover is Leanne.
Magic is 20, skill is 24, luck is 30, and horsepower is 80.
You can Google it and see what the maximum is.
I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do it.
The number one is probably Osaka.
You must be the Chiba and the Kaguya.
Three times in the summer, once in the spring.
Osaka is five times in summer and three times in spring.
I'm looking for a simple chocolate that doesn't have any fruit or extra stuff in it.
If you know, please tell me.
I'd like to see Godiva.
And I'm going to recommend it because it's a little expensive, but it's also very simple.
Do you live alone?
Is there something fun?
I lived alone.
Until last year.
It was fun.
Man is a creature of habit, and if every day is a day of pleasure, then his condition becomes a routine.
When pleasure becomes a daily thing, it doesn't feel like fun unless it's more fun.
I understand that, and I like "the everyday of nothing".
And I feel like I'm in a different place.
Can I have a lot of quail on the grill?
There's no such thing as a "gotta put a little heaven on top of the grilled cheese".
The most common uses are noodles and dough, but they can be baked or roasted.
If you spray paint on stainless steel, will it make it harder for the magnet to stick?
It depends on the magnetic field.
So, as Number One wrote, stainless steel is not magnetized, so it's probably a low-purity stainless steel mixed with iron.
It's a common story in Chinese-made inchi-chicks.
Even if you have a lover who is so good that you can only meet him once in your life, you will eventually break up with him.
How often do you see a pattern of your actual spouse being someone else?
Marriage has a certain momentum and timing.
We got married in such a way that I don't know if we'll ever see each other again.
I'm currently riding a UR3 Vesle.
So, we're looking at a mid-size 2017 model, and we're going to be looking at a late-stage model, but it looks like we're not going to be able to just change the lights.
Did anyone ever specify the pre-mid-late?
How much did it cost?
And what else did you do besides light?
If you have any information, please let me know.
It is generally cheaper to buy the latter.
Tonight is the night.
Thank you for your answer.
I said, "Computer games and comics".
I don't think this is very interesting.
You think it's funny?
Each one of us.
And I think that's why the industry exists.
What if the woman you love took care of all the boxes of chocolates you've ever given her?
If you're going to use it for something, that's fine, but if you're not, I'm a little worried about being a garbage disposal reserve.
Why do older people like to be first?
The person in the front row is always the oldest.
I only see young people in the front seat about once in ten times.
Why is that?
Because priority seats are reserved for the elderly and the disabled.
Do you think it's okay to wear a polo shirt like this in a casual office setting?
It's not as tough as banking or securities.
I think it's important to be in tune with the atmosphere of the people around you.
So, why don't you start by observing the people in your company and trying to judge them?
I think it's just as good as taking between "the person in the fancy dress" and "the person in the dirty dress" in the company.
What about your mother and her best friend?
It's not good.
I'm a member of the Yan clan.
What are you worried about?
Do they have a habit of not wanting to leave their birthplace?
They don't want to leave their homes because they're safe and they can get their food.
If they're in danger or if they're out of food, they leave.
And that's how humans spread from Africa to the rest of the world.
Envy is the feeling of envy.
Envy is not about envying someone else, but envying someone else.
If you apply for both jcb cardw and jcb card plus, will you receive both membership benefits?
JCB CARD W plus L and JCB CARD W are two cards that you can't have at the same time.
You can apply for two, and only one will be issued.
Is there a character in a cartoon or a comic book or a feature film who's hiding who he is, but you think he's been found out, but he's actually someone else?
I mean, I'm tired of people saying, "You don't have to hide your identity!"
Full frontal of Gundam U.C.
So, who among you, who likes Slam Dunk, who will go see the movie Slam Dunk after December 3rd?
And so, the voice actor is not the voice actor that we've always had.
I'm just looking forward to it.
So let's say that we have a matrix of fx.
It is a platform for automated trading on FX.
MT is short for MetaTrader.
4 and 5 are different versions.
Why am I such a loser?
You're probably comparing yourself to someone who's brilliant.
Comparing yourself to someone else makes you better or worse or worse.
You're not going to do it yourself.
If you're self-made, you're not a "bad guy".
The latest ramen, the fat-backed dobber, the pickled, the spicy!
This is disgusting!
Do you have any quick noodles, like pickled noodles or pork chops?
I don't want to be Korean!
Chinese food in the old town diner!
If you have a store that sells soup, noodles, noodles, etc., that's fine.
I like that ramen, too.
It is a system of uplifting plants such as the flying mountain ramen, the shogi ramen, and the shidou ramen.
I'm going to the supermarket for a job interview tomorrow.
I'm afraid of what they're going to ask me.
• Basic information to write on your CV (may be asked again orally)
• Travel time from home to work
• Travel expenses
- Have you had any work experience?
How did you get this job?
• the day and time of the shift
I hope that's the least you'll ever ask!
Does the Japanese constitution require that one change his or her surname when applying for citizenship?
It's not a constitution, it's a civil law.
Have you ever been alive and had the flu?
How many times did it take you?
I myself have forgotten the past, perhaps a few times?
I think so.
I don't remember having the flu for more than 50 years, but I had a good antibody count when I had my antibody measurements in the city, five or six years ago.
And I don't remember getting the vaccine, but I think maybe, unknowingly, I got the flu and unknowingly, I got the antibodies.
Is the table a tray or a lunch mat?
The table is a tray from Corona.
You're supposed to be doing your homework.
Who started playing social basketball at 24?
I'm not a beginner, but I'm not very good at it, and I've gained weight recently, so I'm thinking I'll try it later.
There are many such circles, and if they invite you, you go to basketball.
And of course, beginners are welcome in some places.
And I've seen a lot of car ads on YouTube that look like they're really driving the purchasing power of music, but can you say that the old car ads were good, good?
I think the Honda commercial was good.
It seemed that the Shojo car commercials did not actively use the popular actors and actresses like today.
No, no, no. There were many famous people in the commercials.
The atmosphere was certainly much more sophisticated than it is now.
I've been meaning to ask you this for a while.
I was admitted to the hospital for prostate surgery, and I was in the hospital for two months, and I had very little benefit from the expensive health care system.
So, we're going to use the month as a reference.
Is it possible that doctors do this on purpose every two months?
It's probably the corona.
If you don't have a life, you're a triad.
I'm not sure I can say that to clear up a misunderstanding.
Can you solve it right now?
I think that if you can convince the other person that it's a misunderstanding, then it's a misunderstanding.
I'll tell you what.
And if you're an economics graduate with an MBA and you don't seem to be able to manage your money, is that a bad thing?
I didn't get an MBA to manage my money, so it's fine.
How many days does it take for a lymph node to heal once it's swollen?
I think it's the swelling.
If you have a cold or an infection, you should be able to get it after you have a mild cold.
If you have a very bad swelling and pain, or something like that, you might want to go to the hospital, because the doctor said that you can't get better without taking antibiotics.
Can you run longer than a fifth grader?
I can't do that!
Isn't that a cute little dragon ball bejeet?
That's right.
I'm a little bit of a bum, and I'm a little bit of a short-tempered person, so I'm kind of cute.
I'm not sure.
There is a town that pays 500 yen for the dowry of a person who dies in the town, but will you pay 500 yen for a person who is not in the company?
The town council rules on the handling of death bribes.
It's 500 yen for a single person in the city, with no relationship.
If the comics are... if the art is bad, if the story is honest, if it's interesting, can you read them?
Would you like to read on?
Even a lowly cartoonist like me...
I'm not sure about the carafe yet, but I'm going to darken it from the first page!
The comics are so powerful.
I don't take a picture when it's not good.
Do you get angry when your wife tries to finish her dinner with frozen food every now and then?
I'm worried about my health.
And you can make delicious frozen foods, but you'll be angry if you find something that's obviously unpalatable or unpalatable.
We can find ways to make better, tastier frozen foods.
I'm just asking you a simple question.
Can't I be the one who's computer-deaf and can't chat GPT?
I registered it.
I feel like you need a lot of knowledge to apply it.
It's easy enough to play, so anyone can do it.
Give me words that will help me when I am tired, when I am in pain, and at any time.
Eat while it's hot.
I'm scared of the smile of the shopkeeper.
What do you think?
I think it's natural to think a little bit, not too hard, not too fast, just a little bit of conversation, and slowly you get along.
Is it wrong to drink sour meaka?
Japanese wine is the best, but the sea wine still smells like fish.
You don't have the latest movie about a bad detective?
So this is 2016, so that's six years ago.
Oh, you're tired today, you're tired, you're tired.
And by the way, if you fail at your job, analyze why you failed and then use it to get back to work, right?
So, what is it, a caterpillar?
It was a good day.
That's right.
I'm going to analyze why I failed and try not to fail again.
Do you want to be the 17th professional baseball player from Chiba-ku and Okayama High School?
He said that he had become aware of this when his elder, Zhongji Kangsheng, was nominated as the first Dra last year by the Asuka.
He's 6'6", weighs in at 6'2", right-handed, throws right-handed.
The fastball has a top speed of 150 km. There are also many variations of the slider curve, changeup, fork two-seam and change ball.
If nominated, he will be the 17th person from Shibuya and Gokayan High School to be nominated to Hiroshima in 20 years.
And so, we're going to be looking at comic books, including comic books.
I've been re-reading books I've read recently.
It's going to rain.
It's easy for an actor to read.
I'm not sure what to say.
One book in two days, at most.
I read about 15 books a month.
Borrowing from the library, rereading old books.
I don't want to read it, I just want to waste my time.
I think each has its strengths and weaknesses.
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the cars you drive?
When you buy a car, who has the authority to buy it?
I'll buy my own car.
The good news is it's cheap, it's fuel efficient.
The shortcoming is that there's almost no optional equipment.
I'm not sure I like the sound of that.
And the skirt is a little delicate...
I'd like to ask for your advice.
It's the whole commute.
So, if you're going to do a panty style with a little bit of a sweep, or a tight system, you're going to do a panty style with a little bit of a sweep.
Or maybe you've got a flat top and you want to change it?
Is it Sunday on TV Tokyo?
That's right.
It will be broadcast on TV Tokyo on 7/10 (Tuesday) at midnight.

So, we're saying that the date is 7/11... 1:30 a.m.
Does the air conditioner not turn on the air conditioner?
How do you get the air out?
The fan of the indoor air conditioner draws air in from the air intake of the indoor air conditioner and blows air out from the air intake of the indoor air conditioner.
When changing the air temperature, the outdoor machine is turned to make the heat exchanger work, but if only the air is sent, it is not necessary, so the outdoor machine is not involved.
If I told a supermarket clerk to pack a giant ice cream cone, would he sell it?
We have a backyard inventory and we're happy to accommodate the number of items in the store, but not just giant corn, but also dry batteries, candy, bread, and so on, so you'd better make sure to book in advance.
When I asked for 30 ice creams to help with the children's work, I asked for them in advance.
If you have a free location app, let me know.
I want to make sure that my kids have smartphones and that they know where they are.
I put in an app called "Koko-Koda-Yoko" and after a month, I had to charge again.
If you have a free location app, let me know.
Google Maps is a free service.
Where is the commercial enterprise that you can enjoy without getting bored?
Where's your favorite commercial?
I only go there occasionally, but I'm a bit nervous.
The big malls have all kinds of shops, so you can enjoy everything.
I've done a lot of events before Corona.
And during the sale, we're saving money because we can get clothes and bags at a very good price.
What's a good pillow for a shoulder, a neck, a shoulder?
If possible, please don't spend more than 5,000 yen.
It's said that folding a bastola is the ideal height and softness pillow.
And if you want to know how many accounts you have in the same bank, you can ask the bank.
If it's in your name, you can show me your ID card and I'll tell you.
I can't open another account.
It was growing around the family garden.
Are you one of Neela's?
And it's not very clear, because it's not very clear.

Have you confirmed the A-Class of the Fukuoka Softbank Hawks and Orix Buffaloes in the P.A. League for the 2022 season?

I'm in the middle of a championship fight.
Sugar Boy.
I'm growing my own plants indoors.
Recently, the surface of the leaves has been browned, with a reddish tinge.

Anyway, it nourishes you during the active phase of your life, it builds your immunity.
What happens if you cook with the lid open?
It won't move.

Is it British or Irish?
The same Christian country, but with different denominations (English, Church of England, Irish, Catholic) is a different country.
I'm looking for a reputable one with a Wi-Fi 6 non-compliant gaming router and a wireless LAN.
And I'm not going to go into the details of the project, because I know that it doesn't make much sense to have Wi-Fi 6 because of all the things that are going on.
If you know of anything that might be useful, let me know.
Please, please.
And it's not just the Wi-Fi 6 that's going to be a problem.
I'm going to use the Wi-Fi 6 product, because it's compatible with all the devices that don't support it.
Does the Tōhoku Shinkansen slow down in the mountain section when it arrives in Kyoto?
Of course, we're slowing down before the Yamato can.
The distance between Kyoto and Honshu is only 5.5 kilometers.
So, if you were driving at 180 miles an hour, that's the distance you'd be able to travel in one minute and a half.
Why do fewer people put mayonnaise on a roast chicken when it's delicious?
Because many people don't think it's delicious.

It's the second highest on Oricon.

I had six slices of bread, and I had a ham and a ham sandwich, and I had toasted it, and I had coffee, and it was delicious.

I buy songs from artists I like or want to support.
I buy CDs.
Seven Eleven, Family Mart, Lawson, Ministop, Seiko Mart, there are many different combinations in Japan, but do you have a favorite one?

The best place to go is 7-Eleven.
It's right next to my house.
My favorite is natural lotion.
Do you eat a convenience dessert?
I like a little bit of prune, a little bit of jelly.
Training
Which is better, before or after a meal?
If you train when you're depleted of energy, you lose muscle.
After training, eating nutritious foods (mainly protein) helps your muscles grow.
So, if you're going to do it, you need both pre-workout and post-workout supplements.
But if you're going to choose between before and after, I think you should train after you eat.
And you can also have friends who don't give you money, like Facebook or Instagram.
I hope you think you're good.
I think that "like" is not mutual, it's all about liking the post or the information.
I don't care if other people like it or not.

It's a paradoxical issue.
If he is honest, he is a liar, and if he is a liar, he is a liar and a liar.
If you were to buy one of these three things, Dragon Quest Theatrism, Rhythm Kingdom Wii, and Wario Landshake, which would you recommend?
I recommend theatricalism.
Tell me about the economic benefits of shorter working hours.
Companies that have implemented shorter working hours often report that the shorter hours have led to more efficient work by employees themselves, and that this has also increased the company's performance.
And as you do that, you get more pay, more vacation time, and you consume more, and that's an economic benefit.
So, what's the difference between a car's steady state and a car's steady state, or even a higher air pressure, when you're driving on a snow trail?
If you increase the air pressure, will you save a little fuel?
We should probably raise it a lot.
I think it's going to make it more resilient.
The studs are low pressure tires, so if you put high pressure on them, they won't bite, they won't burst, and that's a bad thing.
I've never had a best-selling book.
How can I get the best answer?
I don't know, but I get it sometimes.
First, I answer honestly to people who ask me a serious question. I stand by them and think a lot.
I'm wondering what the best answer is for the other person.
And I think that's the best thing for the people who ask.
For your information.
And then you raise your eyelashes, and they go down, and I want you to tell me how to keep them up.
You paint the mascara, you dry it, you divide it into three steps, and you give it a little bit of a curve.
If you put the mascara on the front, it will feel like a nozzle, so it will be easy to fix it.
And it's beautiful in three stages.
Tell me about the things you wish you had done sooner in your life.
The clothes dryer.
I didn't think it would be so good.

I didn't know if I was going to wear it on Eid.
I want you to tell me what kind of noodles you like.
And then there's the whole wheat.
I also like wheatgrass.
The noodles are very tasty.
The shrimp soup is a great delicacy because of the poor.
You're too much of a stickler.
It's been going on for about 1:30...
And then there's the whole "go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
I could have put earplugs in your ear, but it didn't work. I can hear you.
There is a real hell of pain and suffering that keeps you awake.
How long will it last?
Isn't that what they call a spring thunder, a snowflake?
It's going to be over soon.
I've been to a few different dentists, and I've sat in that operating chair, and I've had a teacher or a dental hygienist talk to me from behind.
I'm not sure if it's better to turn backwards, but I think it's rude to turn backwards all the time, because it's a bit awkward, or to keep looking forward.
Does anyone know?
What's wrong with you?
Not only dentists, but barbers and hairdressers.
So, what's cooler, polyester 100 or dry rayon?
Dry lemon is good and cool.
Tell me about it.
He joined the company in April.
How do you become a good traveler?
- Thank you.
Instead of thinking about being a good person in the world, now is the time to master the work given to you sooner and become the force of the company.
Is your wristwatch accurate?
I've never been crazy about my body clock and my belly clock.
The door surface of the sink is peeled off, so I would like to ask for a repair. Which store should I go to?
Please teach me.
And we have a makeup board at the home center, so we can make it to size, process it, fix it, replace it.
When you go to the IRS to file your tax return, it doesn't have to be a color print, right?
I know.
When will the money that I applied for in my tax return be deposited into my account?
I'm hoping to get it in in a couple of weeks.
If you're going to put a check in the front, you're going to get a check, and when it comes, you're going to write it down, because it's in the front.
We'll just have to wait for the notification.
Please tell me how to verify your LINE ID.

If you don't have it set, you can set it only once.
Can I buy a ticket-free express ticket with E5489 using a VISA LINE PAY prepaid card?
Good afternoon.
The ticketless emergency ticket for JR West Japan's e5489 is a credit card payment.
Prepaid cards are not accepted.
It's been too long, but do you think you're okay?
It's a vegetable juice.
It's also how you preserve it.
If you've kept it in the fridge for a long time, you can drink it after a couple of days, but if you've left it outside or at room temperature, I think it's better to dispose of it.
If you have any changes later, it's very difficult.
How can the "Avatarou Don Brothers" character, the unemployed ape-man, be able to eat and drink at the "Café Do Dou" restaurant?
How much do you want?
I've never ordered anything except for two haiku.
So what is the function of this washing machine that is close to a low-flow (hand washing, etc.) function?
I'm pleased to meet you.
Please select "dry" on the course.
Can you enjoy the Neverland of the movies without knowing what's going on?
You'll have fun.
It's a simple story.
I'm writing a story about escaping from a monster that feeds on humans.
I think you're a nurse, and you're supposed to wear a tuxedo when you go to work, but can you wear sandals barefoot?
I mean, you can change all your clothes, and you can go to work in anything that's not weird.
I envy the houses that never have visitors, but what's the harm in a house like this?
I'm not going to have to clean the house for you anymore.
And the hospitality of the guests is also unfamiliar.
I'm not sure what to say about Instagram.
I'm a regular, and I have about 10,000 followers, and if you don't know this, you're like, "Oh, wow".
Or do you not think about anything else?
What does it look like?
I think it's really great.
To the common man, it's a miracle.
I think he was doing something special.
I had a problem. I had a setback.
I didn't have much time to exercise, so I bought a pressure cooker to try and get it.
I'm a size H175m and weigh 80kg. I bought a size L.
It's a little bit of a struggle at first, but I think it'll be okay once you get used to it.
I've been using it for a few days, but I've had a problem and I'm using another pressurized inlet now.
The problem is that if the arm circumference is not quite slender, the grip on the sleeve (just the second arm) is too tight, and itching occurs.
Two, the lower abdomen has stopped being used for any of the above two problems.
It's pretty tight in terms of landing, but it's okay to sleep in it.
It's the right people.
I was fine with 5'9", 110 pounds.
But it didn't fit me, a big, muscular man.
And because the butt is not a three-dimensional structure, it doesn't have these weird gaps or it doesn't fall down easily.
I always felt like I had to lift it up.
I'd like to see a stick-shaped person.
I'm not sure I'd call it a comfortable thinness.
And I could make a bootin' that didn't look like a henna or a broken one, but just the right kind of bootin' that would make it look smooth.
It's wonderful.
I was looking for something that was different from a fitness swimsuit, but I didn't want to expose my skin.
And then there's the top, the back, the knitting, and the one-point mark on the sleeve.
I'm happy to choose between wearing a bikini underneath and wearing shorts over.
I've just gotten it, I've just tried it on, I haven't put it in the water, so I don't know how it will hold up or how it will feel if it gets wet, but it's beautifully sewn, it's solidly ground, and I thought it was worth the price.
There was no wire in the bust, but when you touch it, you see that there's a solid core under the butt.
But it doesn't hurt to wear it, and it's so well-fitted to the bust that it looks good when you move.
Did we change the model from no-pat to no-pat?
(Parliament adopted the resolution)
I'm looking forward to going in the water.
45 kg and 156 cm M size, slightly larger.
The coat is thick and hard, so it feels hot and steamy, but it is made in a very good way, so I think it will last a long time.
I had two rain gauges to keep my face from getting wet.
It was so powerful that it could be used safely on a bike in a storm.
It never broke after use.
I'm putting it in a compact form in a compact bag.
It was really more than I expected at this price.
I'm sure it's all right.
The CLA 180 shooting brake was installed for the 2016 event.
The dress code is easy for amateurs to follow.
If you loosen the torque wrench too much, it will fall into the car.
I dropped one and I disappeared.
Then, when you plug the grey connector into the brown and red-green wires, the radio punch and other types of tips are not evenly applied, so the plastic is broken and cannot be fitted as in the photo.
And I'm talking about the company that's very supportive, and they're sending me a new cable the next day.
The challenge was to use a wide-brimmed pencil, like the one in the picture in the manual, to apply the force at once.
I'm going to try to get the last main unit back in the car, but I'm going to have to get it in the wiring.
The DVD, TV, and Navi are visible during the drive.
I think it's a very cost-effective product because it costs over 80,000 yen to order at a dealer, and over 40,000 yen at a specialty store.
It's less than the price.
I don't know why it's so highly rated, but the inside is polished, and it's cut off in the cushion, and it's got a lot of bumps and scratches, and it's kind of old, and it's kind of a little bit less polished overall, and I thought I'd try it out, but I'm not sure if it's going to fit, but I'm going to try it out, and I think it's going to fit, and I think the pillow and the pillow should be a separate failure.
It's not possible. It's not inevitable.
Goods have arrived.
I was told to use it as soon as possible.
It's easy to use and it's easy to milk.
But sometimes, if you're a little annoyed by the sound, the power button doesn't respond.
I don't mind, because I'm using it without any problems, but if you do, you might be worried.
It's not super quiet, but it might be a little bit awkward if you're using it at night.
And I was worried that the attached tube and the connecting part to the machine would get into the tube, but it was pushed in.
You need a little trick to make a bubble.
I'm not sure if it's the poor quality of my hair or the performance of this shampoo, but it doesn't bubble at all with normal use.
So, here's the solution I found: First, I take a little less shampoo than usual, and I apply it to my hair.
(At this point, not a single bubble is bubbling to the level where it would not appear) Wash your hair twice, then shampoo in the right amount, and let it settle into your hair.
(Laughter) So, basically, you're doing a second wash, because the shampoo itself is much smaller, so the trick is to do as little shampoo as possible the first time around, and I'm happy with the effect of the shampoo.
I've obviously bought a higher-priced shampoo, but I've obviously felt better about my hair.
But I honestly don't think that the overall review was satisfactory.
It's a pity that the Quattro Botanico series was only available to the face washing guys...
The evil of the small-capacity cospas, which have to be washed twice.
Considering the smell, which is unpleasant to most people, I'll give this place two stars, strictly speaking.
It's hard to judge.
It's a negative, and it's hard to evaluate.
The blade cleaner will clean the surface of the blade.
I'd like to see a good match with a good blade accuracy.
Positive: You can remove any dirt on the blade, such as tar, peel, soap and so on.
If the taste is bad, it will last longer.
Negative: The life span of the Smoothie is extremely short.
Titanium coat, ceramic coat, etc., which have a coating on the edge of the blade, the coating is easier to peel.
(I'm sure you'll get a lot of the coating off after a couple of shaves, so I'd rather use this cleaner.)
The pencil that says "Do not wipe the edge of the blade" is a warning.
The cost and performance of this rubber is low, as it can be replaced by anti-roll rubber (anti-vibration rubber) that is placed under furniture, etc. used for earthquake preparation.
I'm using a 20 to 30% upper limit on the life of the scissors.
It's hard to tell when the blade of the combine was thrown, but I think it was when the razor caused damage to the blade and the edge became jagged.
In that sense, it's a good product because it prevents the dirt from going down.
(It doesn't have the effect of a cleaner, but sometimes it feels like it's being sharpened, but it's a small comb that makes it feel like it.)
I was in a TV commercial.
I had to paint it once in a TV commercial, and I saw the face of a very old woman, and I bought it.
And I've actually used it, and the texture is a little bit harder than the normal gel, and I use it after I've pre-rinsed it.
It's a little uncomfortable at first, but when you apply it, it's like a massage, and then it gets into your skin.
I was very comfortable, and I had very little pain, and my skin was kind of sticking to my hands.
The lift-up was not like the TV.
I felt the sensation in one breath.
I'm a skin hyperactive, so this one is not enough. I've used a moisturizer 72 before.
It's like a little bit of a splash.
I was hoping that the edges of the pores would be covered, but they're not.
I'm going to try to get a bottle of it, and maybe I'll get a prescription.
I know it was a lot of work to put together, but...
This is a collection of statements made by politicians over the past few years.
I read it and I'm convinced that what he said at that time was, in fact, a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
But it's a delicate question whether, given the value of the book, the fact-checking that the authors call it is necessary.
Honestly, it's not fun to read.
I thought about it a lot, and I felt that the biggest flaw in this book was the "method".
Ultimately, no one knows whether what we call "facts" here are forever true.
I felt quite suspicious about the way I wrote, whether people were aware of the fragility of fact-checking.
The perception of "facts" among Japanese journalists today, at this level, is a bit vague.
It's a book that's been recommended by many people, but it might be a good fit for those who want to know a little bit about what it's about.
If you, like the commentator, are interested in the "fact-checking" that the Japanese media is doing today, this book is a good fit.
To those who don't get a better grade on the test.
I had never really gotten into political economy in my school, in print, in the form of a classroom where you're just learning by doing, and I had become disgusted with political economy.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
He's now 3 and this year he's in the center.
I bought it in March and chose it as my companion for an hour of studying on the way to and from school.
First impressions are easy to understand.
You're reaching the realm of the gods.
I finished the first round and took a history test.
I was surprised by the stone.
It's as long as a weird food.
I felt that what I was getting from this book was not only knowledge and information about political economy, but also the power I had and the motivation to study.
Thank you so much for letting me see you.
The guard.
I've had two attempted burglaries eight years ago, and I've taken precautions.
This time, it's a replacement camera I bought eight years ago.
I used to use a 30-meter infrared light.
This product, and others have written, is capable of recognizing faces at night from a distance of about five meters.
I agree.
I've just arrived and I haven't set up the camera yet, but I've checked the camera's reflection and its performance.
And it's a lot better than the camera from eight years ago.
I've got a 32-inch monitor with four parts, but I'm not worried about maximizing the size of the image.
So far, there's no malfunction in the product.
For those of you who are considering the possibility of a level of facial recognition other than security, you might be disappointed, especially with night photography, which is the best price for this!
I'm a security guard, but I'm not asking for facial recognition.
I'm not sure if I'm wearing a mask or a mask, especially at night.
Professional thieves have a knowledge of security cameras.
They say it's a small camera that can tell the difference between high-performance video and recording.
On the other hand, it's a little bit difficult to be a non-professional.
But the idea of the empty nest is so bold and clever that we recommend that you not rely on the camera alone, but that you use it with a lot of other security stuff.
For example, there's a white solar LED garden light that you can get at the home center for about $1,500 -- the latest one is very bright, six units in a row.
And it's solar, so you don't have to pay for electricity, and in the winter, it doesn't light up until the morning, so we have three 100-volt LED sensor lights that are attached.
This combination allows us to detect the shadow of a person from a distance of 30 meters.
And if you're a security guard during the day and you feel that the camera is too small to be of much use, you need to cover up.
I have a sticker that says, "24-hour security camera on".
It's an original from the security camera company I used to work for.
It's better to have a manufacturer's product than to have a product that's sold at a home center.
The place where it's posted is a thief's entry route that cameras wouldn't cover.
In that sense, I wanted a sticker this time.
I also found it difficult to understand the narrative of the Internet configuration.
If there are any problems after installation, we will inform you.
The more I read, the more I empathize.
Although the social situation of the Japanese born in 1982 is somewhat better than hers, the implementation of the law on equal employment for men and women still leaves the situation far from equal.
As I read, the painful memories of my experience as a person living in a discriminated society came back to me.
It depicts the suffering of all women in feudal societies, not only in Korea and Japan, but also in those who want to live as human beings and not as women.
It's time for women to stop their emotional conflicts and stand shoulder to shoulder with society.
I thought it was a show about men being the worst.
The story of a heroine who was sexually abused by her father as a child.
Of course, as adults, we continue to carry the wound.
Every man who comes out is the worst.
The husband of the main character, who seems warm and family-minded, is also, in a sense, inferior.
The story is told by the main character's sister, who is ignored even though she knows that her husband is receiving DV, and her sister-in-law finally has the courage to come to the police to sue her husband, but the husband of the main character, a police officer, is thrown out, and so on. The development irritates the men.
The protagonist's old mother, who pretends to be crazy, knows that her husband (the protagonist's real father) was killed by her daughter, but she does not know that (publicly, the death of her real father is a drug overdose).
In short, the hero is crazy, since he never let his daughter go to counseling after the death of the father of the rapist.
You want to know about your grandfather, who died because of the daughter of the main character?
Do you care about this Ojiji who died so young?
There's too much drama.
A few years ago, in the summer of the heatwave that hit France, there were reports of many elderly people dying, of hospitals and institutions contacting their children and saying, "We can't take you because we're vacant", and of the morgues in Paris being full.
These people are called "dry".
And then I saw my husband and my daughter at the end of the play, and I felt like, "Dry".
The French are very different from the American ones, and the more subtle parts are often good extras, but I saw a relatively large number of scenes where I was thinking that maybe this should be cut, and I was rushing through them.
The professional boundaries.
If a careful calculation and yet an unpredictable, unforeseen accident had been involved in someone's life, he would have been prepared to risk his life, even if he had calculated it to some extent from the start.
The script was excellent, embodying the drama of her own struggle, which cannot be shown in public, and how far she deceives those around her to pass on her beliefs.
And besides, Jessica's acting is really great.
I don't care what I see.
It's a professional job.
It was a little bit of a shock, but it was a little bit of a shock.
I've used three of them, and they've broken up pretty quickly, for better or for worse.
The first device I used was a 2200 milliampere vaporizer. The battery died after 3 sessions at 200 degrees and 5 minutes.
The second USB port is bad.
It's not rechargeable.
This time, this product solved the problem, but after about 15 battery replacements (I used the battery in the charger to keep the USB port from breaking), the contact got worse, and it was difficult to get power.
You press the lid, and the power goes on.
I'm sure some of you have experience with Icos.
That's the symptom.
The note says the battery doesn't use any other batteries than the one that's attached.
The claws and the catch part, it's like a cut-out, so there's no bending.
So it took about 10 days to get it back.
I bought the product without the Starley logo, but I'll give you a comparison here.
They look the same, they're the same size.
Same with Chambers and Drew.
This is a liquid crystal.
It's probably newer than without the logo.
This is the Vib.
It's like a cell phone beep.
Without the logo, the vibration of the vibe is very loud.
It's a cheap Chinese phone.
This is Chinese, but...
The ingredients are slightly different.
This is Liquid's case.
Without the logo, it's like steel wool.
That's about it.
I'd rather have Starley, but if he breaks up soon, he'll lose credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but I had no choice but to return it, so I went through the trouble of doing so.
Sometimes it's ear rubber, sometimes it's ear rubber.
This gum really doesn't hurt.
This is the best ear-friendly mask of its kind I've ever used.
Even flat rubber, which can be scratched, and the scratched portion of the helix can be scratched on the earlobe, and can be more painful than round rubber, I think this product is not only soft to the touch, but also just as long as it is able to resist scratching.
The three-dimensional fit to the face is also good, not only does it fit, but it also makes it difficult to breathe, as it allows for a moderate amount of space between the nose wire and the bottom edge of the mouth.
And I'm not sure that's the case, because it's the size of my face.
I don't know if it's going to fit everyone the same, but if you think it's going to fit everyone in a smaller size, you might want to try it.
And when we opened the box, it was in a plastic box with a central slit, like a box of tissue, and when we took out the first one, the ear rubber on both sides got stuck and it was hard to get out, so we took one less star.
The response from the vendors was one star.
The price and taste are great, but despite the date, I was suspicious of the response of the seller who ignored it.
I bought a whole bunch of drinks besides this product.
I know the delivery guy, because I always buy from Amazon.
We've taken care to make sure that we arrive as close as possible to the top, especially to carry heavy items.
Amazon is a big problem for shipping companies, but I'm wondering if there's one thing we can do to help the consumer.
I'm disappointed in the arrogant response of the vendor.
But the price is cheap.
And if you're thinking about buying it, it's going to cost you a lot of money.
I don't think I'll be able to use it for long.
I think it's a good idea to consider the cost of disposal.
For reference, some municipalities have centers that can take away your rubbish for free or cheap.
[Sitting comfortably] The seat is tilted slightly to the left and further slanted, so sitting is very tiring.
If you move a little, you make a loud noise.
It's noisy at night.
And that's the biggest problem, and I don't think I can continue to use it.
The assembly manual only describes the rough drawings.
There's a lack of information needed to put it together, and there's a lot of misspellings.
The orientation of the seat and supporting fixtures is not explained. Some people write in the review that it is tilted forward, but the orientation of the seat and supporting fixtures may be reversed.
When properly installed, the height adjustment lever is on the right hand side, facing backwards, and the dial is in front to adjust the slope of the back pan.
However, the height adjustment lever is more natural and will be mistakenly installed by many people.
The manual is not going to have these basic precautions, it's going to be a bunch of trial and error, looking at random pictures.
• The description of the contents is incorrect and the list of contents at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
It seems that many buyers find 12 8x20mm scissors without noticing.
The 8x20mm scissors are already inserted into the side of the chair, so care must be taken not to look for them in vain.
The precision of the work is low, and there are combinations that can be inserted and not inserted even with the same screw hole and screw.
In some combinations, it is very difficult to insert a screw into the screw hole.
So we can imagine that they're shipping with screws like this.
I didn't see any spinach in the manual.
[Other] The black areas of the vinyl laser surface are tinted and almost white, and you should not expect anything as clean as a product photo.
The description of the defect in the instruction manual, and additional explanations of the above payment method, etc., were received at the email address registered with amazon on the 2nd or 3rd day after the arrival of the goods.
These things should be sent out right after the goods are shipped.
It is a completely meaningless act, as many buyers have already completed the assembly in two or three days after the arrival of the goods.
I'm not sure.
I've been a huge fan of thermostats for over 15 years and I've been using thermostats for over 15 years. This is by far the most difficult to use thermostats I've ever used.
The straw mouthpiece is now a much harder material than ever before, and the groove is now so tightly attached to the body that the straw mouthpiece can't be removed from the body at all!
I'll break my fingernails trying to get it.
Only the two-straw mouthpiece ends are thinner than before, and the straw brush is no longer available.
The mysterious valve at the end of the three straws is thicker than the straw brush and dramatically harder to wash.
I'm a little shocked because I've never had any complaints about using a strootype before.
It's really stressful not being able to take a drink out of your mouth.
The good news is, it's still got a great cooling capacity.
When I take it out of my bag and forget to wash it the next day, I still have about 50 percent of the ice I put in the day before.
I'm not drinking hot, so I'm going to be a stereotype.
I'd like to see some improvements in the next model.
First review (with a photo of the aftermath)
This is the first time I've ever reviewed it.
(I'm a first-time buyer and amateur who has no experience in the field of doll eye)
I'm so happy to see you in your obit-dor, with your lovely light.
But, when you put it on, the entrance is a little bit harder, and you can't put it on unless you push it in.
I think it's a different way of doing it, but I put a pincet in the hole of the doll's eye.
About the shipment, since it was the first shipment from abroad, we were expecting three weeks, but it arrived earlier than expected in 8 days (Narita airport is nearby).
I was worried because I never got an email.
And then, you see the Amazon shipping listing, and it says, "Sending".
I think it's safe to say that the damage and the lack of air in the eyeballs and the fact that the envelope was sealed in a small bag with a lot of bits and pieces on the back of it.
But, you know, I had my phone number printed on the envelope, so I thought, "Well, how about an email from abroad?"
So let's say that we have a negative 1 here.
I think that the goods are very well purchased at that price and in this quantity.
The recording is from the Dolly Eye 8mm model iPhonese.
It's a little small, it's a little bit of a tight working area, it's a little bit of a bad bandwidth.
I ordered it after seeing the size, but it felt about twice as small as I had imagined.
It is larger than A4, but because the outside is a groove for parts stock, the range of work available is narrower than A4.
I was going to use it to fix electronics or make a Gamprah, but it's not that easy to use unless you have a B4 size.
Other tasks such as assembling and disassembling can be done using a separate tray or mat.
You can't put tools, parts, and other work in a magazine-sized space.
I was thinking about ordering another one, and doubling the size, but I'm afraid it's going to be a little bit difficult to keep using it, because it's going to be so much electricity, and all the bits and pieces that I've cut will be sucked in.
It's a deadly defect.
After a long struggle to keep the battery box lid open, we finally opened the lid with a rubber slide sheet. However, the battery is still not closed when we try to fill it with water.
I'm out at this point.
Highly recommended!
Does the battery box cover close?
And to add to that, instead of the product's protective seal, there was a little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little, little,
Is this a second-hand item?
The explanation is only in English, written on small pieces of paper.
There's no diagrams, no explanation of how to operate it.
Maybe it's the other finger.
I found a good product!
I bought it immediately.
I was a little bit too... fussy to use a lot of it for my pinkie ring.
But I think it's good for the other fingers.
But I think he's a good idea man.
I'll pay you for it.
You shouldn't expect quality from this kind of product.
One of the flower marks was broken.
It's just the right size.
A person with a thick earlobe may be tough.
Maybe I should have bought a handle.
What the fuck?
The design is good, but it's big in the hand, and it's not so big on the foot, is it?
It's the winter in the Far East.
As in other reviews, the electrical wiring is only 110×80 and the arrangement is horizontal rather than vertical.
I bought the whole sheets to keep them warm, but I didn't want to buy more expensive but larger than the mat type, so I couldn't check it in the store like a famous manufacturer.
It can only be used in combination with a water bottle and a N-worm.
By the way, the quality of the blankets is beyond question.
I'm not very good at this.
It's small, and it's got plenty of air.
The battery can be replaced with a spare.
If you put it on the table and adjust the angle, it's fine.
If you're on a Turtle's desk, you're blowing with your own wind, but if you're on a hook, it's okay.
If you use it in the office, you don't even notice the "middle" sound.
We need to cut the donations when we go out.
And, for office use, "small" is too much air, too cold.
It's perfect for the scene where you're sweating your way out of the house and running back to your family, and you're cooling off in a big way.
But one thing, when you throw it in the jar, it rarely turns around without you knowing it's powered.
So, hopefully, there's a trick to do that, like pushing the button a little bit, or pushing it a little bit longer.
It's a vital item in a life-threatening heat wave, so we'd like to help you make something better.
Multi-function light speaker
And I'm using the weakest warm colors, and I'm using them in the bedroom.
It's better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
And the lighting, you can adjust the brightness and color with touch.
The white collar fits in any room, and the color lighting changes with the gradient, so it's beautiful.
And also, if you touch it in your favorite color, it will stop with your favorite color, so you can light it in your mood!
And it's LED, so you can expect a long life.
And the sound quality, I think, is just too good for my amateur ears.
And the great thing about these lights is that they're multifunctional anyway.
It's got a big speaker on top.
And it's also possible to pair your phone with Bluetooth, so you can enjoy music wirelessly.
• Pairing with a mobile phone allows hands-free calls.
It also supports MicroSD, so it can be integrated with your computer and play music as an MP3 player.
I'm going to be doing some piano practice.
At the age of 66, he started to fight in the DTM to prevent gout.
I bought the audio interface and the original equipment.
I started out as a percussionist, but I've become obsessed with playing the piano, and I'm immersed in practicing every day.
So I downloaded the source, but the protection didn't work, so I downloaded ASIO first, and the free piano source sounded good, so I use it for piano practice.
I'm glad I bought it.
I feel deceived by appearances.
Is it a product that's not for sale?
It's going to be a long sentence.
After 4 or 5 years of use, the synthetic leather of the Doushisha office chair (jumping armrest) has deteriorated and become dull, so we are considering buying a chair with a jump armrest made of non-synthetic leather.
I've searched home centers and furniture stores, but nothing seems to fit.
I was worried that I wouldn't be able to see the real thing, but I compromised on the look and price of the design and bought this product on Amazon.
The box is surprisingly light and compact.
The reindeer have one spare.
Beware of hexagonal wrenches and scissors with oil and bet bet bet.
At first, the oil was not visible on the hexagonal lens, but the body was white, so when the oil was on, it burned.
40 minutes to assemble.
Finished and verified.
The up-and-down stiffness of the jump-up armrest is different on the left and right, the left is heavy on the up and down, the right is light, the usability of the armrest is not good (there is no adjustment method).
The angular adjustment of the movable headrest is weak and hangs down quickly with the sound of "catch".
The seat is made of non-renewable high-density urethane form and feels stiff, uncomfortable to sit on, and weak in elasticity.
The back-and-back sports mesh is stiff compared to other mesh chairs, and thinly-worn chairs cause back pain.
The seat height was 530 feet from the ground, not 550, and the castor legs were not made of steel, so the durability was questionable.
I use a separate cushion, and the mesh part of the skin, so the deterioration (wound) is likely to come early, so I use a towel kit.
I'm 186 cm and 80 kg, and I feel good only in my back, but I also feel that the product is not satisfactory, that it is a product that is out of place.
After all, an office chair might be better bought by sitting down and seeing the real thing.
I got an Amazon email from the manufacturer saying, "Hey, can you please ask about the armrests and headrests?"
We're working on it.
Well, it looks like this.
I bought a 4K tuner from Pixar, which was cheap, because of the unpleasant environment, and because I was going to see BS4K in the right-hand corner.
As an experiment, the right-hand free broadcast of NHK BS4K and others can be watched and viewed on Panasonic's 4K TV, which was purchased at the same time.
(Sometimes the images pop) I've been watching some pre-recorded videos because the update came right after I bought it, and I'm watching some pre-recorded videos, but is there any effect of the 2.5-inch HDD being out of the box, where the images just stop playing, or frame-flipping occurs?
The user interface is not exactly flattering, but it's a 4K broadcast.
By the way, during the pre-recording, you can only follow and playback the recorded program, and this is also accepted as a plus feature that you can record in 4K on the HDD.
Expectations are bound to be high, and expectations can be disappointing.
I hope that the update will improve it.
The heating system is fine.
We've only used the heating system, but we put two 500-ml PET bottles in, and it was warm for about two hours, and it was hot for two and a half hours.
I've used it in a compact car, where I've installed it under the seat cushion, and I'm concerned about the fan noise when the car is idling, but I don't feel it at all when I'm driving.
The smell of chemicals, like new or fan-like, was so bad that I had to open the windows regularly to get air.
Another one says in the review that the bar in the part that goes through the shoulder strap is bad, so we have to break the bar with a negative driver or something.
It's really fragile.
Today, two months after I started using it, it suddenly broke.
I like the keystroke and the size, but it doesn't make sense to break it.
I'm on my computer all day working on video, and the audio is 100% automatic.
It's a little bit of a shock, but it's a little bit of a shock.
The earphones are deafening and unusable, and the volume of the PC is disturbing at night.
It's like sending a signal every few seconds, and the volume display is going to come and go on the computer screen.
And the keyboard is interfering with the mouse's instructions, so unless you turn off the keyboard, the mouse is not free to use it.
The enter key and the backspace key are not responding.
I don't recommend it at all, but if it costs a thousand yen, you can buy it as a trial.
If we're lucky, we'll have six months to live.
Other companies have a one-year, three-year warranty in the same price range, but this one has a six-month warranty.
The short warranty period is a sign of fragility.
The product is the best, the packaging is the worst.
The products are colorful and well-loved.
I highly recommend you to find a food-stalker!
But the big cardboard boxes had a big gap between them, and they didn't have delivery notes, and the packaging was terrible.
The lid was off when I opened the box.
I recommend the product, but it might be better to buy it elsewhere.
I'm worried about the intensity.
I bought it because I had to replace the lid and the support was no longer there.
It's a very important part of the stability of the lid, but it's a very expensive plastic product, so if you don't take care when you open and close the lid, it makes a very unpleasant sound, like, "Mee-mee-mee, [Fold]!"
You have to choose the one that fits the thickness of the lid, so you have to be careful when you buy.
The meatballs are cute.
I was looking for a backpack to take with me to a dog's retreat, and I was attracted by a stylish grey backpack, and I bought this.
And it was a very lightweight, very lightweight, very lightweight, very lightweight, very lightweight, very lightweight.
And the fasteners are smooth and there's no drag.
It's easier to travel for long hours.
It's very compact and easy to fold.
It's a little bit like a meatball, you can fold it, you can put it in, it's cute.
Light and comfortable!
I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the slide.
First, I bought it at a glance because of its appearance and cheap price.
The TSA lock has been my favorite for years, and there are several others, but it's useful.
And, for those of you who have lost your keys or lost your phone, I recommend the number lock.
But, to be honest, I'm hoping that lightness is the most important thing, but if you want strength and security, the fastener is a week-long piece of fabric that, if you cut it with a knife, it breaks in an instant.
And I want the fasteners to be so soft that they overlap.
If you're abroad, please bring it on board.
I used it on a trip on the Shinkansen, but it was comfortable.
It's hard to pick a size.
I'm having trouble buying shoes because of the width.
I'm wearing a 24cm suit and a 24cm band.
MRL996 is 24 cm.
I thought it would be difficult at first, but after I got used to it, it was easy.
This time, ML574 was difficult to wear because my sister said it was 24.5 cm thick.
It was like a thumbs-up.
So I bought a quarter.
When I opened it, it was huge.
I'm wearing socks, but they're a little loose.
I was worried about returning it, but if it's too heavy for 24.5, I'll just wear it for 25.
I bought Team Red, but it's so good in bright red!
There are so many black and white monotone clothes, so it's going to be bright when you wear this!
He's 5'5", male in his 40s.
I ordered an L size, but if you're looking for something that matches the following specs, I recommend an M size.
Height: 165 cm, weight: 60 kg, waist: 81 cm, and girth: 100 cm, typical of a meta-belly.
In the water, the waist is loose, the rush guard is raised.
I'm swimming, and I'm fixing the upper part of the boat.
Especially when you're doing a jiggy, you're gonna be able to see your stomach.
And if you're walking up and down, you're going to have a bump on the bottom.
The raw material is strong and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples leaking.
At this price, I'm satisfied with this design, but I think it's better to buy a smaller one.
I'm still leaking gas, but...
Silver Colt 25 still had a gas leak, and after changing the valve, there was a problem with missing parts of the tank, but when I used [Basband Q] to seal the tank and repair the grille, I started to get excited. If you want to buy this Colt 25, you can ask someone who can disassemble or who can, or who is not sure because there is no disassemble while taking a digital camera, I can not recommend it very much, but you may think it is broken, you may be happy, I have already bought a black Colt 25, the disassemble tool can take the trigger out with the left thumb and without any parts flying, I was able to assemble myself, when assembling, I could paint the cylinder with silicon grille on the small parts and fix it with grille, and when disassembling, I could only get past the grip and take the safety net out of the safety net so that I did not damage the two outer ends of the diesel engine on the left side, and I did not fail to disassemble the front engine, but I slowly disassembled the engine without any damage.
I thought, "What quality is this?"
So, we can use the fastest turn and the fastest torque.
I like it light, small, and simple without any fancy.
And I'm not going to say that I'm not going to be able to do it, but I'm going to be able to do it.
And what about the durability?
I don't think it's something you use very often, but I think it's something you can put in your toolbox.
I bought it from a dealer I know, a 1/4 inch hexagonal shank magnetic quick release driver, a rotor bit holder 60/100/150 mm.
This one was fine, or rather, it was pretty good for the price.
The controller won't work.
It's not like the machine is going to be able to operate itself.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the device is quickly moved in the wrong direction and cannot be operated.
It is better not to buy this product.
I'm going to warn you.
This is a terrible product.
I'm not sure if it's wired, but I recommend the BeBonCool PS3 controller.
It's reliable, it's been around for a long time, and it's still not broken.
It can be used for PC games.
And I'm glad I did, because I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back, and I got my Amazon gift card back.
Does this boost your computing power?
I think it's a positive thing that you understand calculus.
And I'm not sure that's possible, but I'm not sure that's possible.
The problem is difficult to solve.
And then, when you give your parents a tool, you can have them slide it up on the screen, but I've tried it myself, and it doesn't work very well.
The point is that it might be easy for someone familiar with DS to slip.
I don't like the cartoon characters, or the DS, or the other stuff, but I think it's just the fun of the screen that gets in the way.
And the way we do it is we do it in a time-competitive way, like how many questions we get right in a few minutes.
I know you're rushing me with tests and stuff, but why don't you just rush me and do the math?
I don't like the sound of the gong when it's over.
Why don't we make it sound more pleasant, even though we're working so hard?
I feel like I've lost some money on this 6,200 yen.
So this is the price of half of that.
Sorry, I've got two of them.
I like the songs of Personas!
Persona 3 is reaching the ED.
Five played all the way through.
Persona 4 is ready for the Vita.
What we can do is the same as in Persona 4.
It's a lot shorter than the previous one, but it doesn't have a story.
It's a really cool song!
I'm so happy just to hear it!
The characters in Persona 3 were the first to be in HD, so when I first saw them, I was impressed.
And I think that's why I'm going to go with the third one.
As a voice geek, I felt more comfortable playing with three than five.
Persona 3 is blue in the main, but it was hard to see the background as dark.
The 5 is the brightest color, red or yellow, so it's easy to see even if you wear it with a background.
It's got a lot of assistive features, so I think it's a game that even the voice-less can play.
A game that can be a very challenging game for a voice gamer is to turn on the challenge feature.
The triple pack has a santra, but not as much as a four-piece set, so if you like the songs of Persona, I recommend this.
That's too bad.
I bought it because I liked the color of the typeface in the photo, but the real one is bluish, but it's black or chacoal gray.
And it wasn't a double-back.
So we've been thinking about buying gold, but we're holding off on it for now, so can we just give up because it's cheap?
After the review was published, I received an email from the seller apologizing and exchanging for new products.
And the processing was very fast.
I think the response was very good, despite the cheap products.
I got four stars for it, and then I bought gold.
The color is almost as beautiful as the picture.
But the difference between the backs and the illustrations is obvious.
That's the only thing I regret.
The evening is very heavy.
I used the SIM-free iPhone 7s.
In the first setup, I didn't know how to point to the SIM after arriving in Korea, so I asked the woman at the SK counter at Kimpo Airport to tell me ((Setup > Mobile Communications > Communication Options to turn data roaming ON), and it worked.
The narration that came with the product had little to do with...?
But the radio waves around the airport in Kinshasa are bad, so we've been getting 3G all along.
And then we went out into the city and we got 4G.
And then, in the evening and at night, sometimes the communication became very heavy, but now it may have reached a maximum of hundreds of megabytes a day.
It's better than I thought.
I've been using the Z4 for two years, and I've been using it for free on Ymobile, and the Z4 has been getting worse, so if I was looking to buy a used Xperia, I found this phone that I can use with a brand new phone.
I was using a mobile Suica, and I was worried about whether it would work, but it didn't.
I bought the size, the weight, the silver, and I thought, "What's the iPhone 6?"
And I'm not playing games, so I think it's a little bit faster than the Z4, and I think it's a little bit slower, because I've seen in reviews that it's a little bit slower to recognize fingerprints, but it takes a little bit longer to recognize faces, so it's a little bit faster, so I'm using it here.
I thought it would be great, like the iPhone, and I made Android version 9, and I was satisfied with the purchase.
I'm interested in a smaller case, but I'm interested in a case with no strap holes, but I'm interested in a case with no strap holes, but I haven't tested it for water resistance, it's a little heavy, and I've only used a little bit of it, so I'm happy with it.
