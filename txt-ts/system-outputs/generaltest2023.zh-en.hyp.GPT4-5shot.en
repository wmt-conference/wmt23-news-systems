4.1 Overview
The characters in this file are encoded in single-byte, double-byte, or four-byte encoding.
The single-byte part includes all 128 characters from 0x00 to 0x7F of GB/T 11383-1989.
4.3 Double-byte section
The double-byte part includes all the graphic characters in GB/T 2312-1980, the CJK Unified Ideographs in GB/T 13000, and some graphic characters.
The characters in the double-byte part are arranged according to Appendix A.
The graphics, code positions, and functions of the ideographic character descriptors should comply with the provisions of Appendix B.
Note: GB/T 13000 provides a unified encoding for Chinese characters used in China, Japan, the UK, Vietnam and other countries and regions.
Chinese characters with unique abstract glyphs are assigned individual code positions; Chinese characters with the same abstract glyphs but different origins are assigned shared code positions.
Encoded Chinese characters are referred to as CJK Unified Ideographs, where CJK stands for China, Japan, and Korea.
4.4 Four-byte section
The four-byte section includes 66 CJK Unified Ideographs (9FA6 to 9FEF, excluding 8 characters from 9FB4 to 9FBB) from GB/T 13000 beyond the aforementioned double-byte characters, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension A, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension C, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension D, CJK Unified Ideographs Extension F, and characters of minority languages already encoded in GB/T 13000.
The four-byte part of the character is according to Appendix C.
5 Overall Structure
In the main text, numbers preceded by 0x are in hexadecimal, and those not preceded by 0x are in decimal.
In the appendix, all coded representations are in hexadecimal, while all other numbers are represented in decimal.
The single-byte part adopts the coding structure of GB/T 11383-1989, using the code positions 0x00~0x7F.
The double-byte portion uses two eight-bit binary bit strings to represent a character, with the first byte code ranging from 0x81 to 0xFE, and the tail byte code being 0x40 to 0x7E and 0x80 to 0xFE.
The four-byte part uses the unused 0x30 - 0x39 from GB/T 11383 - 1989 as a suffix for the extension of the double-byte encoding, with the encoding range being 0x81308130 - 0xFE39FE39.
The encoding range for the first byte of a four-byte character is 0x81 to 0xFE; the second byte is 0x30 to 0x39; the third byte is 0x81 to 0xFE; the fourth byte is 0x30 to 0x39. That is: 0x81308130 to 0x81308139; 0x81308230 to 0x81308239; 0x8130FEFE30 to 0x8130FE39; 0x81318130 to 0x81318139; and 0xFE39FE30 to 0xFE39FE39.

The content of this manual page is excerpted from the full documentation of the GNU C compiler, and is limited to explaining the meaning of options.
Unless voluntarily maintained, EURo files, Info files are authoritative documents.
If a discrepancy is found between the manual page and the software, please check the Info.
If we find that the content of this manual page is causing significant confusion and complaints due to being outdated, we will stop publishing it. There is no other choice, like updating the Info file and the man manual at the same time, because other maintenance work on Gnu cc does not leave us time to do this. The GNU project considers the man manual to be an outdated product and time should be spent elsewhere.
For complete and up-to-date documentation, please refer to the Info file `gee' or the Using and Porting GNU CC (for version 2.0) manual. Both are derived from the Texinfo source file gee.texinfo.
The C and C++ compilers are integrated. They both process input files in one or more of four steps: preprocessing, compilation, assembly, and linking.
The extension of the source file identifies the language of the source file, but for the compiler, the extension controls the default settings.
GCC considers preprocessed files (.i) as C files, and sets up C-style linking.
g++ considers preprocessed files (.i) as C++ files and sets up connections in C++ format.
The extension of the source file indicates the type of language and subsequent operations.
.c C source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembly.
.C C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembly.
.cc C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembly.
. CXX C++ source program; preprocessing, compiling, assembly.
.m Objective-C source program; pre-processing, compiling, assembly.
.i is a preprocessed C file; compilation, assembly.
.ii is a preprocessed C++ file; compilation, assembly.
.s assembly language source program; assembly.
Assembly language source program; preprocessing, assembly.
.h preprocessor files; these usually do not appear on the command line, other files with subsequent names are passed to the linker. This typically includes:
.0 Object file
.a Archive file
Linking is always the final step unless the -cec, -s, or -E options are used, or a compilation error prevents the process from completing.
During the linking phase, all .e files corresponding to the source program, -1 library files, and unrecognizable filenames (including specified .o H label files and .a library files) are passed to the linker options (OPTIONS) in the order they appear in the command line.
Options must be given separately: 'de' is entirely different from '-d -r'.
Most `-E' and `-W' options have two opposite formats: -fname and -fno-name (or -Wname and -Wno-name).
Only formats that are not the default options are listed here.
Below is a summary of all the options, grouped by type, with explanations in the following sections.
Code Generation Option
Overall Option
Explicitly specify the language of the input file as language (rather than the default choice obtained from the file name).
This option applies to all subsequent input files until the next '-x' option is encountered. The language is optional.
Close any explicit language specification, therefore process the files behind based on the file name suffix RE AS E `-x' option.
If only a part of the four stages (preprocessing, compiling, assembling, linking) is operated, you can use the `-x' option (or the file name after Ah) to tell geo where to start, and use the `~-c', `-s', or `-E' options to tell geo where to end. Note that some option combinations (for example, `-x cpp-output -E') {i gee MEF =c compile or assemble source files, ETER. ERA ATI By default, GCC replaces the source file name with `.o' and `.ec' file names. You can use the -o option to choose other names. GCC ignores any unrecognized input after the -ec option -S F what's going on.
The target file.
After compilation, it stops and does not proceed to assembly.
During the compilation process, pipelines are used instead of temporary files, as the assemblers of those systems cannot read data from pipelines. This is not a problem for GNU's assembler, which can accept a C "dialect" that supports ANSI standard C programs.
This will close some features in GNU Cc that are incompatible with ANSI Cc, as well as rarely used ANSI trigraph features such as unix and vax, and despite the use of all standard libraries available in the hosted environment (note: in the hosted environment, the main function returns an int value, a typical example is almost all programs except the kernel. In the corresponding freestanding environment, there is no standard library, and the program entry is not necessarily main, the most obvious example is the operating system kernel. For details, refer to the latest information on the gcc website).
For function declarations without parameters, such as `int foo ();', it is handled in the C style - that is, it does not specify the number or type of parameters. (Only for C++).
Normally, such a function foo in C++ means that the parameters are empty.
The list of sections was deleted here in an attempt to support certain aspects of traditional C compilers.
See the NU c manual, we have already deleted the details, so people won't HERI when the content becomes outdated.
Except for one thing: for C++ programs (not C), the '-traditional' option brings an additional effect, allowing assignment to 'this'.
The result is the same as with the `-Ethis-is-variable' option.
-traditional-cpp attempts to support certain aspects of the traditional Cc preprocessor.
Especially the content mentioned above about the preprocessor, but does not include the other effects of the `-traditional' option.
The -fdollars-in-identifiers allows the use of the '$' character in identifiers (only for C++).
You can specify the `-Efno-dollars-in-identifiers' option to explicitly prohibit the use of the `$' symbol.
(GNU C++ allows the '$' symbol by default on some target systems, but not all.)
The -fenum-int-equiv allows implicit conversion from ant type to enumeration type (MEF c++).
Normally, GNU C++ allows conversion from enum to int, but not the other way around.
-fexternal-templates produces smaller code for template declarations (only in C++), by generating a single copy only at the place where each template function is defined.
To successfully use this option, you must mark `#pragma implementation' (definition) or `#pragma interface' (declaration) in all files that use the template.
When the program is compiled with `-fexternal-templates', all template instantiations are of external type. You must ensure that the required instances appear in the implementation file.
This can be achieved through typedef, which references each required instance.
Correspondingly, if the default option `-fno-external-templates' is used during compilation, all template instances are explicitly set as built-in.
All member functions (except for constructors and mnew or delete member operators) are considered virtual functions of the class they belong to.
This does not imply that every call to a member function will go through the internal virtual function table.
In some cases, the compiler can determine that a virtual function can be called directly; when this happens, it is called directly.
-fcond-mismatch allows the types of the second and third arguments of a conditional expression to not match.
The value of this expression is Void.-fthis-—is-variable allows assignment to this (only for c++).
After integrating the user-defined free storage management mechanism into C++, the assignable 'this' seemed out of place.
Therefore, by default, assigning a value to 'this' within a class member function is an invalid operation.
However, for backward compatibility, you can make this operation valid through the `-fthis-is-variable' option.
The -funsigned-char defines char as an unsigned type, similar to unsigned char.
Different machines have their default char type. It could be either unsigned char or signed char.
Ideally, when dependent on the symbolic nature of data, a portable program should always use either signed char or unsigned char.
However, many programs have been written to use only simple char, and expect it to be a signed number (or an unsigned number, depending on the target machine for which the program is written).
This option, and its opposite, make such programs work on the corresponding default values.
The type of char should always be explicitly defined as either signed char or unsigned char, even if it behaves exactly like one of them.
If no explicit 'signed' or 'unsigned' modifier is stated, these options are used to define signed bitfields or unsigned bitfields.
By default, bit fields are signed, as they inherit from basic integer types such as int, which are signed. However, if the `-traditional' option is specified, bit fields are always unsigned.
-fwritable-strings stores string constants in the writable data segment, without any special treatment.
This is for compatibility with some old programs that thought modifying string constants was a very bad idea; the `-traditional' option has the same effect.
Executive Summary
The impact of COVID-19 on the drug market.
Its impact could be similar to the 2008 economic crisis.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has plunged the world into an unprecedented crisis.
In many countries, this disease has overwhelmed healthcare services to the point of near collapse, and the restrictive measures implemented by governments have caused serious disruption in the global economy.
The impact of the epidemic on the drug market is still unclear and difficult to predict, but it could potentially have far-reaching effects.
Some producers may be forced to find new methods of manufacturing drugs, as restrictions on movement also limit the acquisition of precursors and basic chemicals.
Smugglers, unable to cross borders due to travel restrictions, may have to find new routes and methods.
The patterns of drug use and supply may change, and the government's ability to respond may be hindered.
The changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedented, but there are still some lessons to be learned from past crises.
After the 2008 economic crisis, some drug users began to seek cheaper synthetic substances, shifting their usage patterns towards injecting drugs.
At the same time, governments around the world have cut budgets related to drugs.
If governments around the world respond to the current economic recession in the same way, preventative measures and treatment services for drug use and related risky behaviors could be severely impacted.
Additionally, the priority of interception operations and international cooperation may decrease, making it easier for traffickers to operate.
Some countries, where a large amount of drugs are smuggled via commercial flights, are expected to be most directly affected by drug trafficking activities.
Couriers carry synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine in their personal backpacks or hidden in their private luggage, sometimes in large quantities. Due to restrictions on air passenger transport almost everywhere, activities supplying drugs through commercial air travel may be completely interrupted.
Despite disruptions to the international postal supply chain, activities involving trafficking through the dark web and cargo mail may increase.
In the long run, economic recession and related lockdown measures could disrupt the drug market.
Due to rising unemployment rates and lack of opportunities, the poor and vulnerable are more likely to resort to harmful drug use, develop drug-related diseases, and turn to illegal activities related to drugs, whether it's production or transportation.
Drug trafficking organizations may take advantage of this situation, providing services to vulnerable populations and recruiting new members to strengthen their ranks.
With the decline in government response capabilities, these changes may quickly take root, becoming the new reality for many communities.
Expansion and Complexity
Market Growth
The pattern of population growth partly explains the reason for market expansion.
Drug use around the world has been steadily increasing, both in terms of total numbers and the proportion of drug users in the global population.
In 2009, it was estimated that there were 2.1 billion drug users, accounting for 4.8% of the global population aged 15-64, and in 2018, it was estimated that there were 2.69 billion drug users, accounting for 5.3% of this population group.
Over the past twenty years, the rate of drug use in developing countries has grown much faster than in developed countries.
This reflects to some extent the difference in overall population growth during this period, with developed countries at 7% and developing countries at 28%, but also reflects the faster growth of the young population in developing countries.
Teenagers and young adults make up the largest proportion of drug users.
Between 2000 and 2018, the population in this age group in developing countries increased by 16%, while in developed countries it decreased by 10%.
Urbanization is a driving factor in the current and future drug markets.
Whether in developed or developing countries, drug use is more prevalent in urban areas than in rural ones.
Part of the overall increase in drug use is due to the large-scale migration of people from rural to urban areas. Currently, more than half of the world's population lives in urban areas, compared to 34% in 1960.
Urbanization could be a key factor in the future dynamics of the drug market, especially in developing countries where the trend towards urbanization is more pronounced.
Wealth increase is associated with a rise in drug use, but the greatest burden of disease is borne by the poorest people worldwide, with drug use being more common in developed countries than in developing ones.
Drugs like cocaine are even more strongly associated with wealthier regions of the world.
Similarly, within countries, the prevalence of drug use is higher among the affluent social classes.
However, the rate of transition to drug addiction is higher among people with lower socio-economic status.
Data from a few countries suggest that harmful drug use patterns and morbidity are associated with low income.
These patterns seem to be less common in wealthier social classes.
The global economic constraints caused by the COVID-19 crisis are likely to exacerbate the risks for the most vulnerable groups, including drug users.
For example, changes in the labor market, such as rising unemployment rates, have historically been associated with an increase in drug use, and this pandemic has already forced tens of millions of people worldwide to become unemployed.
The COVID-19 pandemic could potentially lead to an expansion of the drug market, as more farmers may increase or engage in illegal crop cultivation, either due to reduced control by national authorities or because more people may be forced to take risks and engage in illegal activities in the face of an economic crisis.
COVID-19 related restrictions have led to a decrease in air and land traffic, potentially increasing maritime trafficking due to its lower interception risk and higher smuggling quantities compared to air or land routes.
Recently, there have been reports of cocaine shipments being transported directly from South America to Europe by sea.
Complexity increased.
The presence of non-internationally controlled substances remains stable, but new types of potentially harmful opiates are increasing, making the drug market increasingly complex.
In addition to plant-based substances such as cannabis, cocaine, and heroin, hundreds of synthetic drugs have been added, many of which are not under international control. The non-medical use of drugs is also rapidly increasing.
About 500 new active substances are introduced to the domestic markets of member countries each year.
Currently, the majority are stimulants, followed by synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists and a small amount of opiate-like substances.
While the overall number of new psychoactive substances has stabilized, the proportions have changed.
In 2014, the total number of new psychoactive substances identified included only 2% that were opioid-like, but by 2018, this figure had risen to 9%.
Many of the new psychoactive substances in the class of opioids are analogues of fentanyl, whose efficacy and harm have been proven, leading to overdose deaths in North America and other regions, albeit to a lesser extent.
In North America, fentanyl is used both as an adulterant for heroin and other drugs (including cocaine and methamphetamine), and to manufacture counterfeit medicinal opioids.
Some evidence suggests that the phenomenon of injecting new psychoactive stimulants also exists in Europe: a study of discarded syringe residues in six European cities found that many syringes were contaminated with new psychoactive substances that produce a stimulant effect.
The use of new psychoactive substances may gradually become firmly established among vulnerable groups.
A single new type of psychoactive substance has almost never formed a large market.
However, evidence from Europe suggests that synthetic cannabinoids are a serious problem among socially marginalized groups such as the homeless and prison inmates.
Twenty-two countries reported the use of new psychoactive substances in prisons, with most identifying synthetic cannabinoids as the main challenge.
Regulation of precursor chemicals has forced drug manufacturers to innovate. Many chemicals commonly used as precursors for the synthesis of drugs such as amphetamine, methamphetamine, and "ecstasy" have been placed under international control.
Drug traffickers and manufacturers have been looking for alternatives, not only substances with looser controls, but also chemicals specifically designed to evade regulation, the so-called "designer precursors."
Restrictive measures aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19 are likely to further squeeze drug manufacturers who rely on precursor chemicals.
Evidence from Mexico suggests that this has become a reality: reports indicate that a shortage of methamphetamine precursors imported from East Asia in March 2020 led to a rise in methamphetamine prices in Mexico and the United States.
The market changes in the blink of an eye.
Synthetic drugs have replaced opiates in Central Asia and the Russian Federation.
The opiate market in Central Asia and the Russian Federation appears to have changed between 2008 and 2018.
The amount of opium intercepted by the Russian Federation authorities has decreased by about 80%, while the number of people receiving treatment for opiate use has significantly decreased.
However, the stimulant market seems to be growing increasingly vibrant.
Evidence suggests that methamphetamine and various cathinones, including methcathinone and alpha-pyrrolidinopentiophenone, are now ubiquitous in the Russian drug market.
Russian authorities reported a sharp increase in the number of secret processing sites for the production of various illegal drugs recently seized, more than doubling in two years, rising to 152 sites in 2018.
Growth in the methamphetamine market in Afghanistan and Iraq.
As early as 2012, surveys of hospital, prison, and other institutional staff had already revealed the significance of methamphetamine in Iraq.
Crystalline methamphetamine has become another major drug of concern, in addition to Phentermine and Tramadol.
A 2015 study further confirmed these findings, with drug users stating that marijuana was harder to obtain than "fentanyl" or methamphetamine.
Recently, Iraqi authorities have discovered several methamphetamine processing sites, and the DEA has expressed concern over the large-scale importation of pseudoephedrine preparations, which are used as precursors at these methamphetamine processing sites.
In Afghanistan, the production of methamphetamine appears to have begun in 2014.
Since then, the seizure of methamphetamine has been steadily increasing.
However, the amount seized in the first half of 2019 was 657 kilograms - a sharp increase compared to the previous year.
Large amounts of methamphetamine believed to originate from Afghanistan have been seized in other countries, indicating that the country's production is rapidly increasing.
Policy changes and trends.
Jurisdictions where the non-medical use of cannabis has been legalized tend to see an increase in cannabis use.
Canada, Uruguay, and 11 jurisdictions in the United States allow the production of cannabis products for non-medical use.
In most jurisdictions where marijuana use has been legalized, there has been an increase in use, although the same trend has been observed in jurisdictions where non-medical use of marijuana has not been legalized.
In the two earliest states to legalize it, Colorado and Washington, adult non-medical use of marijuana has increased, particularly in the past month and daily or nearly daily use, exceeding the national average since 2012.
All indicators show that since 2011, the use of marijuana in Uruguay has increased, with last month's usage almost doubling.
This suggests that the main reason for the increase is the frequent and regular use of marijuana.
Short-term data from Canada also indicates that as the legal market expanded from 2018 to 2019, usage also increased.
However, in 2019, 40% of cannabis users still obtained some products from illegal sources.
Is the reason behind the global plummet in cannabis seizures the legalization of marijuana?
In 2018, the global seizure of cannabis herb fell to its lowest level in 20 years, due to a decrease in seizures in North America, which had fallen by 84% over the past decade.
In contrast, seizures in the rest of the world during the same period almost doubled. The pattern of seizures suggests that policies aimed at liberalizing the cannabis market played a key role in the decline.
Regulation of new psychoactive substances appears to have a deterrent effect, but the effectiveness of domestic regulation of these substances is still difficult to assess.
Countries with different regulatory systems for new psychoactive substances show different prevalence rates of use for these substances.
In some other countries, the use of new psychoactive substances has decreased following domestic legislation.
Vulnerable groups face harm from both legal and illegal drug markets. Medicinal opioids used for pain management and palliative care are primarily provided in high-income countries, with uneven distribution across regions.
In 2018, over 90% of all medically consumable opiates were in high-income countries.
Approximately 50% are in North America, 40% in Europe, and 2% in Oceania.
The population of these countries accounts for approximately 12% of the global population.
It is estimated that the population of low and middle-income countries makes up 88% of the global population, but consumes less than 10% of medicinal opiates.
The barriers to accessing medicinal opioids are related to many factors, including legislation, culture, health systems, and prescription practices.
The risk of drug addiction is greater among the poorer population, with approximately 35.6 million people suffering from drug addiction in 2018.
Poverty, limited education, and social marginalization may increase the risk of drug addiction and exacerbate its consequences. This has been confirmed by studies in high-income countries, where individuals' adverse socio-economic trajectories - not just their status at a particular point in time - are associated with the risk of drug addiction.
Drug addiction can also exacerbate socio-economic disadvantages, further increasing the risk of unemployment, poverty, and homelessness, thereby fueling a vicious cycle of disadvantage. These outcomes may also be associated with stigmatizing attitudes and consequences within the criminal justice system.
Women, ethnic minorities and immigrants, diverse sexual orientation groups, people displaced by armed conflict or disaster, and people in rural environments may also be disproportionately affected by drug-related diseases, or encounter problems in accessing treatment services.
According to the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY) index, which estimates the number of healthy life years lost due to disability and premature death, the wider societal impact of harmful drug use has increased over the past decade.
Between 2007 and 2018, the global disability-adjusted life years attributed to drug use increased by 17%.
Among injection drug users, the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) associated with untreated hepatitis C leading to liver cancer is particularly high, reaching up to 40%.
The relationship between drugs and violence is complex and it is difficult to determine all the causal relationships between the use of psychoactive substances and violence.
Limited global data suggests that intoxication may be a significant factor in homicides.
But in violent incidents, alcohol seems to play a bigger role than drugs.
While drug use may lead to criminal behavior, in some cases this link can be partly attributed to various mediating factors such as socio-economic disadvantage and other types of adversity caused by individual risk, family environment, and peer influence.
The connection between drug trafficking and violence is multifaceted.
If there is already a stable criminal structure, large-scale organized criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, could potentially be carried out without violence.
In the short term, the presence and extent of violence depend less on the amount of trafficking and more on certain changes that destabilize the balance of power between organized crime groups, such as changes in the size of the illegal market, the death or imprisonment of notorious criminals, and law enforcement measures that weaken one group relative to another.
Latest trends.
Marijuana is the most commonly used substance, while opioids pose the greatest harm.
It is estimated that in 2018, 192 million people used cannabis, making it the most widely used drug in the world.
In contrast, 58 million people used opioids in 2018.
However, the associated risks of opioid drugs are often overlooked due to the smaller number of users.
Of the estimated 167,000 deaths related to drug use disorders in 2017, 66% were caused by these substances, and of the 21 million years of life lost due to disability or premature death believed to be caused by drug use, 50% were caused by these substances.
The non-medical use of synthetic opioids has exacerbated the public health crisis.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, the opioid crisis is exacerbated by Tramadol; in North America, it is Fentanyl. These two regions have almost no commonalities in terms of economy, demographic data, or general drug use patterns, but both are struggling to combat the opioid crisis fueled by easily accessible and low-cost substances.
In North America, the use of synthetic opioids like fentanyl has led to an increase in opioid overdose deaths over the past 20 years.
In 2018, two-thirds of the 67,367 overdose deaths registered in the United States involved fentanyl.
Canada also reported similar results, but with lower numbers.
Part of the reason fentanyl causes overdose deaths is the unpredictable potency of fentanyl on the illegal drug market.
In West Africa, Central Africa, and North Africa, there has been a significant increase in the non-medical use of Tramadol market.
In this region, the number of patients using Tramadol for treatment is increasing.
In 2017, the global interception of tramadol significantly increased, reaching a peak of over 125 tons.
But in 2018, after India passed a new law regulating turmeric, the global seizure amount dropped to 32 tons.
The crises in these two places were brought about by the simplicity of manufacture and low production costs, as well as the lack of international regulation on carfentanil and many fentanyl analogues or their precursors.
What exacerbates the crisis in these two places is that these substances are supplied in both the pharmaceutical market and the illegal market, making it even more difficult to detect and prevent their misuse.
The use of stimulants is continually increasing.
In the field of stimulants, cocaine and methamphetamine are dominant, with the usage of both substances on the rise in their main markets.
In 2018, about 19 million people used cocaine, as it was quite popular in North America and Western Europe.
In the same year, about 27 million people used amphetamines, with methamphetamine being the most commonly used amphetamine stimulant in Southeast Asia and North America.
According to most indicators, the use of methamphetamine in these two regions has been expanding for the past 20 years.
In some markets, cocaine and methamphetamine can coexist, sometimes substituting for each other, such that when the use of one drug increases, the use of the other decreases, and sometimes both increase and decrease to meet the same market demand.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk for intravenous drug users.
It is estimated that in 2018, there were about 11.3 million people who injected drugs, and about 10% of global HIV infections were caused by injecting drugs.
Over one million injection drug users are infected with the HIV virus, and 5.5 million suffer from Hepatitis C.
In 2017, approximately 585,000 people died from drug use, half of which were due to liver disease caused by hepatitis C, and most of the hepatitis C in injection drug users remained untreated.
The restrictions due to COVID-19 may cause a shortage of opioids, leading users to substitute with more readily available substances such as alcohol or benzodiazepines, or to mix opioids with synthetic drugs.
As some users switch to injection or inject more frequently, more harmful methods of use may emerge.

EU summit debates refugee policy, EU official: reception process bottlenecked - China News Network.
EU summit argues incessantly over refugee policy, EU official: every step of the reception process has bottlenecks.
According to a report by Agence France-Presse on February 10, at the latest EU summit, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that EU leaders agreed to implement stricter policies on illegal immigration, making it easier to deport illegal immigrants, reported by Niu Ruifei, the special correspondent in Belgium for Global Times.
The move by the EU was reportedly a response to the growing concern over illegal immigration in Europe, with the core issue now being that very few illegal immigrants can ultimately be deported.
According to summit documents, EU leaders called on the Commission to "immediately mobilise substantial EU funds" to strengthen external borders through infrastructure and surveillance.
However, the EU and its member states have been constantly arguing over issues such as the payment of fence costs.
Von der Leyen has repeatedly stated that EU funds will not cover the related costs.
However, diplomats from some member countries said that if Europe could share the cost of installing cameras, watchtowers, and other infrastructure along the external borders, it would free up national budgets and speed up the construction process.
The European website Euractiv reported that EU officials admitted that there were bottlenecks at every step of the refugee reception process, and the limited reception capacity and overburdened immigration authorities of member states could not prevent refugees from submitting "countless" asylum applications in EU countries, leaving the EU's refugee reception system in a near "permanent crisis".
According to estimates by the European Commission, Schengen countries in the EU received over 920,000 asylum applications last year, nearly half more than the previous year.
Meanwhile, the EU recorded over 330,000 instances of illegal entry last year.
In this context, the summit also reached an agreement on a "principle" that EU countries can deport illegal immigrants based on the court decision of another member state.
Additionally, it was reported that EU leaders also agreed to "increase the use of the concept of safe countries," paving the way for the EU to compile a common list.

The US escalates "chip war" severely damaging the global semiconductor industry - China News Network.
Recently, the US "chip war" against China has shown signs of escalating - first, under US pressure, the Netherlands and Japan agreed to initiate controls on the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China; then foreign media reported that the US government is considering severing all ties between US suppliers and Huawei, prohibiting US suppliers from providing any products to Huawei; the Biden administration is also preparing to announce an executive order restricting US investment in China's sensitive technology industries... Shortly after the start of 2023, the US has been relentless in its efforts to curb the development of China's semiconductor-related industries.
In recent years, the United States has never ceased its efforts to curb China's development in the "core" sector, precisely suppressing the semiconductor supply chain to China on one hand, and constructing a "de-Sinicized" semiconductor industry chain alliance on the other, aiming to completely "shake off" China in the advanced semiconductor industry.
Whether it's courting South Korea to establish a "technology alliance", or establishing a chip "quadrilateral alliance" with South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, or establishing a semiconductor industry "small circle" through mechanisms such as the US-Japan-India-Australia "quadrilateral mechanism" and "Indo-Pacific economic framework", the United States is attempting to build a closed supply chain cycle dominated by the US by introducing politicized, camp-based, and weaponized means into the semiconductor industry, in order to make up for its shortcomings in chip manufacturing and maintain its advantageous position in the global chip industry.
However, the US's high-profile "chip tactics" against China also resulted in a "lose-lose" situation.
Recently, the well-known American chip manufacturing equipment supplier, Lam Research Group, announced that due to the impact of the latest round of export bans on chip manufacturing equipment to China, the group will lay off 1,300 full-time employees and plans to lay off another 1,400 temporary employees in the next two quarters.
The global lithography giant, ASML Holding NV of the Netherlands, recently warned that banning the export of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China could lead to an increase in semiconductor prices.
US media analysis shows that after the US government's aggressive suppression of China's chip and semiconductor industries, many US companies have been severely affected, including electronic design automation tool developers, chip designers, wafer manufacturing equipment manufacturers, and chip manufacturers themselves.
The so-called US suppression of China's advanced semiconductor industry has dragged down the global semiconductor industry chain and supply chain.
The semiconductor industry is a high-tech and knowledge-intensive industry, and a closely linked global semiconductor industry chain has already been formed.
According to professionals, based on specialized division of labor, the entire production process of semiconductor products needs to cross national borders more than 70 times, taking up to 100 days in total.
Despite a strong foundation in the semiconductor industry, the United States is relatively weak in manufacturing capabilities, especially in advanced process technology, and heavily relies on the East Asia region.
Even though the United States is making great efforts to guide the advanced chip production and supply chain towards a regional development dominated by a "small circle" of the US, the regional distribution and interdependence of the global semiconductor-related industries are hard to change.
The United States' aggressive "reshaping" and "de-Sinicization" of the semiconductor industry chain has severely impacted the global semiconductor industry.
The chip is at the core of the global future industry, and the development of the chip industry cannot be separated from the participation of countries around the world.
In recent years, the United States has taken a series of unilateral actions, successively introducing the "Innovation and Competition Act", the "2022 American Competitiveness Act", and the "Chips and Science Act", using technological hegemony to consolidate its technological leadership; it has both rewarded and threatened allies, enticing chip manufacturers such as Intel, TSMC, and Samsung to set up factories in the US, striving to ensure America's global leadership in the chip field.
In the short term, the United States has indeed caused trouble for the development of China's chip industry and related industries, reaping real benefits.
But in the long run, the hysterical suppression by the United States has forced the Chinese chip industry to continuously break through, causing it to lose a huge Chinese market, which will ultimately greatly weaken the innovation willingness and ability of American technology companies, and harm the development of the global chip industry.

The first batch of personal pension wealth management products go on sale, with a minimum holding period of 360 days - China News Network.
The first batch of personal pension wealth management products goes on sale.
Seven products from the home institution are available, with the shortest holding period being 360 days.
Personal pension financial products have finally been launched.
On February 10th, China's Wealth Management Network released the first batch of personal pension wealth management product list, and seven personal pension wealth management products from ICBC Wealth Management, ABC Wealth Management, and Postal Savings Bank of China officially went on sale.
At this point, the "shelf" of personal pension accounts finally gathered four types of products: personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management, personal pension insurance, and public pension funds.
According to the introduction, the first batch of personal pension wealth management products are all publicly raised net value open-ended products, including 5 new products and 2 existing products. Except for one mixed product, the remaining 6 products are all fixed income products.
A Beijing Youth Daily reporter noted that of the five newly launched products, four came from ICBC Wealth Management, all of which were fixed income products. The shortest holding periods were 365 days, 540 days, 720 days, and 1080 days, with corresponding performance benchmarks (annualized) of 3.70% - 4.20%, 4.10% - 4.60%, 4.40% - 4.90%, and 5.25% - 5.75% respectively.
The remaining new product is "Postal Savings Bank Wealth Tianyi·Hongjin with a minimum holding of 1095 days No. 1", which is also a fixed income product. The fundraising began on February 10 and ended on February 19, with a risk level of two.
Of the two surviving products, one is the Agricultural Bank of China's "Agricultural Bank of China Sincere · Dynamic" 360-day technology innovation RMB wealth management product, with a mixed investment nature and a risk level of three.
Another surviving product is "Post Bank Wealth Tianyi·Hongjin with a minimum holding of 365 days No. 1", a fixed income type, which began fundraising on December 30 last year, officially operated on January 4 this year, and the accumulated net value on February 8 was 1.0011.
According to the "Opinions of the State Council Office on Promoting the Development of Individual Pension Funds," financial products that can be invested in by individual pension fund accounts include bank wealth management, savings deposits, commercial pension insurance, and public funds.
The launch of the first batch of personal pension wealth management products marked that personal pension investors can officially purchase wealth management products through personal pension fund accounts.
In November last year, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission formulated the "Interim Measures for the Management of Personal Pension Business of Commercial Banks and Wealth Management Companies".
The regulations stipulate that participants can purchase personal pension savings, personal pension wealth management products, personal pension insurance products, personal pension public fund products, and other personal pension products through their personal pension fund accounts.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, the Ministry of Finance, and the State Taxation Administration issued a notice, clearly stating that the individual pension system would be implemented in Beijing, Tianjin, as well as 36 pilot cities and regions including Shijiazhuang in Hebei, Xiong'an New Area, and Jincheng City in Shanxi.
By the end of 2022, the number of participants in the personal pension scheme was 19.54 million, with 6.13 million contributors, and the total contribution amount was 14.2 billion yuan.
Previously, the banks involved in the pilot only launched three types of products: personal retirement savings, personal pension insurance products, and public pension funds.
Now that personal pension financial products have gathered, how should investors choose?
Experts from the BOCOM Wealth Management Product Development Department stated that compared to other personal pension products, the pilot phase of pension wealth management products and personal pension wealth management products both have three characteristics.
The first is robustness, with a more sound risk management mechanism, more stable investment strategies and concepts, and the implementation of independent third-party custody outside of the parent bank.
The second is long-term, the term of pension financial products in the pilot stage are all 5 years and above, the personal pension financial products to be issued in the next step have a minimum holding period of 1 year in principle, and holding for more than 3 years is encouraged.
Thirdly, it is inclusive, with a low threshold for product purchase, generally starting at 1 yuan, and some as low as 0.01 yuan, with more favorable rates for product custody fees, management fees, and other charges.
Professionals point out that investors should make choices based on the characteristics of the product and their own risk tolerance.
Personal pension savings have the characteristics of long-term, high interest rates, and high security, suitable for people with low risk tolerance; personal pension insurance products focus on protection, more suitable for those who cannot bear investment risk and can accept stable returns; while personal pension financial products and public fund products do not guarantee principal or returns, have certain investment risks, but the expected returns are higher, suitable for people with certain financial knowledge and higher risk tolerance.

The fitness industry should overcome the trust crisis - China News Network.
Another major gym "going bust"?
Recently, the issue of member rights protection at the well-known fitness organization, Zhongjian Fitness, has attracted social attention.
After the Spring Festival, many members found that their stores were not operating normally. Subsequently, rumors about the institution's bankruptcy and absconding caused panic among the members, leading to the intervention of the public security and human resources departments.
Finally, the person in charge of the agency responded, promising to work hard to protect the legitimate rights and interests of employees and members, and the controversy was settled.
Why is it that when individual fitness institutions temporarily close some of their branches due to operational issues, instead of calmly waiting for the problem to be resolved, many members' first reaction is "something is seriously wrong"?
Behind the controversy over gym club membership rights, there is a deeper issue of trust crisis in the industry.
Domestic traditional gyms generally adopt a prepaid model, and "earning money from non-attending users" is the underlying logic of their development.
By obtaining cash flow through pre-selling membership cards and continuously opening new stores, it seems like a cycle that can be repeated. However, it's actually robbing Peter to pay Paul, and cannot form a stable profit model.
Negative news such as gym closures are frequently reported in the industry, causing a strong impact on consumer confidence.
From a market perspective, a gym can certainly be considered a good business with a "money-making" future.
Despite its ups and downs, the fitness track has always attracted capital attention.
Multiple data show that the popularity in areas such as cultural and sports consumption continues to rise, indicating a sustained market recovery.
Specifically in the fitness market, with the steady improvement of residents' living standards and the deepening of the concept of healthy living, there is great potential for the development of the fitness industry.
The better the situation, the more the industry needs to pay attention to the quality of development.
However, some institutions are blindly optimistic about the fitness market after the consumer recovery, just emerging from the crisis, they are blowing the horn of pioneering and expanding, pouring all their financing funds into the construction of new stores.
Undeniably, in recent years, due to the impact of the pandemic, many institutions have withdrawn, and the industry has reshuffled. Strong companies are selectively increasing their acquisition efforts and repositioning, which may present new opportunities.
However, if the fitness market wants to enter a virtuous cycle and embark on a steady and long-term path, the industry must change its traditional model and business strategy.
Only by being steady and reliable, and re-establishing consumer trust and security, can we truly win the market and the future.
Compared to aggressively expanding with new stores, what the fitness industry currently needs more is to focus on improving services and retaining customers through high-quality development.
Firstly, retaining users relies on providing good service.
Gyms belong to the service industry, and their essence is to adhere to a "user-oriented" approach, focusing closely on user needs and placing the emphasis on improving and upgrading services.
Secondly, digital transformation is needed to enhance the user experience.
For example, the currently popular internet gym model allows users to pay per use and choose their own location.
At the same time, physical data and exercise data can be effectively utilized, and social needs can be met, achieving a complete service loop from online to offline.
Without personal trainer sales pitches and expensive annual memberships, users' concerns about fitness institutions "running away" are reduced, thus increasing trust.
Additionally, there is a need to actively explore diverse business formats.
Nowadays, sports consumption has moved from single service to scenario consumption, and fitness clubs are expected to become new consumption entrances. Peripheral products such as sports supplements and fitness equipment needed for fitness may become new profit points, providing consumers with more choices.

Buy at a higher price, get a refund for the difference!
"Nanjing's real estate market sees a resurgence of 'price difference compensation' - China News Network"
Yangzi Evening News reported (by reporter Ma Zuobo) that Yangzi Evening News/Zi Niu News reporters discovered in an interview on the 10th that the "price protection agreement", which had not been seen for more than ten years, has returned to the Nanjing property market. A property development in the Jiangbei New District claimed "price difference compensation". If the discounts on other properties before the handover are greater than the previous discounts, the developer is willing to change the house for the buyer and refund the difference.
The conditions of the "insurance agreement" can be numerous.
The property located in Jiangbei New District is called Poly Yangzi Cuiyuntai. A prospective buyer, Mr. Sun, told reporters that he found a "statement" when he visited the property last weekend.
The picture he sent to reporters showed that the developer of the property promised that anyone who purchased a property between February 1 and February 28 would, from the date of signing the sales contract to the delivery of the corresponding property, if the discount on other properties in the project was greater than the discount previously enjoyed (limited to other unsold properties of the same type, same building, same unit, and same property type), the developer could change the property for the buyer and refund the difference.
Mr. Sun stated that the property consultant said this was actually a "price protection agreement," designed to reassure buyers and prevent them from worrying about the developer lowering prices for promotions. "The fear now is that the price will drop after purchase. There's no time to make a fuss at the sales office, and it's indeed frustrating if you don't complain," he said.
Many homebuyers believe that while "price protection agreements" are meant to reassure purchasers, the conditions are not low.
Ms. Zheng, who plans to buy a house in Jiangbei, said that the houses with a guaranteed price must first be of the same type, and also in the same building and unit. There are very few houses for buyers to compare prices, so the "threshold" is still quite high.
Some homebuyers believe that due to information asymmetry, it is not ruled out that extra concessions may be given during sales, and it is not easy for buyers to "defend their rights".
Whether homebuyers can be retained remains to be seen.
A reporter found out from Nanjing's online real estate that the property launched a total of 252 units in two buildings last November, with apartment sizes of 105 square meters, 114 square meters, and 129 square meters, etc. The average selling price for fully furnished units was 39,843 yuan per square meter.
However, more than two months later, online real estate shows that the total number of unsold units in this property is 157, accounting for 62.3% of the total. Among them, there are 128 units in Building 8, with 113 unsold units. Out of 124 units in Building 7, 44 are unsold. The total number of transactions for the project is only 33 units, accounting for just 13%.
Market insiders explained that the "price protection agreement" had also appeared in Nanjing in 2008.
In August of that year, to attract buyers, the real estate development on Huangshan Road in Hexi, Hengtang West Garden, launched a "Price Guarantee Plan". The specific content was "The company solemnly promises that if the discount range of the project expands within a year, the company will return the difference to the old owners."
In April 2011, nine real estate developments in Nanjing also offered a portion of their properties with a "price difference compensation" promise.
"The real estate market is recovering, and it needs a 'cardiotonic' more than ever at this moment."
"Price protection agreements are also one of the marketing strategies of real estate companies," said Mr. Shen, a veteran operator in the Nanjing real estate industry.
He believes that nowadays, property developers need confidence more than homebuyers, and the introduction of the "price guarantee agreement" is actually a morale booster for them.
As for whether homebuyers can be retained, he said it depends on the impact of multiple factors such as regulatory policies and loan thresholds, which still need to be observed for now.
Multiple data declines, Taiwan's economy starts the year poorly - China News Network.
Xinhua News Agency, Taipei, February 11th (Reporters Zhao Bo and Huang Yang) - With export trade volume experiencing five consecutive months of decline, the Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) shrinking for seven consecutive months, and the Consumer Price Index (CPI) once again hitting the "3-digit" mark... Recently, the Taiwan authorities have successively released economic data for January 2023.
Experts have analysed that the Taiwanese economy's performance at the start of the year was not good, and there is significant pressure for growth.
According to the financial authorities in Taiwan, the region's exports in January of this year amounted to $31.51 billion, a year-on-year decrease of 21.2%, marking the fifth consecutive month of negative growth.
The export value of all 11 major categories of goods declined compared to the same period last year.
The largest declines were in rubber and plastic products and optical equipment, which fell by 37.6% and 35.7% respectively over the year.
Exports of electronic components fell by 20.1% year-on-year, the largest decline in 11 years.
Among them, integrated circuits fell by 18.3% annually, marking the largest decline in 14 years.
The head of the department's statistics bureau, Cai Meina, stated that this shows a diffusion of weak demand in the consumer electronics industry, indicating that the electronics industry has entered a correction period.
Statistics show that in January, both imports and exports in Taiwan decreased, with a trade surplus of only 2.34 billion US dollars, the lowest level in nearly three years.
The financial authority in Taiwan believes that due to the global decrease in terminal demand and industry inventory adjustments suppressing manufacturers' willingness to purchase materials, the decline in exports is unlikely to improve in the short term. The decline in Taiwan's exports in the first quarter of this year may be worse than expected.
According to the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research, the seasonally adjusted Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for Taiwan's manufacturing sector was 40.4% in January of this year, a continuous contraction for seven months, and a decrease of 3.3 percentage points from December of the previous year.
In the economic monitoring indicator system, PMI uses 50% as the boom-bust line. An index greater than 50% represents economic expansion, while less than 50% indicates contraction.
In January, among the five components of Taiwan's PMI, new orders, production and employment contracted, supplier delivery times fell, and inventory tightened.
All six industries reported a contraction in PMI, with the industries ranked by contraction speed as follows: power and machinery equipment industry (35.1%), electronics and optics industry (35.2%), chemical and biotech medical industry (39.2%), basic raw materials industry (42.4%), transportation equipment industry (42.6%), and food and textile industry (45.7%).
In terms of prices, the Taiwan authorities' "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics" announced that the annual increase rate of Taiwan's CPI in January this year was 3.04%, breaking 3% again since last July.
Among them, vegetable prices soared by 28.25%, hitting a 17-month high.
Cao Zhihong, a special commissioner of the Taiwan "Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics," admitted that the increase in vegetable prices was indeed beyond expectations. Excluding the Spring Festival factor, the average CPI in January and February this year should be close to 2.71% in December last year, indicating that inflationary pressure still exists and remains high.
Looking ahead to Taiwan's economy this year, experts expressed pessimism, according to reports from local media such as the United Daily News and Yahoo Finance.
Professor Wu Dare from the Department of Economics at Central University in Taiwan analyzed that a decline in exports could cause cash flow problems for export manufacturing firms, increasing the risk of debt default.
At the same time, a decrease in orders led manufacturers to cut labor costs, affecting the labor market and household economy, which in turn impacted consumer spending power.
Taiwan Economic Research Institute researcher Qiu Dasheng believes that this year's inflation situation in Europe and America has not been resolved, demand continues to shrink, and it is predicted that Taiwan's export recession will continue into the first half of the year.
As Taiwan's economy is export-driven, the economic growth for the year will not be as good as last year due to the downturn in exports.
"The Important Engine of Global Recovery" - China News Network
"In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy has demonstrated strong resilience."
Recent market expectations indicate that the international community is generally optimistic about China's future development.
"Julio Rios, a well-known Spanish expert on China and honorary advisor to the China Policy Watch Network, recently told our reporter in an interview that China's epidemic prevention and control has entered a new stage, and the vitality of economic and social development will be further released.
Rios stated that in the face of various unexpected factors, China has responded calmly with extraordinary economic governance experience and measures, fully demonstrating its economic resilience and management level.
While China is steadfast in expanding its openness to the outside world, the endogenous driving force of economic development is constantly strengthening, with state-owned enterprises and private enterprises developing in coordination.
Every year, the two sessions of the National People's Congress of China are held, where representatives and members discuss major national development plans and hot issues concerning people's livelihoods, widely gathering consensus, rallying public support, and pooling wisdom to add strength to China's development.
"Since the reform and opening up, China has achieved long-term rapid development and is currently entering a stage of high-quality development.
The international community looks forward to Chinese wisdom and solutions, and expects China's development to bring new opportunities to the world.
"China is currently pushing for technological innovation with full force, injecting new momentum into economic and social development," Rios said. "Investment, talent cultivation, policy incentives, all these keep China vibrant in the new five-year plan."
In Rios' view, economic system reform is a daunting task for any country.
Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China both leverages the strengths of the market economy and the superiority of the socialist system, taking proactive measures to stabilize the economy.
Focusing on the strategic basis of expanding domestic demand, increasing financial support for the real economy, supporting private, small and medium-sized enterprises and manufacturing development, insisting on innovative development, promoting employment, improving the income and living standards of the Chinese people, and meeting the diverse consumption needs of the people... China's complete, accurate, and comprehensive implementation of the new development concept, striving to promote high-quality development, and building a new development pattern, will bring more growth opportunities to the world.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of the proposal of the "Belt and Road" initiative.
The stabilization and recovery of the economy after the pandemic is a common goal of the international community.
The continuous release of China's economic development potential will bring more benefits to countries around the world, becoming an important engine for global recovery.
Rios stated that he looks forward to the continued role of the "Belt and Road" cooperation in improving the infrastructure level of various countries, strengthening interconnectivity in various fields, and continuing to release greater potential.

Save half or even more on costs?
Henan Province standardizes and integrates the price of oral implant medical services - China News Network.
According to CCTV News: Dental implants are the ideal choice for many patients with missing teeth, but the cost, often tens of thousands per tooth, has deterred many.
Since the beginning of this year, with the accelerated implementation of centralized procurement of dental implants, various places have also put the price reduction of dental implants on the agenda.
Starting from February 10, the full-process price control target for conventional dental implant medical services in Henan Province is 4300 yuan, and the full-process cost of a single conventional implant should not exceed 97% of the control target.
Dental implantation refers to a method of tooth restoration that uses an underlying structure implanted in the bone tissue to support and stabilize the upper dental prosthesis.
Reporters learned from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University that, taking a single conventional implant as an example, the price from implantation to final restoration is about 16,000 to 17,000 yuan.
Patient He Ying: After the new policy, the doctor told me that in my case, it would be around 8,000 yuan, less than 10,000 yuan, basically saving half.
Based on the current project, Henan Province has also integrated and determined 15 oral implantation medical service price items such as "implantation fee (per piece)", and uniformly formulated the price and medical insurance payment category of provincial public medical institutions, cancelling or adjusting 20 medical service price items such as dental implant surgery.
Li Yunjie, Director of the Pharmaceutical Price and Tender Procurement Department of Zhengzhou Medical Security Bureau: The main beneficiaries are fourfold: medical insurance, which has less expenditure; hospitals, which have less pressure; suppliers, who have gained a market; and our patients, who are the biggest beneficiaries, as the cost of implanting a tooth may be halved or even more.
Shenzhen: Building the nation's first and world-leading pioneer city for high-speed development - China News Network.
On February 11, according to the "Shenzhen Industrial Information" WeChat public account, the Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Industry and Information Technology recently issued the "Shenzhen City Pioneer City Construction Action Plan".
It proposed that by the end of 2023, a super broadband network with high speed, large capacity, and low latency would be built to achieve the network construction goals of "double gigabit, all-optical network, 1 millisecond, and Internet of Everything", creating the country's first and world-leading ultra-fast pioneer city.

With the emergence of "new variables" in China's e-commerce industry, how can "content be king" in driving sales?
- China News Service
On February 11, China News Service reported: "New variables" emerge in China's e-commerce industry, how to achieve "content is king" in product promotion?
China News Financial Reporter Xia Bin
"We entered the e-commerce game late, but from the very beginning, we realized that in order to stand out from the countless shops, content is very important.
Fangfang, a post-90s girl from Guangdong, is currently operating a nourishing food ingredient shop on Douyin, making a 30-year-old offline shop "bloom" online.
Imitating the style of old Hong Kong films and accompanied by classic Cantonese songs, opening the @FangFangOnePersonFood TikTok account offers refreshing and beautifully crafted videos.
At the recent Douyin e-commerce "Looking for Companions · High-quality Content Sharing Session", Fangfang, as a representative of high-quality creators, spoke about her daily creative experiences and insights.
She said on the spot, "The carefully polished videos have attracted a lot of netizens' attention, many people are interested in the ingredients in my home, want to cook along, and the sales channel suddenly opened up.
" "
Fangfang used soup-making videos to make more people fall in love with the "taste of old Guangdong". In one live broadcast, she sold up to 300,000 pieces of nourishing ingredients, saving her family's nearly bankrupt old store.
"With no content, there is no e-commerce." As short video and live-streaming e-commerce continue to develop, people's requirements and standards for e-commerce content are entering a new stage.
In the early stages of live-streaming sales, live-stream rooms often attracted users with low-price discounts, and price advantage seemed to be the only selling point at the time.
In recent years, there have been both phenomenal influencers like Liu Genghong and Dongfang Zhenxuan, as well as many experts and merchants in niche fields that are not well-known to the public. They have improved their long-term business benefits by continuously creating high-quality content that aligns with their brand's tone.
Gao Yaxuan, the head of operations for Douyin's e-commerce star authors, explained that over the past year, 6.27 million creators have monetized their content through Douyin's e-commerce platform, with their content creation volume increasing by 252% and total transaction volume more than doubling.
"Behind these numbers, we can sense a thriving and vibrant author ecosystem.
"Gao Yaxuan said."
The Communication Innovation and Future Media Experimental Platform of Beijing Normal University previously released the "E-commerce Industry Content Health Index (ECHI) Report", which analyzed the importance of the "new variable" - quality content in the current e-commerce industry from a data perspective, and used the index to evaluate the content ecology of 27 mainstream e-commerce platforms in China.
According to the e-commerce industry content ecosystem health index ranking in the above report, Douyin E-commerce, Kuaishou, Taobao, Pinduoduo, and JD.com are in the top five.
The report suggests that the content ecosystem in the e-commerce industry is a comprehensive concept that integrates e-commerce with content. However, not all content can be integrated with e-commerce. Good PGC (Professionally Generated Content) and UGC (User Generated Content) are the high-quality carriers for integration with e-commerce. The higher the value of the content platform, the richer the scenarios for consumption and promotion, the higher the possibility of e-commerce implantation, and the stronger the commercial value. The proportion of e-commerce content production and content consumption in this gradually integrated public and private domain will also be higher.
At the event, Yu Guoming, a professor at the School of Journalism and Communication at Beijing Normal University and the chairman of the China Media Economics and Management Committee, provided an analysis and interpretation of the report.
He stated that in terms of content value, the current e-commerce industry has transitioned from the "consumer accessibility" stage to the "consumer quality" stage, and high-quality, professional, differentiated content is the "hard currency" of the e-commerce industry.
At the same time, content has become the foundation and focus of the new stage of e-commerce development, with paid knowledge, professional knowledge, and KOL (Key Opinion Leaders) and other PGC content starting to become standard in e-commerce live broadcasts.
Looking towards the future development of the e-commerce industry, Yu Guoming proposed two suggestions.
One perspective is to promote the overall improvement of the health and quality of the e-commerce content ecosystem from the perspective of content structure enhancement, to create positive content creation and management standards, and to achieve a dynamic balance of the health system index of the e-commerce industry content ecosystem.
Another perspective is from the external ecology, to achieve the healthy development of the content e-commerce industry and the value synergy and co-creation of the external environment.
"The future of e-commerce still needs more support in terms of data and artificial intelligence to form predictions for stable future development; in addition, it needs to provide merchants with a more standardized and healthy growth space, to achieve value synergy among enterprises, users, products and services in the e-commerce industry, and to jointly create a healthy content ecosystem."

Xinhua News Agency commentator: Promoting modernization with Chinese characteristics is a systematic project - Four discussions on deeply understanding General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the study and implementation of the spirit of the 20th Party Congress - China News Network.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th - Title: Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project - the fourth discussion on deeply understanding General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speech at the opening ceremony of the study and implementation of the spirit of the 20th Party Congress seminar.
Xinhua News Agency commentator
Promoting Chinese-style modernization is a systematic project that requires overall planning, systematic planning, and overall advancement. It is necessary to properly handle a series of major relationships such as top-level design and practical exploration, strategy and tactics, adherence to principles and innovation, efficiency and fairness, vitality and order, self-reliance and opening up to the outside world.
At the opening ceremony of the seminar for the study and implementation of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era and the spirit of the 20th Party Congress by the new members and alternate members of the Central Committee and the main leaders of the provincial and ministerial levels, General Secretary Xi Jinping scientifically grasped the laws of modernization construction, deeply and systematically clarified a series of major relationships that need to be handled well in practice, providing us with a scientific methodology to vigorously promote modernization with Chinese characteristics.
Promoting modernization with Chinese characteristics involves various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society, and ecological civilization. It relates to the governance of the party, the country, and the military, domestic and foreign affairs, and defense. It requires both systematic planning and the courage to reform and innovate, continuously achieving overall progress.
To carry out top-level design, it is necessary to deeply understand the world's development trends, accurately grasp the common aspirations of the people, deeply explore the laws of economic and social development, and make the formulated plans and policy systems reflect the characteristics of the times, grasp the regularity, and be creative, achieving a combination of near and far, top-down coherence, and content coordination.
Promoting modernization in the Chinese style is an exploratory endeavor, with many unknown areas that need to be boldly explored in practice, and the development of the cause needs to be promoted through reform and innovation, and we must not stick to old ways or wait for opportunities to come.
Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party or a country.
To advance modernization with Chinese characteristics, we need to enhance the foresight of our strategy, using scientific strategic foresight to anticipate and lead the future; we need to enhance the overall nature of our strategy, focusing on solving major issues that affect the rise and fall of the Party and the country's cause, and that have far-reaching implications; we need to enhance the stability of our strategy, once a strategy is formed, we must persist in the long term, stick to it, and do it well.
To scientifically grasp the dialectical unity of strategy and tactics, to organically combine the principled nature of strategy and the flexibility of tactics, to be flexible and adaptable, to make decisions on the spot, and to take the initiative in strategy by adapting to local conditions, responding to situations, and acting in accordance with the trend.
The Chinese nation is a nation that upholds tradition and fosters innovation.
In managing the relationship between upholding tradition and promoting innovation, we must steadfastly adhere to the essence, essential requirements, and major principles of Chinese-style modernization, ensuring its correct direction, while also placing innovation at the forefront of national development. We must meet the demands of the times, focus on solving major theoretical and practical problems, actively adapt to changes, vigorously promote reform and innovation, continuously create new momentum and advantages for development, and fully stimulate the creative vitality of the whole society.
Efficiency is an important foundation of fairness, and fairness is a strong guarantee of efficiency.
In advancing Chinese-style modernization, we aim to create efficiency higher than that of capitalism, while more effectively maintaining social fairness, and better achieving a balance, mutual promotion, and unity between efficiency and fairness.
Manage the relationship between efficiency and fairness, continuously achieve development for the people, development relying on the people, and the results of development shared by the people, allowing the benefits of modernization to be more equitably enjoyed by all.
To promote modernization in the Chinese style, it is necessary to balance vitality and order, making society both vibrant and stable.
It is necessary to coordinate development and security, implement a comprehensive national security concept, improve the national security system, enhance the ability to maintain national security, and firmly safeguard the security of national political power, system, ideology, and key areas.
While considering safety factors more in development, enhancing national security strength through development, and using the results of development to solidify the foundation of national security, it is also good at creating a safe environment conducive to economic and social development, constantly stimulating development vitality, and achieving a positive interaction between high-quality development and high-level security.
To promote modernization with Chinese characteristics, we must both persist in our own path and broaden our global perspective, persist in opening up to the outside world, and continuously expand the breadth and depth of modernization with Chinese characteristics.
We must adhere to independence and self-reliance, insist on basing the development of the nation and the people on our own strength, and firmly hold the destiny of our country's development and progress in our own hands.
We must continuously expand high-level openness to the outside world, deeply participate in global industrial division and cooperation, make good use of both domestic and international resources, expand the development space of Chinese-style modernization, and share development opportunities and create a better future in mutual benefit and win-win cooperation.
Only by following the path can one go far.
Under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, and guided by the scientific principles of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, let us grasp the laws, persevere, fully exert our initiative and creativity, correctly handle a series of major relationships, strive to make progress on the new journey of fully building a modern socialist country, and continuously open up new horizons for modernization with Chinese characteristics.
The Biden administration on Friday (February 10) blacklisted six Chinese entities suspected of involvement in a spy balloon program, according to Deutsche Welle Chinese.
The US Department of Commerce stated that these five Chinese companies and one research institution have helped modernize the Chinese military, particularly in aerospace projects, including airships and aircraft.
Companies on the blacklist have difficulty obtaining technology exports from the United States.
The list is known as the "entity list," and companies on it cannot purchase technology or goods from U.S. suppliers unless they obtain a special export license from the U.S. Department of Commerce.
The companies listed on the blacklist are: Beijing Nanjiang Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd., China Electronics Technology Group's 48th Research Institute, Dongguan Lingkong Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd., Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd., Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd., and Shanxi Yingmen Aviation Technology Group Co., Ltd.
Prior to this, the White House had indicated it was considering broader measures to "expose and address" larger-scale surveillance activities by China that threatened US national security.
The balloon incident further escalated tensions between China and the United States, leading US Secretary of State Blinken to cancel his trip to China.
On February 4th, the United States shot down a balloon, leading the Chinese government to lodge a serious protest with the US embassy in China, criticizing the US for seriously undermining and damaging the efforts and progress towards stable Sino-US relations.
From the existing wreckage evidence and information from China's military procurement platform, the US government concluded that the manufacturer of the balloon had a direct relationship with the Chinese People's Liberation Army and was an approved supplier for the Chinese military.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stated at a press conference on Friday that China has repeatedly explained the situation and clarified its position regarding an incident where a Chinese unmanned civilian airship accidentally entered US airspace due to force majeure.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, she added that the relevant resolutions of the US Congress were purely political manipulation and hype.
China strongly disapproves and firmly opposes this.
Matthew Axelrod, the Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the U.S. Department of Commerce, said: "Today's action demonstrates our joint efforts to identify and stop China's use of spy balloons that violate the airspace of the United States and more than 40 other countries."
" "
A Reuters report stated that an employee of Guangzhou Tianhaixiang Aviation Technology Co., Ltd. claimed to be unaware of the sanctions and refused to comment further.
The Chinese Embassy in the United States has not yet commented on this information.

Several days have passed since the earthquake in parts of Turkey and Syria, and the hope of finding survivors is fading. However, the rescue of a family of five on Saturday brought immense relief to the rescuers. (Deutsche Welle Chinese Network)
According to the Associated Press, a family of five was successfully rescued after being trapped under the rubble for more than five days in the heavily affected town of Nurdai in Gaziantep province.
Rescue workers first pulled the mother and daughter from the rubble, then found the father, but he insisted on rescuing his son and another daughter first.
When they were all rescued, cheers erupted from the crowd.
In the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras, a 16-year-old boy and a 70-year-old woman were successfully rescued under harsh cold weather conditions.
What day is it today?
"This," asked the boy who had been trapped under the rubble for 129 hours after being brought back to the surface by his rescuers.

The miraculous success of the rescue operation brought a glimmer of hope to the originally bleak search and rescue work, but at the same time, the number of casualties continued to rise.
According to official statistics, the earthquake on Monday has already caused over 20,000 deaths in Turkey, with the death toll in neighbouring Syria estimated to be over 3,500.
Despite experts stating that a person could survive for more than a week after being trapped in rubble, the hope of finding more survivors has become increasingly slim.
Rescue workers are still using thermal imaging cameras to search for signs of life under the rubble.
At the same time, the focus of the rescue efforts began to shift towards helping those survivors who were in urgent need of assistance.

Cai Qi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, attended the graduation ceremony and delivered a concluding speech.

We must strive to master the theoretical skills of Marxism, consciously arm our minds with the party's innovative theories, guide practice, and promote work. We must put effort into deep learning, careful understanding, and diligent practice, truly learning firm belief, absolute loyalty, and a sense of mission.
We must implement the decisions and plans of the Party's 20th Congress with a spirit of striving and dedication, solidly promote modernization with Chinese characteristics, roll up our sleeves and work hard, throw ourselves into the role of "construction team leader", and turn the blueprint into reality step by step.
We must always remember that the comprehensive and strict governance of the party is always on the road, and the self-revolution of the party is always on the road. We must tighten and implement the political responsibility of the comprehensive and strict governance of the party, take the political construction of the party as the guide, and deeply promote the new great project of the party's construction in the new era.
To enhance the ability to promote high-quality development, serve the public, and prevent and resolve risks, we must vigorously promote the spirit of investigation and research, and resolutely prevent and overcome formalism and bureaucracy.

Google AI chatbot "answers question incorrectly," parent company's stock value evaporates by hundreds of billions of dollars.
(Comprehensive news from the 11th)
Google's newly launched AI chatbot, Bard, had a poor start, "answering questions incorrectly" in promotional videos, causing Alphabet's stock price to plummet by 8.9% on Wednesday, falling below the $100 mark, and evaporating $110 billion in market value (approximately 476.5 billion ringgit), closing at $94.57 on Friday.
The market is worried that Alphabet is not as competitive as its rival Microsoft.
According to a Reuters report, Google earlier posted a promotional video on social media for its AI chatbot Bard, in which someone asked Bard, "What new discoveries about the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can I tell my 9-year-old child?"
In his response, Bard mentioned that the telescope had taken the first photo of an exoplanet in the solar system.
However, according to data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the first photo of an exoplanet was taken by the European Southern Observatory's "Very Large Telescope" in 2004.
Reuters reported with the headline "Alphabet stock plummets after Bard answers incorrectly."
On the other hand, Google pointed out that Bard's response "highlighted the importance of rigorous testing processes," and would combine external feedback with its own internal testing to ensure Bard's response "meets high standards in terms of quality, safety, and accurate information."
Singapore's tourism industry rebounds strongly with a 19-fold increase in inbound tourists compared to 2021.
The Singapore Tourism Board recently announced that it expects the number of international visitors to Singapore to reach 12 to 14 million by 2023, bringing in about 18 to 21 billion Singapore dollars in tourism revenue; the number of visitors and tourism revenue will recover to about 67% to 75% of the levels before the 2019 coronavirus pandemic; there is a high possibility of a full recovery in the tourism industry by 2024.
In 2022, the Singapore tourism market gradually restarted and recovered.
The latest statistics released by the Singapore Tourism Board show that the number of inbound tourists in 2022 increased 19 times from 330,600 in 2021 to 6.3 million, surpassing the board's earlier estimate of 4 to 6 million. Tourism has now recovered to 33% of pre-pandemic levels.
From January to September 2022, Singapore's tourism revenue totaled 8.96 billion Singapore dollars. It is estimated that the total tourism revenue for 2022 can reach 13.8 to 14.3 billion Singapore dollars, an increase of 6 to 7 times compared to 1.89 billion Singapore dollars in 2021, and has recovered to about 50% to 52% of the level before the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019.
The Singapore government has taken multiple measures to accelerate the recovery of the tourism industry.
In April 2022, the government announced a grant of nearly 500 million Singapore dollars to stimulate the recovery of the tourism industry.
The tourism board recently announced plans to allocate 110 million Singapore dollars from its budget over the next two years to introduce more commercial and leisure activities to attract tourists back.
In order to make health and wellness a highlight of Singapore's tourism, the Singapore Tourism Board launched an intention solicitation event on November 23, 2022, planning to develop a health and wellness attraction on the southern coast of Singapore.
Wang Lingli, the Executive Director of Sports and Wellness Tourism at the Singapore Tourism Board, said that in recent years, more and more tourists are putting their health first in their considerations.
The development of a health and wellness attraction in the Marina South area, which includes the Gardens by the Bay and the Marina Barrage, is expected to contribute to Singapore's tourism industry and economy, encouraging tourists to spend and stay longer in Singapore.
The Director of the Singapore Tourism Board, Chen Jianlong, stated that health and wellness will become an important part of Singapore's tourism products in the coming years.
The COVID-19 pandemic has increased public awareness and demand for physical and mental health.
For this reason, the tourism bureau has been promoting health and wellness programs to the local public and international tourists for the past two years.
In June 2022, the Singapore Tourism Board held its first Health and Wellness Festival, offering the public over 130 different health activities and experiences.
Singapore will continue to provide new travel experiences for tourists.
In addition to the newly opened Singapore Children's Museum, Avatar World at Gardens by the Bay, Central Beach Market at Sentosa, the new "Exploring New Territories" exhibition hall at the ArtScience Museum, and the new open-air theatre at the Night Safari, the Tourism Board will support the development and renewal of projects such as the Bird Park at Wildlife Reserves Singapore, making Singapore an attractive international travel destination.
According to the plan, Singapore will establish industry standards for the sustainable development of the meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) sector within 2023, with a focus on improving waste management and carbon emissions, further optimizing the tourism environment.
The recovery of Singapore's tourism industry accelerated the recovery of the aviation industry.
Data shows that as of December 18, 2022, passenger traffic at Changi Airport has strongly recovered, with as many as 150,000 passengers received daily, about 1 million per week, which is approximately 75% of the pre-COVID-19 level. The number of aviation industry employees on duty has also recovered to about 90% of the pre-pandemic level.
Data shows that from January to October 2022, Singapore has already received 23.6 million visitors, equivalent to 42% of the pre-COVID-19 level, with 170,000 flights taking off and landing, which is 53% of the pre-pandemic level.
The rapid recovery of the tourism industry also drove the recovery of the accommodation, transportation, catering, and shopping industries.
The Singapore government and tourism industry have high hopes for the Chinese market.
The Assistant Director of the International Department of the Singapore Tourism Board, Ke Shudan, said that a survey by a Chinese travel platform showed that Singapore's safety index ranked in the top three globally, which is one of the reasons why Singapore is popular among Chinese tourists.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 3.6 million people from China traveled to Singapore for vacation each year.
With China relaxing its border policies, it is expected that the number of Chinese tourists this year can recover to between 30% and 60% of the 2019 levels.
Ko Shu-tan pointed out that the tourism bureau will closely monitor China's signals for further relaxation of outbound travel policies to respond to changes in tourist demand.
In addition to strengthening partnerships with Chinese online travel platforms and travel agencies such as Ctrip, the Singapore Tourism Board is actively preparing to welcome Chinese tourists in response to new trends in outbound travel from China.
Looking ahead to the 2023 tourism market, the Singapore Tourism Board is confident that as long as there is no significant economic downturn affecting public income, and no new widespread deadly epidemics, the recovery of the tourism industry will be faster than expected.

She gently cradled her father's cheeks with her hands and even touched his chest, with the father-daughter interaction being broadcast nationwide.
However, the First Lady, Li Xue, could only step aside.
According to reports from South Korea's "Chosun News" and others, Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju brought their daughter Kim Ju-ae to a banquet on the 7th. In the official group photo, Kim Ju-ae not only sat in the middle between her parents, but also joined Kim Jong-un on the podium at the 75th anniversary military parade the next evening.
The North Korean official media "Korean Central Television" later released parade footage, revealing more scenes of deep father-daughter affection.
Kim Jong-un exchanged glances with his daughter several times on the podium, their smiles never fading, and they whispered to each other. At one point, Kim's daughter cupped her father's cheeks with her hands, to which Kim Jong-un responded with a bright smile.
Other official media images also showed Kim Yo-jong sitting with Kim Jong-un on an indoor sofa, constantly touching her father's face with her hand; when she walked hand in hand with her father, she touched Kim Jong-un's chest with her hand.
The First Lady, Li Xue, could only walk behind or sit aside throughout the process, always a few steps away from her husband and daughter.
Korean media pointed out that since Kim Jong Un's first public appearance during the Mars-17 missile test on November 18 last year, his exposure has been increasing over the past three months, and this is already his fifth appearance at an official event.
When North Korean state media mentioned Kim Jong-un, they used extremely high honorifics such as "most beloved brother" and "noble brother", and also broadcast clips of Kim Jong-un repeatedly shouting pledges of allegiance to the Baekdu bloodline from the viewing stand during the parade.
These signs led to speculation that Kim Jo Ai had been designated as the successor to the Kim regime. The Washington Post analyzed that "this is a signal that Kim Jong Un is pushing his teenage daughter into the position of successor," but there are also views that such a judgment is still premature, and in the situation where Kim Jong Un has a son, all possibilities are still preserved.
Chongyang Q&A: How to view the US non-farm employment data in January greatly exceeding expectations and future trends - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
Q: How does Chongyang Investment view the significantly better-than-expected non-farm employment data in the US in January and its future trend?
On February 3rd, the U.S. Department of Labor announced the non-farm employment data for January 2023, with an increase of 517,000 non-farm jobs, significantly higher than the market expectation of 189,000; the unemployment rate dropped to 3.4%, the lowest in nearly 50 years; the year-on-year wage growth was 4.4%, and the month-on-month growth was 0.3%, slightly slowing down.
In terms of the total amount, this data is subject to many one-time and technical factors, such as returning striking teachers, revisions to the survey statistical caliber, updates to the seasonal adjustment factor, and may be revised in the future (refer to the January 2022 non-farm payroll revision from 504,000 to 364,000). Non-farm employment may not be as strong as the data suggests.
Structurally, the impact of layoffs in high-tech companies is still present, but the proportion is relatively low; high-contact service industries such as leisure hotels, education and healthcare have seen a significant rebound in new employment, and data shows that there is still a labor gap in the service industry.
Given the equally larger-than-expected rise in service sector PMI, job vacancies, labor shortage data, and strong consumer credit data, we judge that the US service sector has experienced a rapid recovery after extreme weather and holidays.
We believe that it is difficult to improve the tension between supply and demand in the US job market without going through a recession.
Currently, there is still a supply gap of over 5 million in the US labor market, and the labor participation rate is rising slowly, especially the labor participation rate of 25-54 year olds, which is close to the pre-pandemic peak.
In addition, due to the strength of excess savings and consumer credit among US residents, strong consumer demand will further delay the impact of austerity policies on the job market.
The continued tension in the US job market supply and demand will be the underlying tone of the US economy in 2023.
With the current overlay nearing the end of rate hikes and inflation expectations constantly fluctuating, we are not optimistic about the continuous decline in wage growth.
Before the data was released, the US stock, bond, and foreign exchange markets were overly optimistic about the Federal Reserve's interest rate hike path.
With the continuous improvement of inflation data, the Federal Reserve has been maintaining a delicate balance of fragile market inflation expectations while shortening the pace of interest rate hikes. However, the market has turned a blind eye to the Fed's hawkish rhetoric, not only expecting an early halt to rate hikes, but also expecting two rate cuts by the end of the year.
In a labor market with tight supply and demand, and unclear effects of tightening policies, we believe that the Federal Reserve's guidance on interest rate hikes at the end of the year is relatively reasonable. The adjustment of extreme market expectations and crowded trading may cause some damage to the market.
Despite this, the stubbornness of wage growth is difficult to change the current trend of rapid decline in inflation. With the year-on-year M2 data turning negative and the gradual improvement of various CPI sub-item leading indicators, the US CPI data has entered a rapid decline stage since October. The stubbornness of wage growth will only form a bottom for future inflation data. The current market expectations are difficult to falsify, and the market may enter a new round of game after the next inflation data is released.
The founder of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang, passed away due to a sudden heart disease. He once led the transformation of China's first clothing stock - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website.
On February 11, a WeChat public account certified by Shanshan Holdings Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Shanshan Holdings") announced the death of Zheng Yonggang, the founder of Shanshan Enterprises and chairman of the board of directors of Shanshan Holdings. Zheng passed away on February 10, 2023, due to a sudden heart disease, at the age of 65, reported by Zheng Yuxin, a journalist from Economic Observer.
In the 1980s, Zheng Yonggang served as the director of a state-owned cotton spinning factory, and with his transfer, he became the director of Ningbo Yungang Garment Factory, the predecessor of Shanshan Shares, in 1989.
In December 2022, at the 20th China Business Leaders Annual Meeting and the 22nd China Future Stars Annual Meeting, Zheng Yonggang stated in his speech that in the Chinese suit market of the 1990s, the market share of the Shanshan brand once reached as high as 37%.
In 1996, Shanshan Shares (600884.SH) went public, becoming the first listed company in China's clothing industry.
Just as the clothing business was booming, the Shanshan Group began to transform, because Zheng Yonggang realized that "once the market is opened up, Chinese brands will naturally form a tiered brand market, and the possibility of Shanshan suits always leading the trend and becoming the national dress of the Chinese people in the long term is not great."
In 1999, Shanshan began researching corporate transformation. Zheng Yonggang recalled, "We came to Shanghai to figure out what to do with the transformation. We specifically sought out many experts and scholars, and continuously held some Zhuge Liang meetings and theoretical seminars."
Finally, we have set two major strategic directions.
The first direction is new energy and new materials, and the other is "great health has a future".
After determining the strategic direction, Shanshan began to look for cooperation. At that time, Anshan Thermal Energy Institute, a carbon research institute supporting Ansteel, was conducting a national 863 project with insufficient research funding. Therefore, Shanshan signed a cooperation agreement with Anshan Thermal Energy Institute Carbon Research Institute to jointly promote the industrialization of the national 863 project "Intermediate Phase Carbon Microsphere" project, engage in the research and development, production and sales of negative electrode materials, and promote the commercial use of negative electrode materials domestically.
In 2001, Shanshan Co., Ltd. achieved large-scale production of mesophase pitch microspheres, began domestic substitution, and replaced Japan as the main supplier of mesophase pitch microspheres in China.
This is the first Chinese company to produce anode materials for lithium-ion batteries, achieving the domestic production of these materials.
With the rapid popularization of lithium batteries, Sunsun Shares' lithium battery business began to gradually develop. In 2007, the lithium battery material business was written into Sunsun Shares' main business, and the proportion of clothing business revenue decreased year by year, until 2013, when the revenue from Sunsun Shares' lithium battery material business fully surpassed the clothing business.
In February 2021, Shanshan Co., Ltd. successfully acquired LG Chem's polarizer business, entered the LCD polarizer market, and established the polarizer company Shangjin Optoelectronics. The technology in this field is relatively advanced, and Shanshan's main competitors are Fortune 500 companies such as Samsung from South Korea, Sumitomo Chemical from Japan, and Nitto Denko.
Zheng Yonggang once shared his insights on post-investment management, "Why do acquisitions of some high-tech companies internationally by China's private enterprises have a relatively low success rate? Why do those acquisitions fail?
"Everyone would consider, 'I've spent so much money, I need to send someone to manage it, right?' This is a common behavior," however, Zheng Yonggang was different. On the day of the successful acquisition of Shanshan, Zheng Yonggang publicly announced at Shanjing Optoelectronics that Shanshan, as the major shareholder of Shanjing, decided to implement a 'one enterprise, two systems' policy. Apart from Zheng Yonggang serving as the chairman, no one from Shanshan Enterprises would be sent to Shanjing. They would adopt an authorized management approach, and the original distribution system, corporate culture, and various management models would remain unchanged.
ICC Xinlu Information released negative pole data for 2022, showing that Shanshan's negative pole shipments exceeded 200,000 tons in 2022, an increase of 100% year-on-year, with a market share of 16%. The shipment volume of synthetic graphite negative pole materials remained at the top.
In the polarizer business, Yano Research statistics show that the company's subsidiary, Sugimoto Optoelectronics, reached a global market share of 29% in 2022, and it is expected to reach 32% in 2023, continuing to rank first in the world.
In the first three quarters of 2022, Shanshan Co., Ltd.'s revenue was 15.841 billion yuan, with a net profit of 2.313 billion yuan. On February 10, the stock price of Shanshan Co., Ltd. was 19.24 yuan per share, with a total market value of 43.6 billion yuan.
On February 9th, Sunshine Holdings stated on its interactive platform that by the end of 2022, the company's effective graphite production capacity will be about 100,000 tons, and the graphite production capacity of the Meishan project is still ramping up.
According to Wind, Zheng Yonggang is still the chairman and actual controller of Shanshan Shares.
According to Tianyancha, Zheng Yonggang holds 40.1% of the total shares in Shanshan Holdings Limited.
The general manager of Shanshan Shares is Li Zhihua, born in 1968, who has served as the chairman of Dongguan Shanshan Battery Materials Co., Ltd., Ningbo Shanshan New Material Technology Co., Ltd., Hunan Shanshan Energy Technology Co., Ltd., and the deputy general manager of Ningbo Shanshan Co., Ltd.
On February 10, Suning Shares stated on the investor interaction platform that there is no kinship between the company's senior management and the actual controller of the company.
"The Fund E-Account is here: The Securities Regulatory Commission authorizes development - Investors can aggregate and query all funds under their name - Economic Observer Network - Professional Financial News Website"
Is the complexity of fund purchasing channels leading to difficulties in account information collection? - Economic Observer Network reporter Chen Shan.
Always forgetting the "petty cash"?
These issues of the citizens are about to be resolved.
On February 10th, the Securities Regulatory Commission announced that the "Fund E-account" APP was launched and began public beta testing in various mobile app stores.
The "Fund E-account" provides individual investors with a "one-stop" inquiry service for public fund accounts and share information, aiming to solve the industry service pain points such as forgotten accounts and cumbersome inquiries for the majority of small and medium investors.
According to Wind data, by the end of 2022, there were 156 public fund managers in China, managing approximately 26 trillion yuan in funds; there were 167 public fund share registration institutions and 411 public fund sales institutions.
The share registration agency account systems are independent of each other, lacking a unified industry query channel.
Industry insiders have stated that by the end of 2021, China had over 720 million fund investors, meaning that half of the country's population had invested in fund products.
Previously, investors had to inquire about purchase conditions through different sales agencies, but with the "Fund E-account", they can check the conditions of all purchases through all sales channels, making the status of fund holdings clear at a glance.
What is the "Fund E Account" APP?
According to related documents, the "Fund E Account" APP is a mobile application for the public fund industry developed and built by China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation with the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission. It can provide investors with a one-stop query of the off-market shareholding situation of all market public fund products.
Investors can conveniently and quickly grasp their holdings of public fund products under various fund managers purchased through all market sales channels through the "Fund E-account", greatly improving the efficiency of inquiries.
Specifically, the information that investors can query through the "Fund E-account" includes: the fund account information opened at all public fund managers in the market, the trading account information opened at public fund sales institutions, and the off-market shareholding situation of products including publicly raised securities investment funds and collective asset management plans set up and managed by securities companies, where the number of investors is not limited to 200.
Liu Yiqian, the head of the Shanghai Securities Fund Evaluation Research Center, told reporters from the Economic Observer that investors can use the "Fund E-account" App to get a one-stop understanding of all their off-market public fund holdings, helping them to retrieve "forgotten assets". More importantly, it provides a comprehensive collection of all account information on fund investments, helping customers to grasp their own investment situation more timely, accurately, and completely, thereby better optimizing their own fund portfolio allocation and better planning their own financial arrangements.
How to register for use?
Reporters noted that the "Fund E-account" APP is currently available in Huawei, Apple, Xiaomi, OPPO, Vivo and other mobile app stores, but the APP is still in the public trial operation stage, registration requires an invitation code, and investors can contact the fund manager of the funds they hold to obtain it.
A customer service representative from a medium to large public fund in Shanghai provided a six-digit invitation code to a reporter from Economic Observer Online, and said, "During the APP trial operation stage, China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation provides a certain number of invitation codes to each fund manager. When investors call to get them, we will provide them."
After the trial run is over, users can register without needing an invitation code.
" "
A journalist registered and completed a search based on the "Fund E-account" download and usage instructions related documents displayed on the official website of the Securities Regulatory Commission. The whole process took only a few minutes and mainly consisted of four steps: user registration, real-name authentication, fund account binding, and public fund inquiry.
After completing the real-name authentication, by clicking the "Asset" fund binding button, all the fund products purchased by the reporter through various fund sales platforms are presented in the binding option list (accounts that can be bound). After completing the binding, you can intuitively see the total assets of the invested funds and start using the query function.
It is worth noting that the "Fund E-account" only provides inquiry services for investors and cannot carry out subscription and redemption transactions.
The data displayed in the "Fund E Account" is generally dated three trading days prior to the date of the user's query (T day).
For example, if you open the "Fund E-account" on February 10th, the total assets, fund shares, and net value of the fund displayed on the asset page correspond to the date three trading days prior, which is February 7th.

The US, Japan, and the Philippines reach a defense consensus against the Chinese Communist Party.
Asia - On February 9, Philippine President Bongbong Marcos visited Japan and met with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.
Both sides reached a consensus on opposing the CCP's infringement of the South China Sea and the East China Sea. After the meeting, the leaders of the Philippines and Japan issued a joint statement stating that they would conduct substantive defense exchanges through the signing of a tripartite defense agreement with the United States, opposing the CCP's hegemonic policy.
According to Japanese media, Fumio Kishida hopes that this meeting will help Japan and the Philippines establish policies for the Taiwan Strait crisis.
In early January of this year, Marcos Jr. visited China and secured agreements worth 20 billion dollars.
But after this, not only did Sino-Philippine relations not improve, they actually deteriorated.
Earlier this month, the Philippines signed an agreement with the United States to open more bases to US forces, ensuring the security of the South China Sea.
A newly added base is 300 kilometers away from Taiwan, which is also the closest location to China.
If a crisis occurs in Taiwan, the US military may launch operations from its bases in the Philippines.
Japanese media believe that Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Australia, and even the Philippines have now formed an axis with the United States, constructing a "counter-CCP arc" in the Western Pacific to promote regional cooperation.
Kuomintang Vice Chairman Xia Liyan conveyed Song Tao's message during his visit to China: under the 1992 Consensus, the Green Camp is welcome to visit the mainland.
The Vice Chairman of the Kuomintang of Taiwan, Xia Liyan, met with the Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People's Republic of China, Song Tao, and the Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China, Wang Huning, during his visit to China.
In an interview with Taiwan's Central News Agency last night, Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT's official organization, the National Policy Foundation, positively evaluated Song Tao's statement to Xia Liyan, saying that as long as they recognize the "1992 Consensus" and oppose Taiwan independence, mainland China welcomes visits from the Green Camp.
The Kuomintang considered it a novelty.
The news of the day did not mention this statement when Xia Liyan met with Song Tao earlier.
The ruling Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan has been clarifying its refusal to accept the "1992 Consensus" in recent days.
According to Central News Agency today, the vice chairman of the Kuomintang, Xia Liyan, led a delegation to visit mainland China. During his stay in Beijing, he met with Wang Huning, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Song Tao, the new director of the Taiwan Affairs Office, and Yin Li, the secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee.
During his meeting with Song Tao, Xia Liyan discussed that the political foundation of the KMT and the CCP is the "1992 Consensus" and anti-Taiwan independence. Zhao Chunshan, a senior advisor to the KMT's National Policy Foundation, stated in the meeting that the KMT's "1992 Consensus" is the original "1992 Consensus".
Zhao Chunshan analyzed that this was different from the previous meetings he had attended.
In recent video conferences with mainland scholars, and in this discussion, there was no talk of military unification or the "Anti-Secession Law." Instead, the focus was on resuming exchanges and dialogue.
Zhao Chunshan pointed out that in the face of military tensions across the strait, mainland China hopes to convey its intention to improve relations through the Kuomintang.
Because there is no mutual trust between the people and the communists, the other side is still willing to do a good job for the people of Taiwan, indicating that they do not want cross-strait relations to deteriorate.
According to Zhao Chunshan, Wang Huning personally instructed Song Tao, saying "You must implement the demands raised by them (Taiwanese farmers and fishermen). If you can't solve everything, you should handle it on a case-by-case basis."
The report did not mention whether the Kuomintang visitors to the mainland had directly addressed the daily harassment of Taiwan by Chinese military aircraft and ships, the agricultural and fishing issues in a few counties and cities in Taiwan, and whether the Central News Agency reporters had asked such questions.
The French unions mobilize again against the government's retirement reform plan in a large march.
On Saturday (February 11), French unions once again launched a nationwide mobilization against the government's pension reform bill, calling on the public to take to the streets to express their opinions.
This was the fourth day of action in the social movement against the government's proposed pension reform bill.
The number of people who respond to the call for a rally could potentially influence the next course of action for union groups.
This was the fourth nationwide mobilization jointly initiated by France's eight major trade unions in a month, and the first time the protest activities were scheduled for a Saturday.
Given that for most French people, Saturday is a day off, they do not need to choose between participating in protest demonstrations or losing wages due to a strike. Therefore, union groups hope that today's rally can attract more participants.
The unions of the bus system, subway, and public railway companies did not call for a strike today, so the bus system should operate normally. Citizens can take the bus to the rally site, and in areas where schools have started winter vacation, people can start their holidays as usual.
Union groups hoped that over a million people would attend the rally today, while police estimated national attendance could be between 600,000 and 800,000, with between 90,000 and 120,000 people possibly gathering in central Paris.
Since the start of the anti-government pension reform protests, although polls show that the majority of French people do not support the measure to delay the legal retirement age from the current 62 to 64, the number of people actually taking to the streets to participate in marches has gradually decreased.
The first strike demonstration on January 31 rallied between 1.27 million to 2.5 million people nationwide.
However, the number of demonstrators this Tuesday (February 7th) has shrunk to between 757,000 and 2 million people nationwide.
The pension reform proposal is currently being discussed in the French National Assembly.
The opposition, especially the radical left-wing opposition, submitted countless amendments, slowing down the review process significantly.
The debate between the ruling and opposition parties is becoming increasingly intense and sharp.
A member of the radical left-wing party France Unbowed recently posted a picture on social media of himself stepping on a balloon with the image of the Minister of Labor, sparking protests from the ruling party.
The Speaker of the National Assembly ultimately announced a 15-day ban on this member participating in parliamentary activities as a punishment for this behavior.
Despite this reform proposal sparking the largest social movement in France in over 20 years, the government has so far made only minor adjustments to the draft and has not made any significant concessions.
The union is prepared to take action again on Thursday the 16th, and plans to organize a demonstration on March 7th when the reform bill is submitted to the Senate for discussion.
China encourages increasing birth rates, urging high-quality sperm donations in universities.
The Human Sperm Bank of Yunnan Province, China, issued a call on the 9th for donations from individuals with a college degree or higher, or current students. Successful donors who donate 8 to 12 times can receive a subsidy of 4500 yuan.
According to Taiwanese media reports today, the message topped the Weibo hot search list that day, and sparked follow-up initiatives in many provinces and cities such as Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong and Beijing.
According to a report by the Liberty Times, China is encouraging university students to donate sperm.
Among all the universities where sperm donation takes place, Beijing has the highest requirements. In addition to education, they also require a height of over 170 cm, regular facial features, no obvious hair loss, and nearsightedness not exceeding 600 degrees.
According to the report, the Yunnan Province Human Sperm Bank stated that sperm donors could receive a full set of men's health check-ups worth 1000 RMB, "especially semen and chromosome tests, which most people have never done before, are of great significance for understanding their own fertility status."
The conditions for sperm donors include being over 165 cm tall, having a college degree or higher or currently studying, and not having genetic diseases or infectious diseases such as color blindness or hepatitis B.
Reports cited China's Tianmu News as saying that the Shaanxi Province Human Sperm Bank had printed promotional posters with the slogan "Paid sperm donation, unlimited glory," calling on young people to respond to sperm donation and encouraging netizens to forward related information, "to pass on the love."
In Shaanxi province, the price is higher than in Yunnan, with qualified individuals receiving 300 RMB in cash each time, and those who complete a certain number of donations can receive a subsidy of 5000 RMB.
The highest known subsidy is currently in Beijing, with a maximum subsidy of 5150 RMB.
The last East German Communist Prime Minister has passed away.
The successor to the East German Communist Party reported in a statement that "Last night, Hans Modrow left us at the age of 95."
Therefore, our party has lost an important leader.
" "
On November 13, 1989, four days after the Berlin Wall, which had separated East and West Berlin for 28 years, was opened, Modrow stated that he would help transform East Germany into a democratic country.
At that time, due to protesters across East Germany demanding democracy and freedom, the Communist Party leaders were forced to step down.
After coming to power in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev called for reforms in Eastern Europe under Soviet leadership.
In March 1990, Modrow announced the first and only free elections in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).
The election results led to him no longer serving as Prime Minister.
Despite Modrow's reforms, opponents accused him of trying to delay the political changes and unification that occurred in October 1990.
He was also criticised for trying to reform rather than abolish the secret police.
In 1993, Modro was found guilty of election fraud in the May 1989 municipal elections, but was not imprisoned.
Some say these allegations are politically motivated.
From 1990 to 1994, Modrow continued to serve in the German Parliament, and from 1999 to 2004, he served as a member of the European Parliament.
Modrow saw himself as a reformer and hoped to change the Communist Party from within.
In 1999, he told Reuters that he did not want East Germany to return, but said that East Germany's achievements should be recognized.
Modrow was born in 1928 in the then German town of Jasenitz (now Jasienica in Poland) and received training as a mechanic.
During World War II, he served as a youth fire brigade platoon leader and became a member of the Nazi militia organization Volkssturm near the end of the conflict, which conscripted men aged 16 to 60 for the final struggle of the war.
At the age of 17, Modro was captured by the Soviet army and taken to the Soviet Union as a prisoner of war, where he attended anti-fascist courses and became a staunch communist.
In 1949, the year East Germany was established, he returned home and found a job as a mechanic, continued his studies in social sciences and economics, and earned a doctorate degree.
Modrow was a worker in the Free German Youth movement, which nearly all East German young people joined, and he rose to become the chairman of the party in the Dresden region through the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) from 1973 to 1989.
He also served in the East German parliament for over 30 years.
In 1990, Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany, holding the highest state office.
Iran commemorates revolution anniversary, hackers supporting the protest hacked the president's televised speech.
The Islamic Republic of Iran held an official rally on Saturday to commemorate the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, but anti-government hackers briefly interrupted President Ebrahim Raisi's televised speech.
The President's live television speech was interrupted on the internet for about a minute, with the screen displaying the logo of a group of anti-Iranian government hackers called "Edalat Ali (Ali Justice)."
There was also a voice shouting, "Death to the Islamic Republic."
According to a Reuters report today, Iran's commemoration of the anniversary of the revolution was interrupted by hackers disrupting the national television broadcast.
As Iran officially commemorates the 44th anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, the hardline government of Raisi faces the boldest challenge from young protesters demanding their resignation. However, Raisi still calls for the "deceived youth" to repent so they can receive the pardon of Iran's supreme leader.
Nationwide protests swept across Iran following the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in the custody of the country's morality police in September.
Iran's security forces carried out a deadly crackdown on protests, one of the most formidable challenges faced by the Islamic Republic since the 1979 revolution that overthrew 2500 years of monarchy.
As part of a general amnesty to commemorate the anniversary of the revolution, Iranian authorities released imprisoned dissident Fahad Mesami and Iranian-French scholar Fariba Adelkhah on Friday, who had been on a hunger strike.
Earlier, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a pardon, which included some prisoners arrested in recent anti-government protests.
According to a report by the human rights organization HRANA, as of Friday, 528 protesters had been killed, including 71 minors.
The report stated that an additional 70 government security personnel were killed.
It is believed that as many as 19,763 protesters were arrested.
For several weeks, Iranian leaders and official media have been urging people to vote in Saturday's rally to show opposition to protest activities and support for the government.
On the Friday night of the anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, official media showcased fireworks as part of the government-sponsored celebrations, with people chanting "Allahu Akbar!"
(God is the greatest!)
However, many people at the rally could also be heard shouting "Death to the dictator!"
"Death of the Islamic Republic" in videos posted on social media.
On Saturday, the government television station broadcast live footage of official gatherings from all over the country.
In Tehran, as part of the official celebrations, domestically produced anti-ballistic missiles, drones, anti-submarine cruisers, and other military equipment were displayed.
President Lecy's speeches were often interrupted by the slogan "Death to America" - a signature chant at state rallies.
The crowd also chanted "Death to Israel."
Reuters reported that Adelkhah, who has been in prison since 2019, is one of seven French nationals detained in Iran, a factor in the deteriorating relations between Paris and Tehran in recent months.
She was sentenced to five years in prison in 2020 on charges of national security.
They later placed her under house arrest, but she returned to prison in January.
Adelkhah denied these allegations.
A week before Mesami was released, supporters warned that he was at risk of death due to his hunger strike protest.
He was arrested in 2018 for protesting against the compulsory wearing of headscarves.
The French Foreign Ministry responded on Friday to Adelkhah's release, calling for the restoration of her freedom, "including, if she wishes, allowing her to return to France."

Did the balloon incident open America's eyes?
Strengthen restrictions on technology exports to China.
According to a report in the Wall Street Journal today, the US is preparing to further tighten technology exports to China following the balloon incident.
Current and former security officials have said that the aforementioned balloon incident highlights the national security threat posed by China, and will be used to garner more political support for strengthening US technology protection.
The United States claimed that the balloon carried antennas and sensors for intelligence gathering and communication.
According to Martijn Rasser, a former senior official at the US Central Intelligence Agency and now working at the New America Security Center, a think tank in Washington.
"This undoubtedly added fuel to the fire, supporting the views of the hardliners towards China."
White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday, "We will also consider taking broader actions to expose and address China's larger-scale surveillance activities, which pose a threat to our national security as well as our allies and partners."
"US officials have reported the balloon incident to the governments of more than 30 countries," said American officials, adding that international coordination is crucial in dealing with the threat from China.
Senior researcher Emily Benso from the Center for Strategic and International Studies said that in addition to the actions of the Biden administration, the newly established Special Committee on Strategic Competition with the Chinese Communist Party in the US House of Representatives could also pressure the US to take stricter measures to slow down China's development.
She said that members of Congress would face increasing pressure to take a tougher stance, which could in turn force the White House to adopt a more hardline policy.
The Wall Street Journal reported that many advocates for stricter export controls are also pushing to expand the scope of these controls to include industries such as artificial intelligence.
The US government is also developing a foreign investment review program to examine whether US investments abroad pose potential national security threats from China.
Analysts say the White House may face calls to roll out the plan more quickly.
Relief efforts for the Turkey-Syria earthquake continue day and night.
Since the strong earthquake in Turkey and neighboring Syria, rescue teams from dozens of countries have been working day and night in the ruins of thousands of destroyed buildings, rescuing survivors buried under the rubble.
In the freezing temperatures, they often called for silence as they strained to hear any signs of life from the rubble of the shattered concrete.
According to a Reuters report today, two more women were rescued after surviving several days in the rubble of the earthquake.
However, the death toll from the earthquake rose to 24,150 people.
The death toll in Turkey was 20,665, while in Syria it exceeded 3,500.
The 7.8 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Monday, followed by several strong aftershocks in Turkey and Syria, is the seventh deadliest natural disaster of this century, surpassing the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, and approaching the 31,000 deaths caused by the 2003 earthquake in neighbouring Iran.
A similar strong earthquake in the northwest of Turkey in 1999 resulted in the deaths of over 17,000 people.
Turkish authorities said on Saturday that two women were rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building by rescue workers in Turkey after being trapped for 122 hours, following the deadliest earthquake in the region in 20 years.
Another injured man, 55-year-old Masallah Cicek, was identified as having been rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building in Diyarbakir, the largest city in southeastern Turkey.
In the freezing temperatures, rescuers often pleaded for silence as they strained to hear any signs of life from the rubble of the shattered concrete.
In the Samandag district of Turkey, rescuers crouched under a concrete slab, whispering "Inshallah" - "God willing" - as they carefully reached into the rubble to rescue a 10-day-old newborn.
With his eyes wide open, the baby Yagiz Ulas was wrapped in a warming blanket and taken to a field hospital.
Video footage showed that the paramedics also took his mother away, who was dizzy and pale on the stretcher, but conscious.
Turkey's Vice President Fuat Oktay told reporters overnight that 67 people had been rescued from the rubble in the past 24 hours, with a total of 31,000 rescue workers deployed in the affected areas.
He said that approximately 80,000 people were being treated in hospitals, and 1.05 million people were left homeless by the earthquake, crowding into temporary shelters.
Due to many people lacking food in the cold winter conditions, there is increasing public doubt about the leaders of the two countries' responses to disaster relief.
According to Syrian official media, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his wife Asma visited a hospital in Aleppo, reportedly his first visit to the disaster area since the earthquake.
Earlier, the World Food Programme had said that its stocks in rebel-held northwestern Syria were about to run out, as the state of war made relief efforts complicated.
On Friday, Erdogan visited Adiyaman province in Turkey, where he admitted that the government's response had not been as swift as expected.
Opponents seized on this issue to attack Erdogan, who is running for re-election in the vote on May 14th, but it may be postponed due to the disaster.
Reuters reported that anger over the delay in providing aid and initiating rescue efforts could potentially impact the election.
Even before the earthquake occurred, the vote was seen as the most serious challenge to Erdogan's rule in twenty years.
Erdogan called for unity and condemned what he called "negative campaigns for political gain."
The leader of Turkey's main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, criticized the government's response.
Critics said, "The earthquake was severe, but what was even more serious was the lack of coordination, lack of planning, and incompetence."

Hanoi, Vietnam News Agency - A special correspondent reports that during his visit to Brunei Darussalam, on the morning of February 11, Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife visited the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD, also known as "University of Brunei").
The University of Brunei is the largest higher education and scientific research center in Brunei, ranking third in the local university rankings.
The University of Brunei is one of the symbols of educational cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
In July 2013, the University of Brunei officially established a partnership with FPT University in Vietnam, with the main area of cooperation being English language training.
In addition to foreign languages such as English, French, German, Japanese and Korean, the University of Brunei has also incorporated Vietnamese into its curriculum.
During his visit to the University of Brunei, Vietnamese Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and his wife interacted with students from the Vietnamese language class.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh is pleased that an increasing number of foreigners are interested in learning Vietnamese, and is actively contributing to promoting the unique culture and customs of Vietnam to the world.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng expressed his belief and hope that the team of Vietnamese language teachers at the University of Brunei would grow stronger; more and more students in the Vietnamese language class are becoming interested in Vietnamese, studying hard, hoping to use fluent Vietnamese as soon as possible, and becoming ambassadors of friendly cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
Taking this opportunity, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh also communicated with Vietnamese students studying English at the FPT-UBD Global Center in Da Nang city via video, understanding their learning situation, especially during the pandemic.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh believes that the cooperation between Vietnam's FPT University and the University of Brunei, especially the FPT-UBD Global Centre, is a vivid symbol of the educational cooperation between Vietnam and Brunei.
At the same time, it is hoped that the students of the center will make greater progress in their studies and make positive contributions to the friendly cooperation between the two countries.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly praised the achievements in educational cooperation between the two countries during his discussions with the Minister of Education and leaders of Brunei University, including the collaboration between FPT University and Brunei University, and the initiative of incorporating Vietnamese language into the curriculum at Brunei University.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng hopes that the University of Brunei will continue to focus on ensuring the quality of Vietnamese language teaching and further expand the scale of Vietnamese language classes.
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly praised the positive results of the cooperation between the two countries based on the Memorandum of Understanding on Educational Cooperation signed in April 2014; he suggested that Brunei continue to provide more scholarships and effectively carry out various short-term exchange training programs, such as the Global Discovery Programme and the Discovery Year.
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh highly appreciated the establishment of the first branch of the University of Brunei in Vietnam in Southeast Asia; he believed that the university's development scale in the region and the world is increasingly strong; and further expanded the cooperative relationship with Vietnamese higher education institutions.
On this occasion, Prime Minister Van Ming and his wife planted a commemorative tree on the campus of the University of Brunei and left a message in the commemorative book.
Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng wished for the continuous development of the University of Brunei, contributing more and more to the education of Brunei, and to carry out deeper and broader cooperation with various educational and training institutions in Vietnam.

Vietnam News Agency
Hanoi, Vietnam News Agency - Special correspondent reports that the official visit to Singapore and Brunei by Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh and his wife has been successfully completed, achieving comprehensive, pragmatic and specific results.
During his three-day visit to Singapore and Brunei, Prime Minister Fan Mingzheng participated in over 30 different activities.
The achievements have injected new momentum into the continuous development of the strategic partnership between Vietnam and the new country and the comprehensive partnership with Vietnam in a deeper, broader and more effective direction.

What exactly was the "object" that was shot down over Alaska?
It's puzzling and full of speculation.
On Friday (February 10), the US military once again used its most advanced stealth jet, the F-22, to shoot down an unidentified object flying over Alaska.
The location of the crash was ten miles off the coast of Alaska.
This was the second time in less than a week that the US military had shot down an airborne object.
Last Saturday, a spy balloon from China was destroyed over the coast of South Carolina, USA, after drifting in US airspace for several days.
The Pentagon stated that the second object that was shot down first entered US airspace on Thursday night. It was tracked by the US military as it moved over northeastern Alaska at an altitude of 12,000 meters (40,000 feet). Its size was roughly that of a small car, much smaller compared to the previous Chinese spy balloon that was shot down.
The Pentagon also believes that there are currently no signs indicating that this object is manipulable.
John Kirby, the White House National Security Council's strategic communications coordinator, said on Friday that while the exact nature of the high-flying object was unclear, it posed a "reasonable threat to civil aviation safety."
Kobe stated that this object was different from the spy balloon found within the United States, as it did not have a "payload" attached to it.
Kobe said, "Calling it an 'object' is the best description we can make at the moment."
President Biden took the advice of the Pentagon before ordering the object to be shot down, and he was "very cautious" in making this decision, Kobe added.
The official US description of the object can be roughly summarized as: the size of a small car, no control stick, no suspension device, and a flight altitude of about 10,000 meters.
But this information still cannot answer basic questions, such as what exactly this object is, which country it belongs to, and what mission it is carrying out.
Many online analyses and speculations currently suggest that this might be another Chinese balloon.
It may have originated from China, like the spy balloon that invaded US airspace and the Chinese balloon that floated over Latin America, carrying out some sort of mission at different locations.
Some people have linked this "object" in Alaska with "Unidentified Flying Objects" (UFOs).
A report by US Newsweek quoted a tweet from former US Congressman Peter Meijer on Friday saying, "I really hope this 'unidentified flying object' is also a spy balloon, not a legitimate UFO."
"The irony of confusing alien spacecraft with weather balloons is surprising, but it's not worth sparking an interstellar conflict," said Meijer.
Meijer tweeted this shortly after Kobe confirmed that the object in Alaska had been shot down.
Newsweek reported that Meje was not the only one who suspected the object to be a UFO.
Tennessee Republican Representative Tim Burchett criticized the government's cover-up of intelligence last month and called on the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to release reports on "unidentified flying objects".
The customer service attitude of Amazon is hard for me to believe.
I guess not many people will read this, but I still want to say a little bit.
The clothing we bought at the time was a zip-up hoodie, but what was finally given to me was a short-sleeved shirt.
After receiving the clothes, I immediately contacted Amazon customer service. At that time, it was confirmed that the clothes were still in stock. I requested an exchange, and the customer service said they would handle it. Then I immediately saw the product name changed to short sleeves, and the original link I bought was taken down.
Then, the customer service notified to either keep the goods and compensate a certain amount, or return the goods.
Is this how Amazon handles it?
It's really hard to believe that the wrong delivery of clothes is not my fault. As a consumer, I demand to receive the goods I should get, without making any exaggerated demands, yet Amazon changed the name and said there was no stock.
This is my first long review, I hope it's not my last.
The incomprehensible sleeve.
While it is said to be made of cowhide and is indeed quite hard, upon closer inspection, there are many small cracks in certain areas, making it unclear whether it is genuine leather. Additionally, the sleeves of this jacket are puzzling. Typically, the sleeves of a jacket are slightly longer than the hem, usually by 1-2 centimeters, but the sleeves of this jacket are a full 5 centimeters longer. When the arms are naturally hanging down, the sleeves should reach the base of the palm, but the sleeves of this jacket cover the fingers.
Buying clothes is easy, and returning them is also easy.
But when will the money be refunded?
The clothes were well made, but due to the small size, I had to return them. However, it's been over a week since I returned them and I still haven't received a refund?
Moreover, the buyer had to contact Quanfeng Express, a courier with a not-so-good reputation, on their own. This was the worst shopping experience since buying items from Amazon!
However, the store was quite good, actively cooperating to urge the courier to refund in time, but the work of this Quanfeng Express was really infuriating, dragging on for about half a month before refunding. Such a partner is going to drag Amazon down, with poor work efficiency and no service awareness!
More suitable for young people.
It's a 99-second kill.
The craftsmanship, color, and feel of the woolen pants are all good, they are soft and of moderate thickness, and do not have a kerosene smell.
Unfortunately, the style is slim fit, which is more suitable for young people.
3XL, with a flat waist circumference of 2.5 feet, maximum stretch size of 4 feet, is a bit tight around the waist for someone weighing 1.79/80 kilograms.
It seems there is no elastic waistband, so it's quite difficult to loosen the waist.
Additionally, wearing tight clothes is uncomfortable.
Very good, the color is not very bright.
I just bought it and it's already increased by more than two hundred, what's going on?
This was the first time Amazon used the cooperative courier service, Tian Tian Express, which was terrible. The first time they attempted delivery, I wasn't home. I then proactively arranged two delivery times with the courier, but they didn't deliver either time and eventually returned my package. This damn courier has no integrity at all. I strongly suggest not using Tian Tian Express anymore.
This time, a t-shirt was also returned to me, and if I were to buy it again, the price has increased by more than a hundred yuan.
Such products should not appear on Amazon's self-operated platform.
The product was purchased on sale, the price was not low, and the reviews also indicated that it was a very good product.
When I actually received the product, I was dumbfounded. The product had large areas of wear on the surface and multiple other areas were worn. It was either a substandard product or a used one. I will upload pictures later.
I requested a return, and the manufacturer's representative said it was due to transportation after seeing the picture. Isn't that a baseless claim?
How could the inside of a product possibly wear out?
There are only two possibilities, either the goods are substandard or old, or I deliberately damaged the goods and then returned them.
Objectively speaking, I have no evidence to prove that I did not damage the product, but based on my credit record of shopping on Amazon, I believe such products should not appear in Amazon's self-operated products. Customers choose Amazon's self-operated products because they trust them. When the customer wins, we win. The customer's victory is the manufacturer's victory. I hope everyone will work together to improve. Thank you.
I have been using this product for less than a year and have encountered two E2 errors, I don't know how to handle it?
I purchased this product on July 30, 2015, but in March 2016, the right two groups of the receiver often showed a red E2, which should be a problem with the transmitter module. This doesn't quite match what Amazon's website says about the transmitter module being able to work continuously for 7 years. I can't find after-sales service on Amazon's website, so I don't know what to do?
It's okay.
The first purchase was bad.
It doesn't feel new.
The label on the box was torn off, and the label on the body was also broken.
And it keeps going to a white screen.
It got better after changing it.
The exchange was quite fast, it's a bit blurry at night, the field of view is not very wide, but it's enough for regular home use.
The downside is that it doesn't come with a card, I had to buy it myself, and I have previously bought a phone on Amazon.
There would usually be a sticker on the packaging to prevent it from being opened, but this time there wasn't. When buying a phone, there would also be a sticker-like seal that could be attached to the warranty card, but this time there wasn't.
I'm not sure if things are no longer available because they're cheap, it's very confusing.
Waiting for a response from the supplier.
The packaging had no markings, so I called the supplier directly. They said that the lack of markings indicated that it was genuine, and if I had doubts, I could send a sample to Johnson & Johnson for verification. They also left their license plate number and phone number, promising to send a text message to notify me that my information had been entered into the Johnson & Johnson warranty card on their official website, but I haven't received a text message yet?
Received the engine oil in the morning and replaced it in the afternoon.
The second purchase.
Amazon's self-operated products are very reliable.
The mechanic who changed the oil said that the oil was clear and indeed good quality.
Because it was the second time I made a purchase.
So it's still very reassuring.
The delivery was fast, the packaging had no faults, and after using this oil, the engine noise noticeably decreased.
The cost-performance ratio is good, it's hard to find synthetic motor oil for less than 200.
Support the star crown, support the winning card, effectively protect the car.
Amazon Japan has seriously damaged the interests of buyers due to customer service issues (delivering an 8cm caterpillar instead of an 8c caterpillar) (8c=14cm, 8cm=2c).
Admitting the mistake, but always evading, constantly emphasizing that the goods belong to a third party and cannot bind the third party.
Order number: 503-4265464-1830254.
When I originally purchased, the size options on the page were 7c, 8, 9c. I thought this was a trap, so I called Amazon's Chinese customer service and was clearly told that 8 meant 8c. However, when the product arrived back in China, I found out it was only 8cm. I believe this was a trap deliberately set to scam Chinese people (according to Amazon's after-sales service). Now, this option is no longer available on the page.
Chinese customer service: We apologize for the inconvenience caused, we offer you two options:
You return the goods, the buyer bears all shipping costs.
If you don't return the item, we will compensate you with 1000 yen.
(Let me do the math, the shoes cost more than 4000 yen, which is about 200 RMB. If I choose option 1, I don't have the shoes, so the loss is 200 yuan.
I chose option 2, I have the shoes, and was finally compensated 2000 yen, with a final loss of 150 RMB. Customer service: We have recorded this, we will handle it seriously, and the next day they sent an email saying that if I do not accept mediation from the Chinese customer service, then it's over.
I proposed: When purchasing pages with confusing options like 7c, 8, 9c, the Chinese customer service told me that the commonly used codes in Japan do not include 'c', similar to 140, but have you guys ever looked at other caterpillar pages?
There are cases where American and Japanese codes are mixed.
Moreover, why did you place 8cm between 7c and 9c? It's clearly the smallest size, what's the point of putting it there?
Chinese Customer Service: We provide services in Chinese, but we didn't know you wanted to ship back to your country, so we will not compensate for your shipping costs.
I don't understand this logic. I am Japanese, and I need Chinese customer service. Chinese living in Japan don't need Chinese customer service. Tourists in Japan don't have the time to make international calls. So the question is, who needs to call Amazon's overseas Chinese service? It's probably just people like me who shop on Japanese Amazon.
Isn't Amazon's Chinese customer service just to facilitate us, the overseas online shoppers?
I am not very satisfied with this purchase.
This is the second time I've purchased Pampers diapers from Amazon. I bought a box when my baby was two months old, choosing diapers made from European imported paper. The first purchase experience was quite satisfactory, as my baby could use one diaper for the whole night, indeed meeting the need of not changing diapers for 12 hours.
However, this time I bought size L diapers, there were 2 separate packages in a box. After opening, I felt that the paper was looser, which was significantly different from the imported Pampers. After using them for my baby, they were okay, with no signs of leakage or rash.
However, after starting the second pack of diapers, a rash immediately appeared on the inside of the baby's thighs and has not yet faded.
I suspect that the quality of the two packages in one box is not the same.
I probably won't continue to buy in the future!
Emphasize the importance of package transportation protection.
This is the worst packaging and shipping I've seen in all my time shopping online, with absolutely no protective measures, no bubble wrap, no cushioning material, nothing at all.
Regarding a deformed box under pressure.
Moreover, the soft rubber boxes inside were packaged in such a way that the card boxes were squashed and deformed.
I hope it's genuine and the quality is guaranteed, I'm not very confident in buying things from Amazon in the future.
I'd rather pay half more domestically for some assurance.
Moreover, regarding the issue of product packaging, I saw comments from as early as 2016, and now in 2019, it's still the same.
This indicates that Amazon does not value service feedback at all, which is far behind domestic companies like JD.com and Tmall.
It's nice, but there's a slight regret.
The entire cup is in a color I really like, orange-red, even though I have a boy at home, I still think orange-red paired with yellow is very eye-catching.
It's a bit smaller than I imagined, but it's meant to be portable, so it's still acceptable.
I brought it home to try last night, and after opening the bottle cap, I found that the distance between the straw and the cap was too close. Because the position of the straw is vertically straight, my son always has to hold the protrusion on the cap to drink water. I wonder if this could be improved.
It seems that other brands of straw cups make the straw slanted for a reason. When it comes to children's items, safety and comfort really do matter.
Lightweight and high capacity.
I like its lightness and large opening, but the two separate compartments seem a bit redundant to me, as I'm not sure what to put in them.
After purchasing, I found another similar brand on the overseas shopping platform, Amazon, for less than two hundred yuan.
Fake goods, especially those that are extremely counterfeit.
I can't believe Amazon sells counterfeit goods.
The customer service said that because I used it, I couldn't return it. How would I know it was a fake if I didn't use it?
Because of trust, there is sadness. After all, it's a facial product. It's better to buy it in a physical store, even if it's a bit more expensive.
Because it was a flash sale, I didn't look at the reviews. I have already submitted a complaint to the National Administration for Industry and Commerce's e-commerce platform. Let's protect our rights together.
Is it broken?
Fake goods?
In short, a tragedy.
When I used the second sheet, I chose one with fine pores, but as soon as I opened it, there was a strange smell. I thought it was normal because I had never used this brand before. However, when I applied it to my face, I couldn't stand it. The smell was very strong and indescribable. It made me cough immediately, and my eyes were very painful and teary. I immediately took it off and washed my face.
I tried another one of the same kind, it didn't have such a strong smell, and I'm using it now.
It reminded me a bit of the smell of cheap perm solution in a hair salon.
It's hard to imagine, will Amazon's own skincare products also have to be avoided from now on?
Unscrupulous merchant.
When I made the purchase, the promotion on the page said that a "Three-Body Trilogy" would be given for free with purchases over 99 yuan. However, I did not receive this gift when I received the goods. When I called customer service, they asked me to show them a screenshot of the promotion at the time. The problem is, who saves screenshots of web pages when they make purchases? You need customers to provide evidence for promotions you have run yourself. Buyers, be careful next time and keep evidence.
Post-use experience.
This was my first time shopping on Amazon, and I had several impressions. Let's start with my experience after using the product. Firstly, it was indeed painless and there was no irritating smell, overall it was quite good. After waiting for about 8 minutes, the hair came off easily, although there were a few small hair residues left, which were not noticeable unless you looked closely. So overall, it was good. As for the future, I will need to continue observing and using it to know more.
Anyway, I think this thing is really good.
The second order was placed on the 27th and received on the 12th, a total of 15 days or half a month. The delivery service from Amazon was also very good.
Thirdly, don't trust Amazon's Black Friday deals. I placed an order on Friday and after waiting for two days, the price dropped by nearly $12, meaning I paid over $170 (including shipping), which gives the impression that they raise prices during sales.
The customer service mentioned price fluctuations, but I've been monitoring for over 10 days and the price has been pretty stable.
Affordable, made in Japan, with Chinese labels, granulated, definitely a repurchase!
The paste with granules in it has just the right refreshing feel. After using it, the teeth feel smooth. It's much better than some second-hand stuff, which claims to be imported, but many items don't have Chinese labels, and it's unclear where they are wholesaled from.
From now on, as long as Amazon has it, I will never go to second-hand Dong again.
Here's a suggestion, sometimes I can't post reviews on the Amazon app, I hope some improvements can be made to the application, it will get better and better!
The service has been getting worse over the years, there is simply no quality to speak of!
The garbage excellence disregards customer needs when placing an order, especially the delivery time from 19:00 to 22:00.
Due to having an elderly person at home who is bedridden after surgery, it is only convenient to receive packages in the evening.
Surprisingly, they delivered it directly to the door at noon without giving any prior notice by phone.
If the delivery time is at the whim of your couriers, why bother pretending to let customers choose a time?
If your own logistics can't guarantee service, then you might as well not do e-commerce at all!
Making an elderly person with three wounds get out of bed to answer the door and pay for a delivery is outrageous!
The contact number is clearly on the order!
No one bothered to call and give an explanation from start to finish!
The so-called customer service of Excellence Network is just a group of outsiders pretending to handle your complaints and then giving you a so-called response.
There will be no changes or compensation!
I had encountered similar issues with incorrect delivery times before and tolerated it, but this time it's unbearable, it's too much!
The new book I pre-ordered arrived with the front and back covers reversed. How could they overlook such an obvious quality issue and send the book to the customer like this?
Leaving a negative review will not result in anyone contacting you.
The service has been getting worse over the years, there is simply no quality to speak of!
I will not spend another penny on excellence.
The image quality is simply unacceptable.
As a title like "Ancient Atlas", the choice of images, layout, and printing in this book is really unacceptable, with some images even having mosaics, blurred to the point of being unrecognizable.
Even if this book is not a professional atlas, even if it is a small format illustration, it should do justice to the grand collection of medieval literature left by our ancestors in the catalogue!
(And many images can be obtained from relevant industry resources in clear original files), what's the difference between using such images to piece together a book and not using images at all?
I regret such an attitude towards scholarship.
In terms of text, no judgment is made, each family has its own discernment.
Overall 2 stars.
When I read this book in my second year of high school, I was just reading it out of boredom. I didn't think I would get addicted to such a book, after all, web novels from Qidian have never been that appealing to me.
And then... fell into a pit.
According to this plot, the whole book is quite relaxed and enjoyable. In the early part when Ye Xiu is still in the online game, even the intrigue between guilds is not heavy because it is often made light-hearted by Ye's antics.
As for the competition part, it conveyed a bit of the bittersweet feeling of the changing times and the transition from old to new (perhaps I'm just sentimental).
Reading the entire book took up a lot of my study time in my second year of high school, but I just couldn't stop.
The full-time description of characters and emotional lines is very impressive. Some characters are just occasionally mentioned, but they also leave a deep impression. Characters like Ye Xiu, Huang Shaotian, and Su Mucheng, who are more focused on, have a large number of fans. Characters not at the center of the writing, such as Jiang Botao and Chu Yunxiu, are also very popular. In an e-sports text, it is surprising that there is not a single character that is extremely disliked. This is the success of full-time in character description.
In terms of emotional storyline, unlike the common criticism of harem and beauty or decay in general web novels, all the characters in Full-Time share a common love for the game Glory, and most of them desire a fair and square victory.
There are small amounts but no big conspiracies, everyone seems so innocent and lovely.
Perhaps this is why there are no particularly annoying characters in Full Time.
The full-time IP is also large, thanks to this.
Setting aside the cultural phenomenon of online literature, Full-Time is a pretty good book.
To some extent, he really does provide some passion and a bit of emotion to people.
This April, the full-time job will be turned into an anime.
I've wanted to buy this set of books for a long time, but I've always been held back by the lack of money. When I finally decided to buy it, I found that there were a lot of fakes on tb. In fact, a new version of the full-time job has recently been released, and I quite like the cover, but I still plan to buy the old version first, so I looked at it on Amazon and bought a set all at once.
Let's briefly discuss the situation with the goods.
The fourth book does not have a plastic wrap, but the book is new.
The seventeenth book was sealed in plastic but was opened, and the texture of the book felt strange and not as hard as the others.
The 23rd book is similar to the 17th one, but it is also harder than the 17th one, and it is very old.
The publishers of a few individual books seem to be different, for example, the 23rd and 17th are from the same publisher, which is different from the others.
Overall, I'm quite satisfied. A box of 24 is quite large and very satisfying.
The Lonely Little Lion
When I got the book, I thought it would be as simple as "The Lost Corner," but there turned out to be a lot of text!
It took three readings to finish this book for the child, about a little lion who can shoot and loves to eat gummy candies.
When seeing the scene where the lion eats the hunter, there is a slight discomfort, as modern city dwellers have a hard time accepting such a scenario of being eaten by animals.
In the end, this little lion, who had succeeded in human society, lost himself. He was no longer a complete lion, nor a complete human.
In the end, only the little lion's silhouette was left, and it was unknown where he had gone.
Perhaps years later, the image of this little lion will still remain in the impressions of grown-up children, being recalled inadvertently one day, and may touch or inspire them.
A very cost-effective portfolio.
I didn't know about TASCHEN before, but recently I've bought quite a few of their books because they are so impressive, both in terms of the topics they choose and the production itself.
There have been three versions of this work, the largest of which is nearly 50 cm long and 34 cm wide, similar to the complete works of Michelangelo; the medium version is approximately 36 cm long and 23 cm wide; and this version is the smallest, and comes with a two-volume book box.
Personally, I find it acceptable. Firstly, it's affordable and the 700-plus pages are divided into two volumes, making it easier to flip through as a paperback. Secondly, unlike the complete works of Michelangelo, this book of Da Vinci is predominantly filled with black and white manuscripts. For readers with a limited budget and non-art majors, this edition offers the highest cost-performance ratio for appreciating artworks and manuscripts.
The commentary on the painting section is excellent, with composition analysis, draft analysis, and historical background (such as The Last Supper), but due to either printing or book size issues, some shadow parts are too dark to see the details, which is a bit regrettable.
Compared to Michelangelo's manuscripts, Da Vinci's manuscripts are much more abundant in content.
The former is already a genius, the latter's wide range of interests and high achievements are not enough to describe as a genius.
If before one could only appreciate half of Da Vinci through his paintings, after seeing his manuscripts, one would be completely speechless.
Trash, whoever buys it will regret it!
I never give bad reviews, but this is genuinely rubbish. It's a waste of money. Give me a reason!
The time was not accurate, it suddenly turned to January 1st, and the time was reset to zero.
Inferior quality belts, which are not made of silicone, can cause allergic reactions and blisters on the wrist.
3. Often unable to connect to the mobile phone.
The battery life is only five days.
Sleep detection does not display, the time is 0.
Not waterproof.
7. Others.
The logistics are too slow.
It was supposed to arrive on October 16th, but I only received it on the 21st. Bad review!
The delivery is too bad, buying things on Amazon is already slow, I didn't expect it to be this slow!
Overall satisfaction.
Initially, I was worried about the packaging of the camera, but this time it was fine. There was an airbag inside, the camera's three codes matched, and it could be registered on the official website. The shutter count was zero, and the rest would have to be tested over time.
The delivery speed was quite fast, but I have to complain about the courier. He left the valuable item at the door and left quickly. I had no chance to open the box and check it in front of him, which left me speechless.
The merchant has considered the customer's needs before shipping :)
The merchant was quite responsible, specifically calling to ask about the screen size of the camera used, truly considering the customer's needs.
The delivery speed is also fast.
The diamond film fits quite well and is effective.
The battery is not fully charged.
The machine is indeed good, but I want to ask why it can't be fully charged the first time, the charging indicator light is always red.
Currently, there is no official feedback channel for Amazon, so feedback can only be given in product reviews.
On March 29, I pre-ordered this book for 31 yuan, which showed it would be pushed to the device on March 31. At this time, the book could not be previewed on the Amazon official website (because it had not yet been released).
The book pushed to the device on March 31st was blank, with only a "coming soon" message, and the electronic version of the book on Amazon was reduced to 18 yuan.
I have repeatedly tried to delete the blank books downloaded on the device and sync again over the past two days, but I have been unable to obtain the electronic version of "The Essence of Business" containing actual content. However, I see that the book can already be previewed on the Amazon official website.
Currently, I have a few thoughts.
The issue of price is not the most important, the key is how to replace the blank books on Kindle with books of actual content, rather than always downloading "coming soon".
I probably won't buy pre-ordered books in the future, after all, if it gets postponed, downloading an empty book seems very complicated.
I hope Amazon can provide a proper channel for feedback on such issues, so that there is a place to voice concerns when there are doubts about e-book downloads or usage (tickets, online customer service, etc. can be used, you can refer to how the Microsoft official store does it).
Not highly recommended for reading.
I read it a long time ago, and just happened to see it. I'll write some thoughts from memory.
This book is less a collection of short stories, and more a collection of fragments about love from life.
The tone of this book is extremely plain, like that of plain water, with the pursuit of simplicity in word choice and sentence construction taken to the extreme, and the plot is as quiet and plain as a street on a summer afternoon.
Each short story is a snapshot of a small moment in ordinary life, with no beginning and no end.
Finally collected together, it was titled "What We Talk About When We Talk About Love."
I think, this collection of stories, as well as its title, is like a kind of performance art. The author wants to express that love is not just the joys and sorrows on the stage, the eternal love in urban legends, or the inseparable intimacy between lovers. Love is not only the above and should not be represented by the above. Love is also a life as plain as water, a boring day after day, as well as the helplessness towards life, the escape from reality, and the confusion about the future.
While reading this book, you may recall the quarrelling couple beside you, the bland marriages of people you know, and unsatisfactory relationships.
This is exactly why I do not recommend reading it. From an aesthetic perspective, the writing and plot of this book are bland and tasteless, unless your life is tumultuous or sweet as living in a candy castle, otherwise, your feeling when reading it would be indifferent and bored.
From a depth of thought perspective, the everyday plot does not dazzle or expand one's thinking and perspective (unlike Marquez's Love in the Time of Cholera), and the brief segments do not explore any issues, such as what kind of mistakes lead to the failure of love?
What are the reasons for the breakdown of the protagonist's marriage?
So I don't recommend reading this book, it doesn't make much difference whether you read it or not.
The author's ideas are more expressed through techniques and genres rather than the story plot, which is a reason why the reading experience of this book is relatively poor.
Suitable for skimming, not for detailed reading.
The logic of this book is good, but the content is not rich enough.
Many sales theories explain what and why, but are weak in terms of how to do it, only pointing out the direction but not providing specific methods.
Additionally, this book feels like it was pieced together.
Examples include both domestic and foreign; both well-known entrepreneurs or salespeople and those who are not well-known.
It is unclear whether the stories were compiled for illustrative purposes, but examples from the author's personal experience would be more convincing.
The terminology fluctuates between "customer" and "client".
The title still refers to the customer, but in the body of the text, it has changed to client.
The e-book also had issues with typos, missing punctuation, and numbering errors.
In summary, this book is a good choice for beginners in theory, but not quite suitable for those already in sales who want to improve their sales level.
A guidebook for quickly understanding internet finance.
This book is quite basic, it can be said to be an introductory course, it can help everyone quickly understand the full picture of internet finance, but to understand in depth, you still need to follow the clues and dig deeper on your own.
Moreover, the book was written quite early, and it does not mention the later subsidy wars between Alipay and WeChat to cultivate user habits. The current market share of third-party payments is probably much larger than what is mentioned in the book.
Nowadays, many people just bring their mobile phones when they go out to eat, and because of the high bank turnover, merchants have abandoned UnionPay.
Still, I am very grateful to the author for writing this introductory book. It is clear that the author has many years of experience observing finance and is very familiar with the history of financial development both domestically and abroad, which is why he was able to write such accessible content.
It's easy to write grandiloquently, the challenge is to write in a way that's easy to understand.
I admire you, and I want you to know it!
The primary factor determining a person's job satisfaction is not the level of salary, but whether they receive enough recognition and appreciation in their work.
According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, once a person's basic survival needs are met, the most urgent need is the satisfaction of psychological needs - the desire to be understood, affirmed, and appreciated.
Indeed, for most Chinese people, love is often "kept in the heart and hard to express," even feelings of love, gratitude, and appreciation are silently kept in the heart and not spoken out loud.
The author elaborates on five languages of appreciation in this book: words of affirmation, quality time, acts of service, receiving gifts, and physical touch.
I think what's important is not knowing what the five languages of appreciation are, but being able to genuinely use these five languages to appreciate and be grateful for the people around you, whether they are family, friends or colleagues.
In fact, the closer the person, the more they need appreciation and gratitude, which will make our lives better.
By learning to appreciate, companies can also retain talent to a certain extent and reduce the resignation rate.
Thanks to the translators for bringing us wonderful foreign thoughts and world views.
Due to differences in cultural backgrounds between the East and the West, there are more or less differences between languages. If there is a chance to see the original version of the author, I believe more will be gained.
Once again, thank you to the authors, translators, and editors for their hard work!
Suspected counterfeit product, please conduct strict review, Amazon.
The quality is extremely poor, the packaging is loose, there is no weight, it's even worse than roadside stall products, there is no weight, no barcode, the ten-bag packaging is also loose, it's not at all the characteristics of a qualified product; it's the worst shopping experience on Amazon, I have already applied for a return; it's completely a quality issue; I suggest the seller to open their eyes and reject inferior goods; supplement: I bought another Heart to Heart, supermarket 23 yuan/10 rolls, added a few comparison photos, further verified the inferiority of this product, in order to give consumers a clearer reference, to avoid economic loss and further unpleasant feelings!
Once again, there is an expectation for Amazon to be meticulous and strictly control the source of its products.
The product is mediocre and does not meet expectations.
Advantages:
Big brand, low price.
Advantage 2: Both the motor and blades are guaranteed by PANASONIC, and they are okay to use, but there is a gap between the actual performance and my expectations.
Disadvantages:
There is no charging indicator light, even the most basic power indicator is omitted. I guess for customers who buy a 300 yuan product, in the eyes of Panasonic, it is a handout, with no respect at all.
There is a strong unpleasant smell when charging, even if it's only for 10 minutes, you can smell the strong scent of burning plastic.
After a day of testing in the office, the whole room was filled with the smell of plastic.
Compared to the Philips product of the same price range that I used before, although this Panasonic product has an extra blade, the quality really lets consumers down.
Small package
Upon receiving the package and seeing "e-commerce version" written on it, I knew I had fallen into a trap again. It was much smaller than what I bought from the supermarket, probably a size M. The packaging didn't match the product description and images, probably a so-called new version.
Three stars is blaming myself for not carefully checking the product specifications. I have no objection to you selling M size e-commerce version, but what do you mean by delivering the wrong version?
E-commerce can be tricky, it's better to go to the supermarket if you have time.
Just like that.
Don't like the taste.
The child really dislikes the taste of toothpaste, always saying it's spicy. Perhaps a different word would be more appropriate, but for now, this is the only word in the child's vocabulary.
I bought it during a promotion, it was very cheap, so I feel bad giving a bad review. Four stars, but I won't buy it again.
Authentic product, well packaged.
The packaging was complete, with an airbag added inside, not just the bare product as some online reviews suggested.
The bottle also has a layer of plastic wrap on the outside packaging as described in the picture, and the delivery was very fast, arriving the day after the order was placed.
It is genuine, just out of stock, not sure when it will be restocked.
A terrible shopping experience.
I placed an order during Black Friday, but after waiting for a long time, I didn't receive it. Upon checking, the package had already been signed for. I asked my colleagues and none of them had signed for it. I quickly contacted the courier company, but they said only the sender could initiate an inquiry. I contacted Amazon customer service and waited for more than ten days. Finally, it was clear that the package had been mistakenly delivered to someone else. After several rounds of transfers, I finally retrieved the package. The outer packaging had been opened, but the product was still intact. I don't know if it has been used or not. It was quite a frustrating experience.
Incorrect illustration.
I thought I would receive headphones like the ones in picture 1, but instead I received headphones like those in picture 2. Not only do the items not match the pictures, but what does it mean when the sound in the left and right earpieces is not the same?
Although the names are the same, we hope everyone will be careful and we also ask the person in charge at Amazon to replace the correct pictures in a timely manner. Thank you very much.
The operating system is average.
After using it for a while, the overall display is acceptable, and there doesn't seem to be much difference. However, the system is somewhat frustrating to use, the boot time is noticeably slow, and it's not easy to set up. The pre-installed software doesn't even warrant a comment, and the response speed is just average. Compared to my colleague's, it's not even in the same league.
I read reviews saying the design is very user-friendly, but I couldn't find where it was user-friendly. The placement of the commonly used up, down, left, right, and back buttons on the remote control is really not commendable.
So, just use it as a TV, and add things like a TV box.
The price drop is too drastic.
The price drop is too drastic, from over a hundred to now 99!
I have accumulated many unreviewed orders on Amazon, so I use a copied paragraph as the review content for all of them.
If I use this statement to evaluate, it means that the product scores at least 85 points or above.
For inferior products, I would never be lazy enough to copy and paste reviews. This would serve as a reference for other consumers when making purchases, and the merchants would also improve the quality of their products as a result.
A good, affordable cable, this is enough if you're not an audiophile!
Such a cheap cable, but it should have met the HDMI certification standards. After personal comparison, it easily beats these crappy things from Akihabara in China (the price is twice as expensive). The cable is thick and relatively soft, there is no noise in 7 meters transmission, in the future, I will only choose Beisi for low-cost cables!
The products are okay, but Amazon's after-sales service is really much worse than other websites.
After placing the order, I realized I made a mistake, but I couldn't cancel the order. The link to contact customer service on the website kept showing an error, so I couldn't get in touch.
After the delivery arrived, the courier called me. I told him I didn't want it and had tried to cancel the order unsuccessfully. The courier took it back, saying he would sign for it first and advised me to apply for a return.
When applying for a return, I was informed that food items cannot be returned once they have been signed for. I tried calling Amazon customer service, but they said the same thing, that items cannot be returned once they have been signed for.
I have previously bought items that are non-refundable due to policy, including milk and diapers, from Jingdong and Suning. The customer service was able to process the returns for me, even when the diapers from Jingdong had a strong smell after opening. However, this was not possible with Amazon.
Rules are dead, people are alive, how do your customer service handle this?
They told me to either accept it myself or let the delivery person buy it. The delivery person already has a hard job, why should they have to pay for something they didn't purchase?
Fine, I won't return it, I'll keep it for myself, but I must give your service a score of 1.
I advise everyone not to waste money.
I bought it with high expectations, thinking that the Doule brand wouldn't be too bad. After receiving it, I thought the packaging was okay and the size was decent. However, one box was mostly soft, which you couldn't tell from the outside, you had to feel it. It had no taste when eaten, bland and tasteless. When bitten into, the fruit flesh was a dark yellow, the kind that indicates it's spoiled. Good and bad ones were mixed together, and less than a third were edible. I advise everyone not to buy it. It's not cheap and the quality is too poor!
Once bitten, twice shy; I will never buy fruit from e-commerce again!
Where is the product's anti-counterfeit label?
The bottom corner of the bottle is severely dented, which must have been caused by a strong impact. Judging from the outer packaging bag, the degree of damage is distressing, especially since it is food packaging and it is too simple, and it is also an international purchase. Moreover, there is no obvious anti-counterfeit identification mark. Opening the bottle is very easy, and the key is that a layer of honey inside the cap directly came out from inside, there is almost no adhesion when opened, is this how all foreign products are?
As someone born in China, I'm a bit confused.
It should be genuine, right?
Also, when I placed the order, it indicated that it would arrive in the twenties, but I received it on the 14th. This is my first time shopping overseas here, I'm just writing down my doubts, maybe this is all normal?
The pick-up service needs improvement.
I bought a total of 5 pick-up vouchers. When I went to pick them up, I made an appointment to pick up 3 for the first time, but only 2 were sent. After multiple communications, it was confirmed that one was missed and promised to be sent later. The second appointment happened to be on a day off, and there was no prompt on the website or WeChat that an appointment needed to be made on a working day, causing unnecessary panic. I suggest improvements for the future.
Good shopping.
Good reviews all around!
I tend to trust products sold directly by Amazon. Now, overseas shopping is very convenient. The logistics time for buying from abroad is only a few days longer than domestic. It must be said that Amazon's ability to clear customs from overseas to domestic is very strong, much faster than transshipment, so now many things are bought on overseas shopping.
I hope that the quality and price of domestic products can be improved. Many things are produced domestically, but buying them after a trip abroad is cheaper than buying them at home. I hope for improvements.
Trash
Looking at such a package, I ask everyone: doesn't it look like roadside trash?
Is it responsible to send a fragile plastic package in a plastic bag from so-called Germany?
I see this packaging as if it's for garbage. The product was purchased with extremely shoddy packaging, with no measures to prevent damage. It was simply wrapped in a plastic bag. Upon receipt, the package was completely deformed and the items inside were damaged.
If I had just encountered one like this, I would have accepted it, but I bought several like this. I contacted Amazon customer service, and they said I could return it, but I had to pay for the shipping upfront, and then the shipping cost would be returned to me in the form of a gift card.
I have a question, if I pay the shipping fee in cash, and you give me a gift card in return, are you asking me to buy your gift cards? And I have to send the product to the warehouse in Germany myself, isn't this making purchasing a product a hassle!
I kept asking the customer service who was responsible for this issue, but they didn't admit it was their fault, not even a word of responsibility. What kind of guarantee does such after-sales service provide? In one word: admit defeat! But I guess Amazon won't even give me the chance to publish this review, they'll just delete it!
The quality is very good, 5 stars, but the logistics are very poor.
The quality is very good, it's a steal, the price is reasonable, and it's worth more than it costs.
The product is sturdy, made with sufficient materials, has solid welding points, appropriate surface treatment, and good color.
The logistics are a major issue; orders placed on the 3rd arrived on the 11th.
I might have been very satisfied if Amazon hadn't marked the estimated arrival date as February 7th.
However, marking an expected arrival time is like making a promise to the user, and it's hard for the user to accept when that promise can't be fulfilled.
If you are not sure you can keep a promise, please do not make one.
In fact, I care very much about the promises made by businesses.
So, I gave it a low score.
The gold thread will fade in color.
The effects are there, but whether they are noticeable depends on the individual, or it could be a placebo effect.
One downside is the golden thread, which was originally designed for aesthetics, but in reality, this gold thread fades. If it is placed in the car and moved a few times, there will be some gold dust on the hands and in the car.
The product is hoped to be improved.
This square one, which doesn't have much decorative effect, shouldn't have gold lines added to it. If they fall off and dirty the car, it would be troublesome.
The items are intact, the speed is acceptable, and they are divided into two packages with different packaging.
The speed of 8 days is quite fast, but the two items were split into two packages, and the packaging was not the same. One was obviously over-protected, with thick cardboard attached and a layer of plastic sealed, and the outer packaging was also easy to unpack. The other one was like a domestic express box, with a few air cushions considered done, which felt a bit perfunctory.
The Eran mattress is genuinely good.
A 34cm mattress is not typically thick, you could even sleep directly on the mattress without a bed.
The quality is very good, both the front and the back are quite soft, sleeping is very comfortable, and you fall asleep quickly when lying on it.
Upon receiving the mattress, there were two stains due to rough handling during delivery. The Yalan customer service was very responsible and efficiently resolved the issue.
It's not a self-operated product, Amazon is shameless.
The page clearly indicates that it is self-operated, but in fact it is delivered by the supplier, the after-sales service is the responsibility of the supplier, and if there are any problems, you need to contact the supplier directly.
If you want to cancel the order, sorry, the order information has already been passed to the supplier and cannot be cancelled; if you want to return or exchange goods, even if you have successfully applied for a return or exchange on Amazon, sorry, no one will pay attention to you, you need to contact the supplier for returns yourself.
What the hell kind of self-operated merchandise is this?
The product is not delivered by Amazon, and Amazon does not take responsibility for after-sales service. The customer service even said "I will help you contact the supplier," and claimed that it is self-operated. This is too shameless, blatantly faceless, and blatantly defrauding consumers!
The experience of depression.
The filter cartridge I previously bought online from another store had a good filtering effect, and even after 28 days, there was no scale even if it was used for an extra day or two.
Having always been satisfied with the quality of items purchased from Amazon, I decided to buy a filter cartridge there for the first time. However, the experience was not very good. Not only did limescale start to appear early on, but small black carbon particles were still suspended in the water on the 28th day of using the filter cartridge. I really don't know whether to continue using it or just throw it away. It's very frustrating.
It's not as good as imagined.
Compared to the power strips I've used in the past, the external workmanship is average, I haven't opened it to see the inside, but I hope it's as the seller described. From the perspective of ease of use, there is a lack of display to show whether each independent unit is powered.
The packaging is damaged, we will have to wait for time to test the quality of the product.
The outer packaging is severely damaged, the inner box seems to be new, but the instruction manual doesn't seem to be new. I just renovated in September and am stocking up, I hope it won't be broken by then. Amazon, please explain why several customers mentioned damaged packaging, yet you seem to be okay with it. Thank you!
Overall good, with a few minor issues.
This was my first time buying a water filter jug. After reading several reviews, I felt that LAICA offered better value for money, so I chose this one. After receiving the product and installing the filter according to the instructions, I found it generally satisfactory. However, it seems that the unfiltered water might mix with the filtered water when pouring, as the seal on the raw water compartment doesn't seem very tight.
When using, make sure all the water is filtered before pouring it out!
The image is incomplete.
The photo did not capture the details of the side, which are not consistent with the main style and differ greatly, that's one; the bead is produced in Thailand, but the place of origin is not marked, that's two; the texture is not marked, that's three; when I bought it in the UK, each item had its own box, but here there is only a simple plastic bag, and there is no product logo on the bead, how can I judge whether it is real or fake.
Be careful when making purchases, especially when buying items from Hong Kong.
Amazon's customer service is really terrible.
I placed an order two days ago and found out today that the price had dropped by 40 yuan. I spent a lot of time contacting customer service, who said they couldn't refund the difference, but I could repurchase and return the original item.
This customer experience and service is ten thousand times worse than that of certain online shopping platforms.
Not bad, worth getting for a beginner.
The quality is passable, but it can't compare to the top-notch Transformers. I've seen the price in the mall before, it's at least several hundred. This is my first time playing with Transformers, it's okay.
The stuff is not bad.
The product is really good, a gift for my girlfriend, but I had some unpleasant experience with the delivery at noon when I was not in Canada. The logistics company directly put it in the mail storage box and did not send me a verification message for pick-up, causing me to make two trips.
But the baby is indeed good.
Worth buying.
The little monkey is cute, Amazon offers great discounts, Chow Sang Sang's official website ships directly. I placed an order the night before yesterday and received it this afternoon. That's really fast.
The postal courier is also very responsible.
Great!
A customer's confession.
Upon receiving such a defective product, Amazon customer service told you not to worry, they would contact you in about 54 hours.
Then you contact the customer service staff in the middle, they will tell you that a specialist will handle this issue and inform you of the result.
You can never actively contact this officer, nor do you know her employee number, nor do you have a direct contact number. You simply cannot reach her; she can only contact you.
Sadly, after waiting for nearly three days, the representative contacted me, but I missed the call as I was away from my phone for a while.
I waited for 2 hours but did not receive a call from the commissioner. During this time, I proactively contacted Amazon customer service and sent an email asking them to call me back.
Nearly three days have passed and I still don't know what Amazon's response will be to the defective coffee machine I received!
The products from Amazon US are fine, overseas shopping is a good method, but the service is far inferior compared to Amazon US.
For me, all I can do is continue to wait...
Uneven bottom.
Because the reviews were all very good, I had high expectations for this pot. I was very pleased when I received it because it was lightweight. However, I encountered a problem when I started to use it. The bottom of the pot is not flat, it bulges in the middle and dips around the edges, causing all the oil to run to the sides. The large piece of fatty meat I specifically bought to season the pot produced a lot of oil, but it couldn't cover the central area and got burnt. I couldn't even season the pot properly, and I doubt I can cook normally with this design.
I don't know if I was just unlucky, but I happened to get a pan with an uneven base. Thankfully, Amazon offers a one-month return service, so I promptly returned it.
I scrubbed the pot clean and returned it, having wasted half a day for nothing.
Good product design requires matching manufacturing processes to achieve.
This is a product with a very simple design style.
The cube shape, the designer treated the top into a slight curve.
The lines should have been very smooth.
Unfortunately, the final result could not be achieved.
Because there are two components at the top, the front is the control panel and the back is the water tank cover.
The curvature of the top cover and the control panel were not consistent, resulting in a height difference of about 2mm after assembly.
Although it appears to be a small gap.
But it can be said that it destroyed the entire sense of design.
I feel a bit sorry for that product designer.
It seems that Midea's product manager does not yet have the ability to create a product of this standard.
(Of course, one cannot expect too much from the feedback of the after-sales lady, but when I heard her say that all units of this product are like this, not just the one I bought, her indifference and heavy burden of truth made me realize that I can't expect too much from beauty either) On July 7, 2019, the pump failed and the water output was low, it was the second repair, and it broke again two weeks after the first repair.
It's a great deal after the discount, but Amazon's fake discounts are very disappointing.
Purchased one week after the baby's birth, it has excellent insulation.
The outside of the pot does not feel hot to the touch, ensuring it won't burn anyone and effectively preventing heat from escaping.
After a night, the air-conditioned room can still maintain a high temperature.
Amazon claimed a big discount for their anniversary event at 320, but later everyone found out that there were also discounts at 249, 289, and 299, which instantly gave a feeling of being deceived. However, after comparing with the supermarket, it was still much more cost-effective than various off-brands at the same price. It can be carried with the car when going out in the future.
Vitamix 6300
After waiting for a long time, I saw that the price of the product on Amazon was reduced to 6300, and the same price was offered on Amazon's overseas purchase, so I quickly made a purchase.
I placed the order on September 2nd, expecting it to arrive on the 21st, but it arrived on the 12th, almost 10 days early. The speed was really fast!
The packaging box is not big, it directly uses Vitamix's original packaging, Amazon is not afraid of it being damaged across the ocean!
The machine looks quite new and comes with all the accessories, but the cup shakes terribly when placed on the base. I'm afraid to turn it on in case the cup flies off!
I asked a friend who has 5200 friends, and from his description, it seems like mine is not as loose as his.
The randomly included recipes are all in English, which is quite tiring to read, and I couldn't find a Chinese version online, which is a hassle!
After receiving the goods, I quickly bought a transformer. I guess it will arrive in about 3 days, and then I can tinker with it properly!
It's too small, doesn't have an umbrella cover, and the material is average.
It's not a large size at all!
The second Totes umbrella, 1. This one doesn't come with a cover 2. The handle material is average 3. Despite being labeled as Large, it's actually a convenient umbrella for one person, it would probably be a squeeze for two people.
On the contrary, the one previously bought from Amazon can be used by three people without any pressure.
I'm not feeling very well.
Firstly, the box is not very sturdy, it deforms with a little pressure, secondly, the design on the back does not prevent the ABS surface of the box from being scratched when placed flat, thirdly, inside the box is just a piece of cloth wrapped around, the place where the pull rod protrudes... and so on, all kinds of dissatisfaction, finally, the zipper is a bit unsmooth.
PS: The wheels do indeed feel quite good.
It's okay.
Advantage: This backpack is quite delicate and appears to be durable.
Disadvantages: The QR code on the card cannot be scanned (what's going on?), a 15.6-inch laptop does not fit (can it be a bit longer?), this backpack's zipper can be locked, but no lock is provided for the buyer, which can hardly be called top-notch service.
Overall it's okay, not sure if it's real leather.
Overall, it feels okay, I can't tell if it's real leather, so I can't make a blind judgement.
It can hold A4 size documents, up to 80 pages thick, but it probably can't hold a box-shaped object that's too thick or hard (non-deformable).
The bag is very soft, and the interior compartments are quite user-friendly, which is pretty good.
I just received this and there's a small sand hole at the bottom, I don't know if it's because of my bad luck or what?
I couldn't be bothered to go through the hassle of returning and exchanging the item, so I put up with it.
Overall, it's worth four stars.
ForRoyal's globally popular camera strap, DSLR strap.
This strap is designed scientifically, it is practical to hang on both shoulders, and the front is fixed and protected by soft material, unlike other quick shooters that use screws to fix the bottom and damage the camera, and it is also convenient to take off the camera.
Poor after-sales service.
I bought a piano a month and a half ago that was missing a part. After notifying Amazon, they gave me the after-sales service number. Despite multiple communications, I still haven't received the part. What kind of efficiency is this!
If you anticipate problems with repairs later on, it's more troublesome. Friends who expect good after-sales service should take a detour, it's too much trouble!
There are minor flaws, but the tone is good.
The head of the piano has a defect, missing a corner, it feels like a substandard product, and there are no gifts, but the price is already good, and the sound of the piano is also good.
It's okay, the first delivery slip.
After using it for a long time, apart from the bass not coming out, overall it's not bad.
The workmanship is not as perfect as imagined.
The first time I bought it, there was a problem with the item, all the lights were flashing and it was unusable.
I requested for an exchange, but even after the goods arrived in Shanghai three days ago, they still haven't been delivered.
The delivery person is not answering the phone calls.
The courier company said that was the only contact information they had.
Amazon could not find a place to lodge a complaint.
Without any request, a text message came saying that the delivery was delayed as per my request - in a case where the delivery was delayed for no apparent reason.
Then there was some discussion about a transfer issue.
The extremely poor shopping experience has led to doubts about the effectiveness of Amazon's logistics and control systems.
It's estimated that it won't be obtained today.
The label adhesive is too weak and not waterproof.
Although Bluetooth connection is convenient, the printed content is not waterproof, and the surface is not laminated; moreover, the label's adhesion is poor, making it unsuitable for cable labels as they can easily fall off. Friends who buy it for cable management need to be aware of this.
The pen is fine, but the packaging was too simple, just a cardboard box, with no protective measures. Moreover, the box for the pen was stuck with a large piece of transparent tape, and when torn off, the glue remained on the box.
I'm very disappointed with this purchase, considering it cost six hundred yuan.
But the pen is fine.
I hope for more improvements in the packaging in the future!
The quality is unquestionable, but in terms of writing, it's not as good as 925-25.
Let's first praise Tiantian Express, their air freight is super fast and their service attitude is also very good!
I've been using the 925-25, which is great. I just received the 925-85, the quality of the pen is unquestionable and the style is very beautiful. The reason I gave it four stars is because the pen is a bit heavy, not suitable for fast writing, and the cap adjustment for the lead length is a bit shaky. Personal opinion: the 925-25 is more handy than the 85.
Therefore, became a die-hard fan of Amazon.
I bought it at a super discount price, but my child didn't like the reading pen.
It has been unsealed, tried to apply for a return, and they actually picked it up from my home for free.
That's awesome.
Returns are not encouraged, but this kind of service is unique in China.
I hope it will not be abused.
From then on, all books were bought from this place.
Headphone bias, and noise.
These headphones are really terrible, I don't know if it's my ears that have a problem or if these headphones are indeed not as good as they used to be.
I bought a blue one from a certain easy purchase two years ago, the sound quality was pretty good with no noise and decent bass. After using it for more than two years and it broke, I plan to buy another one (urbeats), as I feel it was quite good.
I saw a pretty good-looking purple one and bought it. But when I opened it today and listened to it, I realized something was wrong - one side was louder than the other.
At first, I thought it was due to the sound effects of the song and didn't think much of it, but after listening for a while, I realized that the problem was serious. Not only was the sound off, but the bass effect was not as good as before, and there was some noise. Is it just the purple one I bought that has this problem? Or is the current headphone manufacturing process really not up to par?
Quite a poor review, very disappointing.
You must return the goods during the day tomorrow.
The PS has a good appearance.
This AV amplifier is complex to set up, has a rough exterior, and generates a lot of heat.
Give the sound some time before judging!
Just got the German version of the DN1080 on August 14th. The exterior workmanship is so poor.
The front panel and knobs are all made of plastic.
The audio input jack on the back panel and the speaker output terminals are so poor, any 1000-2000 CD amplifier integrated machine you pick at random would be much better than this model.
The top cover is quite thin, and it even caved in on the side of my transformer, forcing me to open the box and manually restore it. The combination of the top cover and the front panel is loose.
The entire machine is top-heavy towards the transformer end, making it awkward to move.
The product feels like an entry-level device from SONY, with that kind of craftsmanship, made in Malaysia.
It feels like Sony's decision to outsource in China is much better than Pony's.
The machine heats up significantly, after about two hours of watching a movie with two channels, the top cover feels about 40-50℃ to the touch. I'm not sure if it's because the transformer is too big and generates a lot of heat.
Nowadays, switch power supplies are commonly used, and this big, dumb transformer probably weighs about 4KG.
Sony should have used an active cooling silent fan inside the machine, but upon opening the box, only a large aluminum heat sink on the pipe was seen.

Never been opened.
The battery is in use.
I really want to dissect it and see what's inside its stomach.
Later on, I thought, if I was disappointed after opening it, it would be a waste of money; if I was satisfied after opening it, it would be difficult to put it back together, and I wouldn't be happy using it.
Well, let's just assume that Sony uses good battery cells.
As for the detailed explanation of electricity, it generally makes people feel uneasy.
I'm doing well, having worked in a mobile phone factory for a long time. Apart from not understanding circuits, I can be considered half a battery engineer, and I can hold my own.
Overjoyed.
I really had no idea before buying, but as soon as I opened it and saw the packaging, I felt reassured!
Finally, when I touched the headphone cord, it felt particularly flexible and of high quality. I couldn't wait to plug it into my phone and open QQ Music.
I was astonished, the sound quality was actually 3D surround!
I asked in a physical communication store, it's about 30 for a similar one, but definitely not the Pisen brand, it's a miscellaneous brand. Therefore, although this Pisen is 27, it's definitely worth having for its cost performance!
The worst online shopping experience.
After placing an order on September 28, the system showed that it had been shipped, but I still hadn't received the goods by October 12.
When checking the Amazon order status, the seller did not provide a tracking number, so it's impossible to locate the order.
So I sent an email to the seller asking if they could provide a tracking number, but there was no response after two days.
Out of desperation, I contacted Amazon's customer service, who gave me the seller's phone number. After calling the store a few times, I finally got through and was informed that the package had been lost. They offered to immediately send me a replacement.
Although I was particularly angry, I didn't say much to the seller because of the urgent need for the computer, as long as it was sent to me immediately.
As a result, I called the next day to ask, has it been shipped?
The seller said it hasn't been sent yet, it will be sent in the afternoon.
I called again in the afternoon, and the seller assured me that the item would be shipped after five or six in the evening. However, when I called at seven in the evening, no one answered the phone.
On the morning of the third day, I called again, asking if the goods had been shipped out?
Can you tell me the order number?
The seller said it hasn't been shipped yet, and told me to order from another store if I'm in a hurry, but if I can wait, it will be shipped in the afternoon.
There's no choice, ordering from another place would take a long time.
All we can do is ask the seller to ship the goods as soon as possible.
Finally, after countless phone follow-ups, I received the computer on October 16th.
As for the quality of the computer, I don't know because it was purchased for someone else. I will add more comments later.
I just bought it half a year ago and haven't used it much, but it's already having contact issues. Can I ask for it to be repaired?
Because I have a desktop computer, I didn't use it much after buying it.
Just bring it in your travel bag to use a few times.
Recently, it was found that when the power is connected, it does not charge. It is necessary to manually adjust the connection between the charger and the wire a few times before it can be charged.
I suspect there is a poor contact at the interface, I wonder if it can still be repaired now?
It is strongly recommended that Amazon stop using EMS!
Five stars for the product, one star for logistics, averaging three stars.
I don't understand why Amazon would choose to ship with EMS, which is widely recognized in the industry as unreliable. After all, a computer is a valuable item!
The post-purchase order indicated an expected delivery on the 20th, so my family waited at home for three days!
Why does it take four to five days to send something from Xiamen to Fuzhou?
On the morning of the 22nd, the logistics finally arrived in Fuzhou, and I was ready to happily receive the goods. However, in the evening, without receiving any calls or messages, I checked the logistics and found that it had been signed for at noon, and it even showed that I had signed for it!
I was instantly shocked!
Who am I? Where am I? Did I really buy this computer?
I'm seriously questioning my life!
Finally, I had to make a trip to the collection point to bring the computer back.
The specific reason is simply because the courier mixed up the two tracking numbers, but fortunately, the package was not lost.
I strongly suggest that Amazon stop using EMS. If Amazon continues to use EMS for delivery, I will definitely not purchase from them again.
The goods are not bad.
Firstly, I just bought it a few days ago and found out it had been reduced in price, which is disappointing. The laptop itself is quite good, with high cost performance. The CPU and graphics card are enough to handle mainstream online games and a considerable part of large single-player games. The cooling is very good, but the screen has a bit of light leakage (a common problem with IPS screens). The sound quality is not very good, and the hard drive is not good (I suggest spending some money to add a solid state drive). I took it to after-sales for a hardware check yesterday, and there were no problems. The pre-installed Windows 8.1 is not very user-friendly, I suggest upgrading to Windows 10. The seller shipped quickly and answered all inquiries quickly. The invoice arrived the day after I received the computer, which is good, but unfortunately there were no gifts.
(By the way, when buying keyboard film, definitely do not go to a Taobao store called E Cool Digital Center. The delivery is slow, the quality is poor, and they do not accept returns or exchanges for faulty products. The owner also uses foul language. Just a special mention.)
The goods are excellent, but the platform bureaucracy remains.
The hard drive is of excellent quality and absolutely high cost-performance ratio, even cheaper than buying in Hong Kong. If you are not in a hurry to use it and can tolerate the logistics, I would definitely recommend purchasing it.
However, it must be said that the bureaucracy of the Amazon platform remains unchanged from a few years ago when I swore I would never use it again. You can never check the actual logistics status, the information is always delivered a few weeks later, you can never complain, it's just so bureaucratic!
The goods have been received for a few days, but the logistics information still says you will receive the goods in about ten days!
Logistics is a headache.
It arrived in this condition, not only was the packaging crushed, the appliance packaging was also open, I don't even know if anything was switched.
For Your Information.
I haven't tried it yet, but I always trust Philips and hope that the battery life is longer than other brands.
I looked it up online, it might be a common problem with water ingress, and there's no warranty.
Depressed!
Now that it's wrapped in cling film and continues to be used, I wonder how long it can last?
Bought something that has been opened by someone else.
The tax of over a hundred on more than three hundred machines is indeed high, but seeing it now at over six hundred makes me feel much more balanced.
When I received it, the condition of the sealing tape looked very wrong, as if it had been opened. I quickly took a picture, and sure enough, it opened as soon as I tore it. After opening it, the cardboard inside was also damaged. I was worried that it was returned by someone else, so I hurriedly tried it on my husband before the anniversary. As a result, the machine had no power at all, but luckily there were no stubble in the blade, otherwise how would I return it from such a distance!
Whether it's good to use or if there will be any short-term problems is still unknown, as the previous review stated, the items sent out when out of stock are indeed unreliable!
Above average in terms of experience.
It's almost top-of-the-line electric, with many different tooth cleaning modes, but few people would change modes every day.
I've been using it for half a year without any problems, brushing every day, and it needs to be charged about once a week.
The brush head attachments are just as cheap on Amazon.
The app is a bit difficult to use, apart from changing the colors and such, it seems that other compatibility issues are due to the overseas version?
I want to learn the Great Law.
High cost-performance ratio.
It has already been used 3-4 times.
The packaging is intact.
It is very easy to use and also convenient to clean.
You can totally DIY your haircut and save money.
In conclusion, it was a very successful purchase.
There are counterfeits.
Last time I bought two packs, they turned out to be two different versions. Originally, the words in the lower left corner of the package were green, but one pack was not, it had white words. As a result, the cat had diarrhea after eating it.
I can't confirm whether the goods from Amazon are fake, or if they were switched by the staff during delivery.
I will buy it again, and if it's still counterfeit, I will hold your relevant personnel accountable.
It's a hyphen!
The picture on Amazon showed a slash, but what they sent me was a dash, isn't this a scam?
The effect is okay.
The cat likes to eat, that's the point.
Indeed, it is effective.
Tight, narrow, binding feet, rubbing the top of the foot.
Not recommended.
UN is the most comfortable series from Clarks, but unfortunately, this model is too poor.
Addendum: Today I compared the insoles of the previous UN series shoes (the shoes were thrown away but the insoles were kept for use), the material is much worse than before, the elasticity is not as good as before, and the breathability is not as good as before, it's just falsely soft.
The arch of my foot is not very high, and the part that gets rubbed is about 3 centimeters forward from the highest point of the arch.
I bought three pairs of Clarks from overseas, but only one pair fits.
I was so scared that I deleted all the games from my favorites.
Try Rockport again, if it doesn't work, the only option is to go to the ECCO physical store.
Subpar filling, poor quality control.
Firstly, it's worth acknowledging that Prime's overseas purchase Ups is very efficient, orders placed on the 31st were received by the 6th.
The color of the shoes is much better than in the picture, and the leather feels good.
The shoe size is a bit larger, with a foot length of 25 and a width of 10.5, the 7.5W is a bit loose when worn, but I usually like to wear it a bit loose, and it fits just right with a pair of insoles.
Secondly, the quality control of this shoe is really not flattering. One shoe has a damaged sole, the other has various scratches and a pinhole on the surface, and the glue strip at the connection between the shoe surface and the sole is misplaced. It's clearly a case of substituting inferior products for good ones!
A bit of regret!
I bought it for 280 yuan during a promotion, which is quite a good deal for Asics. Of course, according to the reviews, there are even lower prices.
Now about the shoes, the advantages: the shoes are very light, comfortable for running, and fit well, they are not loose.
The shoes are very attractive but the drawbacks are also obvious: I usually wear size 40, but this time I bought 40.5, and there is about a thumb's width of space at the front of the shoe. However, this does not affect anything.
The shoe is very "narrow," although there is still space in the front, it feels tight.
Another point is that the shoes may not be very breathable, as my feet feel very hot when wearing them now.
Pressing the top of the foot.
Firstly, the shoes are well made and worth the price.
My feet are quite standard, with running shoes at UK7.5, EU41.5, and leather shoes at UK6.5. I've bought several pairs from Amazon's Aibu, and they've always fit well. However, for this pair, I bought a size larger (UK7) based on the reviews. The shoes were noticeably too long because they were a size too big, but because the insoles were too thick, they still pressed hard on the top of my foot. Combined with the hardness of the walking shoes, they were very uncomfortable to wear.
If your feet are not particularly slim, this model is not recommended.
If you must buy, changing the insole can solve the problem, but the original insole looks very high-end, it's a pity not to use it.
A perfect shopping experience!
Very satisfied, very fond of, Amazon overseas purchases are undoubtedly genuine, the quality is also very good, good value for money, rest assured to buy, after-sales service is very thoughtful, customer service attitude is very kind and amiable, dealing with problems patiently and efficiently, perfectly solving the worries, the matching express delivery to the door is very convenient and reliable, the delivery master is very considerate for customers, will always remind to pick up from the express cabinet in time, thank Amazon for providing customers with such a comfortable shopping experience.
In conclusion, our whole family loves shopping on Amazon overseas!
Absolutely terrible!
I'm really speechless about this agency and Amazon.
Be careful when buying electronic products on Amazon in the future.
Even though it's been a long time, I still need to vent.
Bought it in a winter flash sale for less than 200, it has been sitting at home unused for several months.
In spring, it was found that it could not connect with the bracelet no matter what, both devices' manuals indicated support for each other, it was later discovered that the problem should be with the heart rate band, as it still couldn't connect with other devices.
I called Amazon, and they told me to contact the agency, which asked me to send the device to Shanghai for inspection at my own expense.
Almost half a month later, the items were returned exactly as they were sent, even the courier box was the one I used to send them!
There are no replies, receipts, or inspection reports!
At least tell me whether it's good or bad!
I called to ask, and they said that sending it back like this indicates that the device is fine, it's good.
But why can't I still connect, the proxy company replied: that's not their problem.
Consider me unlucky, I can't be bothered to be hassled over a 200-dollar item.
Serious mismatch of goods.
It's completely inappropriate.
The material of the headband is very good.
Much better than Nike.
It is also very breathable.
Just the hat in front.
Very thin.
Are you here to joke around?!
It completely fails to block the sunlight.
The reason for not returning it is because it functions well as a headband.
Wearing it upwards doesn't provide much protection from the sun.
But it's different from other headband styles.
Save it for later use.
The product quality is good, but Amazon lacks a spirit of contract, the delivery person is very good.
I request delivery on Saturdays and Sundays!
Amazon's policy does not allow for deliveries on Saturdays and Sundays.
I had to drive 200 kilometers back from out of town to pick up the goods!
Amazon, how can I love you again?
The delivery person was very proactive and enthusiastic.
Give a thumbs up!
The product, after a simple trial, is not bad.
But I've never bought similar products before, so I can't compare prices!
Size logistics
The workmanship is acceptable, but the logistics are too slow. Previous shoes were all DHL, but this time Apex really... I've bought a lot of UA in China, and the prices are not low. Does it feel like it's higher grade than NIKE ADIDAS?
Actually, they're all the same, so let's go for overseas online shopping.
Size: I am 176CM tall and weigh 68KG. I usually wear size 180 for my shoulder width. I bought M size, the hem is slightly long, but the rest fits well. I see some recommend S size, are they so slim? Or do they prefer tight-fitting? I think hoodies should be a bit loose.
Just the right size.
With a chest circumference of 99, height of 184, and weight of 84 kg, I consulted customer service before purchasing and was told to buy XXL. However, after reading the reviews, I decisively chose L. Upon receiving the item, I found that the size was just right. I almost got tricked.
The prices on Singles' Day are much higher than on Black Friday.
The quality of the clothes is very good.
The issue with Z's affordable goods is troublesome!
The order placed on the 18th only arrived on the 25th, the speed from Guangzhou to Beijing is like a snail's pace!
I bought a product from Z, which was described as having scratches, but when I received it, I found that it was missing four screws and nuts!
The child didn't want to return the item, thinking the problem wasn't serious, but the small parts like accessories couldn't be found in several nearby hardware stores by the child's grandfather!
Finally, grandpa stuck it on!
It seems that I can't buy cost-effective products from Z anymore!
The quality of the toy processing is not good.
Most of the bolt holes did not align, and it was difficult to screw in the top bolt, indicating poor manufacturing quality. It's uncertain how long it can be used, but since it was a promise made to the child, it won't be returned.
Other reviews said the installation was easy, am I the only one who had a problem with this one I bought?
Very ordinary.
Am I just unlucky?
The packaging is extremely old; the craftsmanship is average; there is only one type of music and it is only 8 seconds long and then repeats constantly; the action is just shaking the head and walking forward, with no variation.
It's not worth the price.
It's urgent, so I won't return it.
The quality of the toy is good, but the packaging leaves something to be desired.
I received a package yesterday that I bought from Amazon. It was marked as being shipped by EMS, but it was finally delivered by Tmall's courier. How many turns did it take? Do Amazon and Tmall have a good relationship?
Regarding the packaging, it was wrapped in several layers of cling film, without even a bubble wrap inside. Upon opening, all the parts were just placed in an empty box. Thankfully, the quality of the toy was good and there were no broken parts, but it was much smaller than imagined. Since it's not battery-operated, it often derails when pushed by hand. The gap on both sides of the track seems too large, indicating an unreasonable design.
Good quality, fun.
It's very fun, the components are highly precise, the craftsmanship is exquisite, and the quality is almost comparable to Lego. The price is very favorable during promotions.
The assembly process was quite fun, I did the assembly and my 5-year-old son played with it, it was great.
He had a blast playing with it~ I'll probably continue to buy toys from this brand in the future.
The machine is new, overseas shopping is good.
I checked on Christmas, the one I bought before was 150 yuan more expensive, but the current delivery is a bit slower.
The machine is quite good, all very new.
Built-in Pikachu.
Then, connecting the Poke Ball will give you a Dream.
It's quite fun to play, with higher portability than the PS4.
I've already bought Zelda, waiting for the game, will try it again.
Producing poor quality goods, selling poor quality goods, resulting in poor service. I bought six watches to give to my children, one of which has an incomplete digital display, and the time on all six watches is inconsistent, varying by several hours.
I contacted the manufacturer to ask if the watch was time-checked upon storage. They replied "yes." If so, why is there such a big time difference? It must be that the watch is not accurate, simply put, it's a grey market product. I don't mean to be rude, but look, they are selling it with obvious quality issues (incomplete digital display). Isn't it junk?
I contacted the seller, who gave a lot of reasons and complained that I shouldn't have bought their product in the first place. With such a product, such a seller, and such after-sales service, who would dare to buy things on Amazon in the future?
In conclusion, I advise against buying from this seller, as the items purchased are just junk.
Amazon delivery issues.
Upon receiving the goods, it was found that:
The packaging is severely worn out.
The table instructions have serious usage creases.
The table doesn't move, the desk lamp can't be used for charging, and the time can't be adjusted.
4. Contacted Amazon customer service separately, could only send to the United States at my own expense, and then reimburse the postage.
The reason for the 5.2 score is that the customer service is quite good.
It can only be said to be passable.
The time is not very accurate, it's about a second fast every day, and after only a few months it's already over two minutes fast.
I've used a Seiko before, and it didn't lose more than a few seconds over a year or two.
The perpetual calendar function is quite good, but the timing function is somewhat superfluous, basically not used, and occasionally accidentally enters the timing mode.
Solar-powered sports watch.
Advantages: Solar charging eliminates the need to replace batteries, it has world time, multiple alarms and hourly reminders.
Disadvantages: The mirror is easily scratched and dust can get in.
Cost-effectiveness: The general price in China is between 220-300, while overseas purchases can be obtained for just over 180 (delivery time is about a week).
A very satisfactory watch.
It's definitely genuine, I've had it checked at the counter. The appearance of the watch is very beautiful, the workmanship is fine, the materials are sufficient, and it has an imported mechanical movement, so it has a certain weight. It's incomparable to those so-called mechanical watches that cost three or four hundred. This one is truly worth its price.
The watch keeps time very accurately, with errors well within the acceptable range. The packaging includes a jewelry appraisal certificate, and the 12 o'clock position on the dial is a real diamond. This is suitable for personal use and also makes a prestigious gift.
The Bentley watch is indeed good.
The worst shopping experience in history.
On the evening of September 23rd, my wife dropped her phone, so on a whim, I immediately ordered an 8p from Amazon. It was in stock but not sold directly by Amazon and there was no price increase (which made me secretly happy). However, because it was not sold directly by Amazon, the delivery was slower, and the system showed that the latest expected delivery date would be September 27th.
My wife was extremely uncomfortable without a mobile phone. She woke me up at 6 o'clock the next morning to figure out a solution. Later, I checked on JD.com and saw that the 256G model was in stock and could be delivered the same day, so I had to immediately order another one.
Having bought the new one, I immediately thought of cancelling the order on Amazon.
Since the order was placed in the middle of the night, it was not possible to receive the delivery in the early morning. At around 7 o'clock, the customer service was contacted to cancel the order, and they replied that it had been cancelled and to wait for a text message notification.
Well, I waited patiently until noon, checked my phone and saw that the order was still not shipped. I immediately contacted customer service to cancel the order, and they replied that it had been done.
By 3 p.m., I checked my phone and saw that the order was still there. I had no choice but to contact customer service again, clearly stating that this was my third call, and asked them to cancel the order and notify the seller not to ship!
The customer service contacted the seller on my request and informed me that the seller was not familiar with the system and would cancel the order after getting familiar with it.
But rest assured, the seller has been clearly informed and will definitely not ship.
When I checked the order status again on Monday, it had already been shipped, which left me speechless.
Since it was impossible to contact the seller directly, the only option was to call customer service again.

Shortly before his death, knowing his days were numbered, Nicholas specifically instructed his younger brother Alexander to marry Princess Dagmar. Alexander promised his brother to marry his fiancée, the Danish Princess, and the two were married on November 9, 1866. They had a harmonious marriage and had four sons and two daughters.
Individuals avoid responsibility due to four mentalities: a passive mindset in children leads to passive behaviors, such as waiting and watching, not knowing what to take initiative in their work, always waiting for the supervisor's orders; some people are overly subjective, ignoring objective facts, which makes them unable to see that some things should be their responsibility; some extremely selfish people, when faced with responsibility, will play the blame game or use tactics to cover up the truth, always appearing innocent in the face of responsibility; and some people always shirk responsibility because they feel inferior and believe they lack the ability to complete tasks.
The temple houses over 100 inscriptions from the Tang to the Qing dynasties, preserved in the main hall and the inscription corridors on both sides of the hall (built in 2000). The main hall contains many inscriptions from various dynasties, while the corridors contain inscriptions from other temples in Yixing that no longer exist. Famous inscriptions include the General Zhou Mansion Stele from the Tang Dynasty's Yuanhe 6th year (811), the Dragon-Slaying Tiger-Shooting Stele from the Southern Song Dynasty's Chunxi 4th year (1177), and the Cloud Dragon Wind Tiger Stele from the Chunyou 4th year (1244), all of which are in the main hall. Also, the Tang Dynasty's Zhenyi Woman Stele, Song Dynasty's Su Dongpo's Ode to Chu Stele, Song Dynasty's Li Zeng's Life Stele, and Ming Dynasty's Jingyun Branch's Calligraphy, all of which are in the inscription corridors. Today, it also serves as the Yixing Inscription Museum.
In Shane Johnson's novel "Ice," a spacecraft modelled after the lunar module and lunar rover is featured. The novel depicts an imagined tragedy of Apollo 19: the lunar rover is transported to the moon by a Saturn IB rocket and lands at a prearranged site, after which Apollo astronauts performing a J mission land precisely near the lunar rover in a traditional lunar module (reminiscent of Pete Conrad's landing during the Apollo 12 mission). Subsequently, the ascent engine of Lunar Module LM-13 fails to ignite, leaving two astronauts stranded on the moon - an event that never actually occurred during the Apollo program.
On December 6, the Guizhou Provincial Health Commission announced that mandatory nucleic acid testing at airports, train stations, high-speed rail stations, long-distance bus stations, and highway epidemic prevention service points would be cancelled, but "on-the-spot testing" services would continue to be provided for those who wish to be tested. Nucleic acid test negative proof will no longer be checked when taking urban public transportation such as subways, buses, and taxis, or entering public places such as parks and residential areas. Long-term home-based elderly people, home office and study personnel, infants and young children, and other people without social activities, if they have no need to go out, can choose not to participate in community nucleic acid screening. When purchasing antipyretic, antiviral, antibiotic, cough and cold medicines, there is no need to register in real name and provide nucleic acid test negative proof.
In 1999, after winning the Ford Supermodel of the World China competition, Li Ai represented China in the world competition. Due to her fluent English, natural charisma, and good public speaking skills, she gained a lot of support from foreigners before the competition. Because of her fluent English and popularity, she served as a voluntary liaison officer, translating for Chinese journalists. She ultimately won the Most Media Welcome Award, also known as the Best News Award in the world competition. After returning to China, Li Ai chose to continue her studies at a university in Guangzhou instead of immediately entering the modeling industry, even giving up opportunities to develop her career abroad. Therefore, she only began participating in some related modeling activities after graduating from university.
On December 15, 2021, the Shijiazhuang City Public Security Bureau Traffic Management Bureau once again issued a "Notice of the Shijiazhuang City People's Government on Urban Road Traffic Management", announcing that motorcycles (including fuel, electric two and three-wheelers) are prohibited from driving within the scope of the urban third ring road (including main and auxiliary roads). Military, police, and fire motorcycles are not restricted when performing official duties. Industry vehicles that ensure people's livelihood (such as postal express, water delivery, gas delivery, milk delivery, etc.) are to be implemented by the industry's competent department with the "four unifications" (unified model size, unified color identification, unified coding number, unified certification on duty), and limited control measures will be taken during the transition period.
On April 16, 2021, Capcom announced a new round of demo playtime for three major platforms during a live broadcast. The PlayStation version could experience the village part of the game on April 18 and the castle part on April 25. The PC and Xbox demo playtime was later opened on May 2. On May 2, all three platforms could play both the village and castle parts. Each person was only allowed a 30-minute playtime for each demo session (60 minutes for the session opened on May 2), and the game would be forcibly ended when the time was up.
At the time, the Bulls were celebrating joyously, and one reporter asked Michael Jordan, "Does Dennis Rodman have a chance to compete with you for the NBA Finals MVP?" Michael Jordan, universally recognized for his competitive spirit and unwillingness to lose, responded, "Without a doubt, I believe he absolutely has the qualifications. His performance is simply astonishing!" However, in the end, Michael Jordan still beat out Shawn Kemp's three votes and Dennis Rodman's two votes to win the NBA Finals MVP with five votes, which was also the most controversial of his six NBA Finals MVP wins in his basketball career.
After winning the grand prize, Mayonaka, under the arrangement of her teacher Tsuki Kage, was introduced to the entertainment industry by Daito Art to further study acting. She became an important character in a famous TV series, was welcomed by the audience, and met her new boyfriend, the idol star Rimi Mamo. However, the glamour of the entertainment industry led to jealousy and sabotage from many people. Moreover, due to Sumisu Hayami temporarily confining Mayonaka's missing mother to promote Mayonaka's movie, it indirectly led to her death. This caused Mayonaka to fall into a trap set by an actress who attempted to replace her due to her anger and sadness, and she disappeared before the performance. In the end, she was expelled from the entertainment industry for misconduct.

This parameter was only available on Pentium III processors with the codenames Katmai and Coppermine. The processor serial number is a unique 96-bit binary number (only 64 bits are actually used), with each processor corresponding to a single serial number. This number can be used to track the entire process from production to sales use of the processor. Intel claimed that the reason for introducing this feature was "to enhance the security of e-commerce, such as using a bank card only on a certain computer." However, it caused strong privacy and national security controversies in various countries and regions including China, the US, and Europe. The public believed that this feature violated user privacy rights, and that malicious individuals could use this feature to track others' computers. Moreover, if Intel's serial number database were to be leaked, it would cause incalculable losses. National security agencies in many countries believed that intelligence departments of hostile countries could easily record and analyze computer activities using this feature. Under market pressure, Intel disabled this feature starting with the Pentium III processor codenamed Tulatin, and has not used this feature in subsequent products such as the Pentium 4 and Core processors.
The "Dawn: My Feelings Concert" was held at 8 pm on December 18, 1991. The venue was fully packed with over two thousand seats, mostly occupied by young women. The organizers had to deploy security guards to prevent the audience from approaching the stage. The media reported that the audience's support for Dawn had reached a frenzy. Security guards had to go on stage to protect him for safety reasons. There were several instances of chaos throughout the night, with audience members constantly walking up to the stage to shake hands with Dawn, resulting in two audience members' hands being trampled and children crying. Dawn told the audience that everyone has their moments of willfulness. He believes that everyone should be united, reasonable in all matters, and maintain calmness. Seeing the audience injured would hurt him even more. He urged the audience to shout out immediately if they were stepped on in the venue. He would rather stop the concert than sing. If there was chaos in the audience, he would not be in the mood to sing. After Dawn finished speaking, the audience responded with cheers and applause. After the concert ended, Dawn left through a secret passage, with some audience members still waiting outside the parking lot.
A Billboard magazine article published in August 2021 pointed out that the group's fans "through legitimate means" exploited loopholes in the charts to boost the ranking of singles like <Butter> in the US, helping the song to top the Hot 100 for several weeks; although the Hot 100's chart performance usually depends on streaming and airplay, <Butter>'s chart performance mainly came from sales-driven (most of which came from BTS's online store, which allows fans to buy multiple copies of a song, unlike iTunes) and fan-led crowdfunding activities (including purchases counted only in US sales made with funds raised from global fans on services like PayPal); however, an article in The Korea Times refuted the allegations of chart manipulation, arguing that fan bases of other artists like Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande have also taken similar promotional measures, which are neither illegal nor unethical, and fans participating in these measures are simply "smart consumers leading global trends."
It is generally accepted that the last common ancestor had genes and genetic coding, and its genes were likely composed of DNA, thus the last common ancestor appeared after the RNA world; and in its DNA state, its DNA coding used the same four nucleotides as today, namely adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C) and thymine (T); its DNA maintained a double helix structure with DNA polymerase, a template-dependent enzyme, and its DNA polymerase likely belonged to the D family of polymerases; the integrity of its DNA structure relied on a class of enzymes that maintain and repair DNA structure, including DNA topoisomerases; in addition, if its genetic coding basis was DNA, then these codes would be expressed through single-stranded RNA as an intermediary, and its RNA would be generated through DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and its RNA coding would use nucleotides similar to DNA, but the thymine in DNA would be replaced with uracil; furthermore, this organism would have a variety of proteins, including tissue protein folding proteins.
In the Duel of Heaven and Earth ranking 10, the manager of the team "Six Paths of Chaos", Heaven and Earth is a country always in war, with warlords dividing the territory and daimyos fighting for each other's land. Even the de facto leader, the Shogun, is just a daimyo with more territories. The strength of the Tian warriors here is the highest among the seven countries, with an average comprehensive level of over 300. Therefore, the players who can stand here are the top group in other countries. Although they are only ranked 10th in the duel here, they are equivalent to the fifth in the kingdom. Under the temptation of Soul Selling, they led the team to attack the temporarily unprotected village and planned to sell the villagers as slaves, but they were stopped by the bandit king Desert who arrived later. However, Soul Selling used the creation to control and attack the desert and was wiped out by the desert. Later, they went to the prison and planned to stand at the top of the prison and attacked the crime king, but they were killed by the crime king's diamond eraser until only the hungry ghost road Hui Hua Maru was left. Then, under the suggestion of the crime king, they fought against Gepela and were defeated miserably, and she was given the nickname of Nightmare.
The loader of Team 𩽾𩾌 (and vice president of the student council), a second-year student in Class B of the General Department at Oarai Girls' Academy, first appeared in Episode 1. She is a serious military enthusiast with extensive military knowledge. She loves tanks more than anyone else and becomes enthusiastic whenever the topic of tanks or military-related topics comes up. To make use of this knowledge, she joined Miho's team. She greatly admires Miho, who comes from a prestigious tankery family, and always addresses her as "Nishizumi-sama". She has been given the nickname "loyal dog" by netizens. Despite her extensive military knowledge, she struggles to find opportunities to apply it. However, through continuous practice, she has inadvertently developed strong survival skills. Whether it's battlefield reconnaissance, infiltration, survival in harsh environments, or outdoor cooking, nothing can stump her. Because of these skills, she was able to easily untie the anchor knot of Shark Team's (Flint's) boat in the first episode of the final chapter. However, she was caught during two of her three reconnaissance missions. The only time she wasn't caught was during her infiltration mission at Anzio High School, from which she returned easily.
In May 2013, Giovanini was invited to join Eastern as a key player in the club's return to the top division. On December 14, 2014, he scored his 100th goal in Hong Kong in a match against his former club, Standard Wanderers, and was awarded a commemorative trophy by Eastern. He then participated in the newly formed Hong Kong Premier League with Eastern and was voted the league's most valuable player in April and December. At the end of the season, he was again selected as one of the best eleven in the Hong Kong Football Star Awards, became the top scorer of the inaugural league with 17 goals, and won the highest honour in local football, the Hong Kong Footballer of the Year. However, he experienced a goal drought at the beginning of the 2015/16 season, not scoring until a league match against Yuen Long on December 13, 2015. On April 22, he was given a starting opportunity in a league match against South China, where he scored twice to help Eastern win their first league championship since coming to Hong Kong. As a result, he defended his top scorer title with 10 goals and was again selected as one of the best eleven.
The M4 Sherman (76mm turret type) tank commander and communicator (deputy team leader of the tank unit), a second-year high school student at Saunders University Affiliated High School, first appeared in episode 4 of this series. She is skilled at devising various tactics and is the strategist of the entire team. However, during tank road races, she tends to become very emotional and easily nervous. During the competition with Oarai Girls' Academy, her panicked and flustered performance affected the morale of her teammates. She used a loophole in the rules to secretly use a spy balloon to eavesdrop on information, but was counterattacked, causing the entire team to lose its advantage and be defeated. She was also punished by Kay. When she is upset or angry, she inexplicably mentions her crush on a boy (Akio). In the movie version, she was comforted by the Rabbit Team. Although she is usually sharp-tongued and full of cunning ideas, she is essentially simple and just a girl with a rich personality and a bit silly. In episode 3 of the final chapter, she fell into the trap of continuing high school, resulting in the destruction of her own flag tank.
The achievement system requires the character's adventure level to reach over 10 to be activated. After the latest expansion pack, The Shadow Odyssey (TSO), officially launched in November 2008, the achievement system was divided into three types: profession-specific system, branch profession system, and TSO profession system. The newly added TSO profession achievement system in The Shadow Odyssey is roughly divided into basic profession line, four major profession branch lines (fighter, mage, priest, scout), subdivided profession branch lines (warrior, knight, monk, witch doctor, priest, druid, bard, wanderer, rogue, warlock, summoner, illusionist), and profession-specific branch lines (each profession-specific). Each branch line must first be filled with 10 points before it can continue to the next branch line. Except for the basic profession line, which does not have a special ultimate move, all other branches have special ultimate moves, which require 10 points in that branch line to be activated. The final profession-specific branch line has two ultimate moves, and after being activated, each will give the player a title.
Even if the revision takes effect, public holidays that overlap with Saturday can theoretically still reach up to 5 days per year, but this situation only occurred in 1999 (that year, the first three days of the lunar new year and the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival did not overlap with Sunday, and there was no situation where a holiday was made up on Saturday, but public holidays that overlapped with Saturday still reached up to 5 days, namely the day after Good Friday, Labor Day, Buddha's Birthday, the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival, and Christmas). From 2011 to 2046, the maximum number of public holidays that overlap with Saturday is 4 days per year, averaging 2.78 days, as shown in the table below (public holidays for 2024 and beyond have not yet been announced, assuming that the "Public Holidays Ordinance" will not be revised again until 2046; since the implementation of "one country, two systems" and the 50-year unchanged period from the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China on July 1, 1997, will expire on July 1, 2047, the laws and systems implemented in Hong Kong thereafter are still unknown, so calculations for 2047 and beyond are not included).
This paradox points out that there is no limit-additive measure defined on the sphere that is equal for all congruent subsets (Hausdorff also proved that there is no countably additive measure that can be defined on all subsets), and the structure of the group formed by sphere rotation plays a key role here - this statement does not hold on the plane or line segment; in fact, Banach later proved that for all bounded subsets on the Euclidean plane, it is possible to define an area that is equal for all congruent subsets (this is also true for the length on the real line); however, this only has finite additivity, so it is not a measure in the full sense, but for the property of "all congruent subsets have equal measure", this measure is equal to the Lebesgue measure, which means that two equi-decomposable open sets on the plane or real line have the same area.
After completing the exploration, New Sam discovered three jammers and recorded their coordinates. When he returned to the base, Old Sam had just discovered the secret room where the clones were kept, located underground next to the sleeping box. Since it was only visited when returning, it had not been discovered before. The two Sams then entered the secret room and found hundreds of Sams, each in a cryogenic box yet to be awakened. While New Sam continued to explore the secret room, Old Sam took a video phone out, destroyed one of the jammers, and contacted Sam's family on Earth. After the call, he found out that his wife had died years ago, his daughter was already 15, not 3 as shown in the film. The videos sent by his wife over the three years were actually received by the real Sam during his three years at the base. The company saved these videos and played them in sequence for the subsequent Sams. The real Sam had actually returned to Earth and was at home.
Before his debut, Lee Junho lost consciousness for 10 minutes after landing on his head during a stunt practice. During the preparation period for "I'll Be Back" after his debut, he suffered a serious accident again during stunt practice, resulting in a severe shoulder injury due to a ruptured tendon and cartilage. He postponed surgery for two years due to group activities. However, on the eve of 2PM's second Asian tour concert in Shanghai on November 17, 2012, Lee Junho injured his waist during rehearsal and was diagnosed with a spinal fracture. He performed on stage with bandages to complete the tour. Despite persistent rehabilitation and fitness efforts, the results were not good. During performances, if there was pressure on his shoulder, he would persist by taking painkillers. Therefore, he was rated as level 4 in the military service examination and was not able to serve in active duty. After continuous rehabilitation treatment, he fulfilled his national defense duty as a social service personnel and enlisted on May 30, 2019, and was discharged on March 20, 2021.
At the moment of destruction, the influence of the strong and weak stones, and what Kesa finally realized, the lament of the earth seen in his eyes, transformed into a wandering mage. The reborn Kesa was determined to end the endless dream of Nefreksia, and spent his life as a wandering mage fighting against Nefreksia. Unfortunately, his individual power was not enough to resist Nefreksia. Over an almost infinite amount of time, Kesa was constantly preparing for a counterattack on the continent, while also traveling through time and space to find allies among other mages, in order to resist Nefreksia's final invasion. He even went so far as to join forces with Yogmoth in the end, in order to achieve the final victory. Led by 'Gerald', the product of Kesa's hybrid plan who possessed Kesa's blood, and armed with ancient artifacts and Kahn, they loaded their thoughts of surpassing suffering, hatred, love, and sadness onto the Clear Sky. In the end, they resisted Nefreksia's time-space fusion and destroyed Nefreksia.
In order to accelerate the modernization process of school education and cultivate high-level international talents with a global perspective and international competitiveness, the school has established cooperative relationships with more than 60 universities and research institutions in more than 50 countries and regions including the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. By implementing Sino-foreign cooperative education programs, the school actively introduces advanced educational concepts and high-quality educational resources from developed countries. It has cooperated with Russia's Pacific National University, Portland State University in the United States, and Youngstown State University in the United States to offer undergraduate programs in architecture, engineering management, civil engineering, electrical engineering and automation. It has also carried out academic exchanges and scientific research cooperation with the University of Iowa, the San Francisco Art University, the University of Leicester and other foreign universities and research institutions through teacher exchange programs, student exchange programs, and overseas talent introduction. The school has appointed more than a hundred experts and scholars, including foreign academicians of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, as honorary professors, visiting professors, etc., and invites more than 50 foreign experts and scholars to give lectures at the school every year. Every year, more than 300 teachers and students are sent abroad for academic exchanges, scientific research cooperation, inspection visits, and study abroad.
The album was produced by Wang Jie and Li Shixian, and was a double CD, each containing 10 songs. "Love Me" refers to the representative works that Wang Jie's fans like, and "I Love" refers to the good songs and latest songs that Wang Jie himself likes. In this album, Wang Jie used a low voice to reinterpret his past classic songs and others' representative works. The market response was quite good. The first batch of 30,000 copies in Taiwan were sold out within a week, and it ranked second in the sales chart in the first week of release. It broke through 50,000 copies within a month. The main song "I'm Better Than Him" also topped the song chart runner-up. The TV announcement of "Guess Guess Guess" set the highest ratings in 2003. The subsequent "Wang Jie Classic Charity Concert" held in Taiwan was also quite successful. However, the concert originally scheduled in Hong Kong was cancelled due to the SARS epidemic. In April, after the album was released in Singapore, although it did not go there for promotion, it achieved the excellent record of winning the sales chart for five consecutive weeks.
Some people might think that saying "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" is reversing cause and effect, and that the real cause and effect should be "more bad behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment." However, research shows that the relationship between corporal punishment and bad behavior is indeed "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children," not "more bad behavior in children leads to more corporal punishment," and this point is supported by post-hoc analysis. Furthermore, even after controlling for various factors that may influence children's behavior, such as parental social status, the point that "corporal punishment leads to more bad behavior in children" still holds true. In other words, corporal punishment itself does indeed lead to more bad behavior in children, and its negative impact cannot be explained by any other possible reasons. Other research suggests that educational strategies that balance care and supervision can effectively reduce the incidence of bullying, while rejection, neglect, and corporal punishment are positively correlated with the incidence of bullying.
The original music video was released on December 14, 2012. In the video, the Sandman is played by Melanie Gaydos, who first appears in Richard Kruspe's dream, causing him to enter a state of torment. Meanwhile, Till kidnaps a group of orphans and locks them in a cage in the main bathroom. A female guard tries to protect the children with a shotgun, but Till defeats her. The guard alternates between appearing young and old, while Till remains the same age, symbolising his immortality and superpowers. When guarding the orphans, Till appears in a bizarre costume. The children are then used by the other band members for various examinations and surgeries, one of which involves extracting the children's tears with a syringe and then injecting them into the Sandman. She wears a dress with two children on it, indicating a connection between the tears and in vitro fertilisation. When Till leaves the main bathroom, the children (played by the band members) escape from their cage and the orphanage, causing Till to rip out and eat his own heart, while the orphanage is consumed by fire.
In February 2014, the game company Orange launched a free dedicated server for the game Paradise, which saw a surge in popularity with up to 660,000 users on the Bahamut Paradise forum the next day. The free server featured a VIP system where the level of service varied depending on the player's VIP level. From September 21, 2017, an international server was launched with updates synchronized with the Korean version, requiring a monthly fee of 660 New Taiwan dollars and prohibiting all cheats. Players could also report cheating players, resulting in a 7-day account ban or even permanent suspension. However, after the international server was updated with the Remastered version, which included a new PSS cheat system, players were unsure if Orange would continue to enforce this policy. From January 9, 2020, the international server became completely free, synchronizing with the original Korean version (actually, all international servers became free to log in after the opening of the Weiton server on December 20, 2019). From November 8, 2017, a permanent NPC, Instructor Bell, was added to the monthly free server, allowing players to quickly level up to 90. On August 8, 2019, the international server officially updated to the remastered high-definition version of Paradise R.
The leader of the Origami Alliance, Guanglong's father, has always fantasized about reaching the Elf World to dominate the entire world. After a fierce battle in episode 26, he was sent into the Elf World by Zhizhe, but unexpectedly arrived at the cage of the demon wolf Fenrir and was absorbed. Due to the opening of the Moon Road, the absorbed leader also came to Neo City to destroy the Earth. He absorbed a large amount of origami, and the demon wolf Fenrir officially resurrected. In order to protect the place where the central tower is connected to the stone tower on the moon, he left a clone to guard it. Under the instigation of Wu Jingzhi, he absorbed the origami beast of the computer virus that was researched to deal with origami, and returned to its original state. However, he used the moon to make the demon wolf Fenrir completely resurrected on the earth (universe). After Fenrir was fully resurrected, he wanted to resist Fenrir from within, but he had no strength. After Fenrir was defeated, he returned to his original state without a mask, but he went to stabilize the Elf World with Guanglong's mother.
In this military campaign account, it is recorded that Kenshin placed Kagekatsu at the highest position among other Uesugi family members (Yamaura, Kamijo, Koshi, etc.), and Kagekatsu had the most troops in the family (originally the largest force was owned by Yamayoshi Toyomori; after Toyomori's death in 1577, part of his vassal group was assigned to Kagekatsu's direct troops, the Fifty Knights, and combined into Kagekatsu's Ueda group). The vassals referred to Kagekatsu in a similar way to Kenshin's honorific "Lord Mikurajō", as "Lord Nakajō", while other family members were referred to as "Jūrō-dono" or by their surname plus "dono" (Yamaura Kuniyoshi and Kamijo Masashige were Kenshin's adopted sons, but became the heads of separate families). As Kenshin's adopted son, Kagekatsu, who received the same honorifics as Kenshin such as "Lord" and "residence (Nakajō)", was likely given a higher status.
In 1818, Sir Raffles was appointed as the Lieutenant Governor of the British colony Bencoolen. He firmly believed that Britain needed to find a strategic location that could surpass the then-dominant Netherlands. At that time, trade lines connected China, Britain, and India, and trade with China in particular required a base. Moreover, the Netherlands was stifling British trade in the region, banning the sale of British goods in Dutch-controlled ports, especially in Batavia, where the prices for goods were quite unfavorable. The challenge Raffles faced was to establish a new port within the Dutch sphere of influence. However, the existing British ports were no longer suitable as trade centers as they were too far from the Strait of Malacca. When large ships needed to trade with Indochina, they had to enter from the adjacent Indian Ocean, or from the more distant Sunda Strait, but these were too far from the main trade hubs. Other locations returned to the original problem - they were too close to the Dutch, or had other issues.
Established on December 11, 1981, by Samsung, Lotte, MBC, OB, Haito, and Sammi, the six teams held the inaugural meeting of professional baseball and launched the first professional game in Korean baseball history at Dongdaemun Baseball Stadium on March 27, 1982. In 1986, the Smiling Eagles team, established by the Korean Gunpowder Group, officially joined as the 7th team in the league, marking the first expansion of the league. In 1990, the Ssangyong Group also established the Ssangyong Raiders team, becoming the 8th team. In 2011, NCsoft's application was approved, establishing the NC Dinos as the 9th team, and according to the rules, they started from the second army and officially promoted to the first army in 2013. In the same year, KT Corporation acquired the right to form a new team and named it KT Wiz, also starting from the second army according to the rules, and officially promoted to the first army in 2015. At the same time, the KBO League became the professional baseball league with the most teams in a single league in Asian professional baseball.
The Dakivali family originally intended to take care of Malefenfen alone, but she cried incessantly (there are also claims that she was born mute), refusing to drink milk or let the women of the family help her bathe. It was not until the family brought in the Manigai group that she would drink milk, and she would not cry when the Tu'uligit family helped her bathe or change diapers. As a result, the two families later helped take care of her daily life, with the Dakivali family responsible for providing food and taking the girl home at night (there are also claims that the ancestors of the two families were created by Satan Yelu using divine power to take care of her). Another family, the Vikivan, was responsible for guard duty. When the baby girl began to eat solid food, she only ate parts like the heart, liver, and hind legs, so when the tribesmen hunted or slaughtered pigs, they had to dedicate these parts, which is the origin of the tribute (vadis).
In June 2022, the Mariners were once down to a record of 29 wins and 39 losses, but they pulled off the second-longest winning streak in team history with 14 wins before the All-Star Game, and never fell out of the top three wildcard playoff spots thereafter. The Mariners finally secured their playoff spot on September 30, 2022, American time, with a walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth inning to defeat the Athletics 2-1. This marked their return to the playoffs after 20 years, passing the record for the longest playoff drought in the four major North American professional sports to the NBA's Sacramento Kings (who have not made the playoffs for 16 consecutive years). In Game 2 of the American League Wild Card Series, the Mariners were down by seven runs after the first five innings, but showed resilience by tying the score in the top of the eighth inning with two big innings. In the top of the ninth, Adam Frazier's go-ahead single allowed the Mariners to defeat the Blue Jays 10-9, winning two straight in the American League Wild Card Series and advancing to the Division Series against the Astros.
Japanese competitor Rie Kaneto broke the Asian record twice in the same year the event was held, making her one of the favorites to win. Despite trailing in the first half of the final, she overtook her opponents in the second half and extended her lead, ultimately winning the gold medal with a time of 2 minutes 20.30 seconds in her last Olympics. She became the third Japanese athlete to win the gold medal in this event, following Hideko Maehata and Kyoko Iwasaki. Russian athlete Yulia Efimova, who had been disqualified for a doping history but later reinstated after an appeal, faced boos from the crowd when she entered but still managed to secure a silver medal for the Russian swimming team with a time of 2 minutes 21.97 seconds. Chinese competitor Shi Jinglin, who had missed out on a medal in the women's 100m breaststroke by finishing fourth, was still in seventh place at the third turn, but a final sprint saw her take the bronze with a personal best time of 2 minutes 22.28 seconds.
Stoermer began to withdraw troops from the north of the encirclement and break through to the south, hoping to reach the north bank of the Gzhatsk River and meet with the relief troops. The fanatical fighters in the protrusion misunderstood the Soviet army, thinking that they had surrounded most of the 8th Corps. The besieged troops occupied three villages in the encirclement to gain a favorable starting line to break through. The 105th Armored Grenadier Regiment of the 72nd Infantry Division captured these three villages. The weakened regiment needed to mount an attack without cover and the Soviet army had dug trenches to defend. Colonel Robert Swift, the commander of the 105th Armored Grenadier Regiment, decided to counterattack at night. According to the agreement, wearing white camouflage clothes, winter coats and white helmets, they silently advanced, only a few kilometers away from the Soviet defenders. In the battle, the 105th Armored Grenadier Regiment captured the ridge within a few minutes. The next night, the 105th Armored Grenadier Regiment reached Komalovka in a similar manner.
According to the current official timeline, the earliest historical work is "Skyward Sword," and the most recent is "Tears of the Kingdom" (although Nintendo has not yet included this work in the aforementioned three timelines). However, to accommodate the need for world view and timeline depth expansion in game production, most of the series' plot settings are revised retrospectively, supplemented or corrected in different works. For example, the Temple of Time mentioned in the 1998 work "Ocarina of Time," which houses a time-traveling portal, was not explained until the plot of "Skyward Sword" released in 2011, a gap of 13 years. This method of retrospectively tracing the timeline effectively dissects and expands the world view of Zelda time and time again, gradually unraveling the plot mysteries of the generations.
As the Dragon Clan gradually discovered the true identities of the eight great demons and the potential dangers of over-reliance on their magical abilities, they began to develop the "Colorless Avatar Symbol", a completely different form and material from the general avatar symbol. The hidden superpower within the colorless avatar symbol can be said to be the ultimate power to restrain the ancient demons. However, after the development was completed, the terrifying monster - the multiple gene body, the beast - created by the Dragon Clan's ambition to invade the world, turned against the fairy world due to loss of control. This beast, both huge and ferocious, and eating everything, reached a terrifying level that even the fire magic could not burn. In the end, the Dragon Clan had no choice but to activate the power of all relics, sending the entire fairy world into outer space, to destroy the beast with the intense heat of the atmosphere. Since then, the civilization and technology on Earth and the fairy world built on the moon gradually lost their connection.
Li Ronghao experienced a severe car accident and spent more than a year in the hospital. Shortly after his discharge, his father passed away from leukemia. He moved to Beijing with his mother and paid off debts by writing songs and producing music for others.

In 2011, he began to serve as the music director of the charity project "The Power of Walking".
In its announcement of the first batch of guiding cases, the Supreme People's Court pointed out that if a state official uses his position to seek benefits for a client, and obtains "profits" in the name of "co-operating" a company with the client without actual investment and participation in management, it should be treated as bribery; if a state official knowingly accepts property from someone with a request, it is considered a promise to "seek benefits for others", whether or not actual benefits have been sought or obtained does not affect the determination of bribery; if a state official uses his position to seek benefits for a client, and purchases houses and other items from the client at a price significantly lower than the market price, it should be treated as bribery, with the amount of bribery calculated based on the difference between the local market price at the time of the transaction and the actual payment price; if a state official accepts property and then returns it to cover up the crime when people or matters related to his bribery are investigated, it does not affect the determination of bribery.

Miu Kuen was born in Shanghai and moved to Hong Kong with her parents when she was young. She lived in Tiu Keng Leng in her early years and later moved to Shek Chu House and Sword Orchid House in Sham Shui Po, Cheung Sha Wan, So Uk Estate (where she was a neighbour of Chow Yun-fat). She attended an international school in Hong Kong and went to Switzerland to study in 1971. She returned to Hong Kong from Switzerland at the end of 1975 and participated in the Miss Hong Kong pageant in 1976, where she won the "Most Photogenic" award. In the same year, she represented Hong Kong in the Miss International Youth pageant in Japan. She later joined TVB as a contracted artist and was quickly promoted. After joining the TV station, she played the lead role in the prime-time drama "Tidal Wave". She also appeared in many films and TV dramas, such as "Narrow Road", "Sweet Sister", "Wrong Door God", etc. Her first film was "Dog Bites Dog Bone".
The commander of the M26 Pershing tank (American squadron leader), who first appeared in the theater version, graduated from a continuation high school. Her tank is marked with a blue triangle, and like (Anzumei), she only has 7 M26 Pershing tanks and 1 M24 Chaffee tank under her command. She is also the only team leader who wears glasses. Together with the other two squadron leaders (Emi, Anzumei), they form the "Bermuda Sisters". However, they are not related by blood, but are sisters in name only. When the three of them are together, they can launch a tactic called "Bermuda Attack". In the theater version, she discovers three people from Anzio High School scouting on the roller coaster track and orders them to be eliminated. On her way to support her own team leader, she is destroyed by the Sunflower Squadron of Oarai Girls Academy and does not participate in the final battle. In the official theater version of the radio drama, like (Emi, Anzumei), she is super fond of her own team leader (Airi Shimada) to the point of being a bit overprotective.
Most digital libraries provide a window that allows for resource queries. These resources are typically hidden deep within the web (or are scarce or even non-existent on the web) and are often not found by users of search engines. Therefore, some digital libraries create special pages or sites that allow most search engines to find all their resources. Many digital libraries often use the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) to display their metadata in other digital libraries in order to obtain more data. Numerous search engines like Google Scholar, Google, Yahoo! and Scirus can also use OAI-PMH to find these resources hidden deep within the web. Therefore, through this agreement, both search engines and digital libraries can benefit, strengthen their interconnections, and enhance the characteristics of their own websites.
After Dreams FC withdrew from the Hong Kong Premier League, Laurence was loaned to the newly formed Premier League club Standard Perfection in July 2016. He made his debut for Perfection in a league match against Hong Kong FC on October 2, where he was selected to play the full match, but Perfection lost 2-3. On October 16, he scored his first goal since joining the club in a league match against Lee Man, which resulted in a red card for the opposing player, Keton, and helped Perfection draw 2-2. On November 27, he played the full match in a league game against powerhouse Kitchee, helping Standard Perfection to a surprising 0-0 draw. In his second season of his professional career, Laurence played in 15 matches across all competitions and scored 2 goals. He also helped Standard Perfection finish 9th out of 11 teams, successfully avoiding relegation. However, the club was eventually disbanded due to issues with returning management rights.
Since the final victory on Guadalcanal in early 1943, in addition to the counterattacks in New Guinea by the US-Australian forces under MacArthur and the US South Pacific Fleet under William Halsey, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff also decided on a plan for the US Navy to begin counterattacks from the Central Pacific in late 1943. This plan was carried out by the 5th Fleet of the US Navy, which received strong support from Nimitz in terms of armaments and supplies. Before the Battle of the Gilbert Islands, the 5th Fleet consisted of at least 10 aircraft carriers and more than 7 battleships, almost encompassing all US naval forces outside of Thomas Kinkaid's 7th Fleet and Halsey's 3rd Fleet. The fleet commander was Rear Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, who made his name in the Battle of Midway. His air attack force, the Fast Carrier Task Force, was originally designated Task Force 50 during the Gilberts campaign, was re-designated Task Force 58 during the Marshall Islands campaign, and remained so until the end of the Pacific War.
In the "Polarized Light" timeline, after K2 ordered separate actions, M950A teamed up with Thunder to rescue the commander, but the two were quickly caught up by a regular army squad. During the operation, M950A's legs were blown off and could only rely on Thunder's support, and she fell into a coma. Just as the two were surrounded and about to be wiped out by the regular army squad, a "prototype fairy" secretly took advantage of the distraction caused by other fairies to dismantle its own body for M950A's repair and upgrade. After the upgrade, M950A's strength greatly increased, and she single-handedly eliminated several regular army soldiers. After moving Thunder to a safe place, she decided to act as bait to attract another batch of regular army troops. In the end, M950A lured the troops into an underground tunnel and shot down the supporting beams, burying all the regular army troops (including herself) underground. The injured M950A then crawled out of the ground with her bare hands and engaged in battle with a regular army officer.
In the end, only a little over a hundred die-hard fans pre-ordered the Nut TNT, and the scarce production led the factory to refuse to start work, leaving these customers without their orders. Some media commentators have said that this is a fundamental problem with the brand: Luo Yonghao is extremely arrogant and has grand dreams, but seemingly lacks the equivalent large pool of funds and innovative technology. Initially, he attracted a group of fans by appealing to a "Chinese craftsman's dream" ideology and rebellious internet youth. Some of these die-hard fans became employees, others became consumers, but ideologies always burn out one day and the market will ultimately test your technical strength. At present, the brand only has the ability to create or rewrite apps, and is still in the stage of being a brand that assembles goods from upstream suppliers. The spirit of craftsmanship is reflected in the creation of the phone casing, but there is actually little variation that can be done with phone casings, and current automated processing technology means that there is not much difference in casing craftsmanship between manufacturers. Other brands are not necessarily "less finely crafted".
Before 2021, problems such as pop-up information tags that were hard to see, extremely small close buttons, disguised pages, and click baiting appeared in the startup advertisements of Chinese apps. In July 2021, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China launched a special rectification action in the Internet industry, which included rectifying behaviors that infringe on user rights, such as deceiving and misleading users with pop-up ads when launching apps, and forcing the provision of personalized services (including full-screen pop-up ads as redirect links, providing false close buttons during targeted push, etc.). This made many platforms' advertising standards much stricter. However, some platforms, in pursuit of the benefits of startup ads, created a new "shake to view" ad, considering the user's "shake" as their consent to view the ad and thus evading rectification. By the end of the year, during the "Double Eleven" and "Double Twelve" periods, some apps launched "shake to view" ads. Although their push was random and did not appear for every user or every time the software was opened, they triggered too sensitively and caused many complaints.
The first level is called "Musical Memory," which is a color symbol sequence memory game. Players enter a circular stage, above which is the game's boss, a toy rabbit named Bunzo. Players must hit the circular buttons in front of them in the correct order of colors or patterns that appear on the screen. Bunzo will slowly descend from above the circular stage. When players hit the correct sequence on the screen, Bunzo will be pulled back to the top, otherwise, he will descend quickly. If the correct sequence is not hit in time, Bunzo will jump down and kill the player. The level has five rounds. In the fifth round, the sequence of questions on the screen will keep changing, and there will be an exclamation mark emergency stop button circling the stage. After the player presses the emergency button, the game will be forcibly terminated. The first level ends after Mommy Long Legs gives the first train password, and the player is allowed to leave through the ventilation duct. The first level ends.
Konev now knew that the German army was breaking out, which angered him and made him determined to fulfill his promise to Stalin not to let any "Hitlerites" or "Fascists" escape the encirclement. However, the Soviet intelligence agency overestimated the armored strength of the German 3rd Armored Army at this time, so Konev launched a full-scale attack. The tank brigade of the Soviet 20th Tank Army brought the new Joseph Stalin heavy tanks to the Kursk battlefield. Konev ordered all available armored vehicles and artillery to fire at the breakout troops, cutting off the enemy in the arc and scattering them. The two Soviet infantry divisions responsible for the blockade, the 206th Sniper Division and the 5th Guards Airborne Division, had been defeated by the German relief troops. Without infantry support, the Soviet tanks had to fire at the German breakout troops from a distance. Since there were no anti-tank weapons on the battlefield, the T-34 tanks rushed into the unprotected Germans, attacking command units, stragglers, and medics.
In the 187th chapter of the remastered comic, he faced off against the Ugly President and Gum. He was nearly swallowed by Gum several times during the fight, but was saved by Pig God each time. In order to protect the hostages controlled by the Ugly President, he asked Pig God to swallow the hostages first and then threw Pig God out of the battlefield. He then teamed up with Tornado to fight the Ugly President. However, after Tornado was knocked unconscious by the Ugly President, he was left to fight alone. Despite his "Vest Grapple" and the President's "Forearm Destruction Fist", he was defeated and his hands were severely damaged. The President then attacked with his "Full Body Destruction Fist". Despite being seriously injured, he still muttered "The power of the vest is eternal". He was then attacked several times by the "Full Body Destruction Fist", leaving his limbs twisted and deformed. He was finally thrown to Gum to be swallowed, but was later saved by Silver Fang.
The design work for the Kirov-class cruiser officially began in 1968, under the code name Project 1144.1. The initial design was for a 8,000-ton vessel, but Soviet leaders at the time, such as Brezhnev, seemed to prefer larger ships. Due to a favorable environment for the development of the navy, the founder of the Soviet Navy, Gorshkov, was determined. The naval high command was active in the ministerial meetings, and they brought up the ambitions of Peter the Great, the Tsar of the Russian Empire, as evidence. Therefore, the design of the ship was for 8,000 tons, equipped with 6-8 missiles with a range of 150 kilometers. However, this was not much different from the Kresta II-class cruisers being built at the time, and there was also the larger, gas turbine-powered Kara-class under development. Such specifications could neither accommodate a nuclear reactor as planned, nor pass the scrutiny of the high command who had a special preference for larger ships. Therefore, the design was revised several times, with the full-load displacement eventually increased to 15,000 tons, then to 20,000 tons, and finally settled at 24,300 tons.
The 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade, supported by the Royal Engineers' amphibious armoured vehicles (used for the first time on the European battlefield) and tracked amphibious landing vehicles of the British 5th Assault Group, launched a landing operation. The brigade planned to use amphibious landing vehicles to cross the entrance of the Braakman Bay and land near Hoofdplaat, a complete village on the opposite side of the pocket, thus applying pressure from both sides. Although there were difficulties in mobilising vehicles and a delay of 24 hours when crossing the canal, the German army was still shocked by the attack and the Allies quickly established a bridgehead. The German army quickly recovered and launched a fierce counterattack; however, they retreated slowly. The 10th Canadian Infantry Brigade under the 4th Canadian Armoured Division crossed the Leopold Canal and attacked the Isabella lowlands, while the 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division was ordered to advance south from the coastal area of the encirclement, opening up a land supply route to the pocket.
McKee was born in the central English city of Birmingham and moved with his family to Dubai and Abu Dhabi at the age of two. He was born into a sports family and was exposed to different types of sports from a young age. His mother excelled in tennis and golf, and his grandfather, a left midfielder in his youth, had played for local famous clubs such as Birmingham and Kinningham. His father had served in the youth army of English clubs Stoke City and West Bromwich. At the age of 10, McKee moved with his father, who worked in the construction industry, from Dubai to Hong Kong. Initially, due to the high property prices in Hong Kong, his parents chose to live in a village house near the country park in Sai Kung. Soon after, McKee enrolled in King George V School. He developed a strong interest in football at the age of 11 and had the opportunity to represent the school at the age of 14. The young McKee shone in school competitions as a key player for the school team. He did not receive formal football training until he was 16.
There are differing views on whether the decision to abolish or retain the death penalty should be left to public opinion. In practice, some governments have put the issue to a public vote. For example, in 2012, California held a referendum on whether to support Proposition 34, which, in simple terms, proposed the abolition of the death penalty in the state. If the referendum had passed, California would have abolished the death penalty; if it had not, the state would have retained it. Despite the supporters of Proposition 34 spending more than six times as much on advertising as the opponents, the referendum ultimately did not pass, with 52% of voters opposing the proposition and 48% supporting it. As a result, California continues to retain the death penalty.
On August 18th, the Polish 1st Armoured Division, commanded by Rafał Maćkowiak, captured Hill 262 (known as Mont-Ormel in French and The Mace in English) on the eastern front of the Canadian army. This was to prevent any counterattacks from the encircled German forces from the east. From this vantage point, they could also oversee the road from Chambois to Vimoutiers (now the only escape route out of the encirclement) and attack the disintegrating German forces. The Polish forces repeatedly and fiercely attacked, especially on August 20th, when the 2nd Armoured Division of the Waffen-SS broke out of the encirclement. They attacked and broke through from Vimoutiers, resulting in 325 Polish soldiers killed, 1,002 wounded, and 114 missing. They were replaced by the Canadian 21st Armoured Regiment on August 21st, while the German forces suffered approximately 2,000 deaths, 5,000 prisoners, and 359 vehicles destroyed.
The reinforcing ribs made of steel bars not only serve as the structure of the engine compartment but also as the landing gear connection frame. The nose weapon compartment is also made of a steel bar frame wrapped in aluminum alloy, with two 23mm caliber Madsen machine guns and two 7.92mm caliber Madsen machine guns inside. These two machine guns can swing left, right, up, and down, but they were changed to fixed 8 7.92mm caliber Browning M36 machine guns. Behind the cockpit is the bomb bay, which can carry a 400kg bomb, usually carrying one 400kg bomb or two 200kg bombs or ten 26kg small bombs. The bombing is the responsibility of the observer. When he bombs, he uses a bombing sight to aim. In addition, he also operates the radio and aerial camera. If necessary, he also operates the defensive machine gun. Therefore, there is a suggestion to change it to a three-seater, that is, to add a seat between the pilot and the observer to share the observer's work.

In January 2014, the disaster film "Out of Inferno" was released, and William Chan won the Best Supporting Actor award at the Macau International Film Festival for his role as Zhang Wenjian. In July, the ancient costume idol drama "The Legend of the Ancient Sword" he starred in achieved the highest TV ratings in the country during its broadcast period, with online views exceeding 5 billion and an average single episode click-through rate of over 150 million. William Chan became well-known to mainland Chinese audiences for his role as Ling Yue, and won the Most Popular All-Around Artist of the Year and the Most Anticipated Actor of the Year at the National Drama Festival. In September, he filmed the urban romantic drama "Destined to Love You". On November 25, he won the Best Young Male Actor award at the European Chinese Film Festival for his role as Xue Keyong in the inspirational film "Men Can't Be Poor", and was also nominated for the Best Supporting Actor award at the Macau International Film Festival. The film was subsequently released in mainland China on December 24.
When external energy is injected into an energy level system in the form of an electric field, photons, chemistry, etc., and is absorbed, it causes electrons to transition from a lower energy level to a higher one. When the photons produced by spontaneous radiation encounter these electrons that have jumped to a higher energy level due to the external energy, these high-energy electrons will be induced to migrate to a lower energy level and release photons (so-called stimulated radiation). All the optical characteristics of stimulated radiation are the same as the original spontaneous radiation, including frequency, phase, and direction of progress. When these stimulated radiation photons encounter other electrons that have jumped to a higher energy level due to external energy, they will produce even more of the same photons, and the intensity of the light will become stronger and stronger (i.e., the energy of the light beam is amplified). Unlike ordinary light, all the photons have the same frequency, phase (coherence), and direction of progress.
Upon arriving at the warehouse auction venue, the two often encounter some competitors who are also warehouse bidders at the entrance. They try to greet each other and make some simple social exchanges, and inquire whether there are any bidders in the local area that need to be aware of. Some venues often have bidders who are willing to spend a lot of money to bid for all items regardless of cost. These bidders usually fall into two categories. One is the big bidder with deep pockets, who often wins the bid for the warehouse at the venue. These big players have monopolized the local warehouse for a long time and do not want outsiders to come in to bid at the auction, so they will deliberately raise the final bid amount regardless of cost, trying to drive away foreign bidders. The other is the bidding novice, who does not know how to set a maximum bid and randomly calls out bids, causing some warehouses that were originally very low in cost to be called high. Other bidders often give up bidding because the bidding price is called too high, and the novice himself is unable to make ends meet and loses out.
On November 6, 1983, the ND2 type internal combustion locomotive of the Nanjing Locomotive Depot of the Shanghai Railway Bureau, pulling the 155th passenger train from Sankeshu Station to Shanghai Station undertaken by the Harbin Railway Bureau, ran to the downline departure signal machine east of Nanjing Station. Due to low visibility in the fog, the driver could not see the signal and stopped to identify it. At this time, the 773rd freight train ran to the 5th inbound signal machine on the downline. The driver, without clearly seeing the signal, blindly crossed the signal machine. When he continued to run to the 6th inbound signal machine, he saw that the signal was showing a red light. However, the crew mistakenly thought it was a red light changed after the locomotive pressed the track circuit, so they ran through the red light and continued to run, colliding with the just-started 155th passenger train. This resulted in the death of one freight handler on the 773rd freight train, one serious injury and 30 minor injuries to passengers on the 155th passenger train, an interruption of operation for 5 hours and 57 minutes, and a disruption of the downline mainline for 84 hours and 19 minutes.

Aiden's sister, Nicky Pearce's son, Jackson Pearce, turned 10 and had a birthday party at her house. During the party, an unknown caller began to harass Nicky. Aiden managed to take down the harasser, but discovered that the harasser was sent by someone else. He once again asked for "Badboy17's" help. During this time, Aiden received a call from Jordi to pick up a person, only to find out that he had picked up a member of the South Chicago gang. The gang's leader was Dermot Quinn, and the person he picked up was killed by Quinn for failing his mission. After completing the task, Aiden blamed Jordi, but Jordi stated that as long as there was money, he would take on any task, and warned Aiden that if he was picked up, he would let Maurice go. Aiden had no choice but to continue.
Hokumura Norimasa was born in the Kowloon district of Hong Kong and began playing football in Hong Kong from a young age. He joined Kitchee's youth team in 2007 and attended King George V School from 2007 to 2012, where he scored 22 goals and made 22 assists for the school team. He then helped Kitchee U17 win third place in the Youth League Football Association Cup.

During his two years there, he played 36 games for the school team, starting 21 games and scoring 4 goals and 7 assists. In 2014, he transferred schools and played 18 games, starting 4, and all the goals he scored helped his team win. After graduating in 2015, he went on to study at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.
After the leaves of the almond tree wilt, they are collected, boiled, and soaked to create what is known as "black water" in aquatics. This can stimulate the mating of Siamese fighting fish from Thailand, improve their fertility, and is especially proven in their breeding. The almond leaves release pigments and tannic acid, which darken the water, simulating the black water environment, stabilizing the fish's mood, relieving stress, and enhancing the color of their body, tail, and dorsal fins. It lowers the PH value (increases acidity) and contains a large amount of tannic acid, humic acid, and folic acid, which can regulate the pH of the water. The softening effect can make the water slightly softer, but it also depends on the hardness of the original water. If it is hard, more leaves need to be soaked to achieve the same effect. In fish tanks soaked with large almond leaves, organisms that die will mold later, suggesting that large almond leaves may have some preservative function to inhibit the growth of mold.
On the eve of World War II, German firearms engineers conducted research on assault rifles. They concluded that although the existing 8mm Mauser rifle bullets had a range of over 800 meters, the long range was difficult to utilize in actual combat. Scopes were not commonly equipped, and most soldiers' marksmanship did not reach the level of snipers. High firing rates could suppress the enemy in close combat, but the existing rifle bullets were too focused on range. Although they were powerful, the recoil was also too large. If they were to be used for fully automatic shooting, it would be difficult to hold them steady, and the hit rate during continuous shooting was so low that it lacked practicality. Therefore, there was an idea to reduce the amount of propellant in the existing 8mm Mauser rifle bullets. By shortening the length of the ammunition, not only could the recoil be reduced, but the weight could also be lightened. As a result, this shortened version of the 8mm Mauser rifle bullet was introduced in 1938. The caliber remained 7.92mm, but the length was about half of the previous Mauser rifle bullet.
Additionally, there are dances used for special occasions, such as the "Victory Dance" performed to celebrate war victories and praise achievements, the "Friendship Dance" for social activities between neighbors or friends, and the "Ghost Dance" calling on ancestral spirits and the souls of deceased warriors to fight together after contact and warfare with white people. There is also the "Corn Dance" performed to pray for or give thanks for a good harvest, and the "Booger Dance" performed to ward off disease or white people. The Booger, considered a demon by the Cherokee people, is usually danced indoors. Some invited participants wear snake masks symbolizing the Booger (after contact with white people, devil horns were added), and use pseudonyms to indicate that they (the Boogers) are not there to harm humans but to dance. After the dance, the Booger is peacefully sent away.
The promotion of litter box toilets first began in the Denver school district in Colorado, where there have been multiple school shootings. In the event of emergencies such as shootings, police require teachers and students to hide in classrooms until the campus is cleared and confirmed safe. The idea was proposed a few years ago by John McDonald, the safety officer of Jefferson County Public Schools, after a school in the area was locked down for several hours following a shooting threat, forcing students who needed to use the bathroom to resort to garbage bags and bins. Following a shooting threat in April 2019, the district began equipping classrooms with portable toilets based on cat litter. Diana Wilson, a spokesperson for the district's public schools, said most teachers support the decision, and litter box toilets have been added to Denver's teacher supply list along with pop-up tents and first aid kits.
After the extinction of the Barariuru tribe, the tribe's location became a place for the good tea tribe to grow miscellaneous grains. Today, you can still see the related ancient city ruins, but the whereabouts of its survivors are completely unknown. On the other hand, although the Karishi tribe regained independence and rebuilt their homes, they also perished under a landslide and flood caused by heavy rain. Only in the current Wutai tribe (located in Wutai Village, Wutai Township) are there some people who claim to be descendants of Karishi. In addition, because they led the tribe to win the war, the descendants of Bereng, the Dalapathan family (also known as Druluane and transliterated as "Luan"), were also called "military merit chiefs". They uniquely had the highest place in the old good tea tribe, Omomos (meaning "easy to fog"), and were on par with the original chief family, the Kadrangilan family, as the two major chief families.
The initial infection cluster caused by a cabin crew member at the end of December 2021 was of the Omicron variant, with virus gene sequencing showing it to be the earlier appearing Omicron variant strain BA.1 subtype. The infection cluster caused by a quarantine hotel in early January 2022 was of the Omicron variant strain BA.2 subtype. Although both belong to the Omicron variant, they have 10 different mutations in their spike proteins. Preliminary studies in the UK and Denmark have shown that the BA.2 subtype is more contagious than the BA.1 subtype, and the BA.2 subtype has a higher breakthrough infection rate in people who have received two or three doses of the vaccine. However, vaccinated individuals may reduce the chance of transmitting to others. The first generation of transmission from the quarantine hotel cluster has already reached 12 people, showing that the Omicron variant strain BA.2 subtype is more contagious and harder to prevent from spreading widely than previous strains found in Hong Kong.
The Lu Family Branch Ancestral Hall, located at No. 15, Taying Lane, Tianfeng Community, Jiangxia Street, Haishu District, Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China, is a Qing Dynasty building. As it is the ancestral hall of a branch of the Lu family, it is named as such. The main building faces south, with three open spaces in front. The central room has a raised beam, while the side rooms have a through-bucket structure, using a beam structure unique to the Zhejiang region: flower buckets are supported on five beams, intersecting with the lower ends of the paired beams used in pairs. The upper end of the column is a butterfly wood, and the lower end is a hanging basket-shaped bucket. There is a stone stele on each side of the front porch of the hall, with the inscription "Double Dragons Playing with Pearls". They are respectively "The Family Biography of Mr. Lu Jingfu" and "The Stele of the Ancestral Hall of Mr. Lu Jingfu, who was appointed as a Scholar of the Imperial Academy and a Candidate for the Same Knowledge of the State in the Qing Dynasty". The Lu family moved here from Dinghai (now Zhoushan City) during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, and had declined by the end of the Qing Dynasty. It was announced as a cultural relic protection unit of Haishu District in August 2001, and the renovation project was launched in 2011 and completed in 2013.
During the later years of his reign, Anastasius realised that his days were numbered. He had three living relatives, but Anastasius did not know who was the most suitable successor. So he summoned his three relatives to a room with three sofas, one of which had a letter hidden underneath. Whoever chose the right sofa would be eligible to become the successor. However, two of the relatives sat on the same sofa, and the other sat on another sofa, but no one chose the sofa with the letter. So Anastasius came up with another idea: whoever was the next person to walk in would be the successor. The person who walked in was Justin, his captain of the guard. Although Anastasius did not expect Justin to become the successor, he was very satisfied with the result, and Justin thus became the emperor.
At the time, the Japanese navy had been ordered to blockade the waters of Hong Kong. When the British torpedo boat squadron sailed to the waters east of the Lantau Strait, they were discovered by the Japanese navy's Kuma-class destroyers and the Hong-class torpedo boat Magpie. Due to the significant difference in firepower between the two sides, Chen Ce instructed the torpedo boat squadron to line up and rush towards the Japanese ships at high speed, pretending to launch a torpedo attack. In reality, the torpedo boats were not carrying torpedoes in order to reduce weight and carry more people, and to avoid the risk of the torpedoes exploding if hit by gunfire. However, the Japanese ships were fooled by the aggressive approach of the torpedo boat squadron and took evasive action. The torpedo boat squadron thus escaped the Japanese interception. After passing through the Guozhou Islands, they turned towards Dapeng Bay. Finally, Chen Ce and more than 70 others landed at Nan'ao on the Dapeng Peninsula. Afterwards, personnel from both China and Britain quickly scuttled all the torpedo boats to prevent the landing site from being discovered and tracked by the Japanese. They then escaped overland to Huizhou, Guangdong.
Buddhism opposes some views of Brahmanism, such as in the Jataka Tales, where the Bodhisattva questions why Brahma allows suffering and evil to prevail, similar to the problem of evil. Some Buddhist scholars also deny the existence of Brahma from a logical perspective. Therefore, Buddhism does not believe that the meaning of life comes from Brahma, who is still trapped in the cycle of reincarnation. In addition, Buddhism denies that Brahma is the origin of all things, considering Brahma as just one of the five manifestations of Nirvana. Therefore, some Hindu theologians accuse Buddhism of promoting nihilism, but Buddhism refutes this, believing that the root of all things is "emptiness". It is the nature of emptiness that allows all things to appear and change, and meaning arises and ceases with dependent origination. Therefore, everything in the world is not meaningless, but because of impermanence, meaning cannot last forever.
In his mid-career, in addition to inheriting Dai Jin's style, he also learned from Ma Yuan and Xia Gui, mainly using freehand brushwork. He also imitated the line-drawing character paintings of Li Gonglin and Gu Kaizhi, and studied the styles of Liang Kai, Wu Daozi, and Liu Songnian, making his paintings more relaxed, simple, and vigorous. At this time, Wu Wei had a high reputation in the capital and was summoned into the palace. However, due to his rebellious nature and discomfort with palace life, and his disdain for the flattery and opportunism of the upper class, he resigned from his position in the painting academy. This caused a great change in his thinking, and he became more wild and indulgent, enjoying life to the fullest. This was also related to the drunkenness of the wealthy at the time. He rarely painted during this period, but works such as "Portrait of a Real Man in Beihai", "Fishing in the Snowy River", and "Song and Dance" reflect the author's self-portrait and his genuine emotions from observing life.
The Camel fighter was developed from the same company's Pup fighter, with a larger, heavier and more powerful air-cooled radial engine that increased the Camel's power from the Pup's 80 horsepower to 130 horsepower. The number of machine guns in the nose was also increased from one to two, and a synchronisation system copied from the Germans was added to prevent the machine guns from jamming due to the cold at high altitudes. A fairing was added, which originally led to the aircraft being called the "Big Dog", but due to the protruding shape of this fairing, the aircraft was renamed the "Camel". This added weight to the nose but the horizontal tail area was not increased, making the Camel tend to pitch forward and become unstable in flight. This made it difficult for novice pilots to handle, but experienced pilots could take advantage of this instability to increase the Camel's agility in air combat.
After more than twenty years of outstanding achievements, the national team's unusually rapid decline in performance was unacceptable to many fans, partly because they could not accept the country's sudden drop in performance. The Greek national basketball team suffered disastrous defeats in the European Championships in 1999 and 2001, and lost the qualifications for the Sydney Olympics and the 2002 World Championships. The poor performance led to problems in the relationship between the team and the Greek Basketball Association. Eventually, the Greek national basketball team underwent a major overhaul before the 2003 European Championships, hiring a new coach Ioannidis and promoting a new batch of young players. This adjustment achieved some success, with the Greek team finishing fifth in the '03 European Championships. However, the public was not very satisfied, as fifth place was still a long way from success.
During the Survey Corps' mission to reclaim the Beast Titan, he stood by waiting. After Reiner called for help, he went to assist, causing heavy casualties to the Survey Corps upon his arrival, almost halving their combat power. He then engaged in battle with the Survey Corps and Eren in his Titan form, easily defeating all enemies and even kicking Eren into a wall. When he tried to capture Eren, Armin distracted him by stabbing his teeth with the anchor of the vertical maneuvering equipment, causing him to spew out superheated steam and severely burn Armin. When he tried to capture Eren again, he found only a hardened clone of Eren's Titan left. He was then captured by Eren using a blade to cut his nape. Only then did he realize that everything was a feint. He was swallowed and killed by Armin in his Titan form, who took his Titan power. Before his death, he briefly called out to his fellow trainees for help, but realizing they were now enemies, he changed his call to the names of Reiner and Annie.
In August 1945, after Japan's unconditional surrender, he returned to his hometown to run a clock shop, studying and learning photography techniques on his own. He often went to Hiroshima to photograph the surviving "bomb victims" (victims of the atomic bomb). From 1952, he spent over a decade documenting Sugimatsu Nakamura, a 43-year-old fisherman (1909-1967). In 1960, he published a photo book "A Record of a Bomb Victim," which won a special award from the Japan Photo Critics Association. He continued to photograph various street protests at the time (anti-security treaty movement, anti-Narita Airport construction "Sanrizuka Struggle", Minamata disease, women's liberation movement, etc.), infiltrated the Self-Defense Forces to expose the truth about new weapons development, and was beaten and had his nose broken, requiring 10 stitches, and his home was burned down in an arson attack. This only strengthened his determination to always stand against those in power, and he self-funded over six hundred exhibitions.
In February of 1568 (the 11th year of the Eiroku era), the lord of Tachibana Castle, Tachibana Akizane, rebelled against the Otomo family once again under the influence of Mori Motonari. At this time, Tonomo Muneyasu of Chikuzen, who was loyal to the Otomo family, did not support Akizane's actions and was killed by him. On April 6, Akizane welcomed over 8,000 men and over a hundred warships from the Mori family, led by Shimizu Munetomo. He also allied with Harada Takane, Harada Chikane and their father and son, and over 10,000 men from the Tachibana family, including the retainer Watanabe Shuzo. On April 24, the Otomo army, led by Toshitsugu, Yoshikiyo, and Shiga Chikamori, surrounded Tachibana Castle and its seven other castles and forts, including Hakutake and Matsuo. Three months later, on July 4, the Otomo army launched a strong attack on Tachibana Castle. Among them, Yoshikiyo's team, which had been greatly reduced in number and was mostly starving after a night attack on the Tachibana army, was revived by Yoshikiyo distributing rice balls and boosting morale.
The eastern part is the undulating Loess Plateau with an altitude of 1500-2000 meters, through which the Yellow River and its tributaries Wei River and Tao River flow, rich in hydropower resources. South of the Qinling Mountains is the Bailong River basin, with a warm and humid climate, dense vegetation, and an annual precipitation of about 500 mm. The western part, west of the Wushaoling, is the Hexi Corridor formed by the confrontation of two mountains in the south and north. The southern mountains are mainly the Qilian Mountains, which are high and mostly above three or four thousand meters. The northern mountains are relatively low, mainly including Longshou Mountain, Heli Mountain, etc. The rivers in the region are inland water systems, most of which flow from south to north, including the Shule River and the Weak Water, among which the Weak Water basin has the largest area. The climate is dry, with an annual precipitation of about 150 mm, mainly semi-desert and desert. Due to the irrigation of the melting snow from the Qilian Mountains, alluvial fans are formed at the foot of the mountains, and where there are rivers in the corridor, connected oases are formed, which are the granaries of Gansu, while the outside is mountains and deserts.
After the observatory changed to signal number one, Lau Fau Shan and Tsing Yi respectively recorded the highest 10-minute average wind speed of 43 km/h between 2:20 and 2:50 am and between 3:40 and 3:46 am on August 15, marking the first time strong winds were recorded at these two stations during the storm, and also the highest wind speed during the storm; at the same time, the southwest of Hong Kong (Lantau Island and nearby areas, such as Cheung Chau, the airport, etc.) continued to be affected by strong winds for nearly a whole day. As a result, between 2:45 and 3:45 am on August 15, four out of eight designated automatic weather stations again recorded strong winds, meeting the requirements for signal number three, leading some citizens to believe that the observatory's change to signal number one was also too early, and even nearly 18 hours earlier than the Macau Meteorological Bureau's removal of the signal number three typhoon warning.
There were differing views between the meteorological agencies of Hong Kong and Macau regarding the time and location of Typhoon Hato's closest approach to Macau. The Macau Meteorological Bureau stated that Hato was closest to Macau at 1 pm, passing about 40 kilometers to the west-southwest of the bureau's headquarters. However, a post-event report from the Hong Kong Observatory and the positioning of the Macau Meteorological and Astronomical Services showed that Hato passed only 20 kilometers to the southwest of the Macau Meteorological Bureau's headquarters at noon. Some citizens questioned whether there was an error in the bureau's positioning of Hato. Given Hato's tight and intact structure and the absence of any reorganization of its central circulation at the time, the chance of a positioning error should have been small. Comparisons can be made with radar images from Typhoon Vicente's assault on Macau in 2012. The bureau's positioning was also 40 kilometers away, and both Typhoon Vicente and Hato had an eye diameter of 50 kilometers. However, Hato's center was clearly closer to Macau than Vicente's, and Hato's actual distance may have been only 20 kilometers.
In 2009, in line with the urban environment improvement action plan of Luohu District, Shenzhen, Guangshen Railway Co., Ltd. invested more than 17 million yuan to carry out comprehensive environmental remediation along the Shenzhen section of the Guangshen Railway. This included improvements to the Shenzhen Railway Station and its surrounding environment. The company completed renovations to the station's walls and electronic screens, added an entrance to the underground Guangshen ticket hall (also the subway transport level) for passenger convenience, and installed a 20-meter-long, 6-meter-high electronic display screen at the east side of the station to display real-time information such as train schedules, ticket prices, and waiting areas. The company also renovated the east and west exterior walls, the luggage consignment hall, the luggage collection area, and other areas, totaling 2,274 square meters of facade. Additionally, they replaced about 550 square meters of ground on platforms one and three and redecorated the interior of the high-speed train ticket area on the first floor of the station.
The mechanical mule weighs less than 567 kilograms, but it can carry objects weighing up to 181 kilograms and travel more than 32 kilometers at a speed of 16 kilometers per hour. It can operate continuously for more than 24 hours. Currently, the mechanical mule is still in the testing phase, with a speed of 11 kilometers per hour, twice the average walking speed of humans. It is powered by a 15 horsepower water-cooled engine, has a built-in global positioning system, and each of its four mechanical legs has a spring to absorb the impact of landing. The part equivalent to the hoof is a force sensor, which, in conjunction with a gyroscope, allows its computer to control its balance. The actuators on its feet (equivalent to leg muscles) can convert the electrical power generated by the engine into mechanical motion, allowing it to move forward.
After the Edo period, most of the area became the territory of the Fukui domain, with a small part belonging to the Obama domain, the direct control of the shogunate, and the banner territory. After the Meiji Restoration at the end of the 19th century, the territories originally belonging to the shogunate and the banner were incorporated into the newly established Motoho County in 1871. After the abolition of the domain and the establishment of the county in the same year, the remaining territories originally belonging to various domains were transferred to Echizen County, Fukui County, and Obama County. However, during the first prefecture-county consolidation at the end of the same year, all areas were consolidated into Tsuruga County. However, Tsuruga County was abolished in 1876, and the current Imari County to the north was incorporated into Ishikawa County. It was not until 1881 that the jurisdiction of the original Tsuruga County was re-established. However, the newly established county was named Fukui County because the county office was located in Fukui.
On the eve of the Demon War, Yixiao Daotianzhen chopped off his own antlers to support the Tianheng Mountain that was damaged by the demon, and died in battle. His blood turned into clear water, forming today's Bishuiyuan, which submerged the remnants of the salt in the ground. A thousand years ago, the Demon War ended, and Yanwang Emperor subdued the demons with his rock spear and confined them in the Gouyun Pavilion. The evil spirits left by the demons were cleaned up by the immortal Yaksha. At this time, only the Golden Peng Yaksha was left among the five great Yakshas. The ancestors of Liyue turned to commerce, and the merchants representing the seven commercial forces - the Seven Stars of Liyue - controlled the country. They managed the Qianyan Army, which was composed of brave and good fighters under the command of the Emperor, while the immortals lived in seclusion among the clouds. Yanwang Emperor controlled the economy of Liyue, established the ceremony of inviting immortals, and the Liyue Port began to take shape.
It's worth noting that due to its inconvenient location, the mall has little foot traffic. The stores inside, such as Mannings, Yoshinoya, and Café de Coral, have shorter operating hours than their other branches. Mannings only operates from 4pm to 8pm every Monday and is closed for the rest of the week, and it carries fewer types of products than other branches. Yoshinoya only operates from 11:30am to 2:30pm every Thursday and is closed from Friday to Wednesday. As of 2021, all retail stores on the first floor, including the Market Place supermarket, have closed, and some children's centers have also closed. Café de Coral does not have a morning or evening market, and only operates from 11am to 7pm from Friday to Wednesday, and is closed all day on Thursday. Some restaurants closed in 2019, and by 2021, all restaurants had closed.
The Spirit of Wind, Taiyi, successfully formed a pact with the two-headed dragon during the defense battle of Azpia City, and can now be summoned by Taiyi at any time and place. However, due to her fear of Taiyi's powerful strength and the consequences that might arise if Taiyi were to use her true power, she lied to Taiyi. The form she takes as Arianne is not her true form, but rather one of the four great spirits of the Elf Queen, the "Sylphid" of the Wind. Her memories and thoughts as Arianne are the same as those of Sylphid. After being summoned by Taiyi, she asked Taiyi to call her "Sylphid".
Following the end of the first season, which was themed around sound, the second season of "Kyoto Color Diary" shifted its focus to "color" as the core topic. It began airing at 1:58 am on the third Wednesday of each month (equivalent to early Thursday morning) from July 17, 2013. At the end of each episode, the segment "Yui's Diary" from the first season was maintained, but the second season used hand-drawn diary illustrations by Yokoyama to review and summarize the content of the episode. In the episode aired on June 11, 2014, Yokoyama announced that the second season would continue into its second year of broadcasting and a special episode would be produced for the first time since the show's inception. In addition to inviting Rie Kitahara, a fellow AKB48 member, as a special guest, the special episode would have an extended broadcast of 90 minutes.

Born into a family of assassins, he honed his combat skills under the influence of his family. Originally, his family served the wealthy Akizuki family, who were of Chinese descent. His father had once clashed with the Nue clan while carrying out a mission to eliminate members of the Yindian family. However, with the death of his mother and the Akizuki family's termination of their contract with his family and hiring of other assassins, the Akizuki family, in order to prevent the family secrets from being leaked by his family, sent assassins to silence his father. This affected him and his sister, leading to the dissolution of their family. During a time of despair, he met Mr. Natsume, who ran a loan company, in a park. Mr. Natsume lent him a helping hand, lending him 500,000 yen for emergencies and to invest in himself. In order to repay Mr. Natsume's kindness, he sought him out and was hired by him, and was named by Mr. Natsume as the successor to run the company.

The Snow Mountain Witch often appears in the Black Forest of Snow Mountain (the highest altitude fir forest in Taiwan). She waves or speaks to passing climbers. If the climbers respond to her or approach her, they will be bewitched and dazed, and follow her into the deeper forest and disappear. It is said that some people who were taken away by the Snow Mountain Witch could not be found, and their footprints were only found on the cliff on the other side of the stream. However, there are also legends that the Snow Mountain Witch does not immediately take away the victims, but goes to the nearby mountain villa at night to call them, leading them to disappear. It is said that only the victims can see her and hear her voice, while others can only hear footsteps.
The improved version launched in 1998 was an export model of the tank, with the "E" standing for Export. It featured a new weapon control and battlefield management system, including a new MVS-580 stabilised panoramic periscope for the tank commander produced by SAGEM, with laser rangefinding and infrared thermal imaging functions. The gun was also replaced with a SAVAN-15 sight, providing all-weather hunting capabilities (Challenger 2 only during the day). The power was replaced with a German MTU MB-883 diesel turbine engine and a Renk HSWL-295TM automatic transmission. Although smaller in size, it was more powerful (horsepower increased from 1200 to 1500), and allowed for more fuel storage space, increasing the cruising range from 450 kilometers to 550 kilometers.

After 2010, pop music in mainland China began to rise, especially with the flourishing of Chinese digital music platforms such as NetEase Cloud Music, Kugou Music, QQ Music, Xiami Music, and Douyin short videos. Various movie and TV drama theme songs, variety music shows such as "The Voice of China", "I Am a Singer", "The Coming One", and "Mars Intelligence Agency" etc. Among them, "The Voice of China" has discovered many new singers, and singers who have shifted their singing careers to mainland China, such as Aska Yang, Julia Peng, Terry Lin, A-Lin, G.E.M. etc., have gained a lot of attention due to the show "I Am a Singer". Among them, G.E.M. has become popular throughout mainland China through this show, becoming a new generation diva in the Chinese music scene.
In modern times, many traditional concepts have been replaced by high-tech modern life. The descendants of Sarutobi Sasuke and Kirigakure Saizou, however, were lured to the Kappa Temple, which is the gate sealed by their ninja ancestors, by the kappa using money. After unsealing and opening the gate, the monsters finally released their grudges from their previous lives into the human world, preparing to cause a big commotion and attempt to exterminate humanity. In this critical situation, a wandering secret ninja allowed Sasuke and Saizou, who were lured by greed, to accept the assistance of their descendant Tsuruhime, and the two ninja descendants who joined later, Kuriyama and Jiraiya, to hide in the human world, cut off evil, and live incognito, becoming the highest purpose of the Ninja Sentai Kakuranger.
Lillard had an outstanding season, often scoring the winning points for his team. As a result, he participated in the Friday Rookie Challenge, Saturday Skills Challenge, Three-Point Contest, Dunk Contest, and Sunday All-Star Game at the 2014 New Orleans All-Star Week, becoming the first player in NBA history to participate in all five All-Star Week events. In his second year, he was selected for the NBA All-Star Game. Lillard also won the NBA Skills Challenge for the second year in a row, his duo with Trey Burke of the Utah Jazz narrowly beat Michael Carter-Williams of the Philadelphia 76ers and Victor Oladipo of the Orlando Magic with a time of 45.2 seconds to successfully defend their title, becoming one of only two players in history to win this honor two years in a row, the other being Dwyane Wade, the greatest player in Miami Heat history.
However, some consider this a controversial period in history. Nobushige was given the title "Danjōchū", a title only the head of the family could receive, while Nobunaga was given the title "Kamitsuke no suke", a title given to the head of the Imagawa family. This suggests that even before his coming of age, Nobunaga's eccentric behavior was not trusted by Nobuhide and his vassals. The Oda family's main castle was Furutō Castle, but to guard against attacks from Mikawa, a new castle was built at Suemori, and the main castle was moved there, not for Nobunaga to live in seclusion. Nobushige was the lord of the main castle, while Nobunaga was the lord of a subsidiary castle. As for Nobunaga's victory, it was related to the support of Masahide and the Mino side. It is difficult for history to answer who betrayed whom. In addition, there should have been support troops from the Mino side. Under the historical view centered on the three heroes of the Warring States period, this is certainly hidden.
The twin-columned Lindt's ghost pen has white bracts, 2-4 cm in diameter; the fruiting body is 3-8 cm high, with two columnar bodies protruding from the bracts. These two separate columnar bodies bend outward in the middle to form an arc, then bend inward at the top and combine. From bottom to top, the columnar bodies gradually thin out. The cross-section of the columnar body is semi-circular at the bottom, convex on the inside, flatter or slightly concave on the outside, resembling a kidney or lentil shape, and gradually becomes circular towards the top. The diameter of the columnar body is 1.6-1.8 cm wide at its widest part and only 3-5 mm wide at the top. The upper part is orange-red, the top is the darkest, maroon, the lower part is light flesh-colored, and opens outward; the mucus is attached to the inner wall of the upper part of the columnar body, it is black-brown and has a strange smell; the spores are elliptical, 4-5×1.5-1.8 micrometers.
The onset of leukemia is a complex sporadic mechanism, a multi-stage evolutionary process, which is also the key to its carcinogenic incidence rate of only 5%. In this process, the virus first binds to CD4+ cells and activates the infected cells. The cells express IL-2 receptors on their membranes, and then the virus's reverse transcriptase forms viral DNA, which is integrated into the host cell chromosome to form a provirus. Under the action of the virus's tax gene, the genes of CD4+ cells IL-2 and its receptor begin to express abnormally, causing a large proliferation of infected cells. The host cells carrying the virus can transform into different cell replications due to the diversity of the integration site of the viral DNA, and during the continuous proliferation of the cells, a replication of the cell DNA mutates and evolves into a leukemia cell, thereby forming a replication of leukemia cells.
The campus of Aurora University, now the Luwan Campus of Shanghai Jiao Tong University in Huangpu District, Shanghai, is divided into two parts by the North-South Elevated Road. The west area (280 Chongqing South Road) still has the original library (built in 1936, reinforced concrete structure, modernist style, now a Shanghai Outstanding Historical Building). In addition, the original St. Peter's Church in Shanghai was also located on the campus (it has since been relocated and rebuilt). The east area (227 Chongqing South Road) still has the original student dormitories 1, 4, and 8 (built in 1908, 1916, and 1919 respectively, now cultural relics protection units of Huangpu District, named as the former site of Aurora College). The Health Science Research Institute of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (225 Chongqing South Road) was originally the Aurora University Museum (built in 1930, brick and concrete structure, Art Deco style, now a Shanghai Outstanding Historical Building).
Over 100 years ago, the fearsome giant pirate crew "Giant Soldier Pirates" disappeared due to the sudden disappearance of their two leaders. Carmel, who was traveling around the world at the time, realized that if the remnants of the Giant Soldier Pirates were executed, it would provoke the giants to take revenge on humans. She successfully persuaded the navy to spare them, vowing to lead everyone towards a world where all races could laugh together, thus earning the title "Holy Mother" from the people. In reality, her collusion with the navy was a ruse that allowed her to infiltrate Elbaf and regularly provide talented children from her care to the navy or CP, hoping to gradually extricate herself from human trafficking through profiteering. The current Navy Rear Admiral John Giant also became the first giant soldier in the navy because of her.
The Bigeye Tuna is a species of the mackerel family, distributed in the western Atlantic region, from Canada to the waters of São Paulo, Brazil.

So far, over 1,400 films have used the SDDS sound format, but only about 97 films have been truly mixed in full eight-channel sound (including dubbing, scoring, and other sound effects editing). The majority of sound studios still use six-channel (5.1) systems rather than eight-channel (7.1) for editing and production. In addition, the eight-channel recording equipment for SDDS is quite expensive, which has made it difficult for many studios to purchase and add new equipment. This has led to the development of eight-channel recording systems being available only in studios with larger budgets, larger production spaces, and the ability to accommodate more broadcasting equipment.
The first event in the history of value engineering was the asbestos incident at General Electric (GE) in the United States. During World War II, the supply of raw materials in the US market was very tight. GE urgently needed asbestos boards, but the supply of this product was unstable and expensive. The then GE engineer began to study the issue of material substitution. By analyzing the function of the company's use of asbestos boards, it was found that their purpose was to lay on the workshop floor where products were painted to prevent paint from contaminating the floor and causing a fire. Later, Miles found a type of fireproof paper on the market that could serve the same purpose and was cheaper and easier to buy, achieving good economic benefits. This is the earliest case of value engineering application.
The technique of lithography was first invented by Alois Senefelder, a Czech-German, in 1798. At the time, copperplate printing was too expensive, so he used limestone from Bavaria as the material for engraving prints. The stone was originally his tool for adjusting ink. In an accidental situation, his mother asked him to write down a laundry list, but the paper and ink around him were used up, so he had to use his prepared correction fluid (composed of yellow wax, soap, black pigment and water) to write on the stone. Later, out of curiosity, he poured some nitric acid on it; because the correction fluid had anti-corrosion components, the writing protruded, marking the beginning of the use of stone for printing.
The common cause is that some village committees in inland provinces are still held by older generations with traditional views, who believe that family property affairs should be mainly patrilineal, and that anything under a woman's name will become "someone else's" if she marries out, and other strange concepts. Therefore, they do not act according to regulations and unmarried women are especially "guarded" by the village committee and will not easily be allocated land. Many rural women also lack legal awareness and do not know how to appeal for their own rights, thinking that tradition is the norm. In fact, Article 32 of the "Law on the Protection of Women's Rights and Interests" stipulates that women have equal rights with men in rural land contracting, distribution of collective economic organization income, use of land expropriation or requisition compensation, and use of homesteads, and both men and women are members of rural collective economic organizations.
In the final, Spain faced Italy again, a team they had drawn with in the group stage. However, in the final, Spain transformed their "no striker" formation into an "all striker" team, greatly increasing their attacking power. Coupled with injuries to Italy's defence, Spain repeatedly broke through Italy's defensive line. Ultimately, with one goal each from David Villa, Jordi Alba, Fernando Torres and Juan Mata, Spain defeated Italy 4-0. This score is the most lopsided in the history of the European Championship finals, and Spain became the first team to successfully defend the European Championship. In terms of individual awards, Iniesta won the best player of the tournament, while Torres won the top scorer with three goals in less playing time.
The MOMO3, a 10-meter long, 50-centimeter diameter, 1-tonne vehicle capable of carrying a 20-kilogram payload, was originally scheduled to launch on April 30, May 2, and May 3, 2019, but was delayed due to vehicle malfunctions and high-altitude winds. It was launched from the base in Taiki, Hokkaido at 5:45 am on May 4, reaching a maximum altitude of 113.4 kilometers in a weightless environment for 4 minutes, with a total flight time of 515 seconds, before falling into the Pacific Ocean near Hokkaido, 37 kilometers from the launch site. This was the first time a Japanese private company had completed a mission to reach an altitude of 100 kilometers. It is expected to enter the commercial market for small satellite payloads in 2023.
On January 6, 2004, at the 12th South Asian Summit held in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, the concept of a South Asian Free Trade Area was first proposed. This free trade area concept includes a total of 1.4 billion people in South Asia, with the foreign ministers of seven countries including Bhutan, Nepal, India, Maldives, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka advocating for all goods in the South Asian Free Trade Area to be traded duty-free by 2016. This free trade agreement was recognized by the seven South Asian countries in January 2006. Developing countries in South Asia need this free trade agreement. In 2007, as a first step, 20% of tariffs were reduced, with a 20% reduction in tariffs each year until zero tariffs are reached in 2012. Less developed countries such as Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal can delay the reduction to zero tariffs by three years. India and Pakistan have signed but have not yet ratified this agreement.
On January 12, 2020, the Beijing Ditan Hospital affiliated with the Capital Medical University admitted two suspected cases of the 2019 coronavirus disease. The outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease in Beijing prompted the city to activate a level one response to major public health emergencies on January 24 of the same year. As the epidemic eased, Beijing downgraded its emergency response level to level two on April 30, and even further to level three on June 6. Local confirmed cases were temporarily cleared on June 8, but a cluster outbreak at the Xinfadi wholesale market in Beijing on June 11 led the city to re-enter a level two response state. The number of confirmed cases related to this outbreak had reached 335 by July 6, with no further growth. On July 20, Beijing once again downgraded its emergency response mechanism to level three, and the city has since maintained a normalized state of epidemic prevention and control.
By March 23, 2017, after defeating the Saigon Heat in the regular season with a triple-double performance, Eilinor was once again elected as the most valuable player of the game, accumulating 497 points to break the record by a margin of 2 points, and breaking the ABL's five-year record to become the player with the most points in a single ABL season. He was later selected as the ABL regular season's most valuable player, scoring champion, and assist king. However, after blocking an opponent's score in the second round of the playoff finals against the Singapore Slingers on April 18, he was penalized by the referee. Unhappy with the decision, he argued with the referee and received two technical fouls, resulting in his first direct ejection from the game. Despite this, he helped his team win the ABL championship for the first time in a 3-1 series in the five-game, best-of-three finals on April 23. He was also awarded the most valuable foreign player and the most valuable player in the finals.
After washing a transparent plastic bottle, fill it with about 5-10cc of tap water and tightly close the cap. Shake the bottle vigorously for a few seconds to saturate the bottle with water vapor. Then, open the cap and insert a lit incense stick that is emitting visible smoke into the bottle for about a second, then remove the incense stick and immediately close the cap. Now, press hard on the bottle, which is to adiabatically compress the gas inside the bottle to raise its temperature. You can see that the inside of the bottle is transparent. Maintain this for a few seconds to allow the heat to dissipate to the outside. Then, release the bottle to let it rebound, which is to adiabatically expand, the bottle cools down and due to the presence of condensation nuclei, a cloud fills the bottle. If there is no incense smoke, no cloud condensation will occur during the rebound stage. This can be observed by pressing before inserting the incense stick, or by filling the bottle with water to ensure all condensation nuclei are removed and then repeating the experiment.
Beyond: Two Souls runs on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4, using a game controller for operation. Players must switch between the female protagonist Jodie Holmes and the spirit entity Aiden. When controlling Jodie, the game is played from a third-person perspective, with players able to move, fight, interact with the environment, and converse with other characters. During close combat, the game enters slow-motion bullet time for attacks and defenses, and players must determine the direction of Jodie's attack or defense to perform corresponding operations. When controlling Aiden, the screen switches to a first-person perspective. As a spirit, Aiden can pass through objects and walls, and players can control him to influence objects and people around him. Players must control him to help the protagonist clear obstacles, destroy or bounce objects, open doors, attract attention, control enemies, and attack.
Starting from the 1980s, in line with Taiwan's socio-economic development, folk songs also entered a mature and commercialized period. People who started with Western music bands became mainstream, and the market was booming with record companies vying for attention. Songwriting and record production became professional and began to be divided into detailed tasks. The two most mainstream ones were the UFO Records founded by Wu Chu Chu and Peng Guohua (including the four great divas Cai Qin, Huang Yingying, Su Rui, Wang Zhilei, and well-known creators Li Shouquan, Chen Zhiyuan, Chen Lerong, Zhang Yusheng, etc.) and the Rolling Stone Records founded by the Duan Zhongyi and Duan Zhongtan brothers (including famous singers Chen Shuhua, Qi Yu, Pan Yueyun, and well-known creators Luo Dayou, Li Zongsheng, Chen Sheng, Chen Huanzhang (Little Bug), Huang Yunling, etc.). The healthy business competition between the two expanded the record market, created a rich and diverse creative force, and eventually broke the million sales threshold for a single record, becoming a high-value record industry.
American Billboard magazine columnist Tamar Herman analyzed and reviewed the album, stating that "White Night" begins with "Wake Me Up," which introduces and narrates a dream-like love story, followed by "Darling," a pop ballad with a piano background, which has a similar feel to the popular 2014 piano-based "Eyes, Nose, Lips." She praised Taeyang for exploring a variety of emotions in this album with deeply moving melodies and heartfelt lyrics, demonstrating his limitless musical ability. She also highly praised the music videos, noting that "Darling" includes scenes that emit a romantic and lonely atmosphere from Los Angeles and Alaska, while "Wake Me Up" presents various scenes as if singing in a dream.
Xiao Yi was the seventh son of Emperor Wu of Liang, Xiao Yan. From a young age, he showed exceptional talent in literature and arts. He was able to write poetry at the age of six and was renowned for his "triple excellence" in writing, calligraphy, and painting. His influence was significant on Tang Dynasty poets Gao Shi and Cen Shen, as well as the literary work "Jin Lou Zi". His contributions to literature and the history of painting during the Southern and Northern Dynasties were extremely important. His monumental historical work, "Jin Lou Zi", was included in the Hundred Schools of Thought and was one of the representatives of divination during the Southern and Northern Dynasties. In terms of military strategy, he made significant contributions to quelling the rebellion of the famous general Hou Jing. In addition to his achievements in identifying and employing talent, he also had deep knowledge in music, traditional Chinese medicine, astronomy, and calendrical science. His philosophical writings were abundant and he was reputed to be a nine-dan Go player. He even pioneered a new school of horse riding. His governance in Jiangling was highly effective. Considering the breadth and depth of his knowledge and the fact that he only lived to be 46 and relied on auditory memory, he can be considered one of the rare geniuses in human history.
Job improvement is an important analysis method in human resource management and job management. It mainly involves a deep understanding of personnel responsibilities or work processes, breaking down each work step and procedure, and recording the nature of each segment of work, the auxiliary tools required, the work actions, the time spent, and the related costs. Then, each project is analyzed for its necessity, whether the sequence should be reorganized, whether there are new ways to improve, and even the arrangement and planning of space configuration. Through the detailed analysis of the work and subsequent job improvements, the most suitable work schedule is redesigned to improve employee performance and job satisfaction, in order to achieve the various goals of corporate management.
Founded in 1971, Hong Kong Shue Yan College was registered as Hong Kong Shue Yan University in 1976 under the Post-Secondary Colleges Ordinance. However, because Shue Yan University did not follow the government's implementation of a three-year university system and continued to offer a four-year bachelor's degree program, it did not receive government funding like the Baptist College and Lingnan College that complied with the government's restructuring requirements. This greatly limited the development of the school, which could only award honorary diplomas and not official degrees. It was not until the Hong Kong government supported the development of private universities after 2000 and planned to implement a 3-3-4 education system that Shue Yan University was allowed to offer recognized bachelor's degree programs. After passing a subject area review, Hong Kong Shue Yan University was officially renamed by the government in December 2006, becoming the first private university in Hong Kong. Shue Yan University remained the only private university in Hong Kong until October 2018.
The county road number in Hefei starts with a capital "X" followed by three digits. The proposed (pending approval) cross-city/county road number starts with "0", while the county road numbers for Feidong County, Fexi County, Changfeng County, Lujiang County, Chaohu City, Yaohai District, Luyang District, Shushan District, and Baohe District start with "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9" respectively. The second digit represents the basic direction of the route, with "0" for circular routes, odd numbers for north-south routes, and even numbers for east-west routes. The third digit is written in the order of the starting town (street). The first two digits of the county road numbers for the Economic Development Zone, High-tech Zone, and Hefei-Chaohu Economic Development Zone are "29", "89", "19", and "59" respectively.
Not much oral tradition has been passed down about the myth of Lululuan. It is known that he may have originally come from the Piuma tribe (located in present-day Taiwu Township, with some saying he came from the eastern Puyuma tribe), and was one of the four ancestors of the Piuma tribe (the other three were Ngarhangarhan, Tauiung, and Kaitjang, all his brothers). For unknown reasons, he left the area with his wife Rhugilingan and moved west in search of other habitable places. He eventually established a tribe in a place called Kurasa/Kurasaru, where he and his wife had four children: Alisu, Drumetj, Ljemedj, and Dravai.
The Next Generation Patrol Vessel (NGPV) project, originally proposed by Malaysia in the early 1990s, was awarded to Germany (Kedah-class frigates, MEKO 100 RMN). The original agreement was for the first two vessels to be completed in Germany and then shipped to the Penang Shipbuilding Industry Company in Malaysia for assembly. Subsequent ships were to be built by Blohm+Voss with the assistance of the Penang Shipbuilding Industry Company. Two years later, the contract was amended, with the first two vessels to be completed in Germany and then delivered to the Royal Malaysian Navy. The project was originally estimated to cost 24.3 billion ringgit, with 27 vessels to be purchased in batches over 20 years. However, due to continuous delays and cost overruns, the construction of the remaining 21 vessels was cancelled and re-tendered. The project name was also changed to the Second Generation Patrol Vessels/Littoral Combat Ship (SGPV/LCS), and the contract was awarded to the Maharaja Lela-class, derived from the French Gowind-class frigate design.
A year after the Resistance successfully evaded the pursuit of the First Order, Supreme Leader Kylo Ren continued to suppress rebellions on other planets. He became aware of a vast dark force lurking deep in the "Unknown Regions" through a Sith wayfinder he found. Following the clues, he eventually found the source of this dark power in a massive, gloomy building on Exegol, deep in the "Unknown Regions": Emperor Palpatine of the Galactic Empire, who was supposed to have been dead for over thirty years. The Emperor officially announced his survival to the entire galaxy. Kylo Ren subsequently made a deal with him: once Kylo Ren killed the last Jedi, Rey, the Sith fleet "Final Order" hidden on the planet would be incorporated under the First Order, and Kylo Ren would become the Emperor of the new Galactic Empire.
The Tsengwen Reservoir is located in the Tsengwen River basin, which is 138.47 kilometers long and covers an area of 1,176 square kilometers, making it the fourth largest river in Taiwan. Its average annual flow is 1.6 billion cubic meters, and the average annual flow at the dam site is 1.064 billion cubic meters. The Japanese engineer Yoichi Hatta, who designed the Chianan Canal in the early days, built the Wushantou Reservoir upstream of the Guantian River, a tributary of the Tsengwen River, and set up a dam on the Dapu River to draw water through a tunnel to the Wushantou Reservoir for irrigation in the Chianan area. However, the water extraction rate was only 25% of the total flow (according to the Tsengwen Reservoir Construction Record, the original water usage of the Wushantou Reservoir before the construction of the Tsengwen Reservoir was 330 million cubic meters). Therefore, if a dam is directly built on the main stream of the Dapu River in the Tsengwen River, and it is operated in series with the Wushantou Reservoir, the irrigation volume can be increased. For this reason, in 1939, Yoichi Hatta once suggested building a dam at the current dam site, but it was abandoned due to the war.
In 2006, with a batting average of 0.336, 26 home runs, and 88 RBIs, he won the Triple Crown, becoming the first player to achieve this since Lee Man-soo of the Samsung Lions in 1984. However, he lost the MVP vote to Ryu Hyun-jin, who also won the Triple Crown for pitchers. This established Lee Dae-ho's formidable batting ability in Korean professional baseball. On August 14, 2010, in a game against the Kia Tigers, he hit home runs in nine consecutive games, setting a world record that still stands. That year, he won the Triple Crown again, becoming the first player in the history of Korean professional baseball to achieve this twice, and won the MVP award.
"Xuan Zhe" is the twentieth album by Zhang Xinzhe, released in April 1998. It is a Chinese and English selection of his personal works released by EMI about a year after he left Kowloon Bay. The selected songs are the essence of his less than three years at EMI. Although his time at Bay was short, it was the peak of his singing career, especially in 1996 when he won the Golden Melody Award for Best Mandarin Male Singer. These three years were also when Zhang Xinzhe's singing skills were at their best, whether in Mandarin, Cantonese or English songs. The singles "Don't Tell Him", "Over Fire", "Too Want to Love You", "I'm Real", "Use Love" and "Suffering" have all become widely sung classic works.
Between 1948 and 1952, Dalian University introduced nearly a hundred scholars from home and abroad, including Wang Ganchang (a famous nuclear physicist and the "father of China's atomic bomb"), Wang Daheng (a famous optical scientist and the founder of China's optical science), Zhang Dayu (a famous physical chemist and one of the founders of China's catalytic science), Qian Lingxi (an educator and the founder of China's computational mechanics), Wu Shisu (a theoretical physicist), Bi Dexian (an electronic scientist and the founder of China's radar technology), Yang Yu (a ship engineering expert), Peng Shaoyi (a petroleum chemist and catalytic scientist), Hou Yufen (a dye chemist), Wang Xiji (a physicist), Lin Jifang (a chemical engineering expert), and other famous scholars. They established eight departments, including Mathematics, Physics, Telecommunications, Electrical Engineering, Hydraulic Engineering, Chemical Engineering, Shipbuilding, Mechanical Engineering, Metallurgy, and scientific research institutes.
The cosmic monsters that have been fighting with Topless turned out to be evolved from the automatic defense system left by the predecessors, and the alien Buster team is the real cosmic monster. Topless is just a kind of human mutation disease. "Laluko" became self-destructive after learning the truth and had a conflict with Nono. Later, under the leadership of Nono, the cosmic army went to investigate a giant true cosmic monster sealed in a black hole. However, at this time, the true cosmic monster broke out of the black hole. In front of the true cosmic monster of the size of a planet, all attacks by Nono and "Laluko" could not harm it at all. Just as "Laluko" was preparing to create another black hole with Nono to launch a suicide attack on the true cosmic monster, Nono suddenly left, leaving "Laluko" in shock.
Unlike the State Duma, where party-affiliated departments are evident, the Senate clearly shows no existence of any party. In 2001, about a hundred senators formed a relatively loose party group, almost supporting all the policies of the then President Putin. However, it was even more disappointing that after Mironov was elected chairman in 2002, all party groups were disbanded. Although consensus is not the most important thing in a democratic country, the Federal Committee of the Senate of Congress has difficulty in forming a considerable consensus, making it difficult to pass any resolution. Bills are more likely to be passed after debates with the chairman or various committees, and senators themselves are asked not to reflect the original ideology of the party in the proceedings. After the reform in 2000, the committee obviously leaned towards the Kremlin authorities, making it easy for important bills to pass to meet the requirements of the Kremlin.
Arab geographers wrote in 985 AD about inns and hotels in the Palestinian region of Greater Syria for travelers to rest. Makdisi mentioned in the literature: "The taxes levied in Syria are not heavy, but the taxes levied in the caravan stations are an exception. Travelers in the station will be charged with extremely harsh high taxes..." The taxes mentioned here refer to the tariffs levied by local government officials on imported goods and commodities. Usually, merchants on the journey will stay or rest in the station with their livestock responsible for carrying goods. Each door in the station will have guards to ensure that the merchants coming in and out will pay the taxes on the goods they carry in full. The levied goods tariffs were one of the main sources of income for the Fatimid Dynasty at that time.
On May 25, 2021, the group announced that it had entered into a sales agreement to sell 70% of its stake in Wuhan Huaxian Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan Huaxian Optoelectronics) to its affiliated company Wuhan Huaxing Optoelectronics Technology Co., Ltd. Wuhan Huaxian Optoelectronics is engaged in the business of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") module. The sale of Wuhan Huaxian Optoelectronics was completed on June 30, 2021, and the net proceeds of approximately RMB 286 million will be used to build a new touch-integrated display module smart factory in Chenjiang, Huizhou, with a planned total construction area of about 100,000 square meters, for the production of mobile phones, smart wearables, medium-sized products and other new products' A-SI modules. The project will gradually start production by the end of 2022, and the intelligent production equipment and fully automated production line in the factory will ensure maximum production efficiency, and it is expected that the production capacity will gradually increase in the next five years.
In the semi-finals, Portugal, led by captain Cristiano Ronaldo, who plays for Real Madrid alongside Gareth Bale of Wales, faced off. Due to the astronomical market value of these two well-known players, both reaching the billion-dollar level, this match was dubbed by many fans as the "two billion battle" or the "billionaire men's duel". However, key players from both sides were unable to play due to injuries or suspensions, resulting in a goalless first half. It wasn't until the 50th minute of the second half that Portugal's captain Ronaldo scored a header from a corner kick, taking the lead. Less than three minutes later, Nani scored a goal from a Ronaldo-like pass, changing the direction of the ball and scoring. Despite Wales' relentless attacks to equalize the score before the end of the match, Portugal held on to their lead, ultimately advancing to the final with a 2-0 victory.
In July 2016, Lucas returned to Hong Kong to join the Hong Kong Premier League team Tai Po. On September 9, he scored his first goal for the team in a league match against HKFC, helping Tai Po to a 2-1 victory. Later, on October 23, during stoppage time in a match against R&F, a conflict broke out due to a foul on Tai Po player Lee Ka Yiu by an R&F player. Lucas was praised by fans for protecting Lee throughout the conflict. After joining the team, Lucas became the team's top scorer, scoring 17 goals in 23 matches, including a goal in the final of the Elite Cup on May 3, 2017, which helped Tai Po to a 2-1 victory over Hong Kong Pegasus. After the match, he was named the Most Valuable Player of the tournament.
The elevated three-story station, approximately 83 meters long and 21.5 meters wide, is located in the middle of Section 3, Kangning Road. Due to the station body crossing over Wufen Street Skybridge to the north and needing to cross over the Zhongshan Freeway to the south, the station height reaches 20 meters (equivalent to 6 stories high), also known as the "Skytop Metro Station", setting the current record for the highest station body (another record is that Dongmen Station has the deepest station body). The station has two side platforms located on the upper level of the station, with a platform length of 93.5 meters. The lower level is the station's corridor, with three entrances and exits located on the east and west sides of Section 3, Kangning Road. The east side is located on Ankang Park on Lane 245, Section 3, Kangning Road, and the west side is located on the green belt between Nanhu High School and Nanhu Elementary School. The design for part of the Minsheng-Xizhi Line is still in progress.

Located between Yancheng and Guogang (Dingyan), it worships the Heavenly Mother (Second Mother), who set sail from Quanzhou Port in mainland China in the 29th year of the Qianlong era (1764) to help seafarers cross to Dagou. When the ship sailed into the inner and outer waters of Guogang, a storm arose at night, capsizing the ship. The Second Mother manifested herself and sent her golden body to the edge of the sand dune. That night, a divine light appeared, and the villagers went to investigate and brought the golden statue back home for worship. At that time, a bamboo hut was built for daily incense offerings. Later, disciples asked her to practice medicine to save the world. After the restoration, the elders asked for the golden statue back and built a temple in 1960, which was completed and consecrated in 1961, named "Anle Palace". Due to the old and unusable building structure, it was rebuilt in 2003 and completed in 2011, becoming the territorial master of the Yangan area.
The 9th seat of the Round Table Knights, holder of the ancient elven artifact "Magic Sword of Transformation," nicknamed "Superman Magic Sword," is the puppet master behind the Kingdom of Oriana. He has been secretly controlling the kingdom and attempting to seize the power of the Black Rose to summon the Twilight of the Gods. After his plan was fully exposed to the people of the kingdom, he used the Black Rose to try to kill all the citizens, but was defeated by Beta and Epsilon. Along the way, he revealed the true history of the kingdom and the research report of the church's investigation, but unexpectedly, everything was in the hands of the others, leading to the complete failure of his plan. In the end, he swallowed a piece of the Twilight of the Gods' flesh in an attempt to resist, but was still defeated by the shadow and evaporated into nothingness. His failure was even described by the shadow as beast-like. His skull was later transported to Japan, where it was recovered by the shadow and Beta, and the Black Rose was revived, becoming the key to their return.

This program began recruiting citizens to volunteer (commonly known as "cat volunteers") in 2000. Applicants needed to provide information such as the location, street name, and area conditions. The program team would meet with the applicants to understand whether they were suitable to serve as volunteer caregivers and to answer any questions about participating in the program. They would also visit the proposed location to assess whether it was suitable for the program. If the location was on private property, permission from the property management was required. Once approved, volunteers would receive an identification card and be responsible for caring for stray cats in a specific area, regularly reporting on the situation of the stray cats in the area. Volunteers were expected to bear the costs of cat food, supplies, transportation, and veterinary care.
After the War of Wrath, Morgoth was overthrown, and the Silmarils were claimed by the Valar. Maedhros and Maglor demanded the Silmarils, but Eonwe, the keeper of the Silmarils, stated that due to the evil deeds of the sons of Feanor, they had lost their right to the Silmarils and were to be judged by the Valar in Valinor. Maglor agreed with Eonwe, but Maedhros did not. They killed the guards and took the Silmarils, but the light of the Silmarils burned Maedhros's hand until it was unbearable. It was then that Maedhros realized that they had truly lost their right to the Silmarils. In extreme pain and despair, he jumped into a chasm in the earth with his share of the Silmarils, falling into the roaring flames, where he was consumed.
Every time a building, natural scene, painting, or natural sound appears, the narrator recites a poem from the Windmill Poetry Society. After each poem, the narrator discusses with one of the poets or reads a letter from a poet that seems to be addressed to the narrator as a member of the Windmill Poetry Society. The order is Shui Yinping (Yang Chichang), discussing the style of the poem, what a true poem should look like, the state of the poem, and timely pointing out the difference between the Windmill Poetry Society and the literary world at the time. The concept is somewhat similar to that proposed by Xichuan Man, who advocated fecal realism, but emphasized that the Taiwan Literary Association at the time did not pay attention to Taiwanese youth who were passionate about Japanese culture, and emphasized the independence of literature, which is somewhat distant from the resolution of the literary battle by the Taiwan Literature Service Association in Taipei in November 1943 based on the imperial spirit.
Japanese scholar Ma Yuandong, based on the legends of Malas and the customs of the Shemagan tribe and the surrounding Puyuma people, such as swinging during festivals, the position of the leader and property being passed on to the eldest regardless of gender, which are similar to the Paiwan tribe, believes that this was the influence of the subordinates brought from the original tribe when Malas and Dugu were married, and the intermarriage and cohabitation with the Puyuma tribe. In addition, some people, based on the significant difference between the number of generations of the Shemagan tribe's leaders and the Zhiben tribe (when the Zhiben tribe had passed on to the 15th or 16th generation since Xihaxihao, Shemagan had already passed on 60 generations since Dugu), judged that the Shemagan tribe adopted the "long extinguishing young and" (the younger generation takes over after the elder generation dies, and then passes on to the next generation of the elder generation) inheritance system, which is also very similar to the customs of the Paiwan tribe.

He was deceived by Toyohime into believing he had arrived at the Dragon Palace and lived in the Moon Capital for three years before wanting to return. Toyohime revealed the truth to Eirin, who initially suggested killing him, but Toyohime took pity on him and couldn't bear to do so. In the end, Eirin suggested putting him into hibernation for three hundred years and sending him back with a jade box. After returning, he opened the jade box and turned into an old man. His story in the Moon Capital was considered by the then Emperor Junna to be the country of Penglai, and after his death, he was bestowed the title of Simplified River Great God and a shrine was built to worship him.

At a time when Kyushu was unoccupied by Hidekazu and Munemasa, on October 14, Kuroda Josui and Kato Naomasa attacked Hidekazu's residence, Kurume Castle, with 37,000 men. The castle was defended by only about 500 soldiers and vassals such as Kashiwabara Hiroshige and Shirai Kageyoshi. According to the "Biography of Kuroda Josui," Hidekazu had instructed his two vassals before the battle that if they heard of the defeat of the Western Army and Kurume Castle was attacked by the Eastern Army, they must defend it to the death. If the castle was about to be breached, they were to kill Hidekazu's wife and son and fight to the death. However, if the opposing force was Kuroda Josui's army, due to the good relations between the two families and Hidekazu's belief that Josui was a man of honor, and both families were Christians, he specifically instructed them not to fight, but to open the city and entrust the protection of Hidekazu's wife and son to them.

"Good Morning, Sir" is a television series produced by Television Broadcasts Limited (TVB) to celebrate its anniversary (commonly known as "anniversary drama"), with a school theme. The script editor of the drama, Jia Weinan, said that everyone had complaints such as "too much homework" and "no freedom" during their school days, hoping to grow up quickly and venture into the world without constraints. It was not until they grew up that they realized the complexity of the world, and then they missed their school days. However, these school days have become memories, gone forever, and the audience can only find resonance on the screen. This is the biggest reason why school dramas must exist. He said that TVB also explores school dramas, and will launch one every once in a while to awaken the audience's memories of school days and let the audience get moved by immersing themselves in it.

He Dudulin's academic performance was average during his time at the National Art Special, but his technical performance was excellent. However, due to the school's emphasis on academic professionalism, He Dudulin repeatedly violated school rules by accepting commercial performances, and was penalized twice for major violations and once for a minor violation. He was also frequently warned for skipping classes. Although the school dealt with his behavior according to regulations, knowing his family situation and based on the relationship of cherishing and loving talent, his teachers often pleaded for him to keep his student status. At the age of 19, as his specialist course was coming to an end, He Dudulin received a full scholarship from the leading ballet academy in Vancouver, Canada (Wu Zhujie Ballet Academy), hoping to cultivate him to study in Canada. However, due to military service issues, he was unable to go. At that time, He Dudulin, who was on the verge of dropping out, was also disinterested in staying at the Art Special, so he decided to take a break from school to serve in the military. This was a crucial turning point for He Dudulin to become a professional artist.

Mu Agaige was not the first person born in the tribe. Long before her birth, the earliest pair of men and women in the tribe were born near a large banyan tree under a giant rock near the spring under the current Jilu tribe. After the couple married and had many descendants, they formed a tribe. However, because they lacked the ability to lead the tribe, they prayed to the gods for a noble who could lead the tribe. The gods put a giant egg in an ancient pottery pot of the tribe through the sunlight, and Mu Agaige was born from it. However, this act of the ancestors also caused dissatisfaction among some tribesmen, so a part of them migrated out of the tribe and disappeared after moving around in Maolin District, suspected of merging with the Paridradhane tribe of the Paiwan tribe.
In contrast to the comedic approach of the previous work "Ultraman R/B", this work takes a more serious route compared to "Ultraman Taro". This work incorporates more elements related to "Ultraman Seven" and "The Return of Ultraman", with the contrasting theme being "diversity". It develops along the line of "aliens secretly living on Earth coexisting with humans". Unlike the new generation of hero series in recent years, this work retains the elements of a serial drama, but adopts the format of past "sci-fi standalone dramas" and introduces many new character groups. Moreover, it depicts more tragic endings in some stories.
On March 1, 2014, Galen signed with the Austrian Super League club St. Pölten, but due to a lack of playing opportunities, he transferred to the Jordanian club Shabab Al-Ordon in 2015. On September 3, 2015, he joined the Cypriot First Division club Aris Limassol, but left in December due to the club's failure to pay wages. He then joined the Romanian club Săgeata Năvodari, where he teamed up with his compatriot Lodi Gus, but unfortunately, they also encountered the same fate of unpaid wages. Therefore, in 2016, he played for the Indonesian club Persela and the Finnish club RoPS, even helping the former to be selected as the best team in July.

In late August 2017, Leso, Zodi, and Danny completed seven years of residence in Hong Kong, becoming permanent residents. In early September, they decided to apply to renounce their Spanish nationality and apply for a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport, which they received on October 3rd. On the same day, due to the withdrawal of three players from the Hong Kong team due to injuries and personal reasons, the then head coach of the Hong Kong team, Kim Pan-gon, immediately selected them to join the team to participate in international matches against Laos and Malaysia. Coach Kim Pan-gon even suggested that Leso was a good replacement for the injured Fatus in the next two matches. Leso made his debut for the Hong Kong team in an international A-level match against the Laos national team at home on October 5th, and was substituted at halftime to save energy for the match against Malaysia, helping Hong Kong to a 4-0 victory.
On January 29, 2022, Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission, stated at a press conference of the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism that there were public reactions to some places not allowing people from low-risk areas to return home for the New Year, forcibly requiring returning people to pay for centralized isolation, and arbitrarily extending the duration of centralized isolation and home health monitoring. The comprehensive team of the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism requires that "people from other places should not be arbitrarily prohibited from returning home for the New Year", "the scope of travel restrictions should not be arbitrarily expanded", "the scope of travel restrictions should not be expanded from medium and high-risk areas to the entire city and province", "compulsory persuasion to return and centralized isolation measures should not be taken for people returning from low-risk areas", and "the duration of centralized isolation observation and home health monitoring should not be arbitrarily extended".

When she learned that the Pretty Cure of Light intended to take the Disease Demon Shard in her possession, she directly used the Disease Demon Shard to strengthen herself again. Although she was extremely powerful after the second enhancement, she was distracted by the Angel of Twinkle's deception about the new Disease Demon King, and was severely injured by the individual techniques of the Angel of Grace, the Angel of Holy Spring, and the Angel of Earth. She was eventually purified by all the Pretty Cure of Light, but even when all the Pretty Cure of Light attacked her with the "Pretty Cure Final Cure Baptism", she was only on the verge of death. It was only after Latte hinted that the initial three Pretty Cure of Light learned and used the "Pretty Cure Cure Oasis" that she was successfully purified and disappeared, and her remaining power was absorbed by the Angel of Earth.
After the performance, the results were announced. A total of 249 tickets were sold, just one short of the target. Just as they were about to accept the reality, Yasushi Akimoto arrived on time and found a pile of notes from Yoshiyuki Yoshinaga, which made Akimoto acknowledge the hard work of the research students. He decided to buy the last 10,000 yen ticket, successfully completing the task. This created a legendary chapter for Shinori in AKB. Her efforts made the whole team shine and attracted the core members of AKB's three teams, TeamA's Minami Takahashi, TeamK's Yuko Oshima, and TeamB's Mayu Watanabe, to ask her out and invite her to join their teams. They aimed to make her the future center and team leader. However, Yasushi Akimoto intervened during the scramble to recruit Shinori (by taking the research student's photo to compete for their own team members), stating that he would decide which team she would join.

On December 30th, the official trailer titled "New Moon" was released at midnight. The video begins with Go Won flying in space looking at Earth, then connects with Hyunjin looking up at the night sky. Butterflies, the symbolic animal of Go Won, appear and disappear in the night sky, documenting the bond between the two. The scene then shifts to Yves and ViVi, featuring the roller skates from "new" and an apple, along with brief glimpses of Ji Jin and Olivia Hye from "Egoist". In the latter part, Chuu appears, reversing the atmosphere, and scenes of Iceland glowing green and HaSeul appear. The new circular logo disappears through motion, indicating that the worldview of LOONA, "LOONAVERSE", will undergo expansion and change.
When the film was first released, it included the lines: "Guess who's coming to dinner now?" The response was a sarcastic: "The Reverend Martin Luther King?" However, following the assassination of Martin Luther King on April 4, 1968, this line was removed from subsequent screenings. By August 1968, it had been omitted from almost all cinema screenings of the film. In 1969, the line was restored in some film copies, but in all video and DVD releases of the film, the line has been preserved.
The single-door version NL262 with the number HKR115 was written off in 2004 due to a serious traffic accident, in which it collided head-on with a mud truck in Tung Chung. Subsequently, with the introduction of the DB03R service to and from Sunny Bay Station, and the continuous influx of new buildings, the Discovery Bay fleet was insufficient. Coincidentally, Citybus was planning to sell some of its single-deck buses. Discovery Bay, which had a large number of MAN buses, purchased 5 NL262/R (former numbers 1570-1574) from Citybus. They were refurbished in the Citybus factory, with all the seats replaced with leather ones, yellow handrails installed, the single seat next to the entrance door converted into a luggage rack, and the original Brose electronic sign replaced with a Lite Vision orange LED electronic sign. The buses were repainted in the colours of the Discovery Bay Transportation Services Limited and adjusted to match the interior tone of the fleet. They now serve the residents of Discovery Bay with a brand new look. One of them was also renumbered as HKR115 (now known as DBAY115).
"Dongtang Spring" ultimately produced an animation that was different from the typical magical girl series. Because the target audience of this animation was school children, and to differentiate it from other animations of the same type, the characters in this work used a costume change where they put on witch costumes directly, rather than the mainstream transformation with nudity scenes at the time. They did not directly use witches as the main characters, but ordinary human children with the secret identity of "witch apprentices". The work used a lot of musical elements and terms, and borrowed elements and names from "Sally the Witch". Before almost every episode's opening song, there was a hint of the plot of the episode, which lasted about 20 seconds. This setting was also almost continuously used in Dongtang Spring's subsequent animations, and became its characteristic.
During its broadcast, the show experienced multiple prime time schedule changes. Initially, the ratings were poor, with an average rating of only 21 points in the first two weeks, and subsequently fell to less than 20 points. For two weeks, the ratings were even surpassed by "Today's Real D" broadcasted on Asia Television's local channel at the same time slot, resulting in the broadcast time being repeatedly postponed to 23:00 and 23:15. By the end of 1995, new characters such as Double Double, Good Aunt, Cat Shit, Li Sheng, Joan, etc. joined, and the ratings gradually rebounded, allowing the show to be broadcast earlier at 20:30, 22:00 and 22:20. In response to the premiere of Asia Television's "Goodbye Sunny Days", episodes 247-343 were extended to 45 minutes each (including advertisements). The last episode of that year was episode 402, which was broadcast on December 30 (Monday).

However, the maximum time they can currently spend together is only 12 seconds.
The Microsoft Certified Professional Developer (MCPD) is an intermediate certification designed by Microsoft for software developers. It is on the same level as MCITP and is tested based on specific job tasks. Unlike the MCTS, which only tests software development skills, the MCPD exam focuses on the ability to design and develop the overall architecture and components of an application. Design decisions are the main focus of the MCPD exam, making it quite difficult for candidates without considerable experience to pass. Since its introduction in late 2005, the number of people who have passed the MCPD: Enterprise Application Developer (equivalent to the previous MCSD) is only about 1/5 of the number of MCSDs (6,567 people).
Back pain is the price humans pay for walking upright. In animals that walk on all fours, the spine is like a bridge and is less affected by gravity. However, in upright walking humans, the spine is like a pillar supporting a house, often referred to as the "dragon bone" in Chinese culture, bearing most of the body's weight and external forces. It is easy to have problems due to overload, so almost everyone has experienced back pain. According to statistics, about 80% of people have had their lives and work affected by back pain. Dr. Gao Ming's lecture on the causes and related diseases of back pain, such as sciatica and bone spurs, addresses this modern civilization's problem!
Continuing the plot of "Breath of the Wild", after defeating the Demon Calamity Ganon with Knight Link, Princess Zelda and Link begin to restore the Kingdom of Hyrule together. The story starts with Zelda and Link investigating the miasma in the underground of Hyrule Castle, where they discover the remnants of the ancient civilization of Lonau. They then find the body of Calamity Ganon, with a glowing arm stuck in it, in a deeper part of the castle's underground. This body suddenly revives as they approach, causing Link to be seriously injured in order to protect Zelda, and his weapon, the Master Sword, decays as a result. Zelda then falls into the collapsing ground and disappears.
Later, Phrixus, who rode on the golden ram Krysomallos, finally arrived in Colchis (a historical region in Western Asia, roughly equivalent to modern Georgia) on the eastern side of the Black Sea. Aeëtes, the king of Colchis and Aea (a mythical country in Asia, often confused with Colchis), sympathized with Phrixus's misfortunes and experiences. He and his daughter, Princess Chalciope, not only warmly welcomed and took good care of Phrixus, but also treasured the fleece of Krysomallos as a national treasure. (Another version says that Phrixus and Helle arrived safely in Colchis, where King Aeëtes warmly welcomed them). Later, Phrixus married Chalciope and they lived a happy life.
From 1916 to 1926, Cai Dongfan spent ten years of hard work, with rich knowledge and astonishing perseverance, to complete the popular histories of the Former Han, Later Han, Two Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, Tang Dynasty, Five Dynasties, Song Dynasty, Yuan Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, Qing Dynasty, and the Republic of China, collectively known as "The Popular Histories of All Dynasties" (also known as "The Popular Histories of Chinese Dynasties").

In his lifetime, he wrote 13 books and wrote more than 7 million words. The enormity of his work can be described as a miracle of historical romance, and he is hailed as "a historian of a generation, a divine pen for a thousand autumns".
The Bigeye Golden Barb (scientific name: "Sinocyclocheilus macrophthalmus"), also known as the Bigeye Golden Carp, is a species of the Cyprinidae family. This species is found in the underground river basins of Du'an Yao Autonomous County and Dahua County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of China. The fish has a laterally compressed body, a large head, a blunt snout, large eyes, and two pairs of barbels. Its body is covered in scales, with a complete lateral line and 55-69 lateral line scales. The tail fin is forked, with 12 dorsal fin rays that harden at the ends and have a serrated appearance. The anal fin has 8 soft rays, and there are 39 vertebrae. The body color is semi-transparent, with a distinct dark brown stripe at the base of the tail fin. The fish can reach a length of 4.7 cm. It inhabits the middle layer of cave bottoms, but its habits are not well known.
It is said that once during a famine among the Kanakanavu people, a tribesman digging for food accidentally stumbled upon the cave where Dabuzalai lived. However, they did not harm him, but instead invited him to stay and live with them for a while, feeding him cakes made from millet and teaching him farming methods. When the tribesman was about to return, they gave him a bag of millet seeds (some say also tree beans and soybeans) and asked him to invite them to taste the new rice after the millet harvest. The Kanakanavu people began to host them every year, but for some unknown reason, Dabuzalai never appeared again. The tribespeople still prepare food for them every year, which gradually evolved into the Mikongu Festival.
In 1956, Chen Wenmin founded Daming Film Company and began investing in film production. During the shooting of "Xue Rengui's Eastern Expedition", due to a conflict between the director Shao Luohui and the investors, Shao left in anger. Chen Wenmin then took over the reshooting and editing work. After the film achieved good box office results, Chen Wenmin, encouraged by everyone, shot his first feature film "Lost Bird". Subsequent works include "Bitter Love", "Seductress", "Pitiful Daughter-in-law", "Beggar's Son-in-law", etc., all of which are family ethics tragedies that are popular with female audiences and have sparked media discussions. This made Chen Wenmin extremely popular, and he had a dedicated white tricycle for his travels.
The 2019 Clash Royale Professional League was the second edition of the Clash Royale Professional League, an esports competition hosted by Supercell. This edition merged the European, North American, and Latin American regions into a single Western region, leaving the other regions unchanged, resulting in only three regions. The Chinese region began its spring season on March 22, while the Asian and Western regions started their spring seasons on April 29 and May 29 respectively. The top three teams from each region's spring season were eligible to participate in the WCG event held in China, while the top two teams from each region's autumn season could participate in the Clash Royale Professional League Global Finals held in Los Angeles, USA, to determine the world champion for 2019.
Ninjas who have tailed beasts sealed within them not only bear the responsibility of sealing the beasts, but also utilize their power to become an important force in their ninja village. However, when using the tailed beast's chakra, they are also influenced by the beast (for example, the one-tail jinchuriki cannot have a stable sleep, and the nine-tails jinchuriki is affected by the negative thoughts of the nine-tails when drawing chakra). As a result, most jinchuriki are in a state of emotional instability for a long time. In severe cases, the tailed beast may even go berserk, causing great damage to the village. This leads the villagers to equate the jinchuriki with the tailed beasts, and almost anyone who is a jinchuriki is discriminated against by the entire village, has no popularity, and no one cares about them even when something big happens.

The method involves first placing the beef (usually a lean cut like tenderloin) in the freezer for about an hour, then peeling and cutting the pear into thick strips and soaking them in a sugar water solution (mainly to prevent the pear strips from oxidizing and changing color) and setting it aside in the refrigerator. Then, take the not fully frozen beef from the freezer, cut it into strips like the pear, and mix it with seasonings (sweet soy sauce, honey, sesame, green onion, minced raw garlic, black pepper, and sesame oil). Then, take out the pear strips that have been soaked in sugar water from the refrigerator and lay them flat on a plate, place the beef that has been mixed with the sauce on top, and finally top it with a raw egg.

This museum is renowned for its collection of American modern art, some of which is newer than that of other modern art museums. Before the establishment of the Whitney Museum, American art was quite conservative and Eurocentric for 30 years, with exhibitions, purchases, and education almost entirely led by the National Academy of Design. Therefore, the establishment of the Whitney Museum broke the conservatism of American art. In 1918, what started as an annual exhibition of the members of the Artists Club, known as the Whitney Studio Club, attracted more and more contemporary American artists. By 1928, the membership had grown to around 800, and preparations began for the establishment of a museum, which officially opened in the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1931.
On the evening of September 6, 2011, in the Xishan Huafu community in Haidian District, Beijing, a couple driving their own Buick car were about to turn into the south gate of the community without using their turn signal, nearly colliding with a BMW car (without a license plate) and an Audi car (Jin O00888) behind them. After an argument, the couple was beaten by the BMW and Audi drivers, who shouted, "Who dares to call 110!" The attackers were surrounded by more than 100 homeowners, and their escape route was blocked by a Toyota off-road vehicle. The two car owners later abandoned their cars and fled, but were subsequently controlled and taken away by the police. The couple was sent to the hospital for treatment; the husband's head was stitched with 11 stitches, and the wife's head was treated and is now out of danger.
The single was initially announced at the "SKE48 Theater 6th Anniversary Eve Festival" held on October 4, 2014, and the song and selected members were first revealed at the "SKE48 Review Time Best Song 242 ~1st Place" held at the Nagoya International Conference Hall on November 2, 2014. Unlike previous singles, the center members of this single were not the first generation members Jurina Matsui or Rena Matsui, but rather the bold choice of 6th generation member Ryoha Kitagawa and 5th generation member Anmi Miyamae, who was selected for the first time. In addition, the 22 selected members for the single broke the record for the most number of selected members in SKE48's history.

When non-local residents move into the residential area planned by the player, they initially set up small tents. As the player gradually provides services such as drinking water, food, religion, entertainment, education, health, and daily necessities, they will gradually upgrade to the highest level of civilian housing, "luxury houses". If the luxury houses are upgraded again, they will become mansions, that is, noble houses. The residents of these houses will automatically become noble residents. Although they will not provide labor for the player's city, the taxes paid by these houses far exceed those of civilians. If advanced services, goods, and satisfaction are provided, they will eventually be upgraded to the highest level of noble houses, "luxury palaces".
After the split, the Greek-Bactrian Kingdom gradually weakened. In 168 BC, the Greek noble Eucratides I occupied the homeland of the Greek-Bactrian Kingdom and established the Eucratides Dynasty. The Greek-Bactrian Kingdom subsequently lost the western part of the kingdom, including Merv, in the war with Mithridates I of the Parthian Empire. Later, around 145 BC, four tribes of the nomadic Scythians - the Asii, Pasiani, Tocharians, and Sacarauli - invaded the Greek-Bactrian Kingdom. The kingdom eventually fell around 130 BC when the Scythians captured the capital, and the king and his royal family subsequently moved south to Kabul.
With his humorous and natural writing style, he sketches out the events and characters in his works with wit and humor. He often writes with a sense of fun derived from rural storytelling, like a modern storyteller, using familiar characters and dialects to narrate vivid life episodes. The scenes in his works, in addition to their appearance and smell, also have a rich flavor. When writing about key points, he often naturally and appropriately adds a few implicit annotations. There is passion in his cold pen, and complexity in his simple depiction, which makes people smile knowingly, but also feel the absurdity and helplessness deep in human nature. He stands out among many Taiwanese prose writers.
Due to disease (overall arching of the roadbed and a large number of cracks, high gas concentration), the Yun Ding Tunnel had been limited to a slow speed of 80km/h for a long time. On February 3, 2020, a 5.1 magnitude earthquake occurred in Qingbaijiang District, Chengdu City, with the epicenter near the Yun Ding Tunnel, which exacerbated the tunnel disease. In addition, the large number of train suspensions during the novel coronavirus epidemic provided an unprecedented opportunity for comprehensive rectification of the line. Therefore, in mid-February 2020, the Yun Ding Tunnel began semi-closed construction. During the construction period, ordinary passenger trains and CR200J EMUs via the Suicheng Line were changed to operate via the old Dacheng Line. The power-dispersed EMUs were shortened to start from Suining Station of the Suiyu Railway. Passenger transport on the Suicheng Railway was temporarily suspended, and only freight trains were operated. On April 10, 2020, the repair was completed and normal passenger train operations were resumed.
During the battle, the Protoss originally thought that the Zerg would become wild and leaderless after the death of the Overmind. However, they were surprised to find that there were hybrid beings in the swarm conducting systematic tactical commands. This surprised Artanis and Zeratul. Then, Amon's powerful dark power invaded the Protoss mental network - Khala, instantly controlling most of the Protoss on Aiur, including Hierarch Artanis and Executor Selendis. As Zeratul belonged to the Nerazim Dark Templar, his people have historically been unwilling to connect with the Khala, so his mind was not affected by Amon. Therefore, Zeratul immediately led a team to rescue Artanis, hoping to sever the neural link with the Khala before he was controlled by Amon, but it was too late.
The Records of the Grand Historian recorded that Yelang was the largest state among the southwestern barbarians at that time, "bordering the Zangke River." During the reign of Emperor Wu of Han, with the intention of attacking the Nanyue Kingdom, he sent Tang Meng to the Nanyue Kingdom and discovered that the local area produced Shu soy sauce, which was known to come from Yelang. Therefore, he wrote to Emperor Wu that he could control the Nanyue Kingdom by connecting with Yelang. As a result, Emperor Wu sent Tang Meng to Yelang, met with its leader, Duke Yelang, and generously gifted him wealth, agreeing to set up county officials in the local area and appoint his son as the county magistrate. Duke Yelang, considering the distance between his country and the Han Dynasty, initially agreed, but later repeatedly resisted the Han. This led to the famous saying "Who is greater, Han or I?" and became the origin of the idiom "Yelang thinks too highly of itself."
When the T7606/7607 T7608/7605 express trains were launched, the EMU trains had already been rerouted to the Shanghai-Nanjing Intercity Railway, so this train did not need to avoid the EMU trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line. The journey from Chizhou to Shanghai only took 7 hours and 13 minutes, but due to the lower standards of the Ning-Tong Railway, the average speed of the train was still less than 80 kilometers per hour, which was not faster than the highway passenger transport on the same line. Furthermore, this train had a close connection with the T7776/7777 T7778/7775 trains, so railway enthusiasts extended the nickname "Shanghai-Chizhou Slow Special" to this train. After the train was extended to the East Station, it got a new nickname "Shanghai-East Slow Special", but many railway enthusiasts still habitually use the nickname "Shanghai-Chizhou Slow Special".
Traditional digital modulation and division of labor use frequency division multiplexing, transmitting different information through different frequency bands. OFDM divides a whole frequency band into several sub-carriers, and makes each sub-carrier orthogonal to each other, so that they do not overlap in the spectrum, which can reduce interference. Its operation method places the signal in the frequency domain at the transmission end, converts it to the time domain through inverse Fourier transform (IDFT), and sends it out after adding a cyclic prefix. The receiver removes the cyclic prefix, then converts the time domain signal back to the frequency domain through Fourier transform (DFT), decoding the original transmitted signal.
Ku Kam Fai was born in Hong Kong and grew up in Tsuen Wan, where he began his football career at the local club Tsuen Wan. In 1983, he moved to Eastern and in 1984, he was invited by team owner Lam Kin Ngok to transfer to the dominant team South China, where he became a key player. During his career, he was selected as one of the best eleven players in the Hong Kong Football Star Election eight times and was named Hong Kong Footballer of the Year in 1987. He retired at the age of 38 and became an assistant coach for the team. On June 19, 2017, after a meeting of the South China board of directors, it was unanimously agreed that South China would withdraw from the Hong Kong Premier League and compete in the First Division to nurture young players. To save on football department expenses, only Ku Kam Fai, who had served South China for over thirty years, was retained.
A broadcast department reporter and a second-year student at Oarai Girls' Academy, she first appeared in episode 10 of the series. She always carries a microphone, camera, and a notebook with the word "secret" on the cover. Although she can't participate in the matches up close as a reporter, she always observes the entire match from a distance and records every match of Oarai Girls' Academy. Originally a character from the Megami MAGAZINE column "Oarai Girls' Academy Lunchtime Broadcast Department," she doesn't often appear in the anime, but is mainly active in the radio drama. In the radio drama, she interviews the captains of various schools to understand their daily lives. In the final chapter, she and her partner spread the news that the Turtle Team's (Kawashima Momo) is going to repeat a year, which even spread outside the school.
Claude Auchinleck's own plans and Montgomery's direction were largely the same, but he also had a series of contingency plans to deal with the situation after the line was broken, including the defense work in Alexandria and Cairo. This led to inconsistencies between commanders about the intention to defend El Alamein or retreat (this had already occurred at the end of June over the issue of defending Matruh). Montgomery's simplification was to abandon other options and emphasize holding his chosen area at all costs, which affected his interpretation of his intentions to his superiors and the deployment of some units to the front line (such as the British 44th Infantry Division), which had been previously reserved for contingency plans.
The Greensource Group has successively won numerous awards and honors, including the "Zhejiang Provincial High-tech Enterprise Research and Development Center" (2005), "Zhejiang Provincial Enterprise Technology Center" (2009), "Zhejiang Provincial Enterprise Research Institute" (2012), "China Famous Trademark" (2015), "Intellectual Property Advantage Enterprise" (2015), "Zhejiang High-tech Enterprise" (2018), "Top Ten Enterprises in China's Electric Bicycle Industry" (2019, 2022), "China National Accreditation Committee for Conformity Assessment Laboratory" (2019), China Light Industry Federation "Science and Technology Progress Award (First Prize)" and "China Light Industry Top 200 Enterprises" (2022), etc.
If calculated on a sixty-minute per episode basis, the budget for each episode of FTV's "Flying Dragon in the Sky" was approximately 1.2 million yuan. FTV filmed nearly 245 hours in total, so the direct production cost was close to 300 million yuan. In addition to the direct production costs, the TV station also had indirect production costs, including studio rental, lighting use, and camera depreciation. FTV estimated that the indirect cost per episode for the prime time slot was about 200,000 yuan. If calculated on this basis, "Flying Dragon" filmed for ten months, and the expenditure for indirect production costs was nearly 49 million yuan. After adding direct and indirect costs, the total production cost of "Flying Dragon in the Sky" was approximately 349 million yuan.
A 15-minute themed fireworks show, "Night of Splendor," was held at Victoria Harbour, featuring patterns such as "HK," "2009," "EAG," and "Ha Ha Laugh." It was accompanied by Cantonese pop songs from the 1980s to the 2000s, performed by stars including Kenny Kwan, Vincy Chan, Yumiko Cheng, and Aarif Rahman. They sang "Love All Day" (originally sung by Leon Lai, lyrics by Lin Xi, composed by Mark Lui; 2000), Han Xue sang "Dancing Street" (originally sung by Priscilla Chan, composed by Baker/Kyte, lyrics by Lam Man Chung; 1986), and the finale was "Red Sun" (originally sung by Hacken Lee, composed by Tatsukawa Jun, lyrics by Hacken Lee; 1992).
The Hong Kong Observatory announced at 2:40 am that day that it had received reports from citizens who felt an earthquake. After preliminary analysis, it stated at 3:16 am that an earthquake had occurred off the southeast coast of China, about 92 kilometers northeast of Hong Kong. The earthquake intensity in Hong Kong was rated as IV (four) on the revised Mercalli scale. Later that morning, it reported receiving over 10,000 reports from citizens who felt the earthquake, breaking the record since the establishment of the short-period seismic monitoring network in 1979. Most citizens reported feeling a slight tremor that lasted for a few seconds. According to the Observatory's radiation monitoring data in Hong Kong, the local environmental radiation level remained normal.
The first product of Scythe was the Socket A slot converter "PK-OCK7/EV6" in 2001, and in 2004 they launched the NAS hard drive box "Kurobako". Today, their product line ranges from graphics cards, ATX power supplies to various storage media and adapters. The key to their steady foothold in the PC gamer circle for over a decade is finding a relatively small but stable blue ocean market. The prosperity of electronic OEM factories in the Shenzhen area can provide various rare and inexpensive computer parts in Japan. However, due to language and other factors, Japanese DIY gamer consumers find it difficult to connect with manufacturers in the Shenzhen area to purchase, and they cannot inspect the quality of the factory and negotiate requirements. This company has taken over this part and created value in Japan.
Due to the limited number of roads connecting the areas on both sides of the Coastal Mountain Range, only Guangfeng Highway (Tai 11 Jia Line), Ruigang Highway (Hua 64 Line), and Dongfu Highway (Tai 23 Line) connect Tai 9 Line and Tai 11 Line. For the distance between Ruisui and Fuli, it is 64 kilometers long before there is a road leading to Tai 11 Line. Therefore, in July 1997, the Highway Bureau began the "Yuli Changbin Section Highway New Construction Plan" to solve the inconvenience of transportation. The journey that used to take 2 hours before the road was opened can be reduced to 30 minutes after the road is opened. It can also increase local development and provide a fast emergency line for medical services.
The "Wenkang A Urban Renewal Project" was funded by Jie Xin Industrial Co., Ltd., with financing trust from Huatai Bank, architectural design by Wu Yuhui Architectural Firm, and construction undertaken by Jin Fuyu Construction Co., Ltd. After the renewal, a reinforced concrete structure building with two underground floors and 14 above-ground floors will be built.

But BoBo returns, singing "My Way" in Spanish, which Gloria appreciates, but she understands that BoBo can't sing. She later discovers that Ramon is right behind BoBo. Just as Gloria is about to leave, BoBo attracts her attention with the rhythm of tap dance. Gloria gradually follows the rhythm and sings. As more and more people follow BoBo, the penguin elder Noah stops the scene of everyone dancing. He believes that the fish shortage is due to BoBo's dancing, which has angered the god of singing, so he banishes BoBo.
Butterfly Bay Beach is a beach located in the Butterfly Bay area of Tuen Mun and is connected to Butterfly Bay Park. It is the second longest coastline in the Tuen Mun area. Therefore, apart from Castle Peak Bay Golden Beach, many tourists often come to Butterfly Bay Beach for swimming and leisure during holidays. Moreover, most residents in the area or those living in the New Territories West, if they wish to go to the beach, would choose the nearby beach in the original area to save travel time and costs to other areas, such as the time to go to the famous beaches in the Southern District of Hong Kong Island or Sai Kung District. They can directly go to this original area beach for swimming. The geographical location of the beach is excellent, and the facilities in the beach are no less than other beaches in Hong Kong, and even surpass them in some aspects.
The story goes back to when Campbell was beaten up by Cole Williams, who said he hadn't seen Rosa since the incident. He didn't continue the beating, but demanded Campbell bring Rosa to him. Campbell, however, stated he no longer worked for Rosa. Cole informed him that he was banned from casinos for life as he was blacklisted, but they were willing to give him one night to catch Rosa without interference. Thus, Campbell began planning. Campbell and Jill prepared chocolate that weighed almost the same as the chips, and during their escape, they secretly switched the chips with the chocolate. Rosa, sitting in the car and feeling quite helpless, was caught red-handed by other security personnel.
Coinciding with the abolition of the rule that Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan players are considered domestic players in the Chinese Super League and China League One from 2016, coupled with Paul's impressive performance in the World Cup qualifiers, he signed a two-year contract with China League One club Shenzhen Kaisa on December 31 of the same year for a seven-figure transfer fee. He registered with the Chinese Football Association under the Chinese name Paul, but due to injury problems, he made few appearances. Finally, on March 20, 2016, in the second round of the China League One, he made his first start for the team and was substituted out in the 74th minute in a 2-1 home win over Qingdao Zhongneng. However, ongoing knee problems prevented him from playing for Shenzhen. During this time, he underwent two knee surgeries in the Netherlands. In the end, he only played four games in his first season and was relegated to the reserve team by Shenzhen Kaisa at the end of the season.
Early descriptions of the Cryptomycota phylum were of organisms that parasitised the surface of host cells, lacked cell walls, and had a morphology similar to chytrids. Their form and intracellular parasitic life cycle were atypical, but this classification had many shortcomings. The etymology of "hidden" refers to these organisms being overlooked by researchers for a long time, until the rise of molecular sequence analysis revealed their mystery. However, this feature applies to many other eukaryotes and is not exclusive to Cryptomycota. Whether Rozella is representative is also debatable, as our understanding of the life cycle of Cryptomycota is still limited. It is unclear whether most species can have both a cell surface parasitic and intracellular parasitic life form, so the morphology and life cycle of Rozella may not be atypical.
On the morning of August 25, the National Hurricane Center began issuing tropical cyclone warnings for the islands of the Lesser Antilles; in Barbados, by the morning of August 27, there was no more fuel available, and local residents rushed to buy disaster supplies, emptying some store shelves; in Puerto Rico, one of the areas hardest hit by a hurricane two years earlier, heightened precautions were taken due to the predicted path of the storm, and on August 27, local Governor Vazquez declared a state of emergency, providing 360 shelters, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency sent 3,500 people to Puerto Rico for disaster prevention, with dozens of flights cancelled at Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, and an 80-year-old man died after accidentally falling down stairs during disaster preparations; in the U.S. Virgin Islands, residents had little time to prepare for the storm due to earlier forecasts that Dorian would not affect the area, but the storm's path shifted north.
Lawyers may defend anyone, even if the person being defended is extremely guilty and the evidence is conclusive. All people accused of criminal offenses, regardless of the severity of the crime or whether the evidence is conclusive, have the right to request the assistance of a lawyer. However, this does not mean that lawyers are inherently evil or lack moral conscience, as this is part of a lawyer's duty. However, due to the image of some of the people defended by lawyers, the arguments used in the defense process, and the unprincipled and high-fee behavior of some lawyers, there are many jokes and satirical cultures about lawyers in society. Moreover, some of the arguments used by lawyers in their defense may involve blaming the victim. In Japan, there have even been petitions to punish defense lawyers for the content of their defense in murder cases.
In several major competitions, Chen Ruolin would choose this move as her finale, including: the women's 10m platform final at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where she chose 5253B for her final dive, and her perfect performance earned her full marks of 10.0 from four judges and 9.5 from three judges, ultimately scoring 100.30 points, and with a total score of 447.70 points, she overtook Canadian diver Heymans to win the gold medal; in the women's 10m platform final at the 2010 World Diving Series in Qingdao, she perfectly completed 5253B in her final dive, earning full marks from six of the seven judges, and ultimately won with a score of 448.40 points; in the women's 10m platform final at the 2012 London Olympics, she once again chose 5253B for her final dive, and her steady performance earned her 86.40 points, successfully defending her title with a total score of 422.30 points.
On August 24, the deputy commander of the Central Disaster Response Center, Zeng Wensheng, instructed the Water Resources Agency of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to actively coordinate the deployment of water pumps to support disaster relief in accordance with local government needs. He also instructed local government evacuation and resettlement teams to continuously monitor the warning and rainfall conditions in the red and yellow alert areas for landslides, and to implement evacuation and resettlement work. For vulnerable groups such as young children, the elderly, those with mobility issues, and those with severe illnesses, early evacuation measures should be initiated. He also asked the Council of Agriculture of the Executive Yuan to closely monitor the supply and prices of vegetables, to ensure the implementation of regulation measures, and to avoid significant price fluctuations that may occur after the flood. He especially reminded the public to take flood prevention measures at home during work and school closures, and to avoid activities such as mountain climbing or playing in rivers and streams in heavy rain warning areas, in order to ensure public safety.
Later, when Chen Manyi went to the bathroom, her phone rang, and Mo Junxian checked it and found out that Chen Manyi had met another man (presumably Hu Huaqiang) and was dating him. He confronted Chen Manyi about why she had deceived him, and her stubborn response made him believe that she had betrayed him and given him false hope. He also recalled that Chen Manyi had hidden something from him, so he felt very disappointed and angry. In his rage, he lost his reason and pushed Chen Manyi to the ground, choking her neck until he noticed that she had wet the floor due to incontinence. He immediately performed CPR on Chen Manyi, but after about 10 minutes of resuscitation, there was still no response. At that moment, he was terrified and felt extremely panicked and afraid. He then hastily put Chen Manyi into the wardrobe and covered her with miscellaneous items to buy time to escape.
Williams syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by the deletion of 25-28 genes in the long arm of the 7th chromosome, a condition that usually occurs as a random event during the formation of the egg or sperm; in a few cases, Williams syndrome is inherited from a parent with the disease (autosomal dominant disease). The patient's distinctive facial features (wide mouth, upturned nose, long philtrum, narrow and small chin, bubble eyes, pointed ears, long neck, sloping shoulders, etc.) are often thought to be due to the absence of specific genes. Diagnosis is usually based on suspicion due to symptoms (for example, heart valve insufficiency, aortic stenosis, SVAS, etc. at birth), and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with an ELN gene probe.
The main difference between papyrus, a plant-based material used by ancient Egyptians, and Chinese paper, is that papyrus is made by sticking pieces of the papyrus plant together, without breaking down the fibres, which retain their natural order. This single, heavy arrangement of fibres is not conducive to writing, folding, and drying, and the raw material, papyrus, is only found in the Nile River basin. In contrast, the fibres in Chinese paper are neither arranged in the orderly manner of plant fibres nor in the geometric arrangement of textiles, but are arranged in a random, cross-linked manner. With simple production and appropriate bonding and adhesion, it forms a material that is both lightweight and strong, and absorbent, making it suitable for long-term preservation of information. The raw materials are also very diverse, and can utilise plants from all environments, which ultimately led to its spread around the world.
As most fantasy novels come from online writers, they are published on the internet as they are written, often changing their style during the serialization process to adapt to the audience (who, having the possibility to comment in real time, are more like spectators than readers). These changes may cause inconsistencies in the content of the novel, but as long as the plot is well-arranged and reasonable, there is no need to specifically distinguish the category of the work. It can also be distinguished by the weight of the chapter themes. If each chapter theme is set in a fictional world and only a small amount of non-traditional plots are added, it can be classified as a fantasy novel; if the chapters revolve around martial arts and science fiction, and magic is only used as an embellishment, it is more recognized as a fantasy novel.

Whenever a large-scale disaster such as a pandemic occurs, toilet paper rolls are often quickly sold out. Some analyses suggest that this is due to the high consumption of toilet paper in Western countries or regions that admire Western civilization. Uncertainty about the future development of the disaster (including the government's response to the disaster, the spread of rumors, etc.) may lead to long-term isolation, prompting people to increase their stockpiling of various supplies. Toilet paper rolls are large and conspicuous items in stores, and the rapid pace of panic buying can easily empty the shelves. This further exacerbates people's panic about material shortages and fear of missing out, ultimately making it difficult for stores to restock at the same pace as people are buying.
This is not reasonable, as good nibs are often found on high-end fountain pens and have a certain weight. Secondly, writing requires pressure on the nib to create thick and thin effects, but ballpoint pens can achieve this by writing on a soft material. Ballpoint pens often perform better in hard pen calligraphy and have more room for expression. However, they require a certain level of understanding of different writing techniques and require the writer to observe more. Fountain pen calligraphy requires speed, as the water-based ink nib cannot write too slowly or stay at one point for too long. This alone makes it far less convenient than a ballpoint pen. The only advantage of a fountain pen is that its ink color is brighter than that of a ballpoint pen.
Diesel-powered U-boats had a low surface speed, only able to chase some slow merchant ships, and their maximum underwater speed was less than 10 knots, usually around 4 knots (except for the Type XXI, which was equipped with a 600-ton high-energy battery pack and a streamlined hull design, allowing it to operate at an unprecedented underwater speed of 17 knots for an hour). In contrast, destroyers had a top speed of 30 knots, but in actual anti-submarine operations, due to the need to use active sonar and hydrophones, the speed was usually still 10-15 knots. U-boats underwater had difficulty evading deep-water bombs from enemy destroyers, and their lack of manoeuvrability was a fatal flaw.
Taoism is a native religion of China, its ideas originated from the Yellow Emperor (attributed to the Yellow Emperor School), and the earliest form of Taoist organization was the Taiping Dao founded by Yu Ji and the Five Pecks of Rice religion (Celestial Masters) founded by Zhang Daoling. They worship Laozi, the founder of Taoism, which can be traced back to the worship of heaven, ancestors, and witchcraft activities by the Chinese people in primitive society. During the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, it absorbed the magic arts of immortality to form the Dao of Magic Immortals, and later integrated the "Five Elements" and "Yin and Yang" thoughts of Taoism and Yin-Yang School to form the Yellow Emperor School. In the middle and late Han Dynasty, it formed the Huang-Lao Dao, and after religious reforms in the Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the integration of sects in the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, it gradually evolved into the current Taoism.

The development of the Minimi machine gun began in the early 1970s when NATO countries were still predominantly equipped with general-purpose machine guns firing 7.62×51mm NATO caliber rounds. These 7.62mm caliber machine guns, such as the FN MAG, the West German MG3, and the American M60, weighed over 10 kilograms without ammunition, making them too heavy and cumbersome for individual soldiers to carry.

Chapter One
Hao Ren, true to his name, is a good person.
He lived in an obscure northern town that could barely be considered under the emperor's feet if Beijing were to build a 20th or 30th ring road. If all the good person cards in the world were counted based on his homophonic name, he could barely be considered famous. Walking down the street, no one recognized him, and he had an ordinary square face that, apart from a bit of masculinity, was plain and unremarkable for over twenty years. His life goal was to be a good person, and apart from that, he had no distinguishing features - that was him.
Although the weather in the north is cooler, walking under the scorching sun during the day can still be quite irritating. Therefore, in the bustling city center, various vehicles can be seen everywhere, but not many pedestrians are walking outside. Among these few pedestrians is a tall young man with an ordinary appearance, wearing a white T-shirt and gray trousers.
Hao Ren felt that students nowadays were becoming more and more unprofessional. When he used to work outside handing out flyers, he would never give them to men who were obviously single, but no matter what, these hard flyers were quite suitable for fanning.
"Last two places, if it doesn't work out, then that's it." Hao Ren muttered as he looked at the last two job advertisements in his hand. Fortunately, both places were close to each other, so he could quickly finish today's "task." One of them was right in front, an advertising company that didn't look very powerful from the outside, but the sign at the door was impressive: Galaxy Media Pan-Cultural Development and Promotion Company. Just by hearing the name, it seemed like a company that would go bankrupt within six months. Hao Ren came here mainly not to apply for a job, but to see what kind of extraordinary person the boss of a company with such a magical name would be.
He walked excitedly for several hundred meters to bypass the road barrier, then ran to the front of this advertising company with a particularly impressive name under the scorching sun, only to be surprised to find that the company had indeed gone bankrupt. The sign was still hanging at the entrance, but there was a notice of closure on the glass door, dated two days ago, while the job advertisement in his hand was from four days ago. This is truly a rapidly changing world, where companies still hire new employees to calm their nerves just two days before going bankrupt.
Casually crumpling up the advertisement agency's job posting and tossing it into a roadside trash can, Hao Ren looked down at the last one and, two seconds later, crumpled it up and threw it into the same place, reflecting on whether he had been blind when screening these things two days ago - a bus company was hiring an office clerk, requiring applicants to be between 25 and 40 years old, able to endure hardship and be computer literate with work experience preferred, and female.
He excitedly clutched the gadget and went to the city center just to see how shiny the glass door of an advertising company that was busy hiring workers two days before closing was, simply out of boredom.
Hao Ren, a 25-year-old male with a fondness for women, has no bad habits. His strength is that he is not picky about food. Currently single and with few close friends, he lives alone in an old house left by his parents in the southern part of the old city. Like most young men, his life goal is to earn more than 10,000 yuan per month by the age of 25, marry a beautiful wife, and ideally own a car. Since he cannot properly care for his parents, he must at least live well enough not to disgrace his family. So far, he has achieved one-third of these life goals: he is now 25 years old.
This is truly a sad story.
He came to the city today to look for a job, but in fact, he didn't have any urgent need for a source of income: as mentioned earlier, Hao Ren lived in an old house left by his parents, and he should be grateful for the legacy left by the older generation, at least the house was quite big - it was a two-story old-style house that had been converted into a structure similar to a family rental apartment.
For several years, Hao Ren has been making a living by renting out houses, but due to the remote location of his own residence, it is so remote that it might take several decades of planning to wait for the old house to be demolished.
To be fair, with this stable income, Hao Ren didn't really need to find a job, but when people have too much free time, they tend to become a bit pretentious, always feeling that they should make a little effort to expand their horizons and explore their life path. Moreover, the more important reason was that his old house was located in such a remote area that it was almost detached from human civilization. Since the last migrant worker couple moved out of the rental house, no one had come to rent the house for almost half a year. Looking at the empty two-story "apartment" for several consecutive months, Hao Ren realized something from the bottom of his heart: unless the urban planning leaned towards his side, he might really have to find a job to survive.
After studying urban planning at home for three days, Hao Ren thought that the possibility of his neighborhood turning into a commercial center overnight was quite slim. Considering that he couldn't waste his life as a grown man, he finally decided to find a job first, at least to have an income to support his life.
How can I say that I was also a hardworking man who earned my tuition by working part-time back then? Surely, I wouldn't starve myself in this vast world.
However, fate does not change according to one's will, and his aimless running around outside that day... basically amounted to nothing but aimless running.
Thinking too much was useless, so Hao Ren stretched lazily and decided to rest under the shade of a bench in a small roadside park. He would wait for the hottest hour of noon to pass, then find a small restaurant to fill his stomach, and finally take a bus home.
Even with rapid economic development, the place still managed to maintain the leisure and openness of a small town. He found a piece of paper to wipe the bench clean, then lay down casually, covering his face with a brochure featuring the logo of a women's hospital and a beautiful girl to block the sunlight, and began to rest without a care in the world.
But just as he had barely lain down for what seemed like less than a minute, the sunlight streaming through the edge of the folded page dimmed, as if someone had come to his side. Hao Ren, slightly surprised, showed his face and was astonished to find that the sun had already set on the horizon, and a petite and slender female figure was standing beside him, blocking the sinking sun. Due to the backlighting, he couldn't make out the woman's features, but could only confirm through a dim silhouette that she was a short-haired, slender girl.
"Oh, you're awake?"
At this point, the unfamiliar girl seemed to finally realize that her backlit position made it difficult for others to see her clearly, so she grinned and slightly turned her body to allow the other person to see her appearance better.
A very beautiful girl - this was Hao Ren's first impression.
The outgoing girl had shoulder-length short hair, possibly a sports enthusiast, with a slightly wheat-colored skin, healthy and full of sunshine. Her appearance was beautiful and pleasant, and the most noticeable feature was her pair of lively big eyes, more vibrant than any other pair of eyes Hao Ren had ever seen, as if the whole person's spirit was about to shine through these eyes.
Behind her was a rather substantial-looking large suitcase.
Looking at the slightly dazed Hao Ren, this short-haired beautiful girl burst into a brilliantly silly smile (although it seems a bit inappropriate to say so, but Hao Ren really thought it was a silly smile). The smile was clean and pure, something that seems to be rarely seen on the faces of girls of the same age these days. She rummaged in her small bag for a while, finally pulling out a crumpled piece of paper and handed it to Hao Ren, "Excuse me, do you know where this place is?"
Hao Ren slapped his cheeks to wake himself up, ignoring for the moment what was going on with this careless girl, and looked down at the address on the paper... Oh my, isn't this his own home?
Chapter 1
The faint light of early morning pierced the dark blue sky, with the vast horizon tinged with the white of a fish's belly.
In Xianyu County, at the Martial Arts Academy, in the forest behind the mountain, a thin young man wearing a loose martial robe was squatting with his tongue against his teeth, concentrating all his strength into his two fists, striking a large tree.
The boxing technique is smooth, flexible, and contains internal strength without exerting it, combining hardness with softness, showing some degree of mastery.
The boy's name was Su Yu, he was fourteen years old, handsome and elegant, with a straight posture, still retaining his youthful innocence.
Amidst the fluttering of her black hair, a pair of eyes as vast as the stars and as deep as the ancient cosmos, displayed a wisdom that did not match her age.
Three hours later, the sun was high in the sky.
Su Yu stopped punching, looked down at his blood-stained fists, and sighed softly, "I work twice as hard as others, but the results I get are less than half of those with better qualifications."
"Coming to a different world, I really don't know, is it a blessing or a curse?"
Two months ago, Su Yu was in a plane crash, and when he woke up, he found himself in a world called the Divine Moon Continent.
Becoming a student of a martial arts academy in the mainland.
It took him a full two months to assimilate the memories of the original owner.
In the continent of Shen Yue, martial arts are revered, the law of the jungle prevails, and the environment is cruel and strict.
Humans practice martial arts, reach the pinnacle, and achieve a transcendent state.
Martial arts are divided into nine levels, each with three stages: minor achievement, major achievement, and peak.
Surpassing the nine levels of martial arts, breaking the shackles, one can leap to become a god, a mythical figure, known as the "Holy King of the Human World".
The realm of the Human Sacred King is the ultimate in martial arts, the limit pursued by billions of people.
It is rumored that the human saint king can move mountains and seas, ride clouds and fog, and is omnipotent.
A human saint king, capable of changing the destiny of a dynasty for a hundred years, is a god-like existence.
However, how difficult is it to practice in this world?
Su Yu is the absolute genius of Qing Shan Town under the jurisdiction of Xian Yu County. At just fourteen years old, he has cultivated to the peak of the first level of martial arts, becoming the once-in-a-century prodigy in the eyes of everyone in Qing Shan Town.
However, after he was admitted to the Xianyu County, the supreme martial arts academy, Su Yu realized how much of a frog in the well he had been.
The Wuzong Academy, which gathers all the talents in Xianyu County, enrolls once a year.
And among all the geniuses in the Wuzong Academy, he was merely at the bottom!
The Wuzong Academy divides its students into three categories based on their qualifications.
Golden students, those of exceptional talent, are often the best in a city, suppressing the top talents of the rest of the city, and are given priority for cultivation by martial arts academies.
The silver student, a potential genius, has a talent that is above others in the small town. With a little effort, there may be hope.
Su Yu is a silver student, he understands very well that silver students are those who have no hope of achieving great success in their cultivation, but it's a pity to give up. They are like chicken ribs, tasteless when eaten but too good to throw away.
The silver students were not highly regarded, the resources for cultivation provided by the academy were very limited, and the possibility of standing out was close to zero.
"Su Yu, hurry back to the academy, the Duke of Qin wants to see you!" A urgent voice broke the silence of the forest, a middle-aged man in blue was panting as he ran up the mountain, his face showing a hint of anxiety.
"How dare you disrespect the Duke of Qin? Come with me!" The man in blue was impatient, he stepped forward and grabbed Su Yu's shoulder, disregarding the pain he caused to Su Yu's thin body, and quickly dragged him down the mountain.
Su Yu gritted her teeth, enduring the severe pain in her shoulder, without uttering a word.
The middle-aged man in blue is the academic steward, managing daily student activities. In terms of an Earth school, he would be the equivalent of a headmaster.
After half a cup of tea.
The Academy, a luxurious and elegant lounge that is as exquisite as a dream.
Only core students, high-ranking academy officials, and nobles are allowed to rest here. Apart from these, neither gold nor silver students are eligible.
This was Su Yu's first time in the luxurious lounge. An ordinary poor boy might be nervous here. But Su Yu, who was a business elite in his previous life, was a regular at five-star hotels, presidential suites, and luxurious parties. He remained calm and composed, unaffected by honor or disgrace.
In the lounge, there were three people, a young boy and girl, and a man of noble temperament and extraordinary bearing.
When his gaze swept over the fourteen-year-old girl, Su Yu paused slightly.
She was a woman with a face as beautiful as a fairy, her features as finely carved as jade, her skin as white as spring snow, her figure exquisite. Dressed in immaculate white, she looked like a fox spirit, extraordinarily beautiful.
However, the look she gave Su Yu was cold, yet also a bit complex.
Beside him was a sixteen-year-old boy, handsome and gallant, with an indescribable nobility.
"Hehe, I am Duke Qin, very pleased to meet you." Duke Qin, one of the three dukes of the Maple Empire, was not arrogant at all at this moment, but rather exceptionally friendly, smiling and inviting Su Yu to sit down.
Su Yu shook her head coldly in her heart, not at all moved by the affection.
Those in high positions, being the focus of millions of people, pay great attention to their own cultivation and personal image.
Just like politicians on Earth, they clearly can't stand each other, but when they meet, they still shake hands and exchange pleasantries with smiles on their faces, only to stab each other in the back and play dirty tricks behind the scenes.
"I am Qin Feng's father, and I am here for his matter with Qing'er." Duke Qin's handsome face showed a warm smile. "I have heard everything from Feng'er, and for this, as Feng'er's father, I apologize to you."
A bitter feeling flashed in Su Yu's heart, the bitterness of another Su Yu's broken soul. The girl in front of him, named Jiang Xueqing, was a genius who came out of Qingshan Town with Su Yu and was also enrolled as a student in the Martial Arts Academy.
The two were childhood sweethearts, innocent and naive, a golden boy and a jade girl, a match made in heaven.
However, after entering Wuzong Academy, Jiang Xueqing, who came from a small town, was shocked by the vast and prosperous world and gradually became infatuated with the flashy world.
With her fox-like beauty, she inevitably attracted the pursuit of young nobles and talented geniuses.
At first, she was able to convince herself to stay true to her heart and accompany Su Yu through the first school year.
But gradually, as she came to understand the harshness of the world, she transformed from a naive little girl, realizing that following Su Yu would likely lead to a difficult future, hardship, and becoming a lesser person.
Finally, her inner defenses crumbled.
Two months ago, he completely cut off contact with Su Yu, becoming the son of the Duke of Qin, and the companion of Qin Feng, the Duke of the small country.
Although Jiang Xueqing adhered strictly to the role of a good girl and never overstepped the boundaries of male-female relationships, from that time on, the two were often seen together, inseparable, and became the enviable fairy couple in everyone's eyes.
And Su Yu, became the laughing stock of the Wuzong Academy.
Su Yu was deeply hurt and repeatedly pleaded with Jiang Xueqing to change her mind, even kneeling and begging, losing all dignity, but was coldly rejected by Jiang Xueqing.
Unable to bear the great sorrow and downfall in life, Su Yu committed suicide by jumping into a lake. Coincidentally, the Su Yu from Earth had a plane crash, and his soul transmigrated into this pitiful and weak individual.
Seeing Su Yu lost in his memories, the Duke of Qin assumed he was struggling to let go of his feelings for Jiang Xueqing. He sighed and said, "Feng is young and naive. I am willing to compensate for his mistakes. Whatever you want, just ask. But as a father, I hope you can help Feng. His feelings for Miss Xueqing are sincere."
Listening to the seemingly heartfelt words of the Duke of Qin, Su Yu shook his head inwardly. These tricks might fool ordinary people, but they were useless against him.
You took my girlfriend and expect me to be okay with it? This isn't an apology, it's clearly a show of power!
The Duke of Qin seemed mild-mannered, but his attitude was full of blatant insult.
Ask yourself, if it were the woman of a king, the woman of an emperor, and she caught the eye of his son, would he, the Duke of Qin, dare to let the king give his woman to Qin Feng? He wouldn't dare, because he can't afford to offend the king, he can only afford to offend commoners like Su Yu!
Su Yu shook his head lightly and stood up to leave. He had no lingering feelings for a realistic girl like Jiang Xueqing. Even if the Duke of Qin did not use his power to oppress people, he had no intention of fighting for her.
As for the so-called compensation from the Duke of Qin, although Su Yu lacked cultivation resources, was poor, and had nothing, he still had an indomitable will and had not fallen to the point of being pitied by others.
Jiang Xueqing understood Su Yu's stubborn and unyielding character. Seeing him about to leave, she assumed he was still unwilling to give up. She bit her silver teeth lightly, moved her lotus steps lightly, and her snow eyes were like the cold moon's deep glow: "Su Yu! Please respect my choice!"
"Since it has come to this, I will speak my mind completely, I hope you can give up." A cold light flashed in Jiang Xueqing's eyes.
"Qin Feng is a duke of a small country and will surely be a pillar of the empire in the future. He can give me wealth and honor. Can you, a poor boy from a mountain village, give me that?"
"Qin Feng is a gold student, who will catch up with the Saint King of the world in the future, standing above millions of people, can give me a sense of security, can you, a mere silver student, give me that?"
"Su Yu, accept the reality. I won't deny that you were once my affection, the most dazzling genius in my eyes. But, I was too young, too naive. The real world is cruel and real, I have no other choice!"
Jiang Xueqing cut off the last thread of attachment in her eyes, her gaze at Su Yu gradually distant, as if looking at a stranger, she sighed softly: "Brother Feng is a good person, as long as you promise not to look for me in the future, he will try his best to compensate you, give you a few soul-melting elixirs to enhance your cultivation, with your improved strength, your days in school will be much better."
After some thought, Jiang Xueqing took out a palm-sized statue of a woman carved from crystal from her sleeve.
Crystal clear, shimmering with brilliant depth. The most beautiful is the crystal statue of a woman, ethereal and aesthetic, like a fox fairy, so beautiful as a celestial being, so fascinating.
The statue of the woman was lifelike, identical to its owner, Jiang Xueqing.
"This is the token of love you gave me, now, I'm giving it back to you, we owe each other nothing from now on." Jiang Xueqing ruthlessly shoved the statue into Su Yu's hands, turned around and returned to Qin Feng's side, gazing into the distance, no longer looking at Su Yu, cold and heartless.
"Chi Yao, I treated you with deep love, why do you want to kill me?"
Zhang Ruochen roared and tried to lunge forward, causing the gilded bed to creak. He suddenly sat up.
Realising it was just a dream, Zhang Ruochen let out a long sigh and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve.
No!
That was not a dream!
How could everything that happened between him and Princess Chi Yao possibly be a dream?
Zhang Ruochen was originally the only son of the "Ming Emperor", one of the nine emperors of the Kunlun realm. At the young age of sixteen, he cultivated to the perfect state of the heavenly extreme with his rebellious physique.
However, just as he was becoming the number one person of the younger generation in the Kunlun realm, he died at the hands of his childhood sweetheart and fiancée, Princess Chi Yao.
Princess Chi Yao is the daughter of one of the Nine Emperors, the "Green Emperor".
Emperor Ming and Emperor Qing were the best of friends, and Zhang Ruochen and Princess Chi Yao were betrothed from a young age, growing up and cultivating together.
One was dashing and the other was stunningly beautiful, they could have been the golden boy and jade girl of the cultivation world. Zhang Ruochen never expected that Princess Chi Yao would actually make a move on him!
After dying at the hands of Princess Chi Yao, when Zhang Ruochen woke up again, he found himself eight hundred years in the future.
The former Princess Chi Yao, who quelled the chaos of the Nine Emperors, unified the Nine Kingdoms, established the first Central Empire, and became the ruler of the entire Kunlun world - Empress Chi Yao.
Eight hundred years ago, the Nine Emperors who once dominated the Kunlun realm, completely became a thing of the past, disappearing into the long river of history.
The nine emperors are dead, the empress should ascend to the throne.
In this era, there was only one sovereign, the Empress Chi Yao, who ruled over the world and commanded respect from all directions.
"Why does she want to kill me?"
"How could her heart be so cruel, or is it that all women's hearts are so cruel?" Zhang Ruochen's eyes were sharp, his heart heavy as iron, full of questions. But, there was no one who could answer them for him.
Eight hundred years have passed, and everything has changed except for the Empress Chi Yao, whose exceptional cultivation has kept her eternally youthful and immortal.
All those old acquaintances have turned into yellow earth and become white bones. Even the once mighty nine emperors have all disappeared from the world, leaving only glorious stories that have been passed down through generations.
"Squeak!"
A delicate woman in palace attire walked in from outside, looking at Zhang Ruochen sitting on the bed with a concerned look, "Chen'er, did you have a nightmare again?"
The beautiful woman before him was the wife of the Yunwu County King and the mother of Zhang Ruochen, Lin Fei.
The original owner of this body, due to his frail and sickly condition, had died in his bed three days ago.
After being killed by Princess Chi Yao, Zhang Ruochen woke up again in this body, bringing the originally sick boy back to life.
Even more coincidentally, the original owner of this body was also named Zhang Ruochen. When Zhang Ruochen first woke up, he was very resistant to Lin Fei.
After all, in Zhang Ruochen's eyes, Lin Fei was just a stranger. However, after three days of interaction, Zhang Ruochen gradually realized that Lin Fei truly cared for him, almost meticulously. When she saw Zhang Ruochen wake up from a nightmare, she rushed to his room immediately, regardless of the cold weather.
In his previous life, Zhang Ruochen had never seen his biological mother. It was said that she passed away when he was born!
Unexpectedly, after being killed by Princess Chi Yao, he was reborn in this body and gained a mother, feeling the warmth of maternal love. "Perhaps she doesn't know yet, that her own son, died of illness three days ago!"
If she were told the truth, she might not be able to withstand the shock of the bad news.
Zhang Ruochen looked at the beautiful woman in front of him, his eyes softened, and he smiled slightly: "Mother, don't worry about me, it's just a dream."
Lin Fei, draped in a date-red hooded mink coat, sat by Zhang Ruochen's bedside, stroking his forehead, worriedly saying, "It's been three nights now, you're always woken up by nightmares, each time calling out the name 'Chi Yao'. Who exactly is she?"
Naturally, Lin Fei could not associate the name "Chi Yao" with the empress of the First Central Empire.
Moreover, after Empress Chi Yao unified the Kunlun realm and established the first central empire, she was known as the "Great Might and Virtue Female Saint Emperor," and no one dared to mention the name "Chi Yao" in normal times.
It's a taboo. Zhang Ruochen said, "It's nothing, mother, you heard it wrong!"
Lin Fei sighed and said, "Never again directly call out the name 'Chi Yao', even in your dreams, that is the taboo name of the Empress. Directly calling the Empress's taboo name is a great disrespect, and if it is heard by someone with ill intentions, you could be executed."
Zhang Ruochen nodded, tightly pinched his fingers, and said with deep meaning: "Absolutely not!"
From now on, I will be her nightmare.
Lin Fei looked at the thin and pale Zhang Ruochen, sighed softly, and felt extremely heartbroken.
Although he was born into a prince's family, he had been weak and sickly since childhood. At sixteen, he was still bedridden year-round, and it seemed he would likely remain this way for the rest of his life!
Outside, a flurry of footsteps could be heard.
What are you doing?
A beautiful maid tried to stop the eighth prince who barged in, but was gently pushed by the prince and fell more than ten meters away. The eighth prince was a warrior, who had reached the late stage of the Yellow Extreme Realm. With one palm strike, he could knock a 300-pound stone plate ten feet away, let alone a maid who only weighed a hundred pounds?
With a flick of the finger, she could be sent flying.
The maid screamed and fell heavily to the ground, breaking her left arm.
The Prince of Hachioji, dressed in a golden robe and a jade belt around his waist, with a robust body and long arms, walked into the Yusu Palace with steady steps. He coldly glanced at the maid, "A mere servant dares to block my way, she's really asking for death."
Behind the prince of Hachioji, there were six guards dressed in scale armor, tall and strong, obviously powerful martial arts monks, belonging to the palace guard.
After hearing the noise outside, Lin Fei calmed Zhang Ruochen's emotions, then closed the door and went out.
She stared at the Eighth Prince standing outside, slightly furrowing her brows, and said, "Your Highness, this is the Yushu Palace, even if you are a prince, you can't just barge in!"
Hachioji Zhang Ji looked up at Lin Fei and said loudly, "The queen has ordered that the sleeping palace of Lady Lin Fei and the ninth brother be moved to the 'Zi Yi Side Hall'. From now on, the master of the Jade Washing Palace will be my birth mother, Lady Xiao Fei."
Lin Fei's complexion changed slightly. She had anticipated this day would come, but she didn't expect it to come so quickly.
With a bitter smile, Lin Fei said, "Is the queen so eager to drive us mother and son out of the Yushu Palace? Alright then!"
"My mother said she wants to move into the Yushu Palace tonight. Please, Princess Lin, move to the side hall now!"
Hachioji sneered coldly, without any courtesy, he said: "Lady Lin, there are many pitiful people in this world, but not everyone is worthy of pity. Since the ninth brother is weak and sickly, why is he still alive?"
"He is your ninth brother!"
Lin Fei wanted to say something else, but suddenly, the door behind her was pushed open.
Zhang Ruochen was weak and could barely stand by leaning on the doorpost, staring at the Prince of Eight not far away.
His seemingly frail body seemed to contain an unyielding will, saying, "We don't need to ask them, we'll move out now."
"Dust, how did you get out of bed? The weather outside is cold, hurry back." Lin Fei quickly stepped forward to support Zhang Ruochen, fearing that he would catch a cold.
Looking at Zhang Ruochen's determined eyes, Lin Fei seemed to be infected by his emotions, and nodded with tears streaming down her face.
Lin Fei and Can Fu helped Zhang Ruochen walk out of the Yushu Palace, except for the maid who was pushed out by the eighth prince and broke her arm.
The other servants did not leave the Jade Palace with them. Everyone could see that Consort Lin and the Ninth Prince had completely lost their power, and it was difficult for them to find a foothold in the Prince's Mansion.
Originally they were servants of the Yushu Palace, now it was a wise choice to stay in the Yushu Palace and please the new master, the Eighth Prince.
The Zi Yi Side Hall, usually the residence of the out-of-favor queens, was very remote, with leaves all over the ground, as if it had been uninhabited for a long time.
The night is deep, and the cold wind is bleak.
Sitting on the cold stone bench, Zhang Ruochen wrapped his thin body in a coat, but still felt cold.
"This body is too weak, only by practicing martial arts can it gradually become stronger."
Otherwise, even if I am now the son of a county king, I would still be at the mercy of others," thought Zhang Ruochen to himself.
Eight hundred years have passed, where can Zhang Ruochen go now?
Since fate had arranged for him to be reborn in this body, whether it was for the purpose of taking revenge on Empress Chi Yao in the future, or for his mother who took care of him meticulously, he had to become stronger. The humiliation and cold treatment he suffered today were entirely because he was too weak to resist, unable to control his own destiny, and even his place of residence was occupied by others.
To gain the respect of others and to achieve a warm and comfortable living environment, one must become a warrior and prove their abilities.
In the Kunlun realm, to become a warrior, one must first activate the "God Martial Mark".
The so-called "Divine Martial Mark" is the qualification for practicing martial arts bestowed by the gods to humans.
Without activating the "Divine Martial Mark," one can never cultivate true energy and become a strong person in the world. Zhang Ruochen was already sixteen years old, but still had not activated the "Divine Martial Mark."
After the age of sixteen, one has missed the best age for martial arts training, and even if the "God Martial Mark" is activated, it is impossible to achieve much.
Why is it that the eighth prince, also a son of Yunwu County King, is superior to others? How could he drive Zhang Ruochen and Lin Fei out of the Yushu Palace?
It was because Hachioji activated the "Divine Martial Mark" at the age of ten, and now he is a young martial artist in the late stage of the Yellow Extreme Realm.
"As long as I activate the 'Divine Martial Mark', I can cultivate the 'Nine Heavens Bright Emperor Sutra'."
"With the profound mysteries of the 'Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra,' even if I have missed the best age for cultivation, I can still catch up with other geniuses and become a martial arts powerhouse again." The 'Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra' is the supreme cultivation manual of the Ming Emperor, and apart from the Ming Emperor, only Zhang Ruochen knows the complete cultivation method of the 'Nine Heavens Ming Emperor Sutra'.
"Tomorrow is the grand ceremony, hoping to gain the approval of the gods and activate the 'Divine Martial Mark'."
Zhang Ruochen clenched his fists, filled with a strong desire to activate the "Divine Martial Seal".
After Lin Fei tidied up the room, she came over to support Zhang Ruochen, "Ruochen, you should rest early! Tomorrow, you still have to attend the sacrificial ceremony."
"Mother, rest assured, I will definitely be able to activate the 'God Martial Mark' tomorrow!" said Zhang Ruochen.
"Hmm!"
Lin Fei looked deeply at Zhang Ruochen and sighed softly in her heart.
Chapter One
With a "clang," a rusty iron gate was opened, the echo of which was blocked by the surrounding ancient buildings, lingering on.
After a dozen or so breaths, a young man with a drooping head was dragged out from behind the iron gate by two prison guards holding his arms. This young man, seemingly lifeless and with arms so thin they were just bones, had clearly been subjected to unimaginable torment and torture, as evidenced by the bloodstained, tattered clothes he wore.
"The frail man known as 'Peng' was thrown to the ground by two prison guards, stirring up some dust, and then there was no movement."
"Is this kid dead?" asked a short, fat prison guard, staring at the young man lying motionless on the ground.
Another jailer grunted, "He must be dead. Who told him to be reckless and disrespect Miss Jian. Now it's good, not only was Ning Mansion destroyed, but he himself is also relieved, it serves him right."
"Old Hui, be careful with your words, let's drag him out and deal with him first," the short and fat jailer hurriedly warned.
Upon hearing the words of the short, fat jailer, the other jailer, known as Old Hui, involuntarily shrank back, preparing to drag away the man on the ground who had already stopped breathing.
Just then, a somewhat weak voice called out from the side, "Brothers, I want to take my husband away."
The two speaking jailers only then noticed a woman in coarse hemp clothing standing to the side. Despite her rough attire, her exceptional grace was still faintly discernible. The only regret was that her face had been disfigured, hidden by slightly messy hair, making people reluctant to take a second look.
Both jailers recognized who this woman was, she was one of the only two survivors of the Ning family.
Ning Gao was the steward of the Ning Mansion. When the mansion was ransacked, he was away from the Cang Qin Kingdom, thus escaping the disaster. The woman was the daughter-in-law of the Ning Mansion and the wife of the thin man who had just been thrown out of prison, named Ji Luo Fei.
She survived because she stayed at the Cang Qin Second Star Academy. Of course, this was also because Ji Luo Fei had little connection with the Ning family. She married into the Ning family because the Ning and Ji families were old acquaintances, and she was betrothed to Ning Cheng since childhood. However, the Ji family fell in the most inexplicable way, leaving only Ji Luo Fei, who had been disfigured.
Even so, Ning Cheng's grandfather, Ning Hongchang, still took Ji Luo Fei into his house. He planned to let the two marry after Ning Cheng truly gathered his energy.
"Alright, alright, take it away, it's an eyesore here." The short, fat jailer pocketed the silver coin and waved his hand impatiently.
They were originally supposed to handle the corpses in Ningcheng, but they didn't expect someone to come and do it, and even give them silver coins, they certainly wouldn't refuse such a good thing.
Upon hearing this, Ji Luo hurriedly picked up Ning Cheng, quickened her pace, and soon disappeared from the prison gate.
"If this Ji Luo Fei hadn't been disfigured, she would actually be quite a beauty." Watching Ji Luo Fei's back, another jailer tossed a silver coin in his hand and spoke with a judgmental tone.
"Stop talking nonsense, Jiluo Fei is after all from the Cang Qin Second Star Academy, even if she is ugly, it's not our place to judge." The short, fat prison guard patted the speaking guard on the shoulder and led him back through the iron door.
Ning Xiaocheng smelled a very pleasant fragrance. The first thing he saw when he opened his eyes was a white neck. The next moment, Ning Xiaocheng realized that he was being carried by a woman, and the fragrance was coming from the woman who was carrying him.
No, he remembered that after being rejected by Tian Muwan, he was in a very bad mood and ended up taking the wrong path, walking alone onto the overpass. Then a yellow light from the horizon struck him, and then there was nothing.
Could it be that he is not dead yet? What on earth is going on?
Just as Ning Xiaocheng thought of this, various pieces of information flooded into his mind, and he realized that he had been reborn.
What shocked Ning Xiaocheng was that the body he was reborn into was also named Ning Cheng. The reason for his shock was because his original name was also Ning Cheng.
Just because he often had a nightmare, in which he saw himself arriving at a very strange place, being secretly imprisoned, and then tortured to death. Although it was just a dream, Ningcheng still changed his name to Ning Xiaocheng.
Unexpectedly, after all the twists and turns, he still ended up calling Ningcheng, and indeed was reborn in the environment of his dreams.
Ning Xiaocheng wanted to wipe the cold sweat from his forehead, but the woman behind him turned to look at him and didn't say much.
"Sorry, I don't have the strength to walk," Ning Xiaocheng said apologetically when he saw the woman looking back at him.
"The Ning family is gone, you're lucky to be alive," the woman said calmly, as if she would maintain this calm demeanor even if Ning Xiaocheng really died.
Ning Xiaocheng fell silent, having just sorted out some fragmented information. He should now call back Ning Cheng, the sole heir of the Ning family in the Cang Qin Kingdom.
Ningcheng's parents went to the Mango Sea to find spiritual objects when Ningcheng was very young, and they never returned. Ningcheng has been living with his grandfather Ning Hongchang in Cangle City, the capital of the Cang Qin Kingdom. Although the Ning Mansion is large, there are not many people.
Ning Cheng naturally became the first person in Ning Mansion, and Ning Hongchang never interfered with Ning Cheng. All the bad things that Ning Cheng did in Cang Le City were taken on by Ning Hongchang. Although Ning Hongchang was also an elder of the Cang Qin Kingdom, he was somewhat inferior compared to those princes and nobles.
One day, Ning Cheng got himself into trouble that he couldn't handle. He had offended Jian Su Jie, the precious gem of the Jian family in the Cang Qin Kingdom. Not to mention that the Ning family couldn't afford to offend the Jian family, even Jian Su Jie's fiancé, Qiu Ying Guang, was someone the Ning family couldn't afford to provoke.
Ning Cheng sighed at the thought. The result of his troubles was, of course, being thrown into prison. His grandfather, Ning Hongchang, exhausted all his connections and wealth in order to bail him out, but not only did he fail to do so, he ended up dragging the entire Ning family down with him. This news was learned from the mouth of a prison guard by his predecessor, it can be said that the Ning family was destroyed because of him.
After sorting out these matters, Ning Cheng sighed again in his heart, realizing that in this world, there is no reason to speak of, whoever has the bigger fist, is the one who is right.
At the same time, he also understood who the person carrying him was - the disfigured woman was his fiancée, named Ji Luo Fei, somewhat similar to a child bride on Earth.
Later, the Ji family mysteriously declined, leaving only a disfigured Ji Luo Fei. However, Ning Cheng's grandfather, Ning Hong Chang, still took Ji Luo Fei into the Ning family, planning to help the two get married after Ning Cheng gathered his energy.
Ning Hongchang indulged Ning Cheng in other matters, but he would not budge on the matter of marrying Ji Luofei. The original Ning Cheng was very dissatisfied with Ji Luofei, who had been disfigured, and often beat or scolded her. Fortunately, Ji Luofei was submissive and never retorted against Ning Cheng. Moreover, unlike Ning Cheng, Ji Luofei had the qualifications to cultivate.
Not only that, but with the help of the Ning family, he entered the Cang Qin Second Star Academy and was already a third-level Qi gathering cultivator. In Cang Qin country, anyone who can cultivate is called a cultivator.
At this point, Jiluo had already carried him into an extremely low black stone house. Although the black stone house was low, it was not small in area and had everything that it should have. There was even a small courtyard with a deep well inside.
Even when it concerned himself, Ning Cheng had to clarify this matter. Although he suspected that the Jian family and Qiu family were involved, he still had to ask some questions.
"Why ask me about what you've done yourself?" Ji Luo Fei simply answered, then let Ning Cheng go.
After she finished speaking, she poured a glass of water for Ningcheng, then said, "I'm going to boil water for your bath, try to forget some things, you know it's not good for you."
Ning Cheng watched Ji Luo Fei go in to boil water, and did not continue to ask questions. He understood Ji Luo Fei's meaning. With his abilities, the more he knew, the faster he would die.
Ningcheng wasn't sure if Jiluo had added something to the water, but after drinking it, he felt some of his strength returning.
Ning Cheng sat on the old wooden couch, his mind alternating between his current situation and his sister Ning Ruolan. At the same time, he really didn't understand why Tian Muwan treated him that way. According to his understanding of Tian Muwan, she was definitely not the kind of girl who was snobbish.
Chapter 1
Chu Li was sailing on the lake, with the lake breeze blowing on his face, refreshing and invigorating.
The Duke of Yi's residence was a vast lake with ninety-nine islands, and the distance from the martial arts hall he was going to and the East Garden was eighteen miles.
On the small boat, he was of medium build, dressed in a flowing blue shirt. His appearance was ordinary but he had a certain heroic air about him, as he gazed at the vast lake, his thoughts drifting far away.
Nineteen years, two months, and three days, it's been nineteen years, two months, and three days!
A distinguished high-energy physics researcher, a promising top student, a future great scientist, made a small mistake in an experiment, and after an explosion, came to this world, reincarnated and started life anew!
"Bang!" A muffled sound broke his contemplation, and turning his head, he saw a golden carp jumping incessantly on the boat.
Chu Li shook his head, bent down to throw the carp back into the lake. As he straightened up, a tall building came into his view.
The hundred-meter-tall building, shimmering with a bronze glow, was imposing and solemn, fully displaying the majesty of the Duke's mansion.
This bronze tower is the Yanwu Hall!
In front of the Yanwu Hall is a spacious martial arts training ground, with red clay paving the ground. Hundreds of people are practicing, either practicing swords, fists, palms, or sparring with each other, creating a lively atmosphere.
Chu Li disembarked from the boat and stepped onto the martial arts training ground. He had only taken a few steps when a handsome young man suddenly appeared, with a face as beautiful as jade, eyebrows sharp as swords, and a spirited demeanor.
He was tall, a head taller than Chu, looking down at him with his arms crossed, "What are you doing here, Chu?"
Chu Li frowned, "Move aside, good dogs don't block the way!"
The handsome young man chuckled, "Do you want to practice martial arts?"
Chu Li suddenly laughed and continued to walk forward, "Zhuo Feiyang, believe it or not, if I fall and scream, you won't be able to handle the consequences?"
The guards of the mansion were forbidden to engage in private fights and were not allowed to kill each other. The guards were divided into protective guards and attendant guards, one military and one civil. Both were strictly forbidden to engage in private fights, with punishments ranging from demotion to expulsion from the mansion.
Chu Li was a guard of unranked status, while Zhuo Feiyang was an eighth-ranked protector. It was a major taboo for a protector to attack a guard. His screams as he fell to the ground meant that even a genius like Zhuo Feiyang would face severe punishment.
Zhuo Feiyang's sword-like eyebrows furrowed: "Chu, fine, you're shameless enough!" Chu Li continued to walk forward.
Zhuo Feiyang stepped aside, his handsome face gloomy: "Chu, you can only resort to these petty tricks!"
Chu Lixiao said, "To deal with a fool like you, a little trick is enough!"
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him, his fists clenched tighter and tighter, as if ready to strike at any moment, but Chu Li looked at him lazily, full of provocation.
Zhuo Feiyang suddenly showed a brilliant smile and waved vigorously, "Zhao Shimai!"
A beautiful young girl with a graceful figure was walking towards us from a distance. Her skin was as white as snow, with almond-shaped eyes and willow-leaf eyebrows. She had a delicate demeanor and a gentle temperament.
Chu Li's expression changed slightly. Zhao Ying, who entered the mansion at the same time as them, was beautiful, kind, and gentle, the kind of woman that men would like at first sight.
"Brother Zhuo?" Zhao Ying walked over lightly, surprised, "Brother Chu?"
Chu Li smelled the faint fragrance she brought with her and smiled, "Zhao Shimei, long time no see."
Since being assigned to the East Garden, he spent most of his time in the library, hoping to change his fate with knowledge, and rarely visited the martial arts hall.
The reason for coming to the Martial Arts Hall this time was because there were problems in practicing the Small Circulation Technique, and he wanted to look at the secret manuals and practice notes related to the Small Circulation Technique.
Zhao Ying laughed and said, "Brother Chu, congratulations, the East Garden is a nice place."
Chu Lixiao nodded with a smile: "Not bad at all."
The East Garden was directly under Miss Xiao Qi's Jade Island, with only him and Li Yue as guards. Not only were they at ease, but they also had the opportunity to see Miss Xiao. Once they gained her favor, their rapid promotion was just around the corner.
Zhuo Feiyang took a deep breath, this guy was too lucky, he actually got into the East Garden, the heavens were too blind, he had to teach him a lesson!
"Zhao Shimai, don't bother with this waste, I just mastered the Breaking Delusion Sword Technique yesterday, shall we spar?"
Zhao Ying frowned, finding Zhuo Feiyang's words unpleasant.
"Alright, alright, I won't say he's a waste!" Zhuo Feiyang quickly apologized with a smile, glancing at Chu Li: "Even though he is a waste!"
Zhao Ying glared in dissatisfaction.
"Zhao Shimai, it's okay," Chu Li smiled and said, "There's no need to argue with such arrogant and foolish people."
"Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying scolded.
Chu Li raised his hands in surrender: "Junior Sister Zhao, come and play in the East Garden, the scenery is beautiful, and Brother Li's cooking skills are excellent."
"Hmph, what's there to see!" Zhuo Feiyang sneered, "It's just flowers and plants. It's better to practice martial arts in that time, indulging in playthings will lead to the loss of ambition!" "According to you, the third young lady and the eldest son are all indulging in playthings, aren't they inferior to you?" Chu Li smiled, the west garden belonged to the eldest son, Xiao Tieying.
Zhuo Feiyang's handsome face turned red, he laughed coldly, deciding not to argue with him.
"Brother Zhuo! Brother Chu!" Zhao Ying complained discontentedly, "Can you two quiet down for a bit! ... Brother Chu, I will come over to play, you can go ahead with your work if you have something to do."
Chu Li looked at her deeply and said, "Zhao Shimei, some people may look good on the outside, but it takes time to see their true nature. Don't trust others too easily!"
"What do you mean, Chu?"
Chu Li ignored him and smiled at Zhao Ying, giving him a fist and palm salute.
Zhao Ying turned and left.
Zhuo Feiyang hurried to catch up, and as he was leaving, he suddenly reached out when Zhao Ying was not paying attention.
His slap was almost on Chu Li's face, very confident that Chu Li wouldn't have time to dodge. It seemed careless, but he had used his internal strength, and his speed was incredibly fast.
Chu Li slightly turned his head, and the tip of Zhuo Feiyang's finger brushed past his cheek. He could feel the breeze, and the force of this palm was not light.
"Bang!"
A crisp and loud slap echoed.
Chu Li slapped his left palm on his own face, the sound crisp and loud. He didn't use much force, but the sound was very loud, and then he quickly withdrew his hand.
Zhao Ying quickly turned her head to look. Chu Li's expression remained unchanged, as if the slap hadn't landed on his own face.
Zhuo Feiyang glared at him with a gloomy expression. Chu Li smiled, touched his own face and said, "What a great skill, I admire it!"
Zhuo Feiyang stared at him intently.
"Brother Zhuo--!" Zhao Ying lowered her face.
"I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to," Zhuo Feiyang gritted his teeth, his voice squeezing out through clenched teeth, coldly saying, "I presume Junior Brother Chu won't mind, right, Junior Brother Chu?"
Chu Li turned his head and smiled, "Sister Zhao, forget it."
Feeling embarrassed, Zhao Ying glanced at him and quickly pulled Zhuo Feiyang away. If they stayed any longer, the two would surely start fighting!
Chu Li stared at Zhao Ying's graceful figure without moving, touched his burning left cheek, and calmed his emotional fluctuations with the help of the large round mirror.
If it weren't for Da Yuan Jing Zhi, it would be inevitable to be schemed against by Zhuo Fei Yang!
In a world where martial prowess is revered, the concept deeply ingrained since childhood, Zhao Ying's gentleness and kindness, openly and secretly protecting him, moved him deeply.
But as a man, he needed a woman's protection, and as a man, he simply couldn't bear it!
He passed through the crowd in the training ground and entered the martial arts hall.
He took off the wooden plaque from his waist and handed it to the young man in front of the hall. The young man, with a sharp gaze, glanced at it and signaled that he could go in.
Before his eyes were rows of bookshelves. He strolled along, occasionally stopping to pull out a book, quickly flipping through it, then putting it back and continuing on, stopping again to flip through another book.
In one hour, he flipped through twenty-two books.
It seemed as if he knew the location of these books all along, going straight to them and pulling them out, but in fact, it was his first time here, and he had read the small washing mantra in the library.
The entire Martial Arts Hall appeared in his mind, every row of bookshelves, the name of each book, clear and vivid.
He casually walked to the second floor, went straight to the third row of bookshelves, pulled out the "Sword Manual of Breaking Delusions" from the second layer, flipped through it, and then pulled out seven secret books, which were the cultivation insights of the "Sword Manual of Breaking Delusions".
When he left the martial arts hall, his mind was imprinted with thirty secret manuals, twenty-two notes on small vein cleansing practices, one Broken Delusion Sword manual, and seven insights into the practice of the Broken Delusion Sword.
He was sailing on the lake, with a gentle breeze blowing, and his original raging anger had dissipated.
The thirty secret manuals in his mind began to integrate and understand each other.
The midday sun was blazing as he sailed back to the East Garden.
The East Garden is a small island of two square miles, divided into individual flower beds, each bed with a unique flower, and the entire island is filled with the fragrance of flowers.
There was only a small courtyard on the island. When Chu Li pushed the door to enter, a cool breeze hit his face. A large tree covered half of the courtyard, driving away the heat.
He entered the west room, took out a green-edged sword, and swung it in the middle of the courtyard, slowly like a Tai Chi sword. After a while, he broke out in a sweat, his forehead shining.
He had a photographic memory, and the secret techniques he saw were imprinted in his mind after just one glance. The Prowang Sword Technique he had just learned from the Martial Arts Hall was indeed powerful, but it also consumed a lot of energy.
"A squeak..." A burly young man with a round face and small eyes walked out of the main hall.
He swayed like a black bear, stretching lazily and yawning twice before speaking languidly: "Brother, you're back so early?"
Chu Li was focused on practicing his swordsmanship and only responded with a grunt. Li Yue, a ninth-rank guard, was responsible for the East Garden together with him. He had a good appetite and excellent cooking skills. His martial arts were good, but he was afraid of death and did not dare to venture into the ninth-rank tower, content to be a guard.
The guards and protectors of the national government were divided into nine ranks, with a tenfold difference in wages.
The salary of the guards is low, and the rank is based on seniority: three years for the ninth rank, ten years for the eighth rank, twenty years for the seventh rank, forty years for the sixth rank, and seventy years for the fifth rank. The promotion of the guards is based solely on martial arts skills, with one rank increase for each level of the nine-rank tower they pass.
The pay is good, and you can often leave the mansion to carry out tasks, leading a colorful life, unlike the guards who can only stay in the mansion to serve people. Anyone with a bit of ability would choose to be a bodyguard.
Li Yue shook his neck and stretched his legs, his joints making a series of cracking sounds. He then began to practice his punches, his fists flying like shooting stars, creating a gust of wind with each swing.
"Brother, stop practicing the sword, come practice boxing with me!"
Chu Li spat out two words, his forehead covered in beads of sweat the size of soybeans.
In this world, martial arts are flourishing, and training begins from childhood.
Once past the age of eight to eighteen, once the meridians are set, even the most magical methods are half as effective, requiring multiple times the amount of time to build a foundation.
Before the age of eighteen, he missed the foundation building in the Daizhidu Benyuan Sutra, where he grew up in Qiuye Temple. His spirit was twice that of ordinary people, and his spirit was strong.
In addition, his past life as a high-energy physics researcher gave him a far superior understanding of the world than the average person.
By combining the two, he finally mastered the Great Wisdom Sutra, achieving the divine power of the Great Perfect Mirror Wisdom.
With a strong spirit, he practiced for much longer than ordinary people, had supernatural powers, and observed in detail, hence his progress in the small washing pulse technique was very fast, and he was able to build a foundation in five years.
"Hehe... with your sword, you can't even kill a chicken, what are you practicing for?"
Chu Li suddenly sheathed his sword and snorted, "A comparison?"
He was panting heavily, his body weak and limp. He propped himself up with his sword on the ground, barely able to stand. The Prowang Sword Technique was too physically draining.
Chapter 1
In the quaint room, Ling Tian suddenly woke up.
This is the instinctive reaction of an excellent special forces soldier!
As soon as the hand fell, a shock-like sour pain came, followed by a wave of weakness.
Ling Tian opened his eyes.
A gentle female voice came to my ear.
Ling Tian saw a delicate face looking at him with concern.
She is a classic beauty, so stunning that it takes one's breath away, she can be perfectly described as a woman of overwhelming beauty.
Ling Tian, a Chinese national.
He served in the most outstanding Wolf Fang special operations unit in China, and during his service, he made countless contributions.
He participated in world-class special forces competitions, winning the individual honor for best combat capability, and is recognized as the 'King of Soldiers'!
Later, during a multinational SSS-level mission, a minor personal mistake led to the sacrifice of a comrade.
Feeling guilty, he chose to retire and left Wolftooth.
After retiring, he kept a low profile for a while, choosing to go abroad and becoming the ace in one of the most renowned mercenary organizations internationally.
As long as he undertakes the task, the success rate is an unprecedented 100%!
Although he had retired from the Wolf Fang for many years, he still cared deeply for his country.
Not only would he refuse to take on tasks that were detrimental to his country, but he would also track down the person who issued the task and carry out a brutal and inhumane massacre.
Over time, he became a thorn in the side of all countries other than China.
In the eyes of other countries, he is a ticking time bomb.
However, as the assassins disappeared one by one, Ling Tian thrived more and more, and no assassin dared to take on this 'death mission' anymore.
Killing Ling Tian is tantamount to seeking one's own death. This is a universally acknowledged statement in the world of mercenaries and assassins.
Throughout the Earth, rarely met an opponent, never been defeated!
Not long ago, Ling Tian received a message from his most trusted agent.
Country R produced a colorless and odorless biochemical weapon, intending to smuggle it into Country H, to carry out a horrific conspiracy.
Of course, Ling Tian would not stand by and do nothing about this.
He made a move!
With the help of a broker, the location of the batch of biochemical weapons was found.
Just as he fought his way into the underground laboratory, ready to destroy the batch of biochemical weapons, the underground laboratory suddenly collapsed, trapping him in a completely enclosed cage.
When Ling Tian saw individuals from Country R holding various types of firearms outside the prison cage, he understood.
I was betrayed by the person I trusted the most!
Otherwise, with his astuteness, the schemes of the people from country R would not have succeeded.
Until he was killed by a hail of bullets, Ling Tian still couldn't figure it out.
"My dear, what's wrong with you? Don't scare your mother."
A gentle voice came, filled with anxiety.
He was absolutely certain that he did not know this woman.
But the look in the woman's eyes now, was as if she was looking at a loved one, devoid of any pretense, filled with sincerity.
Just as Ling Tian was about to argue with this beauty.
Ling Tian was struck dumb as if by a thunderbolt, completely stunned as if he had been acupunctured.
The only thing that satisfied Ling Tian was that this guy was also called Ling Tian, full name 'Duan Ling Tian'.
Duan Lingtian, fifteen years old.
The non-Li surnamed descendants of Qingfeng Town.
His mother, 'Li Rou', was one of the nine elders of the Li family.
In his memory, his father... there was no father at all.
In the process of integrating these unfamiliar memories, Ling Tian also learned the reason why Duan Ling Tian was seriously injured and lying in bed.
Early this morning, the youngest son of the seventh elder of the Li family, 'Li Xin', insulted Duan Lingtian as a bastard born of a mother but without a father's teaching.
However, he, who had not even completed the tempering process, was no match for Li Xin, who was at the second level of the tempering realm. He was seriously injured by Li Xin and was on the verge of death.
After merging all the unfamiliar memories, Ling Tian sighed in his heart.
He knew that from this moment on, he would integrate into this unfamiliar world as Duan Lingtian.
From now on, he is Duan Lingtian, and Duan Lingtian is him.
"Madam, the master has sent for the medicine."
A voice came to his ear, and Duan Lingtian looked up.
A maid hurried in from outside the room and handed the exquisite box in her hand to Li Rou.
The box was opened. Immediately, the scent of medicine wafted out.
"Child, come, take this elixir, mother will heal your wounds."
Li Rou took out a pitch-black pill from inside and placed it at Duan Lingtian's mouth.
Taking a deep breath, Duan Lingtian opened his mouth and swallowed the pill.
The elixir melted as soon as it entered his mouth, turning into a warm current that flowed into his body.
Then, Duan Lingtian saw it again.
A cold current flowed into his body, dissolving the warmth created by the elixir and healing his injuries.
An hour later, Li Rou stopped.
Duan Lingtian found that most of the soreness in his body had disappeared, leaving him without any burden.
Did he just take some kind of magical elixir?
At this point, Duan Lingtian noticed that Li Rou's face was pale and she was sweating profusely, clearly having expended a great deal of energy healing his injuries.
"Daughter, are you okay?"
A warmth filled Duan Lingtian's heart.
This 'mother' call was affectionate and natural, without any awkwardness.
"Your mother is fine, she just needs some rest."
Li Rou shook her head with a smile.
For the sake of his son, this expenditure of primal energy was nothing.
"He and the seven elders are still waiting in the prison," the maid whispered as she entered the room half an hour later.
"Let go? Tell the person sent by the house owner that I will handle this matter personally."
The amiability on Li Rou's face was completely gone, leaving a cold expression.
"Daughter, what kind of pill did you just give me? I feel like my injury has almost healed."
Duan Lingtian got out of bed, stretching his body slightly.
"That is the 'Eighth Rank Golden Healing Pill'."
Originally, there were only two of these eighth-grade Golden Creation Pills, even in the Li family of Qingfeng Town, and now one of them was used on him, a member of the family with a different surname.
Clearly, his mother held a high position in the Li family.
"Dear, the master of the house is still waiting, let's go over."
Li Rou brought Duan Lingtian to a spacious courtyard in the Li family mansion.
Here, is where the Li family carries out their family law. The punishment court!
At high noon, the sun was blazing in the sky.
The area around the prison was filled with people, all of them were onlookers from the Li family.
In the courtyard, a young boy was tied to a pillar and exposed to the sun, with two middle-aged men standing nearby.
The middle-aged man with a cockeye on the right side, upon seeing Duan Lingtian and his mother, had a face full of anger.
"Duan Lingtian has also arrived... The effect of the family's treasured eighth-grade Golden Creation Pill is really strong!" "Yes, I saw when Duan Lingtian was carried back, he was half-dead."
"Li Xin is the same, usually bullying Duan Lingtian casually is fine, and the Ninth Elder won't say anything. But this time he actually made such a heavy move, almost killing Duan Lingtian. It would be strange if the Ninth Elder didn't get angry."
One by one, the Li family members watched as Li Rou and Duan Lingtian arrived, whispering among themselves.
Li Rou, accompanied by Duan Lingtian, bowed to the middle-aged man on the left.
"Elder Nine, my son Li Xin was at fault today," he said. "But now that your son is unharmed and my son has been exposed to the sun for a whole morning, can we let him down?"
At this moment, the cross-eyed middle-aged man, also known as the seventh elder of the Li family, 'Li Kun', had a gloomy expression on his face.
To his surprise, Li Rou completely ignored him.
Instead, he brought Duan Lingtian to the bound Li Xin.
"Son, how he hurt you this morning, now, you give it all back to him!" Chapter 1.
When Gu Xijiu woke up, she discovered a very serious problem. She didn't recognize her surroundings at all!
Looking out through the gaps in the corridor, she saw a crescent moon hanging in the sky, with stars twinkling all around, while she was being carried forward lying down.
She was a bit dazed and couldn't help but move, only to discover an even more serious problem - she was naked! Her body was wrapped in a thin silk quilt, which covered her from head to toe tightly, with only her eyes exposed.
Her cold gaze first fell on the two burly men who were carrying her.
He was strong and muscular, dressed like an ancient warrior. Despite carrying a person, he moved silently. At first glance, he was clearly a martial artist with considerable skills.
Gu Xijiu's fingers tightened in the quilt!
She is the queen of modern assassins, cold and ruthless, dominating the world, but she never expected to be betrayed by the person she trusted the most, a man named Long Xi, who was her former instructor and doctor. She didn't trust anyone, but she trusted him, even loved him, and wanted to marry him.
She was supposed to be dead, but instead of going to meet the King of Hell for tea, she inexplicably ended up here.
At this point, she naturally wouldn't think that she had arrived at some kind of filming base.
She has crossed over!
Transported into this body, I was carried like a wrapped dumpling towards a rather luxurious hall.
"Ah... Ah... Help... Help... Ah, ah, don't..." The woman's delicate and painful scream instantly brought Gu Xijiu's wandering thoughts back. She quickly scanned the room, her gaze slightly hardened! The furnishings in the hall were naturally beautiful, whether it was the rosewood tables and chairs or the flower and bird tortoiseshell screen, all displayed two words - luxurious!
The man above was handsome, in his late twenties, with long hair held back by a jade hairpin, casually draped over his shoulders. His muscles were well-defined, his movements strong and powerful. His lips were slightly pursed, hinting at a cold smile, making him quite the cool and attractive man.
Below was a young girl, who looked very young, with clear eyebrows and beautiful eyes. Unlike the man's face of enjoyment, the little girl's face was pale, her mouth slightly open, her throat was hoarse from shouting, and her hair was soaked with cold sweat. She was obviously in extreme pain. Gu Xijiu's face changed slightly!
Who is this bastard, forcing himself on a young sprout! Who is he really?
The two burly men carried Gu Xijiu in, but they couldn't disturb the man's good mood, his actions became even faster and more fierce!
The little girl finally couldn't bear it, she let out a few muffled cries, her eyes rolled back, her head tilted, and she stopped moving.
"What a buzzkill!" The man muttered under his breath, rolling off the girl and, with a swift kick, sent her flying off the bed like a piece of trash.
The girl didn't move, her small face had turned waxen yellow, and there was a line of blood flowing from the corner of her lips. It was unclear whether she was dead or alive.
"This is too useless, take it to the chaotic burial mound to feed the dogs!" The man's tone was full of frustration and unfulfilled desires.
Flagstaff, also known as Flag City, is a small town in the western United States. Geographically, it is located in the northern part of Arizona, on the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau, near Las Vegas to the west and the famous Grand Canyon to the east.
Many Chinese people have heard of the United States, Arizona, the Grand Canyon, and Las Vegas, but not many probably know about Flagstaff, which is nestled in between these four areas.
Six months ago, Li Du was also one of those 'few', until he came to study in Flagpole City.
Flagstaff is not well-known domestically or in the United States, but it does have a few good universities, such as the University of Arizona and the American College of Flagstaff.
The school where Li Du studied abroad was called Flagstaff State College, which is only one word different from Flagstaff American College, but the difference between these two words is like night and day!
Flagstaff American College is a branch of American College, a quite good private university, offering undergraduate, specialist, and preparatory education.
This is a diploma mill, and Li Du was completely deceived into studying for a postgraduate degree here.
As a result, he had only paid his tuition and research fees for half a year when the school was shut down. The school board and admissions department had received advance notice and fled, leaving a group of international students confused and driven away by the police.
Li Du was lucky because the school accommodation was too chaotic. In order to study in peace, he did not stay in the dormitory, but rented an apartment room. At least now he has a place to stay. His classmates who paid for school accommodation are now wandering the streets.
However, his situation was not much better than his classmates'. It was the end of January and his rent was due. If he didn't pay it on time, he might end up homeless.
Sadly, he was out of money at this time!
Of course, he could borrow money from his parents and friends back home, but that's under the premise that he is studying abroad. Now that the school has been banned, he definitely can't complete his postgraduate studies. How could he have the face to ask his elderly parents for money? As for asking friends?
Sitting at the entrance of the small building with a worried look, Li Du heard the pine door behind him being pushed open, and a blonde, blue-eyed girl poked her head out: "Hey, Li, are you here?"
The girl was his landlord, named Hannah-Fox, the house was an inheritance left by her parents who died in a car accident, belonging to her and her brother Hans-Fox.
However, Hans claimed to be 'busy with big business' and would not stay for a few days throughout the year, so the vacant bedroom was rented out by Hanna for income.
Hearing the call, Li Du stood up and said, "Oh, yes, Hannah, what's up?"
The girl shrugged and smiled, a dimple appearing on her beautiful face: "I saw a few cans of beer when I was cleaning the fridge just now, they must have been left by Hans. I remember you like malt beer, why not drink it?"
She was carrying a half-dozen bottles of beer in a common wooden box, with a very obvious Budweiser logo on it.
Seeing these beers, Li Du also smiled. There was only a small refrigerator in the apartment, which he would open and close every day. Where would there be any beer inside?
Given Hans' temperament, if there really was beer, he definitely wouldn't leave it behind; this guy is as fond of alcohol as life itself.
He guessed that the beer was bought by Hannah to comfort him, knowing that their school was closed down. Hannah had comforted him several times, which touched him deeply.
However, Hannah didn't have many ways to comfort him, either giving him a motivational book or a beer.
This American girl once approached him to learn about Chinese culture, and learned the phrase 'a drunken state can relieve a thousand worries.' She thought that according to the Chinese character, getting drunk and sleeping could alleviate worries, so she offered him beer to drink several times.
Li Du accepted Hannah's kindness, considering it a favor owed to her. In American social interactions, some gifts cannot be refused, otherwise it may be misunderstood as rejecting friendship, and he cherished his friendship with Hannah.
He took the wooden box, and Hannah left with a smile, saying before she left, "There are many problems in life, but it is still beautiful."
Muttering the American slang phrase a few times, Li Du opened the package to take out a can of beer. But as soon as he opened the wooden box, a crystal that looked like amber suddenly fell out, hitting the ground with a 'crack'.
The crystal, about the size of his thumb pad, had fallen heavily on the cement floor and had several cracks on it.
The reason for guessing it was amber was because it was light yellow in color and contained a small insect, very similar to an amber he had seen in the sixth grade of elementary school. At that time, their textbook had a text called "Amber", and when the Chinese teacher taught them, she brought an amber.
The crystal reminded him of some good times from his childhood, he remembered his teacher saying that amber with insects inside was very precious. Unfortunately, this one was already cracked, which he regretted, as selling it might have covered his living expenses for a couple of months.
The crystal was severely shattered, and when he picked it up, it had already broken apart, revealing the purple bug that was wrapped inside.
The insect, which resembles a locust, is about two centimeters long, with a strange appearance. It has compound eyes like a locust, but only two legs under its belly, with strange patterns on them. It has no wings on its back and looks very clumsy.
Li Du had never seen this kind of bug before and curiously picked it up to get a better look.
Just then, something strange happened: the little bug's claw suddenly twitched, then quickly regained vitality, wriggling its body to break free from between his fingers.
Before he could react, the little bug jumped into his palm, lowered its head, and slowly, bit by bit, burrowed into his hand.
Li Du was scared to the point of urinating, he really needed to pee!
With a scream, he stumbled into the house, shouting, "Hannah, call 911! Help, a bug has crawled into my hand!"
His scream must have been too piercing, as Hannah came out looking panicked, "What? What bug?"
Li Du spread his hand out to show her: "This is it, the bug in the palm of my hand!"
Hannah looked bewildered, "The bug in your hand? Where is the bug in your hand?"
Not only was there a bug, but it was also wriggling. After burrowing into Li Du's palm, it seemed unsatisfied with being idle and started to burrow out again, with half of its body emerging.
Li Du pointed at the worm crawling out and exclaimed in horror, "This one, this one, the purple locust, can't you see it?"
Li Du interrupted her and exclaimed, "I understand what you mean, you think I'm crazy! But I'm not, Hannah!"
"Shit, the bug is out again!"
Just as he was shouting hoarsely, the bug slowly crawled out of his skin and jumped to the ground, propping itself up with its two legs and walking around like a human.
Coincidentally, it landed next to a drain. The little bug didn't notice and fell right in.
Seeing this, Li Du was overjoyed and said, "Great, the bug has fallen into the drain."
Subconsciously, an idea came to his mind: what could be in the drain? Could there be sewage that would drown the bug?
But then, something happened that he could hardly believe!
Chapter One
The vast land of China, the northern desert.
The snow was wreaking havoc across the land, the vast mountains and countless ravines were all covered in a blanket of silver, the snowflakes were falling thick and fast, and looking into the distance, the sky and the earth were all of one color.
On the winding mountain road, a caravan was resting. The snowstorm was too heavy, making it difficult for the horse-drawn carriages to move. They had no choice but to wait for the storm to lessen before continuing on their journey.
"Look, the coffin bearer!"
The shout of a middle-aged man drew the attention of the entire caravan. A group of people curiously looked up into the distance, and after only a few glances, they were all deeply shocked!
The howling snowstorm filled the sky, making the world a blur. A mysterious golden ancient coffin appeared faintly in the distance on the mountain path, gradually coming into everyone's view.
The golden ancient coffin was two meters long, one meter wide and high, with primitive patterns and runes carved on the coffin wall. The patterns and runes emitted a faint glow, completely blocking the falling snowflakes, which was extremely eerie.
What also shocked everyone was the person pulling the ancient coffin in front.
It was a young boy, who looked to be only fourteen or fifteen years old. He was bare-chested, hunched over, and gripping two massive cold iron chains with his hands. Using his shoulders to bear the weight of the chains, he was struggling to pull the ancient coffin forward step by step.
In the icy and snowy world, the young man pulls the coffin!
The scene was visually striking and captivating. The faint light emitted from the golden ancient coffin behind him made the boy's body somewhat blurry, obscuring his face. In their daze, everyone seemed to see a deity pulling the coffin.
"This young man was born with divine strength."
The middle-aged man exclaimed again, many people turned their attention back to the young man, confirming that there was no mysterious power shining on him, and were once again moved.
A common willow coffin weighs three to four hundred pounds, but this ancient coffin was cast entirely in gold, so it must weigh at least three thousand pounds.
A young man without mystical power is not a true warrior, even a strong man only has a strength of five to six hundred pounds. The young man was able to pull a three thousand pound ancient coffin by himself, although it seemed a bit strenuous, it was enough to be shocking.
"So young and handsome, yet he's pulling a coffin. Does this young man want to be unlucky for the rest of his life?"
An old man sighed, and many people nodded in agreement. Although the act of pulling a coffin was uncommon, it had occasionally happened in the history of the Northern Desert, and everyone knew something about it.
After the death of important elders, the Northern Desert Clan likes to bury them in large golden coffins. These coffins are not buried in the ground, but are placed on the top of ice mountains, which is said to bless the people of the clan.
When the family declines or encounters a major change, the family will hold a coffin-moving ceremony, looking for a new iceberg to transfer the ancestral coffin of the clan, change the feng shui, and rebuild the family's welfare.
This led to the emergence of the coffin bearers.
Carrying a coffin is considered to bring bad luck in many northern desert cultures. It is believed that during the process, one's own luck will be absorbed by the body in the coffin, as well as their vitality and lifespan, leading to a lifetime of misfortune or illness.
Therefore, coffin pulling is considered the most demeaning job in the Northern Desert. No matter how high the commission, young warriors are not tempted, only down-and-out older warriors would take on such a job.
The young man had handsome features, was about 1.75 meters tall, with broad shoulders and a narrow waist, long legs, and well-defined muscles. He wore a primitive beast tooth around his neck, which gave him a wild appearance. Judging solely by his looks, he was quite impressive.
At fourteen or fifteen, he was handsome and possessed terrifying strength. The young man's conditions were not bad. Yet, why did he choose to do this most despicable and lowly job of pulling coffins?
"Isn't he afraid of losing his luck, reducing his lifespan, and being unlucky for a lifetime?" The middle-aged man glanced at the golden ancient coffin and said with relief, "This seems to be the ancestral coffin of the Liu family? That's right, I heard that the Liu family has recently undergone a major change and has offered a sky-high price."
"Silence, the people from the Liu family are coming," an elder suddenly said. Everyone in the caravan quickly shut their mouths and looked towards the distance.
Boo hoo!
From a distance came the howls of beasts, a group of warriors clad in black armor, riding on silver giant wolves, came galloping. The fierce aura of the giant wolves hit you even before they got close.
"The Silver Wolf Guard, indeed the warriors of the Liu family."
Everyone nodded secretly, in the vicinity of Wuling City for a thousand miles around, there was only one army riding silver wolves, which was the strongest Silver Wolf Guard of the Liu family.
The Silver Wolf Guard stopped after catching up with the boy. A middle-aged giant man at the front, holding a long whip, looked at the boy and shouted coldly: "Luli, move faster! If you don't reach Black Hawk Ridge before dark, you will not receive any reward."
The boy known as Lu Li looked up, surrounded by a dozen giant silver wolves each a meter tall and two meters long. He showed no great fear, and nodded, saying, "Don't worry, I will definitely arrive before dark."
With a loud shout, the giant man led the Silver Wolf Guard and galloped away, quickly disappearing into the distant vast mountains.
Lu Li glanced at the nearby caravan and continued to silently pull the coffin forward. He gripped the cold iron chain with both hands, shouldering the weight and struggling to move forward, each step extremely difficult, his whole body trembling. Despite this, he did not pause, quickly passing the caravan and heading into the distance.
"It's so heavy!"
After traveling a few miles and climbing a steep slope, Luliu stopped. He was panting heavily, sweating profusely in such cold weather, which indicated the great physical exertion he had undergone.
He thought about taking a break, after placing the ancient coffin properly, he sat on a rock and took out fresh water and dried meat from the sack on his back, chewing and swallowing heartily to replenish his strength.
We should be able to arrive before it gets dark.
After eating a few pieces of dried meat and looking at the sky, his eyes quickly brightened, and he muttered to himself: "Pulling a coffin can exchange for a pill, I wonder if the Li family's body tempering pill is really as legendary, can one pill increase strength by five hundred jin?"
"If I could really increase my strength by five hundred pounds, I currently have three thousand pounds of strength, and I only need to pull a dozen or so coffins to reach ten thousand pounds of strength, then I could... awaken my bloodline!"
"Who dares to bully my sister in the tribe? Hehe, I will soon be able to give my sister a good life."
With this thought, Lu Li's weary face lit up with glory, he quickly got up and pulled the coffin forward, this time his steps were even more steady and fast.
Shasha!
After traveling several miles, a sound echoed from behind. Lu Li looked back and his face turned slightly gloomy.
At the back was also a man from the La Pavilion, but he was an old man. The old man's hand holding the iron chain was shining with streaks of white light, and there was a faint white light flowing on his feet.
Lu Li enviously muttered to himself, the white light is the mysterious power only martial artists have. Martial artists with this power would greatly increase their strength. This old man had used his mysterious power, which allowed him to move swiftly and easily pull the ancient coffin.
The old man caught up with Lulí, looked at him and frowned, saying, "Young man, why are you also pulling a coffin? This will damage your luck."
Lu Li smiled faintly without saying anything. The old man glanced at him a few times, said no more, and quickly pulled the coffin away.
"If I can't awaken my bloodline, what future is there to speak of? Only a lifetime of mediocrity, being bullied every day, and causing my sister to suffer along with me."
"No, this is not the life I want!"
Thinking of this, Lu Li's face became somewhat distorted, he roared in anger, gritted his teeth and quickly dragged the coffin forward.
The snowstorm grew stronger and the sky gradually darkened. The faint glow emitted by the ancient golden coffin in the vast mountain path was elusive, creating an extraordinarily mysterious and enchanting scene.
Chapter 001
"Big brother is going to look for a job, you stay at home and do your homework well. Here is ten dollars, don't forget to go out and buy something to eat at noon."
In front of a small hut in the slum, Luli patted the little girl's head affectionately, rubbing it again and again. Seeing his sister so healthy and lively, it was truly wonderful!
"Brother, I know," the little girl pouted and complained, "Don't mess up my hair, you've made it all messy."
Lu Xin, the younger sister, carefully sorted out Lu Li's clothes and advised him like a little adult, "You must work hard. Brother is so capable of enduring hardship, I believe you will definitely find a job this time."
"Don't worry, big brother will definitely find a good job, earn a lot of money, and let Xin Xin live a good life," Lu Li hugged his sister, adding silently in his heart, he wouldn't let her lose her life bit by bit because of lack of money.
"When Xinxin grows up, she will also earn a lot of money," the little girl twisted in Luli's arms, waving her little fist with a solemn promise.
No matter how reluctant, Lu Li still said goodbye to his sister.
After getting on the bus, his hand in his pocket paused for a moment, and he couldn't help but give a bitter smile.
The money I just gave to my sister for her lunch has returned to my own pocket. I should have expected this little girl to do so, it's so sweet it's heartbreaking.
Now in the 23rd century, technology has advanced infinitely, with various intelligent technologies filling every corner of the world. This development has brought about a rapid progress in people's lives, but at the same time, it has also reduced the demand for human labor to the lowest level.
Unemployment is no longer a rare occurrence, especially for people like Luli who are at the bottom of society, finding a stable job is only a luxury.
Unless something unexpected happens, he will continue to be unemployed.
It was not until he joined a gold farming guild in a game company by chance that he finally settled down. However, because he entered the game called "Dawn" nearly a year after it was released, he was too far behind in levels and thus never made it into the ranks of the super players.
Two years later, his sister Lu Xin was found to have a serious illness during a school physical examination.
Unable to afford the treatment costs that ran into the millions, and constantly being hunted down by several unions in the game during that period, he could only watch in agony as his only relative grew weaker day by day.
The feeling was more painful than being cut with a knife, and Lu Li cried out in pain more than once while holding his sister.
However, fate took a turn. The day he received the critical illness notice, Lu Li cried for a while and then fell asleep in front of his sister's sickbed, only to wake up and find that he had been reborn three years earlier.
While he was happy that his sister was still healthy, he knew he had to make money, a lot of money.
With money, he could cure his sister's illness as soon as possible, and only with money could he allow his sister to live a happy life like countless other girls her age, as a carefree and adorable little girl should.
With money, one can hold their head high and never feel inferior to anyone at any time!
After much calculation, Lu Li found, much to his dismay, that even after reincarnation, becoming rich was not easy.
All he seemed to be able to do was play games - the one he had been playing for over two years, "Dawn" - with only a few days left until the game was open.
Lu Li had given up on finding a regular job, and today he went directly to the headquarters of the Star Moon Guild where he had served in his previous life.
The Star Moon Guild is not among the top ten games, nor is it among the top four in China. It is just a gaming alliance formed by a group of college students. The leaders of the guild are wealthy second-generation rich kids who are willing to spend money, so its development is quite impressive.
Located next to the university town, Qinghu Community is considered the most scenic place in this area, with mountains and water, cherry blossoms everywhere, office buildings in the front, and a villa area in the back. Only very wealthy people could possibly establish a company here.
The receptionist, a pretty woman, looked somewhat disgusted at Lu Li's attire, dialed a series of numbers, and then informed Lu Li that he could go in for the interview.
"We are currently only recruiting daredevils, no more gold farmers," said the girl in charge of recruitment, who was very trendy. She was painting her nails and conducting the interview without even lifting her head.
The so-called suicide squad is actually cannon fodder, and it's quite normal for a dozen or so to die in a day.
Lu Li joined a studio with the aim of using the studio's gaming helmet for free. Although being a gold farmer had no future, at least he could level up. He didn't want to be a cannon fodder destined for difficult upgrades, as dying in the game would result in a loss of experience.
"What, 20 gold!" The nail polish splashed onto her face, and the girl screamed like a startled cat.
Although "Dawn" represents the most advanced virtual technology today and has a world-class design team, it is not confident enough to go to market without internal testing. However, the content of the tests is relatively small and dispersed, and it will not affect the normal game.
After just a few days of testing, the most profound impression left on the players was that gold coins were hard to earn, and there were just too many places to spend money.
In the early stages of normal gameplay, players generally spend more than they earn, and even experienced gold farmers can't accumulate much silver in a day.
Veteran professional players estimate that to accumulate the 20 gold needed to establish a guild, a hundred-person gold farming team grinding suitable monsters, after deducting equipment repair and potion consumption, would need at least a week or even more. This is under the condition of a higher gold drop rate before the game's third system update.
And this kid in front of him, he actually promised to come up with 20 gold within a week!
20 gold, that's 200,000 copper coins.
"Have you participated in the internal testing, did you find any bugs for making money?" The recruiter, a beautiful woman, asked with a hint of suspicion.
Lu Li laughed without saying a word, appearing extremely profound and inscrutable.
"Proud Sword, I have a situation here, could you come over... Yes, someone has applied for the gold miner position, claiming they can deliver twenty gold within a week, I suspect they might be exploiting a money glitch," the recruiter had no choice but to quietly call for a senior staff member.
Soon, a hurried footsteps were heard, and upon turning around, Lu Li was also a bit surprised.
The people who came over included not only the leader of Star Moon, Ao Jian, but also several others. Lu Li had been in the Star Moon Guild for two years in his previous life, and he recognized most of these people, all of whom were high-ranking members of the guild.
"Oh no, don't tell me, this kid who can make twenty gold a week is him," the short guy walking next to Ao Jian couldn't help but wail. This person's game name is Half a Cigarette, he is the leader of the Star Moon Guild's thief group, and is a very irritable person.
"Do you have a way to get twenty gold coins within a week, and are you sure it's the game 'Dawn'? " Ao Jian's face didn't look very good either. He was originally holding onto a glimmer of hope, but seeing Lu Li's appearance, this glimmer of hope was also gone.
Lu Li had an ordinary appearance, with a waxy yellow and dark complexion. His clothes were wrinkled and worn at the edges, clearly showing signs of wear and tear. At a glance, it was clear that he was the kind of person who struggled at the bottom of society.
"Words are just words, even if I can't get you, there's not much to lose, right?" Facing the powerful aura of the social elite, Lu Li did not show the unease of a low-level person, but just smiled faintly, his calm eyes seemingly filled with endless confidence.
Chapter One
"Ye Mo, Ye Mo, are you okay? Get up quickly, class is about to start. This class is by Wuqing Bing, you better hurry up." A somewhat anxious voice rang in Ye Mo's ear, giving him a strange feeling.
"This idiot, probably too ashamed to show his face, has covered it up," another voice rang in his ear, but this time Ye Mo woke up.
Ye Mo looked around somewhat blankly, not recognizing anyone, all were unfamiliar faces.
Seeing Ye Mo's bewildered expression, another round of hearty laughter erupted. It was clear that the laughter was directed at him. Seeing the people around him laughing as if mocking him, he didn't dare to ask aloud for a moment, but could only be on guard, preventing anyone from attacking him.
Looking at the classmate sitting next to him, it seemed that he was the only one who hadn't laughed at him, and it was him who had kindly nudged him awake earlier.
"How is it like a school?" Ye Mo asked subconsciously, somewhat surprised.
"Haha..." Another round of uproarious laughter echoed.
"Ye Mo, I think you're confused. Can Yan Yan just casually write love letters? You were fine when you were in the Ye family, but now you're no longer a part of it. Be careful in the future."
The classmate sighed, naturally not believing that Ye Mo could forget so quickly, it was just a matter of saving face. He hadn't yet accepted the reality that he was no longer Ye Mo of the Ye family.
Ye Mo's head was throbbing with pain. He remembered making a Rejuvenation Pill with his master Luo Ying, then being attacked by a group from the West Flow Gate. There were explosions and sounds of fighting, and he remembered his master holding him and using a teleportation charm. But how did he end up here? Is this still the Luo Yue Continent?
By the way, he was sitting here now, but where was his master? His master was only three years older than him, and moreover, the reason why the West Flow Sect suddenly attacked them was because his master was too beautiful. The young master of the West Flow Sect wanted to marry his beautiful master, and it was only after she rejected him that this happened.
If Master were to fall into the hands of the West Stream Gate, the consequences would be unimaginable. Thinking of this, Ye Mo could no longer suppress his inner panic and suddenly stood up.
"What's going on, don't you know the class bell has rung?" A stern-faced young woman carrying a few books walked onto the podium, coldly glanced at the laughing students below, and the laughter immediately subsided.
Everyone knew that Yun Bing, the English class lecturer, hated it most when students made a fuss. And once she set her sights on you, there would definitely be no good end. Ye Mo was already feeling that something was wrong. Although he could understand these words, the language was clearly not what he used to use. Could it be that this was no longer the Luo Yue Continent? Frowning, Ye Mo wanted to understand more clearly. Waves of headaches came, and a lot of messy information was remembered.
After his father's death, Ye Mo was completely driven out of the Ye family because he was not of Ye Wentian's bloodline. More precisely, after his father's death, Ye Mo's bloodline was re-examined and determined not to be of the Ye family, which led to him being expelled from the Ye family.
However, he also has a younger sister, Ye Ling, and a younger brother, Ye Zifeng. They are not from the same mother, but are half-siblings. Three years ago, their father seemed to realize that he owed Ye Mo, and specifically proposed a marriage alliance with the Ye family to the old master. Ye Tianwen probably knew that his health was not good, so he wanted to find a backer for Ye Mo, and that's how he found the Ning family in the capital.
The Ning family was naturally very willing to form a marriage alliance with the Ye family, one of the top five families in Huaxia. They promised Ning Lao's granddaughter, Ning Qingxue, to Ye Mo.
During a medical examination at a hospital, Ye Mo was diagnosed with impotence, in other words, he was unable to perform sexually. Although the Ye family tried hard to hide the fact, it seemed that overnight, everyone in the capital knew that one of the five major families in China, the Ye family, had a member who was impotent, which was a great embarrassment for the Ye family.
"Ah..." As his memory reached this point, Ye Mo let out a cry, stood up, and almost immediately wanted to take off his pants to check. He was beginning to understand that he might have been reborn into the body of another person also named Ye Mo, but he was apparently impotent, which was worse than killing him.
"The student over there, what's your name? What do you shout during class? Come to my office after class." The beautiful teacher who was lecturing was interrupted by Ye Mo's shout, and her face didn't look good.
The rest of the class found it amusing that a college student was constantly being sent to the office. They figured only this English teacher could do such a thing. Not going was not an option, as the teacher held their grades in his hands.
Ye Mo sat down in despair. Although he didn't fully understand the intricacies of the family struggle, he had some understanding that he was likely driven out of the Ye family due to his impotence, not necessarily because he wasn't a member of the Ye family. Moreover, who would know if there was any manipulation in the DNA test.
Ye Mo was not worried about being driven out of the Ye family, he didn't care about that at all. What he cared about was his own impotence. And how his master Luo Ying was doing.
However, he also understood why his classmates were laughing. It was because his predecessor, who had clearly been kicked out of the Ye family, still stubbornly pursued the hottest girl in the class, Yan Yan. As a result, she posted his love letter on the blackboard, then stood on the podium and looked down at him, saying, "Young Master Ye, can you sleep with me?"
After his impotence was exposed, he wanted to find a girlfriend out of shame and to save face. However, he didn't expect that the girls who used to fawn over him would treat him this way. In his embarrassment and haste, he fainted, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise for his rebirth.
He was shocked to find himself reborn in such a place. He couldn't understand a single word of the beautiful teacher's lecture on the podium, and even if he could, Ye Mo wouldn't listen. He absolutely couldn't accept the fact that he was now impotent. He would rather not be reborn than be reborn like this.
Whether or not to attend university is no longer a matter of concern, the most important thing is to understand his current situation. His impotence affects the reputation of the Ye family. Although he was driven out of the Ye family, who knows if he will be suddenly killed? Perhaps there are other inside stories that led to him being driven out of the Ye family, is his safety still guaranteed now?
After the bell rang for the end of class, the first thing Ye Mo did was not to go to his beautiful teacher, but to rush out of the school in a hurry. He needed to find a place to check on his own condition, to see if he really had erectile dysfunction.
Fortunately, there wasn't much around Ninghai University, but there were quite a few small alleys. Ye Mo hurriedly ran into a secluded, deserted alley and quickly pulled down his pants.
The "little one" was indeed very small, but Ye Mo was not utterly disappointed because of its small size. Instead, he truly breathed a sigh of relief. He was not impotent, but because the "little one" was too large, it was blocked by a meridian, causing this pseudo-impotence situation.
Even so, with the current technology on Earth, it is undoubtedly a dream to unblock his own blocked meridian. However, this does not stump Ye Mo. Although he currently lacks the ability to open the blocked meridian and strengthen himself, as long as he reaches the third level of Qi cultivation, this meridian will automatically be opened.
However, Ye Mo immediately began to feel somewhat disappointed, because in the situation where the earth's vital energy was so thin, it was undoubtedly a daunting task to cultivate to the third level of Qi training. Perhaps he could never achieve it in his lifetime, in which case, he would still be equivalent to impotence. Sighing, Ye Mo was about to pull up his pants when a sudden scream startled him.
"Such a rogue..." A high-pitched female voice rang out in front of Ye Mo. Ye Mo had been so focused on checking his own little ** that he had forgotten to check his surroundings. He hadn't expected that this small alley was actually connected, it was just that he couldn't see it from the bend in front.
Ye Mo was not an exhibitionist, and besides, he had nothing to show off at the moment, so he quickly pulled up his pants and tried to slip away.
"Ye Mo, is that you?" After screaming, the woman asked in a surprised tone, clearly recognizing Ye Mo.
Chapter 1
In the dead of night, in the Qingzhu Senior Community of Jinhai City.
Shi Feng sat quietly on the soft leather sofa, holding a stack of documents, looking at the swimming pool outside the floor-to-ceiling window, filled with loss and unwillingness.
He was the leader of Phantom, one of the four major game studios in JinHai City, commanding a large guild of tens of thousands of people, and was a well-known master swordsman in JinHai City, but now he could only sit at home and drink to drown his sorrows.
A decade of gaming career.
A decade of bloody battles.
After enduring countless pains and tribulations, he finally led the Shadow Guild to establish the top ten city-states in "God's Domain". Just when they could start competing with the top guilds and enjoy endless glory, a single document turned everything into a fleeting cloud, never to return.
Shi Feng never imagined that his ten years of hard work would be in vain. He had given up so much for the game, but in the end, it all became someone else's gain. All because he opposed the merger of Ghost Shadow into the super guild Dominating the World. The next day, the Blue Hua Group gave him their response, deleting his level 200 Sword King account that he had spent ten years cultivating, and told him to settle his salary at the finance department.
All he could get was five million credit points and a mansion, which was nothing compared to the ten city-states he established and the virtual kingdom that made a fortune every day.
Shi Feng thought about how much he had contributed to Youying, turning the Lan Hua Group into a large conglomerate, much of the credit was his. Yet, he was discarded like trash. He was determined to take revenge for what the Lan Hua conglomerate had done to him.
"I will never just let it go, I'll start all over again if I have to."
Shi Feng's eyes sparkled with confidence and determination, the contract termination document in his hand was torn to shreds, and he immediately picked up a bottle of red wine from the table and took a few big gulps.
Even without the Sword King account, without the support of the team, the skills and knowledge in the game will not betray him. As long as the skills are still there, he can rise again in the divine realm and establish his own virtual kingdom once more.
In the early morning, the sun had just risen.
Drip, drip, drip!
The phone's ringtone kept ringing.
Shi Feng, dissatisfied with being woken up, reluctantly got up and picked up the phone by his bed, still feeling dizzy from last night's hangover.
"Hey, what's up?"
"Brother Feng, I'm Heizi, what are you asking about? We agreed to become professional gamers, today is the day the Shadow Studio in our school is recruiting, haven't you always wanted to become a core member of Shadow?"
Shifeng was somewhat confused.
Just been fired by the Lan Hua conglomerate, how could he go for the Shadow assessment. "Brother Feng, Brother Feng?"
"Are you listening? They're going to test at ten o'clock, if you don't hurry up and come over, you'll be too late!"
"Kuroko, stop joking around, I've just been fired by Phantom."
"Brother Feng, how much did you drink yesterday? You're still not awake, Shadow hasn't recruited anyone yet, how did you get fired? Come on, hurry up."
Before Shi Feng could react, Heizi had already hung up the phone.
Feeling groggy, Shi Feng looked at the mobile phone and realized that this old iPhone 6 was not his phone at all; his phone was the latest iPhone 12.
He quickly looked around. The small bedroom, less than fifteen square meters, was in a mess, filled with books about game strategies. There was also an outdated laptop on the desk in the corner, and many clothes were scattered in the large wardrobe. A familiar face appeared in the dressing mirror of the wardrobe.
Upon seeing this incredibly familiar face, Shi Feng was suddenly taken aback.
Shi Feng immediately stood up and walked to the fitting mirror, looking and looking again, before confirming that he had indeed become younger.
Yesterday I was sleeping in a spacious and luxurious bedroom, but now I've woken up in this shabby place, and I've even become younger.
Shi Feng still had some memories of this place. It was ten years ago, when he was in his senior year and determined to conquer the divine realm, he rented a small house and lived there for more than half a year. After earning some money in the divine realm, he rented a larger apartment in the city.
Back then, it was extremely difficult, the family's situation was not good, and in order to send him to university, they had to incur a lot of debt. Despite this, his parents still worked hard every month to send enough living expenses, allowing him to endure hardship.
Shi Feng was determined to earn money to change his family's circumstances, but with college graduates everywhere, finding a well-paying job was harder than reaching the sky. So, he turned to the most profitable virtual game. To improve his gaming skills, he resolutely bought a virtual helmet, aiming to become a professional player and honing his skills in the virtual game.
At that time, he ate plain white bread and instant noodles every day to save money. He never participated in any class gatherings or social events, thus becoming invisible in his class. The boys looked down on him, and the girls avoided him. Every time he went to the supermarket to buy instant noodles, he had less than ten credit points in his wallet. He didn't even dare to buy a one-credit-point sausage. The female cashier, seeing his plight, recommended a special offer on sausages. Looking at the tempting sausage and feeling his wallet, he still gritted his teeth and refused.
"Is someone playing a joke on me?"
Looking at the familiar scene and his younger self in the mirror, Shi Feng couldn't help but shake his head, dismissing the idea.
Even the most developed United States does not have such rejuvenation technology, who would joke with a down-and-out uncle.
Shi Feng glanced at the time on his phone again.
April 19, 2129.
"Have I been reborn?" Shi Feng revealed a bitter smile on his face and joked.
He remembered that today was August 5, 2139, it couldn't possibly be April 2129 when he was still in his senior year of college.
Shi Feng shook his head, trying to clear his mind, but still held a glimmer of hope, hoping that he could be reborn and truly return to ten years ago. So, he walked to his computer desk and opened his laptop.
If the time on a mobile phone can be faked, then surely the news on the internet can't be faked, right?
After a few minutes online.
Shi Feng was completely shocked. All the information he searched for online confirmed that today was indeed April 19, 2129. Even the official opening time of the globally popular game "God's Domain" was clearly stated on the official website, with a countdown to April 25, six days later.
"Have I really returned to ten years ago?" Shi Feng stared intently at the news report of the divine realm, tears of excitement welling up in his eyes.
At this moment, Stone Peak's emotions were indescribable, filled with regret, sorrow, and joy.
It's as if everything in front of me is a dream.
However, the cicada chirping outside the window and the cold air from the air conditioner reminded Shi Feng that all of this was real.
Looking at the family photo from his university days on his phone, Shi Feng had never noticed that his father had white hair and his mother had wrinkles at the corners of her eyes. They had really aged and were no longer as vibrant as before.
When he noticed his parents had aged, a year and a half after the opening of the divine realm, the high debt, excessive labor, and stress had made both his parents seriously ill. To recover, it would cost millions of credit points. However, at that time, Shi Feng was just a small team leader in Shadow, and the money he earned was not enough to pay for such expensive fees.
In order to raise money, Shi Feng tried everything he could, but it was still not enough. Despite Shi Feng's best efforts to keep them, his parents still passed away a few months later.
Who knows the pain and regret of his previous life where he did not take good care of his parents?
Even after Shi Feng earned millions of credit points, this remained a perpetual pain in his heart.
Unexpectedly, fate played such a joke on him, actually starting from scratch, everything returned to the origin.
"Great, this is fantastic, hahaha. Since I've been reborn, I'm going to change everything, earn enough money, cure my parents' illness, and not let them worry about life." Shi Feng wiped the tears from the corner of his eyes and made a silent vow.
Just as Shi Feng was planning his future, Heizi called again, urging Shi Feng to take the assessment at the university.
However, Shi Feng was unhurried, dressing himself and tidying up before heading to Jin Hai University.
He couldn't be more familiar with the phantom.
I remember when I was in college, Lan Hailong, the eldest son of the Lanhua Group, opened the Youying Studio and provided a large amount of funding to organize the top students from Jinhai University to compete in the God's Domain. At that time, I also took the assessment and became a core member, while Heizi became a peripheral member. I was happy for a long time.
Three years later, under his leadership, Shadow Studio made a fortune for the Blue China Group in the divine realm, catapulting it into a large financial group, only to be personally dismissed by Blue Sea Dragon in the end.
Since he was reborn, he had an advantage in the divine realm that others couldn't match. Naturally, he didn't plan to join the shadows again, to be someone else's tool, to make money for others. He wanted to take a different path, to fight for his own life, not to rely on his parents for living expenses, to pay off all his debts. Therefore, he wanted to start a business, open his own studio, create his own company, build his own virtual empire, and live a good life.
When Shi Feng arrived at the front of the first teaching building, he saw a tall, thin, dark-skinned young man pacing anxiously at the entrance. This man was Heizi.
"Brother Feng, you're finally here. Luckily, the registration hasn't closed yet. Let's hurry up and register," Kuroko said anxiously after seeing Shi Feng.
Shi Feng shook his head and said very seriously, "Heizi, I'm not planning to go to Shadow anymore, I want to start my own studio, will you come?"
He met Heizi in a virtual game where he was very skilled, and they went on adventures together, like brothers. During their time working together in Youying, although Heizi didn't have gaming talent, his management skills were formidable, managing hundreds of thousands of guild members efficiently. With Heizi's help, their goals could be further achieved. However, he would respect Heizi's choices, as he had nothing now and Heizi's family situation was not good either. Heizi decided to become a professional player and join Youying to earn a living.
It took a full minute before Kuroko lifted his head to look at Shi Feng.
"Brother Feng, stop talking nonsense. Do you know how much a virtual helmet costs? It's eight thousand credit points. To open a studio, you need at least six people, a workspace, salaries, etc. Just the start-up capital would be seventy to eighty thousand, not to mention the subsequent investment. That's a lot of money. Do you have that much money now?" Hei Zi knew Shi Feng's situation well and wanted to persuade him to give up this crazy idea.
"You're right, I don't even have the money to buy a divine domain virtual helmet now." Shi Feng silently nodded in agreement. As Heizi said, even seventy or eighty thousand was an understatement. He remembered that the hundred-person studio recruited by Lan Feilong had cost more than five million, and a lot more was spent later to improve the quality and strength of the studio.
"Given this, why should we take the risk? Isn't it more stable to go with Shadow? At least Shadow can provide a virtual helmet, otherwise we can't even play, let alone become professional players." Heizi, seeing that Shi Feng understood the key issue, immediately breathed a sigh of relief and pulled Shi Feng towards the teaching building.
Shi Feng shook off Heizi's hand, looked at him seriously, and said with utmost seriousness, "But I still plan to open my own studio, I don't want to be controlled by others, Heizi, will you come?"
Shi Feng would not force Heizi, after all, he had no guarantees and could not reveal his secret of being reborn, he could only hope that Heizi would believe him.
Seeing Shi Feng's serious expression, Hei Zi felt that Shi Feng was acting strangely today. It was too crazy. Everyone knew that it was impossible to make money in the early stages of a virtual game. Did Shi Feng have a way to make money in the divine domain? Even if they could make money, it would be several months later, and they didn't have that much time to waste.
After hesitating for a while, Heizi gritted his teeth and finally agreed, "I understand, since you're the older brother, I'll start a studio with you. But what about the virtual helmets? We can't play games without them."
Shi Feng's furrowed brows suddenly relaxed, and he happily patted Heizi on the shoulder, laughing, "That's my good brother. Don't worry about the virtual helmet. I remember that there is a student trial discount in the Divine Domain. Every university has a distribution point. As long as you have a student ID, you can get a free trial of the virtual helmet for ten days. Let's go and check it out."
Heizi's dark face turned pale at this moment, feeling that the future was bleak. Why did he believe in Shifeng? Was it because of Shifeng's confidence and stability? Was it really okay to start a business with Shifeng?
What can be done in the divine realm in ten days?
After ten days, I will definitely miss the good opportunities for major studios to recruit. In the end, I still have to buy a virtual headset, but where will the money come from?
Even with a team of professional players, it would be impossible to earn sixteen thousand credit points in the ten days when the divine realm is open!
"Leave the money matters to me."
Shi Feng patted Heizi on the shoulder, revealing a confident smile.
Earning sixteen thousand credit points in ten days is a pipe dream, but he has the audacity of a reborn person, ready to break through any difficulties. The opening of the divine realm marks the beginning of his rise.
Afterwards, Shi Feng took Heizi to collect the trial helmets, then spent all his money on instant noodles, placing two large boxes next to the computer desk in his rented room, enough for more than ten days of meals. After explaining some things about the Divine Domain, he quietly waited for the opening of the Divine Domain.
At nine o'clock on the evening of April 25th, a few faint lights flickered in the dark and quiet cabin.
Shi Feng lay quietly on the bed, his eyes closed, and gently pressed the start button on his helmet.
"Divine realm, here I come."
Unable to distinguish what this sound was, it seemed to penetrate the body and rush into the soul, causing one to involuntarily shiver in this cold snowy night.
The bleak north wind wailed through the earth and sky, with gusts of white snow dancing in the wind, shattering the sky into fragments, layer upon layer covering the earth. From a distance, it looked like a silver-clad desolation covering the barren land.
It was not midnight, but dusk, yet the dimness of the sky was as dark as night, giving a heavy feeling, as if pressing on the heart, making it hard to breathe. On the silver land, one could see a huge silhouette, a majestic city, like a formidable beast looming.
In the center of the city, there was a towering, seven-sided, pitch-black altar that pierced the clouds and stood unyieldingly in the midst of a blizzard. The wailing wind that blew over the altar carried with it a crackling sound that spread far and wide, carrying a primitive roughness and a unique charm.
The hoarse murmuring voice drifted from the altar in the snowstorm, seeming to merge with the wind, becoming somewhat indistinguishable.
"If there is hope, where is it? If there is no hope, why let me see it!" The voice was almost hysterical, like madness, roaring and echoing in the heavens.
Beneath the altar, at this moment, there are countless figures dressed in straw raincoats, standing silently. From a distance, there are as many as hundreds of thousands of them, both men and women, surrounding the altar. They are densely packed and motionless, yet a fanaticism emerges. It seems that with a single word from the person on the altar, they would be willing to give everything.
The snow, it's getting heavier.
"If you let me see, there must be hope, but where is the hope!" The hoarse voice on the altar, filled with bitterness and sorrow, lingered for a long time.
"Today the bright yellow is wrongly attributed, the three Taikai are pioneering, the snow wind is coming, a creation of all ages, the old man wants to calculate the barbaric sky again!" The voice suddenly grew louder, and it was unclear what method was used, but the sky changed color, and countless falling snowflakes suddenly stopped, then all rolled back, howling from all directions and converging together, causing the world to tremble!
The sky was no longer filled with falling snow, all the snowflakes had gathered to form a huge snow-colored dragon. As soon as this dragon formed, it immediately roared towards the sky. The sound was so piercing that it shocked everyone who heard it, as if they were being torn apart by the sound.
Shocking bursts of blood oozed from the Snow Dragon's body, quickly spreading all over it, turning it into a Blood Dragon. With a mournful roar, it struggled and charged towards the sky like a savage meteor, piercing the horizon as if trying to blast a hole in the heavens and create a glimmer of hope.
Its speed was so fast that in the blink of an eye it was endless. Amidst the roaring whirl, it seemed like the dragon crashed into some invisible barrier. The heavens and earth shook, the humming sound spread in all directions, and the blood dragon let out another mournful scream, its body visibly collapsing layer by layer.
Just as it was about to shatter completely, the hundreds of thousands of silent people beneath the altar clasped their hands in a gesture, bit their tongues, and sprayed out a mouthful of fresh blood. The blood seemed to be drawn by some force, speeding up and rising like a sea of blood, heading straight for the collapsing blood dragon. After merging with it, the dragon's collapse slowed down and rushed towards the higher sky.
As the blood dragon flew higher and higher, attracting everyone's attention, it suddenly shook violently, emitting a sharp hiss that could be heard for tens of thousands of miles. Unable to prevent its body from collapsing, it transformed into countless blood-red snowflakes, falling down and staining the sky and earth a crimson hue.
At this moment, when the blood dragon collapsed, a sound completely different from the wailing came from its mouth! "Shang..."
At the top of the altar, in the very center, sat an old man in a purple robe, his face full of wrinkles and covered with brown spots. He was mumbling with his eyes open, but they were dull and lightless, clearly he was blind.
In front of him lay a complete spine, emitting a white glow, and in his right hand, he held a stone piece, resting on the thirteenth vertebra.
His hollow eyes silently gazed at the sky for a long time, before he let out a long sigh.
In his speech, his right hand holding the stone piece moved again on the strange spine, rubbing against the beast bone, making a crackling sound that spread into the distance. His figure appeared desolate, merging with this sound, revealing a sense of sad loneliness and decline.
In the dead of night, amidst the vast darkness, the mountains were far from peaceful. Ferocious beasts roamed, their roars shaking the mountains and rivers, causing the trees to tremble and leaves to rustle down.
Another beastly roar echoed, Lin Feng shrank his neck, brushed off the leaves on his body, looked at the mountains in the darkness, and sighed inwardly, this place was completely different from Earth.
Lin Feng sat under a tree in a daze, while a few robust young men across from him looked at him with disdain. A chubby boy even shouted at Lin Feng, "We didn't let you, a foreigner, stay in the village just to eat for free, get to work!"
Lin Feng came back to his senses, didn't say anything, patted his butt and walked away.
Behind him, the chubby boy snorted, "Useless trash, his physical strength is even worse than a child's, he should be thrown into the mountains to be eaten by fierce beasts!"
Lin Feng sneered, "How can I, a person who has traveled from Earth, compare physical strength with you bunch of beasts?"
This Tianyuan Great World is a world dominated by cultivators.
The village before them, known as the Wolf Village, was just a small settlement in the vast mountains. There were no cultivators, but every villager trained hard in martial arts and endurance, including women and children.
Only in this way can one survive in a world where fierce beasts roam and even ancient species appear.
Just like now, despite it being late at night, the young and strong in the village still go into the mountains to hunt. Many prey are accustomed to being active at night. Although going into the mountains at night is fraught with danger, the rewards can be greater.
The villagers had all become accustomed to this way of life, and the children who stayed in the village did not sleep, but gathered together to play and wait for their parents to return from hunting.
Children still wiping their runny noses casually play with stone weights weighing tens to hundreds of pounds as if they were toys, while a group of teenagers compete to see who can lift the giant cauldron at the entrance of the village, which weighs a thousand pounds.
Looking at these small animals, Lin Feng sighed quietly, feeling very weak compared to them.
But this did not discourage Lin Feng. Despite being occasionally talked about behind his back, he managed to temporarily settle in this small mountain village called Wolf Village by bluffing. What really annoyed him was that something extra had appeared in his mind.
Super Ancestor System.
At first, Lin Feng was quite pleased, thinking that crossing over came with benefits, but the first rule of the system made his heart sink.
"Main system task: The host is to establish a school, create the world's largest sect, and become the first patriarch."
"The main tasks are divided into different stages, each of which needs to be completed within a specified time. If not completed in time, the host will be directly eliminated!"
Lin Feng looked at the system instructions, especially the last sentence "Erase the host," and was speechless for a long time. Finally, he squeezed out a few words through his teeth: "I bought a watch last year!"
After his anger subsided, Lin Feng reluctantly read the task content. He was not prepared to risk challenging the system to see if it could really erase him. He had just arrived in this world and hadn't even settled in yet; he didn't want to die again.
Main quest 1.0 - Recruit four direct disciples.
Mission description: Even a solitary cultivator, if they wish to pass on their mantle, must take on disciples. The most important resource for a sect is always people, especially talented disciples and successors. Great teachers produce great students, but great teachers are hard to find, and great students are even harder to find.
Task deadline: One year, if not completed within the time limit, the host will be directly erased.
"Damn it!" Lin Feng sighed. As a newcomer who just crossed over, I'm as naive as a tender little cabbage. Shouldn't I hurry up and find a big shot to be my master, and cling to their coattails?
Hello system, at least give me a secret book so I can take on apprentices. What am I supposed to teach others when I'm so poor and ignorant? To bluff and brag?
What's even more frustrating is that the system indicated there was a newbie gift pack, but then informed him that there was a glitch in the gift pack system and the newbie gift pack would be delayed, which made Lin Feng exclaim that there's no end to how much one can be let down.
The opened exchange system is full of all kinds of good things, elixirs, magic treasures, and skills. There is nothing you can't find, only what you can't think of.
The problem was, everything required points to exchange, and Lin Feng currently didn't even have a single point to exchange, he could only roll his eyes at the system.
Lin Feng was cursing in his heart when suddenly there was a commotion at the entrance of the village, it seemed like the hunting team had returned.
The boys in the village all cheered and went to greet them at the entrance of the village. Lin Feng glanced indifferently, but was shocked to find that all the young and strong men who had returned from hunting had come back empty-handed. Not only were there no prey, but even their weapons were gone.
For these villagers, weapons are their second life. Living in these mountains, they cannot survive without weapons.
A subtle smile appeared at the corner of Lin Feng's mouth: "Seems like there's a story." With that thought, he also walked towards the crowd at the village entrance.
Before they even got close, they heard someone angrily shouting: "Wolf Wind is the hope of our Wolf Village, now he has been seriously injured by someone from Stone Village, we absolutely cannot let this go!"
Lin Feng looked up and saw a young man sitting on the ground in the middle of the crowd, his expression wilted, his body covered in wounds, and a cold light of hatred in his eyes.
"So this is the genius that the people of Wolf Village always talk about?" Lin Feng sneaked a glance, he had long heard of this Wolf Wind, the idol of the young people in the whole Wolf Village, regarded as the hope of the village, today was the first time Lin Feng saw him in person.
Although Wolf Wind was injured and looked dispirited at this time, he was full of vitality. Although his physical strength could not compare with cultivators, he was definitely top-notch among worldly martial artists.
According to the public opinion of the Tianyuan Great World, having such a level at a young age would also have a promising future in cultivation. After all, cultivators are about guiding the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into the body, refining their mana, and strengthening their own foundations.
Without changing his expression, Lin Feng activated his Super Ancestor System, which had a disciple talent detector. He pointed it at Wolf Wind and pressed confirm.
"The qualifications of this object are too low to become a direct disciple of the host."
Lin Feng frowned, this system was too picky. He originally thought about casually accepting four disciples first, to bluff past the system's one-year deadline, and in the end, he could just expel these filler disciples if necessary.
But now it seems that exploiting the system's loopholes is not so easy, even a genius teenager like Wolf Wind who is famous in the surrounding area is not qualified. The difficulty for Lin Feng to gather four disciples to complete the system task is really too great.
"One year, one year..." Lin Feng sighed in frustration.
In the crowd, an old man next to Wolf Wind had a pale face and snorted, "Wolf Wind is my grandson, of course this matter can't be left like this, but not now. There has been a lot of movement in the mountains recently, it seems that a mountain treasure is about to appear, first get the mountain treasure, then settle accounts with Stone Village!"
There were often fights between rural clans, but Lin Feng was not interested in this. However, the words "mountain treasure" caught his attention and stirred something in his heart.
Lin Feng was pondering about Shanbao when he suddenly heard someone in the crowd muttering, "I don't know how Shicun raised such a little monster. He's not even four years old, a little kid, and he can beat our village's genius, Langfeng. It's unbelievable!"
Lin Feng's eyes suddenly lit up.
Did this child, not even four years old, defeat the wolf in front of him?
Wolf Wind was already somewhat talented, but the person who injured him was not even four years old, what kind of talent would that be?
The chubby guy next to Lin Feng muttered under his breath, "Damn little ghost, we must kill him!"
After glancing at him, Lin Feng echoed, "Yes, yes."
In his heart, he thought that this little child might be recognized by the system. Thinking of this, Lin Feng quietly withdrew from the crowd. He wished he could grow wings and fly to Shicun immediately, but he dared not leave the village alone, otherwise, he would be serving himself as an extra meal to the beasts in the mountains.
Just then, the mechanical alert tone suddenly rang in Lin Feng's mind.
"Newbie gift pack released, would you like to check it out immediately?"
After a moment of surprise, Lin Feng was overjoyed. He had never found the dull and monotonous system prompt sound to be so pleasing to the ear.
Finding a secluded place, Lin Feng opened the gift box.
Newbie Gift Pack: The host receives a basic cultivation level of Qi Refining Stage Four, gets one lottery draw, receives 300 exchange points, obtains the Daoist secret manual "Nine Heavens Thunder Law," and acquires the divine power Nine Heavens Thunder Summoning.
Lin Feng was stunned, a warm current fell from the top of his head, directly penetrating his chest and abdomen, quickly breaking through a hidden acupoint in his body.
In the human body, there are twelve important acupoints, which cultivators refer to as the twelve-story tower.
The Qi cultivation period is divided into twelve levels, each aimed at opening up one of the twelve layers. As each acupoint is opened, spiritual energy is transformed into magical power, and the cultivator's magical power will ascend to the next level.
Lin Feng currently felt a warm current flowing continuously within him, accompanying him all the way until it disappeared after opening up four acupoints in his body. With Lin Feng's breathing, the external Qi of heaven and earth was rapidly absorbed into his body, swirling around in the opened four acupoints.
Each acupoint seemed like a constantly rotating galaxy, where spiritual energy was continuously transformed into Lin Feng's own magical power, as if it was the beginning of the universe, evolving all living beings.
Lin Feng felt his entire body becoming lighter, and with a thought, the power in his acupoints surged like a spring, and an explosive force was ready to burst forth.
After a long time, Lin Feng gradually adapted to the changes in his body, and was relieved: "At least I have some self-protection power now." But when he thought about the ultimate goal of the system was to establish the first sect in history, and he was to become the first ancestor in history, Lin Feng suddenly felt tremendous pressure and hurriedly checked the other things in the novice gift pack.
"A chance to draw a lottery?" Lin Feng looked at it. In addition to the exchange system in the auxiliary training system, there was indeed a lottery system, but it was gray and still in an inactive state, so there was no need to think about it for now.
Currently, we can only hope that the purchasing power of those 300 exchange points is higher.
While thinking, Lin Feng entered the exchange system. Previously, when he was penniless, he didn't have the heart to look at the prices.
After carefully checking the price, Lin Feng secretly cursed the system for being greedy. The lowest level Qi nourishing pill required ten exchange points, and a slightly spiritual refined iron sword required thirty points.
Even to get a basic outfit, a set of feathered star crowns, it would take fifty points.
The most basic magical powers, such as "Fireball" and "Palm Thunder," cost a hundred points.
As for those high-end goods with a string of zeros behind their price, Lin Feng didn't dare to look at them for fear of getting dizzy.
Lin Feng looked at the pitiful 300 in his "current exchange points" column and shook his head: "The startup capital is too small."
Fortunately, the beginner's gift pack contained a secret Daoist manual and a divine skill, otherwise Lin Feng would have been completely lost.
The Dao is the foundation of cultivation, mainly for improving the realm, while the divine powers are practical martial arts or spells with many wonderful uses.
Surprisingly, the quality of the Nine Heavens Thunder Law in the gift package was so high that it could not be exchanged with the current system, and could only be exchanged after a system upgrade.
As for system upgrades, they can only be initiated after Lin Feng completes a certain number of system tasks, it's still too early to discuss it now.
The Nine Heavens Thunder Law is one of the top thunder methods in this Tianyuan world, but it has been lost for many years. The predecessors who had succeeded in practicing this method were all powerful figures.
According to the instructions, the novice gift pack randomly opens a method, and if it opens the Nine Heavens Thunder method, Lin Feng would consider himself extremely lucky. Although the 300 exchange points have limited purchasing power, Lin Feng's frustration was swept away at this moment.
If it weren't for that damn main quest, Lin Feng would definitely find a secluded place to practice this top-notch Daoist technique to perfection before coming out and wreaking havoc.
But now that he was going to take on a disciple, that was a different story.
Despite his dissatisfaction, Lin Feng quickly adjusted his attitude and took swift action.
He remained calm, asked for the way to Shicun, and quietly left the Wolf Village without alarming anyone.
The two villages are now in a state of hostility. Lin Feng, who has become a cultivator, is not afraid of the people from the Wolf Village causing trouble, but he is afraid that they will expose his identity in front of the people of the Stone Village.
Fortunately, the villagers of Wolf Village were all gathered at the entrance of the village, discussing the incident of Wolf Wind being injured. Lin Feng managed to slip out from the back of the village unnoticed.
Walking on the street, Lin Feng did not hesitate to invest fifty exchange points to buy himself a new outfit.
How could Lin Feng from Earth not know the principle of "Buddha needs gold, people need clothes"? If you want to sell something, you need to do a good job with promotion and packaging first.
Looking down at his feathered star crown and wide-sleeved white robe, Lin Feng nodded in satisfaction at his image of a celestial sage. The system's items were expensive, but their quality and appearance were truly impeccable.
When Lin Feng arrived at the entrance of Shicun Village, the first thing that caught his eye was a huge half-dead tree, with a trunk diameter of more than ten meters, completely charred.
Lin Feng took a glance and speculated that this was a lightning-struck tree, which had been struck by lightning many years ago. The old tree's huge crown and vigorous vitality were all destroyed, and now only a stump about eight or nine meters high remained on the ground.
But just by looking at the size of the existing trunk, one can imagine how huge the tree was when it was alive.
The withered tree was completely charred, showing no signs of life.
At that moment, an old man came over, coughing and saying, "This tree has been withered for ten years." He walked up to Lin Feng, his eyes sizing him up and down, "I am the village chief of this stone village, is there anything I can help you with, Taoist?"
Lin Feng smiled slightly, naturally exuding an air of aloofness and pride. Coupled with his attire - a white robe with wide sleeves, a feathered dress and a star crown - his appearance was impeccable, absolutely embodying the style of a transcendent master.
"Find the target, suitable to become a host's close disciple."
Just as Lin Feng was about to speak, he was startled by a sudden system notification sound and almost choked on his saliva.
The old village chief Shi looked at Lin Feng strangely, but was startled into a shiver.
Lin Feng's eyes were glowing green, staring at the entrance of the village like a hungry wolf howling for food.
At the entrance of the village, a lovely child with rosy cheeks and snow-white skin was energetically tugging at the tail of a big yellow dog, his childish voice ringing out clearly, "Yi ya yi ya, don't run!"
The system sound in Lin Feng's mind kept ringing: "The talent system has been sorted out, and the information of the first target is as follows."
"Root Bone -> 10; Comprehension -> 8; Willpower -> 8; Fortune -> 8."
In summary: The target has exceptional talent; it is recommended to accept them into the sect and provide careful guidance, as they will undoubtedly become a pillar of the sect.
Lin Feng didn't notice anything else, his eyes were fixed on the blood-red number "10" behind the root bone.
What does the root bone of 10 mean?
For example, when others run a hundred meters from the starting point to the finish line, this little one starts running from the ninety-meter mark, given the same finish line!
No wonder, no wonder he could beat that wolf wind full of peach blossoms before he was four years old.
At this moment, Little Dot also noticed Lin Feng, looking over with a bewildered face, blinking his big eyes, completely embodying the cute young boy.
Lin Feng smacked his lips, this guy not only had an extraordinary physique, but his comprehension, determination, and luck were all at a genius level.
Isn't it a bit stressful to take on such a person as an apprentice?
Lin Feng pondered, gradually revealing a warm and sunny smile on his face.
If someone who knew Lin Feng in his previous life saw him with such a smile, they would definitely keep as far away as possible.
Chapter 1
The morning sunlight, filtering through the light silver curtain, fell directly onto the bed, making it almost impossible for her to open her eyes.
She drank too much in a moment of happiness at the party last night, and was later taken home by Lu Yanchen.
Time sat up, the thin silk quilt slipped off, revealing a touch of red on the white sheets, and on her own body, the creamy white skin was covered with kiss marks.
It was clear at a glance that it was the result of a night of revelry.
"I love you."
When his feelings were intense, his touching words of love seemed to still linger in the ear. Time was like a peach blossom on the surface, with shy eyes, he turned his head and looked around.
What about Lu Yanchen?
Did you go out to buy breakfast?
When Time got out of bed and his legs touched the ground, he felt weak and almost fell to the floor.
When the light came back on, Lu Yanchen also returned, calmly walking into the living room, his tall and upright figure exuding a strong and oppressive aura.
As time looked up, it fell into a pair of deep eyes, with a gaze as calm and unfathomable as a clear pool.
It was the first time such an intimate relationship had occurred, and time seemed inexplicably shy, with lowered eyes not daring to look at him.
In her daze, she vaguely heard him say that he had a surprise for her.
Is he going to propose to her?
Time was somewhat at a loss, with the heart beating wildly.
She had barely spoken when Lu Yanchen interrupted her in a deep voice: "Let's break up!"
What did he just say, break up?
Is the surprise he wants to give her a breakup?
Was he teasing her, joking, or was he serious about breaking up?
A scream of extreme pain, trapped in the throat and unable to come out, took a while for time to find its own voice again.
Very softly, as if whispering into the dust. "Breaking up, after we... had a relationship, Lu Yanchen, what do you mean?"
Lu Yanchen's expression was indifferent, without a hint of change, "Last night, who was it that called me to pick her up, and who was it that clung to me, begging me not to stop? You seemed to enjoy it very much last night."
Time stood still as if struck by lightning!
She was dumbfounded, staring at the man who was completely different from her memory, unable to control her trembling body, and asked three words with difficulty, "Why?"
Having said that, he turned to look out the window, a faint smile on his lips.
That smile, in the eyes of time, seemed like mockery.
Her face was as pale as snow, with intense pain radiating from her heart, pressing on her nerve endings and spreading to her limbs. A dizzying darkness was approaching, and she tightly pinched her palm with her fingertips to prevent herself from fainting.
The air suddenly became cold and damp, chilling to the bone, causing shivering and suffocation, making it unbearable to stay for even a minute.
Time has passed.
Chapter 1
In the Rain Country, at the Ling family's residence in Cangyun Town, the moon was high in the sky.
It took Ling Han a full ten seconds to finally confirm that he had indeed been reincarnated.
For a powerful being in the celestial realm, it is absolutely unimaginable to take ten seconds to affirm something, but it also proves how incredibly unbelievable the things happening to him are.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts and had unprecedented achievements in the path of alchemy. The "Three Fire Guidance" technique he created caused a revolution in the alchemy world and he was revered as the "Pill Emperor".
But he was not satisfied, he wanted to go further, to reach the legendary realm of breaking the void, shattering the void, and becoming a god. To this end, he visited countless ancient relics, finally entered the Black Blood Valley, and after numerous dangers, found a mysterious ancient tower.
He was not disappointed, as golden text appeared on the ancient tower, which was a supreme technique called "The Immortal Heavenly Scripture." When practiced to the highest level, the body would become indestructible and immortal, coexisting with the heavens and earth, and sharing the same lifespan as the sun and moon!
Even with his martial arts cultivation at the level of transcending the cold sky, he still found the "Immortal Heavenly Scripture" obscure and difficult to understand, as if he was reading a heavenly book, completely clueless.
He forcibly memorized this technique, and just as he was about to study the ancient tower, the tower shook slightly, releasing an immeasurable divine light that instantly shattered his physical body. However, strangely, his soul did not dissipate, but fell into a state that was neither awake nor dreaming, and this lasted for tens of thousands of years.
During these ten thousand years, his soul had been constantly pondering the Immortal Heavenly Scripture - apart from this, he could do nothing else. After ten thousand years, he finally understood the first layer of this technique.
What does it mean for a powerful being in the Heavenly Realm to spend ten thousand years just to comprehend the first level of a technique?
It should be noted that the lifespan of a celestial being is generally less than a thousand years. Normally, no one in the world can cultivate this immortal scripture, because they would have died of old age before they even started.
Ke Linghan mastered the first level of the "Immortal Heavenly Scripture" in this peculiar way, then he suddenly came back to life, reincarnated in the body of a sixteen-year-old boy also named Linghan.
"No matter what happened, I'm alive again!"
"Although this body is only at the second level of body refining, and is as useless as it can be, I was once a strong person in the realm of heaven, standing at the peak of martial arts, and also a master of alchemy. If the aptitude is poor, I will use elixirs to make up for it. I don't believe I can't return to the peak."
"Moreover, I can finally cultivate the Immortal Heavenly Scripture, which is a supreme technique, and perhaps... it may not belong to the mortal world, but comes from the legendary divine realm, otherwise how could it take ten thousand years to understand the first level of the technique?"
"In this life, I will surely surpass my predecessors and achieve godhood!"
"Also, what's the deal with this body, only reaching the second level of body refining at sixteen, could it be because the martial arts of today are too withered?"
Boom, countless memories flooded into his mind. These were the memories of another Ling Han, the original owner of this body, and in this process, two completely different people merged together, indistinguishable from each other.
"I understand."
Ling Han nodded in his heart. The reason he was only at the second level of body refining was because his spiritual roots were too poor.
To train to become a martial artist, there is a prerequisite, which is to have a spiritual root. With a spiritual root, one can absorb the spiritual energy between heaven and earth, refine oneself, and transform it into one's own primal force.
Some spiritual roots absorb spiritual energy quickly, while others do so slowly. Therefore, spiritual roots are divided into four major levels: heaven, earth, mystery, and yellow, each of which is further divided into three minor grades: upper, middle, and lower. The best is the upper grade of the heavenly level, and the worst is the lower grade of the yellow level.
The key to judging the quality of spiritual roots lies in their purity, the purer the better. However, Linghan's spiritual roots encompass all five elements and are the most chaotic. In the martial arts world, this is considered the worst kind of spiritual root, barely qualifying as a lower-level yellow grade. Therefore, at the age of sixteen, he has only managed to cultivate to the second level of body refining, while his peers have reached the fourth or fifth level.
In his previous life, Ling Han was a heavenly spirit root, and even a top-grade nine-yang fire spirit root. Coupled with his unparalleled talent in the path of alchemy, he used alchemy to aid his martial arts and reached the realm of heavenly man in just two hundred years, a record that was unprecedented.
"The Five Elements Mixed Spiritual Root, this is the lowest grade of spiritual root, no wonder the predecessor, despite his utmost efforts, only reached the second level of body refining." "For me, although the Five Elements Mixed Spiritual Root is a bit tricky, with the aid of elixir, I will definitely return to the peak within four hundred years!"
"Huh!"
Ling Han was shocked in his heart, showing an unbelievable expression of astonishment on his face. He was stunned for a while, and with his powerful soul force, he looked inward at the spiritual root in his dantian. His shocked expression instantly turned into ecstasy.
"This is not a five-element mixed spiritual root, but a perfectly balanced five-element, forming a Dao Lotus! This is the Five Elements Chaos Lotus, the best of the best, rarer than the Nine Suns Fire Spiritual Root, it can be called a divine spiritual root!" "The slow cultivation in the previous life was because divine spiritual roots require special cultivation methods to truly unleash their power."
"And I... just happen to have mastered a Five Elements Supreme Skill that matches the Five Elements Chaos Lotus!"
"A hundred years! No, just fifty years, and I can reach the realm of the celestial beings again!"
Even with Linghan's previous life's cultivation level, he couldn't help but show joy. The spiritual root is destined from birth and cannot be changed later. In his previous life, in order to break through the void and become a god, he visited countless ancient sites and obtained a large number of secret techniques, among which the Five Elements Extreme Skill was one.
In his previous life, he stood at the pinnacle of martial arts; in this life, he will create brilliance again and forge an immortal legend.
"How did the predecessor die?"
Ling Han picked up his memories, and soon he showed an angry face.
He was the only son of Ling Dongxing, the head of the Ling family. His mother, grandfather and grandmother passed away early. The Ling family was a martial arts family, where every member practiced martial arts and respected martial arts. Why could Ling Dongxing sit in the position of the head of the family? It was because he was the strongest and fought his way to the top.
Because of his spiritual root problem, Ke Linghan was regarded as a waste from a young age and was constantly looked down upon.
In order to secure a bright future for his son, Ling Dongxing reached an agreement with Huyang Academy - Huyang Academy would accept Ling Han as a disciple and train him with all their might, and in exchange, Ling Dongxing would enter the Purple Light Valley to search for something that the academy had lost a long time ago.
Tiger Sun College was established by the Rain Kingdom Dynasty, with countless resources. If fully nurtured, even the most useless person could be elevated to the Gathering Element Realm.
But the people at Kehuyang College couldn't possibly be fools; if that thing was easy to obtain, why would they offer such generous terms?
The Purple Light Valley is fraught with danger, and one wrong step could be fatal. However, for the sake of his son, Ling Dongxing set off without hesitation seven days ago.
Yesterday, representatives from Huyang Academy came and informed the Ling family that they would come to pick up the person as agreed today. However, at this time, Ling Zhongkuan, the chief steward of the Ling family, came over to negotiate with his predecessor, asking him to give up this precious spot for his grandson, Ling Muyun.
The reason was that Ling Muyun was a genius with limitless potential, and such an opportunity should not be wasted on a useless person.
The predecessor naturally wouldn't agree, as this was an opportunity his father had exchanged his life for! But Ling Zhongkuan said it was a discussion, in fact, he was just notifying the predecessor, and he didn't take his opinion to heart at all.
The predecessor could not bear it and took action, but Ling Chongkuan was a strong man in the realm of gathering elements, and he could suppress him with one finger. How could he be an opponent?
Just one punch, and the predecessor was seriously injured and then locked in his own room, obviously not wanting him to cause trouble in front of the people of Huyang Academy. By the time Ling Dongxing returned, it was already too late to change anything.
And the predecessor who was heavily hit was literally angered to death.
Ling Han snorted, feeling greatly wronged. The spot that his father had risked his life for was actually taken away by Grandfather and Grandson Ling Zhongkuan?
These despicable scoundrels!
Unbearable!
He got up from the bed and immediately felt sore all over - he had survived, but his injuries would not miraculously heal.
"The spiritual root has been injured!" Ling Han frowned, Ling Zhongkuan's strike had damaged his spiritual root, and an injured spiritual root was a very troublesome matter, ordinary healing stones were ineffective.
"To my knowledge, there are seven elixirs that can repair the spiritual root, but the materials required for four of them are too expensive - even if the entire Ling family was sold, it wouldn't be enough. Moreover, my spiritual root has only been slightly damaged, so there's no need for such high-grade elixirs."
"Of the remaining three, two need to be refined into pills, which is too strenuous for my current second level of body refining. So there is only one choice left - Yuanxin Fuling Powder, which only requires the medicinal materials to be proportioned and boiled into a medicinal juice."
"First heal the injury, then stop Ling Zhongkuan and his grandson. Although I don't care about this position, I can't let the opportunity that my father exchanged with his life be cheapened by this shameless grandfather and grandson!"
He sat down cross-legged and began to operate the "Indestructible Heavenly Scripture."
This was his first time operating this potentially divine technique, but because he had been pondering it for tens of thousands of years, he now handled it with extreme ease.
With a buzzing sound, a strong vitality suddenly arose within him. Although his energy was greatly consumed, his injuries were rapidly healing.
In just a few minutes, his injuries were completely gone.
"It's no wonder it's the Undying Heavenly Scripture, I've just started practicing and it already has such miraculous effects. However, this is completely different from other cultivation methods. Normal methods use spiritual roots to transform the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into primal energy, but the Undying Heavenly Scripture does the exact opposite, refining the body with primal energy and being able to heal injuries."
"After reaching the highest level of practice, it is not impossible to become immortal," "That's why it can be called the Heavenly Scripture!" "Unfortunately, my current level is not enough, otherwise I could repair all the spiritual roots with the Immortal Heavenly Scripture."
Ling Han opened his eyes, looked at the gradually whitening sky outside the window, and murmured, "Now, it's time to meet that shameless old man Ling Zhongkuan and give him a surprise."
He put on his shoes, walked to the door, and opened it.
A tall figure immediately appeared at the door, blocking his way. This man was Zhang Yuan, one of Ling Zhongkuan's henchmen.
"Master Han, the chief steward has ordered that you must stay in your room today!" Zhang Yuan chuckled, the person in front of him was the son of the family head, but he was a notorious waste, a joke in his eyes.
Ling Han's eyes turned cold, and he said, "You dare to stop me?"
"It's you I'm stopping," said the chief steward, "We absolutely cannot let Ling Han cause trouble today, even if it means giving him a beating if necessary!" Zhang Yuan said with a forced smile, "This is the chief steward's order, I hope Young Master Han won't make it difficult for me."
Ling Zhongkuan, this old dog, was really cautious. Even after he was seriously injured, he still had someone guard the door. This shows how important it was for Ling Zhongkuan to have his grandson enter Huyang Academy. But when this hope was shattered, one can imagine Ling Zhongkuan's disappointment and anger.
"Get lost!" Ling Han said coldly.
Pop!
With a cold expression, Ling Han raised his hand and slapped him, saying coldly, "Who do you think you are, to not leave when I tell you to?"
What, he was actually slapped by a loser? Zhang Yuan couldn't believe it as he touched his own face. This loser actually dared to hit him, and even managed to land a hit. What kind of joke was this?
Pop!
Ling Han waved his hand again, giving him another solid slap.
"Baa—Baa—Baa—"
The sound of a sheep's bleating echoed through the silent mountains.
Li Qiyue climbed up the hill, the night wind was urgent and cold, but at this moment, he was so anxious that he was sweating all over. At the age of thirteen, he climbed up the mountains with his hands and feet, the night seemed particularly lonely and desolate, making people shudder.
Although the night seemed terrifying, Li Qiyi was burning with impatience inside.
Li Qiyue, he was born into a tenant farmer's family, his parents were both poor, and he started herding sheep for others at the age of seven.
Today, Li Qiyi was herding sheep as usual, but in the evening when he was driving the sheep back, he found that one was missing. This made him very anxious, so he hurried back to the hill to search for it. However, he searched the entire hill but could not find the missing sheep.
Thinking of the ferocity of the wealthy landlord Zhang, Li Qiye was extremely anxious and uneasy after losing a sheep.
Now the entire hill had been searched, and there was no trace of the sheep. At this moment, Li Qiye thought of one place, the only place he hadn't searched - the Immortal Demon Cave!
Looking up at the night view of the valley ahead, it seemed like a ferocious beast from ancient times, ready to devour people at any moment. Faint sounds of wolves howling and ghosts wailing could be heard in the distance. Gazing at the mysterious night of the Immortal Demon Cave, Li Qiye couldn't help but shiver.
Xianmo Cave, a place notorious among locals, is said to be inhabited by a demon that devours anyone who enters, and no one has ever come out alive.
However, at this moment, the sound of Zhang Dahua's cracking whip echoed in Li Qiye's ears, and if he lost a sheep, Zhang Dahua would definitely whip him until his skin was torn and his flesh was bruised!
"Good, good, good, my immortal Yin Crow has finally been refined, only lacking a soul. Today is just the right time to borrow your soul!" After an unknown amount of time, a deep and gloomy voice echoed in the Immortal Demon Cave.
"Pa-pa-pa-" In no time, a rapid flapping sound was heard, and a strange bird, like a crow, flew out of the fairy demon cave.
"Fly, fly, I will borrow your soul to remember the burial place, fly over the lost land, as long as the nine realms still exist, I will definitely find it!" In the Immortal Demon Cave, the deep and gloomy voice echoed.
From then on, a dark crow soared between heaven and earth, entering burial grounds, immortal cities, and crossing dangerous territories... With no control over its own fate, it flew across the nine realms, enduring countless hardships and living for millions of years without dying!
As time passed and the era changed, one invincible character after another rose, and one giant after another fell. Gradually, a mysterious crow began to appear, a mysterious crow that had escaped its shackles, and began to search for a path to control its own destiny.
From the Medicine God, to the Flying Immortal Emperor, then to the Blood Seal Immortal Emperor, then to the Mingren Immortal Emperor, then to the Sun-swallowing Immortal Emperor, then to the Ice Feather Immortal Emperor... and finally to the Black Dragon King.
Generation after generation of invincible giants rise, and generation after generation of gods fall away, but, spanning millions of years, that crow still faintly appears in the river of time.
The cold wind was like a knife, and the snow was falling heavily.
As soon as Lu Sheng opened his eyes, he found himself sitting in a yellowish-gray carriage, which was slightly swaying, and there was the sound of a little girl speaking softly beside him.
Outside the carriage, there was a cacophony of noisy voices. There were cries of vendors, shouts, and cheers.
Lu Sheng sighed deeply.
He knew he couldn't go back; from being an old slicker who idled away his time in a state-owned enterprise, after getting drunk one time, he woke up in this world.
It has been five days so far.
He sniffed his nose, and the air was filled with the aroma of wine, pancakes, and fried pastries.
"Oh my, the white osmanthus wine from Guihua Fang is getting more and more fragrant," said the petite maid in the carriage with a soft, milky voice.
With a natural baby face and a small stature, she looks no different from a ten-year-old child.
Her little face was chubby and rosy, dressed in a green cotton skirt, and her small hands were still rubbing the hairband for Lu Sheng to tie her hair when she got off the car.
This hair tie is made from a very expensive type of bark, which naturally emits a faint fragrance. However, the only downside is that it becomes hard in cold weather and needs to be warmed and softened by rubbing it with warm hands.
Lu Sheng smiled and didn't say anything. The carriage stopped quickly.
He lifted the curtain and stepped out of the car onto the gray street, where large, basin-sized blue stone bricks were laid.
The streets were bustling with cars and people leading horses back and forth. Vendors and strolling girls and women showed no restraint, laughing and revealing their faces without any inhibition.
Lu Sheng looked up at the wine shop in front of him. The white rectangular plaque had three large characters written in a lively and vigorous style: Guihua Fang.
"Please come in! Cabin A is reserved for you!" A young attendant greeted with a smile.
Lu Sheng nodded, looking like a wealthy young master. He took the silver-edged white paper fan from the delicate hand beside him, gently flicked it open, revealing a landscape painting of mountains and rivers on the fan. The mountains and rivers rose and fell, with light and shadow overlapping, and there was an inscription that clearly showed the style of a great master.
He confidently followed the servant into the tavern.
The tavern had two floors, and on the first floor, many people were sitting in the hall listening to someone singing.
A young girl in green stood crisply in the open space, her voice melodious, and a middle-aged woman played the pipa beside her.
The song is about a tragic love story between a general going to war and a fox woman from the mountains, as told in the tale of the Three Meetings.
Unfortunately, most of the guests at the scene were rough people, and only a few literate young men could understand. The rest of the people ignored the two girls.
Lu Sheng stopped in his tracks, seeing the lively atmosphere on the first floor, he simply found an empty seat and sat down.
"Who ordered the Sanhui Chuan?" he casually asked the servant.
His status in this Osmanthus Fragrans Pavilion was quite different; if the pavilion could be compared to a high-end entertainment club on Earth, then he would be the supreme VIP customer here.
Such expenses, in a small northern town like Jiuliancheng, were already considered top-tier customers.
"It's the son of Duke Zhou. Zhou Que, the son of Duke Zhou."
Lu Sheng didn't want to make things difficult for him, so he waved his hand and let him go.
After pulling Xiaoxiao to sit down, he scanned the crowd on the first floor and quickly spotted a pale, thin young man dressed in white, holding a flashy golden lotus leaf-edged folding fan, gently waving it.
"I guess he's taken a fancy to that little girl who sings," Lu Sheng shook his head.
"The young master just warned him last time, this guy is really a bad person!" said Xiao Qiao, pouting in dissatisfaction.
Lu Sheng smiled and stopped talking, starting to quietly listen to the music.
A table full of dishes and wine was quickly served on the dark red wooden table, and Lu Sheng picked up a piece of stir-fried shredded meat with lettuce and put it in his mouth.
Take a sip of Baijiu, which is similar to a beverage. The light sweetness and floral aroma blend together, making it almost like drinking juice.
In this northern snow city, ice shrimp is a local specialty. In the thick ice caves, you can easily catch a large number of semi-transparent small shrimp with a single scoop.
Ice shrimp are half the size of regular shrimp, but their taste is incredibly delicious.
Of course, the price is also extremely expensive.
It's already considered a luxury for ordinary people to eat it once a month, let alone having it in every meal like him.
While Lu Sheng enjoyed delicious food, fine wine, and music, his mind was preoccupied with other matters.
He had been in this ancient China-like world for so many days now. But from his observations, this world had many strange aspects.
At first, he thought he had traveled back to ancient times, but later he realized that was not the case.
The customs, festivals, and climate here were vastly different from any dynasty or region he had ever known.
As he was lost in thought, the door to the tavern opened once again.
A group of strong men dressed in short, tight-fitting clothes entered one after another, and found a table near the corner to sit down.
It was evident that these strong men were not locals; their attire and demeanor resembled those from the Central Plains region, lacking the roughness of the people in the northern area.
The leading strong man was bald, wearing copper earrings, with a face full of horizontal muscles, but at this moment he was sighing and lamenting.
"What's there to worry about, big brother? If we can't get through Li's village, we can take the second route and go around from Zhang's village," said another man, frowning.
"What do you know? When I came over to join up, I walked from Zhang Village. The situation there is similar to Li Family Village, with many people dead."
"What on earth happened, big brother? Tell us so we can learn something too," a man urged.
The bald strong man sighed again. "I'm not sure about the specifics, but I do know that several fishing villages by Suiyang Lake have had incidents, as if there's a water ghost causing trouble."
"Really? No way!"
Lu Sheng's table was not far from them, and he could hear their unrestrained conversation.
Originally, he was just listening for fun, but he didn't expect these people to actually start talking about mysterious and mystical things.
In this life, his Lu family was one of the wealthiest households in the northern ice city, and saying they had a fortune of tens of thousands was an understatement.
To put it in perspective on Earth, that would be at least a billionaire in terms of assets.
In the past few days, he had heard many rumors about monsters and ghosts in the tavern, but most of them were just stories and legends.
This was the first time for these people to have such a personal experience, so Lu Sheng listened carefully with his ears pricked up.
Fortunately, those few people didn't hide it. They continued to talk loudly about the strange things in the fishing village.
"I saw the water ghost with my own eyes; it was over ten feet tall, with a green face and fierce teeth, covered in water plants. Goodness, if it weren't for my fast running, you wouldn't be seeing me now," the bald man said, still feeling lingering fear.
"Big brother, do you really believe in water ghosts?" A man asked incredulously.
"Are you sure you didn't make up that story, big brother?"
Lu Sheng also found this amusing, guessing that it was probably just some brash man bragging. He had seen many such people during this period.
After eating and drinking, he asked the servant to bring the song list of the singing girl and casually browsed through it.
Although the Sanhui Chuan is not bad, it doesn't fit the occasion, so he plans to change to a more cheerful one.
Pop!
But at that moment, the bald man's face turned red, and he slammed the table.
"That piece of bone the water ghost dropped on the ground! I picked it up secretly afterward!"
He carefully took out a green stone, like a piece of jade, from his arms and placed it on the table.
"Isn't this just a piece of mixed jade?" a man laughed.
"Miscellaneous jade? Is this miscellaneous jade?
"Brother, can you show me this thing?"
Suddenly, a gentle voice came from the side.
Lu Sheng stood beside the table with a smile, his gaze sweeping over the green jade stones on the table.
"Do you dare to take this? This is something left behind by a water ghost," said the bald man in astonishment.
He just took it out to show off now, planning to throw it away later.
After all, this is not something left behind by humans. If it really attracts water ghosts to cause trouble, it would be a real loss.
"I'll just take a look." Lu Sheng didn't believe in any water ghosts, but the jade looked good and didn't seem like ordinary miscellaneous jade.
It should be noted that ordinary miscellaneous jade can be found in shops and small stalls everywhere, made from the leftover edges of jade stones and polished casually, with extremely low prices.
But somehow, when he saw this piece of jade, he felt that something was off.
Wearing a green robe with white fox fur, a green jade hat, and embroidered black boots with silver-threaded cloud patterns.
The cost of a single outfit could cover several months of expenses at Guihua Fang, and even more than a year's living expenses for an ordinary family.
"Well, young master, it's not impossible... just one or two silver coins will do!"
Lu Sheng took out a small amount of broken silver and placed it on the table.
Bald decisively picked up the jade and stuffed it into Lusheng's hand. The group exchanged glances, got up, and left.
Lu Sheng didn't speak, watching the others leave with his eyes, holding the jade stone in his hand and examining it carefully.
"It means I can be so extravagant in this life." He shook his head, one or two silver coins meant nothing to him. According to the memories of this body, his monthly expenses were at least a hundred silver coins, and occasionally, he might spend up to a thousand.
Thinking of this, he secretly cursed himself for being a spendthrift in his heart.
Holding the jade stone, he ignored the gazes of the surrounding onlookers and left the tavern with nimble steps, heading towards the waiting carriage outside.
But just after leaving the wine shop, not even halfway down the road, he suddenly paused and picked up the jade stone, placing it in his palm.
The jade stone in his palm, right in the center of his right hand, actually began to melt.
The originally hard stone turned into a dark green sticky liquid in just a few seconds, and a faint scream could be heard from within the liquid.
The entire mucus suddenly exploded, turning into a puff of green smoke that slowly drifted away in front of Lu Sheng.
He stood there in astonishment, and upon a closer look, the jade stone was still in his hand, but the green color inside had quietly disappeared at some unknown time.
He stood there, lost in thought, constantly recalling the previous scenes.
Xiaoqiao kept calling him from the side.
When Lu Sheng came to his senses and looked at the jade in his hand, it turned out to be just an ordinary pebble, not even a jade stone.
"Let's go, back to the mansion!"
The two people got on the carriage, the coachman picked up the whip and swung it in the air a few times, and the two long-haired black horses slowly started to move.
Inside the carriage, Lu Sheng remained silent, constantly looking at the pebble in his hand. At this moment, Xiao Qiao also noticed the strangeness of the stone.
"Fooled again!" she muttered to herself, not saying much more. The young master's deception this time was relatively mild; the biggest scam he had fallen for in the past was a so-called antique wine pot that cost him thousands of taels of silver, nearly infuriating his father to death. This time, it was only a tael of silver, which was sometimes not even enough for the young master to have a meal.
The carriage made its way back to the mansion. As it passed the city gate, Lu Sheng heard someone shouting outside.
"...I heard that the water demon was eliminated before! A wandering Taoist took action and saved the fishing village from danger!"
"Has someone come from the court?"
"It came early, and I heard that even the Ouyang Buhuo from the city's prefectural government almost fell into it. Fortunately, they encountered a wandering Taoist priest. It is said that as soon as the priest made a move, there was a flash of golden light, and the water ghost screamed in pain, turning into green slime, and then exploded into thick smoke and dispersed."
Of course not!
Lu Sheng could tell that this was the city gate guard officer chatting idly.
He often deliberately passed by this city gate, where the officers and soldiers on guard were well-informed and liked to brag about strange things happening everywhere.
"That's quite a coincidence..." Lu Sheng's face remained expressionless.
He recalled the previous jade stone, and his heart sank.
In the autumn of 9999 in the Divine Land, the city of Qingzhou was located in the East Sea.
Qingzhou Academy, the sacred place of Qingzhou City, has produced more than half of the powerful individuals from the noble families and sects in Qingzhou City. Therefore, the people of Qingzhou City take pride in being able to study in the academy, and if given the opportunity to enter the academy, they will study diligently.
However, it seems not everyone was aware of this. At this moment, in a schoolroom in Qingzhou Academy, a young man was lying on the table, fast asleep.
In the lecture hall, a girl dressed in a long green dress also noticed this scene, and a touch of anger appeared on her pretty face as she walked towards the sleeping young man.
Qin Yi, seventeen years old, is a formal disciple of Qingzhou Academy, an outer door disciple lecturer, with a beautiful face and a hot figure. In the school, pairs of eyes follow Qin Yi's attractive figure as she moves, and even when she is angry, her steps remain graceful.
"This guy, he's actually sleeping again in Sister Qin's lecture." It seemed that they only just noticed the sleeping figure, and many of the surrounding youths were somewhat speechless. Apparently, this was not the first time.
"With Sister Qin's appearance and figure, even just looking at her is pleasing to the eye; I wonder what's going on in that guy's head."
Among the many lecturers, Qin Yi is definitely the most popular one, without a doubt. As for the reason, it becomes clear as soon as you see her. Countless people regard her as a goddess, and her lectures always fill the classroom to capacity.
Qin Yi's footsteps were light, making no sound as she approached the young man. She stood by the table, looking at the sleeping face before her, her beautiful features covered in frost.
"Ye Futian." A gentle voice came out, but it was not from Qin Yi's mouth, but from behind Ye Futian.
It seemed as if he heard someone calling him in his sleep, Ye Futian's body moved slightly, his hands supporting his head, and he slowly opened his eyes. In his hazy gaze, he saw the undulating peaks before him.
"Wow, it's huge," Ye Futian couldn't help but whisper softly. His voice was light, as if talking to himself, but in the quiet environment, it still seemed particularly abrupt. In an instant, many gazes froze in the air, and then turned into anger.
"He actually dared... to openly disrespect Senior Sister Qin?"
Angry gazes turned into sharp swords, making Ye Futian shiver with cold, as if sensing something wrong. His eyes moved up from the tempting spot and soon saw a delicate, jade-like face filled with rage.
"Uh..." Ye Futian had a black line on his face, why was it Qin Yi?
Glancing back, he saw a fifteen-year-old innocent girl staring at him angrily.
Ye Futian glanced at the girl, then cursed under his breath, feeling wronged and realizing that the size was not right.
"Sister Qin, I..." Ye Futian was just about to explain.
"Ye Futian." Qin Yi interrupted him coldly, saying, "Under what background was the Qingzhou Academy founded?"
It was clear that Qin Yi wanted to avoid the embarrassment just now and change the subject, but Ye Futian could clearly feel her anger at this moment. He even faintly sensed strands of sword intent flowing from her, sharp and piercing, stabbing every inch of his skin.
"Three hundred years ago, Emperor Dongfeng unified the Eastern Divine State and ordered the lords of the world to establish martial arts academies to promote martial arts. Qingzhou Academy was founded under this background," Ye Futian replied. Of course, what he said was recorded in the official history. In the unofficial history he saw in his family, there was another name, but that taboo name was not allowed to be mentioned.
"What are the professions of cultivation?" Qin Yi asked again.
"Practice can be divided into martial arts and techniques. There are many professions for those who practice martial arts, such as warriors, knights, and swordsmen. Those who practice techniques have many professions as well, such as mages, alchemists, and artifact refiners. Mages are also divided into multiple systems, and of course, there are also those with unique talents who practice both martial arts and techniques," Ye Futian replied.
"You seem to have missed one profession," Qin Yi said solemnly, asking very seriously.
A sacred glow appeared on the boy's face: "The universally recognized strongest profession in the Divine Land, favored by the heavens, is the Destiny Mage. They possess the talents bestowed by the heavens, and those with rare talents, such as summoners, beast tamers, and astrologers, mostly come from Destiny Mages. Destiny Mages, regardless of their martial arts cultivation, have stronger natural talents than others."
Everyone around was fascinated by the Destiny Master, a legendary profession that carried the destiny and received the favor of the heavens. "Not only that, even Destiny Masters are naturally suited for both martial arts and magic cultivation."
Qin Yimu looked hopeful, then turned to the young man in front of him and said angrily, "I didn't expect you to know quite a bit about this."
"Of course," Ye Futian looked at Qin Yi and said seriously, "I am a Destiny Master."
"Pfft..." A young man not far away, who was drinking water, suddenly choked and coughed violently. The surrounding pairs of eyes looked at Ye Futian, as if they were looking at an idiot.
How can there be such shameless people in the world? Truly a legendary figure of Qingzhou Academy, not only openly flirting with Senior Sister Qin, but now also falsely claiming to be a Destiny Master, just to attract Senior Sister Qin's attention?
However, who was he? After studying in the palace for three years, he had been stuck in the first stage of awakening, unable to progress. His body was weak, and he had clearly not completed his physical training. Such a mediocre, even useless character claimed to be a destined mage? How shameless could he be?
Qin Yi's chest heaved once again, creating a magnificent sight. She angrily looked at Ye Futian and said, "Since you are a destiny mage, your destiny palace naturally has a soul. Release the soul of your destiny palace and let me see it."
"My life soul is still in a deep sleep, unable to be summoned, and the reason I fell asleep in the lecture hall is also because of the life soul," Ye Futian calmly replied.
"Ye Futian..." Qin Yi suddenly shouted loudly, her beautiful eyes staring intently at the young man in front of her, saying, "Three years ago, you entered the academy at the age of twelve. At that time, I was still an outer disciple, watching your talent test. Your perception of spiritual energy was top-notch, shocking the academy and attracting the attention of many teachers. However, in the following three years, you made no progress, remaining at the first level of the awakening stage, the gathering energy realm. You were idle all day, lazy and unfocused in class. Have you ever practiced at all?"
"For three years, whether it was the spring or autumn exams, you have given up all your rights and directly ranked last in the academy. Ye Futian, do you have any sense of shame?"
With Qin Yi's angry roar, the entire school building became silent, so quiet that one could hear a pin drop. Everyone's eyes were fixed on Qin Yi's agitated face, as if it was the first time they had seen their senior sister in such a state.
Ye Futian seemed to be subdued as well, his pitch-black eyes staring at the delicate face in front of him that was flushed red with anger.
"Has it been three years?" Ye Futian whispered in his heart, not realizing that three years had unknowingly passed, and the guy in his destiny palace had not changed at all. Moreover, he was somewhat surprised that the always indifferent and sexy ice mountain goddess, Senior Sister Qin, had been paying attention to him all along, starting from the day he stepped into the academy and detected his heaven-grade perception talent.
The space was dead silent, as Qin Yimei's beautiful eyes stared at the young man in front of her. His handsome face had clear lines, and his clean, deep eyes shone like stars. At the age of fifteen, aside from being a bit thin, there were no other flaws to be found. In another three or four years, he would undoubtedly become a stunningly handsome man.
"Was my tone too harsh?" Qin Yi saw a hint of sadness in Ye Futian's eyes and couldn't help but think to himself, his anger dissipating slightly.
"There is still one month left until the autumn examination, and if you give up or fail again, even if I plead for you for the rest of my life, it will be useless. The academy will not allow you to stay any longer. Do you understand?" Qin Yi continued, and the people in the study hall looked at him with a tense gaze, it seemed that the academy had reached its limit with that guy.
If so, it would probably go down in the history of Qingzhou Academy, as it is extremely rare for someone to be expelled from the academy.
"He goes, I go." At the end, an indifferent voice came from the corner, and many people looked at the young man sitting there with complex expressions, including envy, jealousy, admiration, and fear.
"The Academy has already made a decision, Yu Sheng no longer needs to participate in next year's spring examination, and he can choose to practice in any of the Academy's battle towers, knight regiments, or the magic palace. His future cannot be affected by you anymore," Qin Yi sighed as he looked at Ye Futian. The destinies of him and Yu Sheng would eventually head in completely different directions.
A faint smile played at the corner of Ye Futian's mouth, showing a hint of playful irreverence.
"Shut up..." Yu Sheng, who was sitting in the back, stood up, his eyes shining with a brilliant sharp light, piercing towards Qin Yi.
"Sit down," Ye Futian said indifferently without turning his head. Yusheng's gaze paused, looking at the figure in front of him, and then he quietly sat down, as if Ye Futian's words were an iron command for him.
"I've decided..." Ye Futian revealed a slightly frivolous smile on his face and said to Qin Yidao, "I will officially participate in this year's autumn examination."
Later, a brilliant light flashed in the eyes of the rest of his life.
After three years, is he finally going to be serious?
After three years of training at Qingzhou Academy, everyone there knew that he had an unparalleled talent for the rest of his life, with a heavenly perception of the gold attribute, an extremely high martial arts talent, and the ability to practice both law and martial arts. Although he was an outer disciple, his realm was even higher than many lecturers.
However, who truly understands that sleeping youth?
"You have a weak body and are still stuck in the first stage of awakening, gathering energy. Even if you participate in the autumn exams, how can you pass?" Qin Yi looked at Ye Futian and sighed inwardly, fearing that even if he tried his best now, it would still be too late.
"What if I surpass it?" Ye Futian seemed to have no self-awareness, and his tone was full of strong confidence.
"If you can pass, you can do whatever you want in the classroom later," said Qin Yidao.
Ye Futian's eyes flashed with an unusual light, looking at the figure in front of him and her hot body, his eyes involuntarily looked at the place he shouldn't, and weakly said, "Can I do anything I want?"
"What does this guy mean by that..." Many people stared at Ye Futian.
"What a shameless bastard, where is he looking?" It seemed that many people noticed Ye Futian's gaze and had the urge to explode. How dare he flirt with Senior Sister Qin?
Qin Yi naturally noticed Ye Futian's gaze, and the sympathy that had just arisen in her heart disappeared instantly. She stared at Ye Futian with fierce eyes and gritted her teeth, saying, "Whatever you want to do, go ahead!"
In the deep mountains and dense forests, thousands of demons gather.
For the first time, all the different clans set aside their grudges and gathered together, including tigers, rabbits, foxes, snakes, and various other types of demons. For a moment, the entire forest was filled with the voices of various demons, big and small, delicate and enchanting. At the top sat ten demon kings, the top powerhouses of the demon world, who all had the same serious expressions on their faces.
"Everyone from the demon race, I believe you all know what has been happening recently," said the Tiger King, whose tribe was known for their strength, and his words made the other demons quiet down. "We all belong to the demon race, and in the face of this crisis, I think all tribes should put aside their prejudices, unite together, and solve the current problem."
What is the purpose?
"Is there any need to guess?" The Tiger King snorted coldly, "Apart from the cultivators in the six sects and three schools, who would do such a thing? Haven't we been slaughtered by them all these years?"
"But we have always been clearly separated from these cultivation sects, why would they suddenly block our way out of the boundary?" The Fox King looked puzzled.
"They didn't eat the disciples of their three sects and six schools," the Snake King also guessed, "There's no need for them to tear their faces apart like this, right?"
"Exactly!" The Leopard King also said indignantly, "We've been like this for so many years, and every demon has eaten a mortal or two. Why would the three sects and six schools suddenly attack us? I don't think it's them."
"Yes, everyone knows that the demonic energy of my realm is harmful to their cultivation, so they never approach the border forest, let alone guard it specifically."
"But... apart from the six sects and three schools, who else has the strength to kill all the demons that have crossed the boundary within three months?" The Tiger King still insisted on his own idea.
The Eagle King nodded, as if recalling something, and his feathers trembled. "I heard that those demons who went out of the boundary died with no remains left, some were even skinned and cooked. In the forest, there are dried corpses hanging from the old shame trees. Such cruelty... worse than beasts."
"It's simply outrageous!" The Tiger King smashed the armrest of the stone chair with one palm and stood up angrily, "Fellow demon kings, I think instead of guessing who did it here, we should go out together and find out the truth. I don't believe that no matter how high their cultivation is, they can withstand the army of ten thousand demons!"
As soon as he said this, the other nine demon kings immediately showed expressions of agreement; indeed, instead of being frightened, it was better to take the initiative to attack.
The Deer King responded, "My son died at their hands, instead of guessing here, it's better to go out and fight. What about the three sects and six schools? When have we demons ever been afraid of them!"
"Isn't that why we are gathered here today? No matter who it is, let's fight and avenge our fallen comrades." Even the timid Rabbit King stood up in response, as the rabbit clan had suffered the most casualties.
"Yes, if I don't avenge this, I would be a useless demon!"
"By the spirits of our clan, we swear to avenge this."
Other demon kings also stood up one after another in response, and even the various demons waiting around them showed their true forms and revealed their claws, excitedly shouting slogans of revenge, looking like an army ready for battle.
"Um..." a thin voice suddenly sounded in the crowd of demons, "I think we don't need to go, right?"
In the midst of the wave of public outrage, a sudden opposing voice emerged, although not loud, it successfully caught the attention of the crowd. As the shouting stopped, all eyes turned sharply towards the source of the dissenting voice.
"Who is it?" The Tiger King roared even louder, searching for the cowardly demon.
The demons searched everywhere, and although they were the most sensitive creatures in terms of the five senses, they couldn't find the person who made the sound after searching for a long time.
"Who just spoke?" The Tiger King was somewhat angry, "Where did this cowardly demon come from? Have the guts to stand out for this king!"
"I'm here, right here!"
The demons searched the surroundings several times again, but still couldn't see who was making the noise.
"Over here, over here..." the voice came again, "to the left, to the left, no... too far, to the right a bit, wrong, look here, look at this!"
The crowd of demons followed the sound, looking left and right several times, but still could not find the person who made the sound.
"Ah! Never mind, I'm here!"
It was not until a sigh was heard that a figure suddenly climbed onto the high platform where the demon kings were sitting, using both hands and feet. Only then did the demons see the person who had made the sound.
She was a woman dressed in a gray, dull robe, with drooping shoulders and lifeless eyes that kept falling down. The whole person exuded a lazy temperament, she was very short and thin, and her face had a slightly waxy yellow complexion.
The word "weak" appeared in the minds of all the demons at the same time; she was too weak! Even the demonic aura on her body was pitifully weak, as if a casual breath from any demon could blow her away.
No wonder the demons couldn't find this person after searching for a long time; such a demon is really too inconspicuous.
The bloody Tiger King couldn't stand it any longer. With a snort from his tiger nose, he said fiercely, "Hmph, you spineless kid, just a few cultivators have scared you into this state, and you've changed into this appearance." Demons can transform, but this is the Ten Thousand Demons Conference, so most of the demon races here reveal some of their original forms to distinguish their races. Only she maintained a complete human form, which made the Tiger King even more displeased. "Not daring to show your true form, what kind of demon are you?" "I am a human."
"I am a person," the woman replied.
"Human demon?" The Tiger King was stunned, "What kind of demon is a human demon? I've never heard of it!"
"How dare these weak and messy little demons participate in the Ten Thousand Demons Conference," the Tiger King glared at the woman angrily, "You, a spineless little demon, stop talking nonsense here and affecting the morale of our revenge mission."
"No, I'm serious," the woman stubbornly raised her hand, but her shoulders unconsciously drooped, making her look even weaker. "You really don't need to go out and seek revenge for me."
"Still talking nonsense!" The Tiger King roared angrily, "Believe it or not, I'll eat you, little demon."
"You ate me, so there's no need to make a wasted trip, right?"
"What do you mean?"
"What I mean is, the guy you just mentioned who kills all the monsters and is worse than a beast..." She sighed, patted her dusty robe, and raised her head, still looking listless, but pointed to her own nose and said, "It might... be me!"
The entire room was silent for three full seconds, not a sound to be heard.
"Kill her!"
The myriad of demons reacted and rushed towards the woman at the same time.
Small animals and such - they're so troublesome!
Five minutes later.
The first and last grand assembly of ten thousand demons has come to an end!
Chapter One: Tony Don?
The enormous noise stimulates the brain nerves, and high decibels can cause deafness. A dazzling white light shoots into the eyes, causing the sun to ache.
Don couldn't help but squint his eyes, but the white light didn't disappear; instead, it spread throughout the entire world.
What the hell is going on? Am I at a rock concert?
Don cursed inwardly as he opened his eyes, only to be met with a large, terrifying face. A sweaty, black face with wide nostrils, from which hot breath seemed to touch his own face. The cracked, open mouth revealed frighteningly white teeth, like those of a wild animal, and of course, the bad breath that came from within.
Next came a fierce, head-on collision. Don felt as if he had been hit by a heavy punch to the chin, and he fell backward.
The weight of the two people pressed down on those poor plastic bottles, causing them to collapse under the pressure. The water splashed out, and a jet of water even shot out from one bottle, hitting the face of a "pond fish" behind them. The other "pond fish" scattered like frightened sparrows.
"Damn it!"
"Damn it!"
"What's going on?"
"Team doctor, team doctor!"
"How did you kick?"
Don lay on the ground, staring blankly at the unfamiliar faces surrounding him, some of them anxious, some gloating, and others covering their faces, their expressions hidden. The noise around him was still loud, but the huge commotion from before had changed its tune, now filled with hisses and laughter.
Where is this? Who are they? What is going on?
"Wait a minute, let's see what's happening on the sidelines!" The live commentator suddenly became excited, standing up and looking down from the top of the stands, "Forest team's main forward David Johnson was knocked into the sideline coaching bench during a scramble with the opposing player, and poor coach Tony Dunn was just standing there directing the game... Oh! Look at the mess on the ground, this is truly a collision of Mars and Earth!"
Don lay on the ground, his light gray suit soaked through and crumpled, covered in grass and dirt, looking like a used rag.
A man with a large nose and black beard, resembling Mario, appeared in his field of vision. He quickly took out white gloves from his dark-colored leather bag, put them on, and began examining Don's body.
Damn, it seems like he landed on the back of his head!
"Can you hear me talking?" He waved his hand in front of Don's eyes, his tone noticeably more anxious than before.
At the same time, the scene was replayed repeatedly on the television screen.
David Johnson was forcefully pushed by the opposing number 14 during an intense scramble, and the tall, dark player then charged towards Tony Dunn, who was standing on the sidelines. However, strangely enough, Dunn could have avoided the collision, as he had ample time. Yet, he stood there like a puppet, watching his own player crash into him.
The scene was tense as the Forest team players anxiously gathered around the coaching bench, with the focus naturally on Don, who was lying on the ground. The black forward, David Johnson, who had made a mistake, was kneeling on the ground, praying non-stop. If anything happened to his coach, he would become the first player to kill his own head coach on the field.
In contrast to the tense forest team players, most of their opponents stood inside the field with their arms folded, watching the show. Some curious individuals took on the role of scouts for the whole team, constantly running over to see the excitement and then running back to share the situation in the crowd with their teammates.
The Forest fans in the stands didn't seem to worry about their head coach's life or death; instead, they took the opportunity to loudly curse their team's poor performance, with various words starting with "F" or "S" spewing from their mouths, and countless raised middle fingers making the "0:2" on the big screen even more glaring.
Forest team's doctor, Gary Fleming, was still doing his best; he had just clearly seen Tony's eyeball move a little, but why was there no response afterwards?
He patted Tony Don's face, but there was still no response. The team's acting head coach lay on the ground like a wax figure, mouth slightly open, eyes wide, as if he had seen something very surprising.
The blue sky, cotton candy-like white clouds, faces of various skin tones and expressions, a noisy environment - all of this was familiar yet so strange, as if it were a million miles away from oneself.
The main referee signaled the team doctor to handle it himself, as he couldn't let the game be endlessly paused due to off-field injuries. He blew the whistle for the players to return to the field, and the game had to continue, even though the Forest team players had already lost their fighting spirit.
"But he could be in serious danger!" Fleming was furious at the referee's indifference, yelling at him and pointing to Don, who was still lying on the ground.
"Then call an ambulance, I'm just the referee!" The main referee retorted without showing weakness, "Besides, he doesn't seem as dangerous as you say." He pointed behind Fleming and then ran back to the field.
Fleming turned around to see Donn touching the back of his head and slowly getting up; he hurried over to help him. "How are you feeling, Tony?"
Don asked blankly, "Where is this?"
Fleming cursed under his breath, having had the worst luck lately. "Des, Des, come here!" he called, waving a golden boy over from the coaching bench.
A man called "Des" ran over. "How's Tony?"
"It's terrible. He even just asked me where this is?"
Des's reaction was identical to Fleming's earlier one; he also turned his head and cursed a swear word.
"I suspect this is the result of him falling and hitting the back of his head just now."
"Is it bad, Gary?" Des bit his lip, his face serious.
"I don't know, maybe good, maybe bad," Fleming shook his head.
"What does that mean?"
"In the best case scenario, he just has temporary memory loss and will recover after some rest. In the worst case... do you really need me to say it?"
Des waved his hand, indicating that he understood. "Take him to the hospital? But the game is still going on, and we're behind; we need him to direct the game..." As he said this, he turned to look at Tony Don beside him, only to be surprised to see Don slowly moving towards the player's tunnel on his own.
"Hey!" Des quickly dropped Fleming and ran forward to grab his colleague.
"Tony, where are you going?" In the noisy environment, Des's shouting and gesticulating actually had the effect of a "whisper."
Donn looked back at Des with a blank expression, which chilled Des's heart. The setting sun above them was shining brilliantly, but he could not see any light in those eyes.
"Tony, where are you going?" Des repeated the question.
"I... I don't know, maybe... going home..." Don muttered, still trying to break free from Des's grip.
Fleming also ran over from the side: "Tony, you can't go home now. We're in a game, and you're the head coach; you have to lead the team!"
The struggle between the three people at the entrance of the passage caught the attention of both substitute benches, as well as the spectators in the stands, and even the players on the field occasionally glanced over.
Don suddenly laughed, "Am I a coach?" This is ridiculous, how could I possibly be a coach... Although I am a football fan and often play football manager games, how could I possibly be a coach? This must be a dream, a damn nightmare!
Fleming introduced them as if they were meeting for the first time, saying, "This is Des, Des Walker. A former England international, he played as a central defender and retired from the team last season. Now he's your colleague, your assistant."
Don nodded, then said to Des, "Alright, now you take command of the game for me, I'm going to rest." With that, he broke free from Des's hand, ignoring the huge booing behind him and the two dumbfounded people, and walked into the passage.
Fleming looked at Don's back, then at Des Walker.
Walker sighed heavily, turned around, and walked back. "This game is unplayable!"
Don sat in the corridor, leaning against the wall, staring blankly at his surroundings. On the white wall opposite him was a huge sign, a red "mushroom" above three wavy lines, and below that, an English word: Forest.
Where am I? What on earth is going on?
Don rubbed the back of his head, where it still throbbed faintly.
***, sneak attacking me, hitting me from behind!
"What's my name?" he muttered to himself, but suddenly covered his mouth. It was only then that he realized he had been speaking in "bird language" - English.
"***, what's going on?"
Finally realizing where he was, Don was stunned once again; it was so unbelievable that his brain stopped responding after processing the information. And it seemed like all of this had nothing to do with him anymore.
That was the scene this afternoon at the City Stadium, where Forest's interim head coach Tony Don was knocked down by his own player on the sidelines and appeared to briefly lose consciousness. When he got back up, he walked straight into the players' tunnel.
Using the faint light from the streetlamp outside, Don stood in the bathroom, looking at himself in the mirror. A middle-aged foreigner with a tall, straight nose, deep eye sockets, blue eyes, and slightly curly brown hair.
In reality, Tang En from Sichuan, China, was only 26 years old, but the person in the mirror even had forehead wrinkles! Thirty-four years old! This was Tony Tang En's age.
Not only did he inexplicably bend down to an Englishman, but he also traveled forward four years and three months!
Although he never thought he was very handsome, he could attract the attention of many women.
He roared at the mirror and then smashed it with a punch. The reflection of himself instantly shattered into countless pieces, the fragments falling to the ground with a clattering sound, and countless faces stared at Don, as if mocking him.
Don felt a bit dizzy, he took a step back and leaned against the smooth wall, gasping for air.
After sitting quietly in the dark for a few minutes, Don gradually calmed down and decided not to think about such complicated issues for now. He had a habit in China of going to a bar to drink whenever he encountered something unpleasant. Bars were everywhere in Chengdu, and perhaps he could even find a one-night stand along the way. He habitually thought of Nottingham as Chengdu in his mind and decided to go out and find a bar to drown his sorrows.
Glancing at the gloomy sky outside, he put on a thick coat and walked out the door.
After losing 3-0 to the weak team Walsall at their home ground, Nottingham Forest has indeed been having a tough time lately. The highly anticipated Paul Hart failed to bring good results to the team, and after the last match, he submitted his resignation to the team chairman Nigel Doughty, which was quickly approved.
The televisions mounted on the high stands were playing today's sports news, with the focus naturally on everything happening on the sidelines of the Nottingham Forest match.
A chorus of boos erupted in the noisy bar.
A drunken man raised his middle finger to the television. "I know that Tony Donn! He used to be a young assistant to Paul Hart in the youth team."
Just as the drunkard finished his long-winded speech, Don entered the door. The sound of the door attracted the attention of most people drinking and chatting in the bar, and they all looked towards the entrance. When they saw who had come in, they were first surprised, and then a playful smile appeared on their faces.
A typical middle-aged British man stood up with his glass raised, shouting loudly, "Our Tony Dunn coach has arrived!"
"Boo!" came the jeers of "welcome" from the people inside the bar.
"Cheers to him for his beautiful off-court defense against Johnson's breakthrough!" The middle-aged man raised his wine glass, and the people around him immediately followed suit, raising their glasses. "Cheers!"
Another obviously drunk man staggered to his feet, walked up to Don, held a beer bottle to his mouth, and belched, "Coach Tony Don, that was a beautiful defense, but the referee and public opinion obviously don't... don't think so... uh!"
After asking him, he turned his head and laughed loudly at the other people in the bar.
With a gloomy face, he pushed away the wine bottle in front of him. Then he walked straight to the bar and said to the bartender, "Please give me a bottle of..." He habitually wanted to say "little two" - a small bottle of Erguotou, a strong liquor. Although he was from Sichuan, he went to college in the north and had liked this strong liquor since then. However, he realized that he couldn't say "little two" in English, and more importantly, he quickly realized that he was in the UK, not China. He lowered his head and muttered a curse, then changed his request, "Give me the strongest liquor."
The others who had been watching him closely heard him ask for the strongest liquor and began to cheer loudly.
"Yo! So even the timid Tony drinks alcohol?"
The young bartender, facing these excited guests, was also a bit at a loss. He wanted to get some wine but was stopped by the drunkards: "Get him juice! Juice!"
"No, no, it's milk, we have the freshest milk!"
"Aha! Haha!"
The bar owner was disturbed by the noise outside, and he came downstairs to find almost all of the guests who hadn't fallen asleep on the tables gathered around the bar, in the middle of which sat a man wrapped in a black coat, being mocked by the drunkards.
His loud voice instantly quieted the tavern. The previously boisterous drunks suddenly fell silent when they saw the person standing behind them.
Don felt it strange that someone could calm this group of people down with just one sentence. He turned his head slightly and saw a person walking out of the shadows of the stairwell.
The young bartender quickly pointed to Don and said to the man, "Boss, he wants a strong drink."
Upon seeing who was sitting there, the newcomer was somewhat surprised, but still said, "Give it to him then."
"But... but they won't let..." the bartender said hesitantly, looking at the drunks who had already returned to their seats.
The man looked around the bar, and everyone he glanced at lowered their heads, either pretending to sleep or taking a big sip of their drink. Don became more and more interested in the capable middle-aged man in front of him.
"I see no objections, pour him a glass of Scotch whiskey, it's on me," said the bartender, turning to Don. "Single or double?"
The onlookers, who were drinking nearby, burst into laughter.
The bartender also laughed. "I forgot who you were..." He poured half a glass of golden whiskey into the glass, then added half a glass of water. Then he handed it to Don: "This is the drink from my hometown."
Don took a sip and immediately started coughing, as he rarely drank foreign alcohol. Moreover, this authentic Scottish whiskey had a strong, intense charcoal taste.
A burst of schadenfreude laughter erupted inside the bar.
"The Tony Donne I know never drinks and lives like a true traditional Puritan. And he wouldn't look at me with those eyes now, don't you know who I am?" The man stared at Donne, who felt as if he was being seen through by this man.
He had to find a way to hide himself. "Uh... I," Don lowered his head and took another sip, this time not daring to let the liquid linger in his throat for a second longer, swallowing it directly, and the uncomfortable feeling was indeed lighter.
Another burst of laughter followed.
The man scratched the back of his head, indicating understanding.
Someone nearby helped Don out of the situation, and a voice shouted, "It seems our Tony coach really has a broken head! The person sitting next to you is the pride of Nottingham Forest, a two-time European Cup winner, and the 1978 Stanley Matthews Award recipient, Mr. Kenny Burns! He's a hundred times better than you, you stupid donkey!"
The people behind him laughed loudly, shouting "stupid donkey" non-stop, but unexpectedly, the object of their ridicule suddenly turned around and threw the remaining half glass of wine in his hand. The golden Scottish whiskey shone brilliantly under the light, drawing a beautiful arc in the air, and then accurately shot onto the unlucky guy's face - as precise and beautiful as David Beckham's right-footed free kick. "Bang!"
His swearing was met with a thick wine glass thrown back at him, and Donn pounced on the other person with a speed that no one could have anticipated, along with the wine glass. He had endured enough, inexplicably coming to this place, inexplicably traveling forward four and a half years, inexplicably being ridiculed and insulted... Now he just wanted to vent on someone, whether he knocked them down or they knocked him down.
The two people collided with the table behind them, causing empty wine bottles to fall and shatter on the ground with a crisp sound.
The laughter abruptly stopped, and everyone was stunned. They didn't expect Tony Donn, who had just seemed like a coward, to suddenly explode.
The first person to react was the bar owner, Kenny Burns, who pushed a fat man standing next to the bar and shouted, "What are you standing there for? Pull them apart!"
In addition to the terrible scene on the ground, the beaten person's forehead was already oozing blood, and a red circle appeared there, which was the mark of the cup's mouth. Besides that, his left cheek was punched, looking as red as if he had been drinking.
As for Tang En, aside from messing up his hair and clothes, nothing happened. When he was pulled up, he seemed to have vented all his anger and didn't show any intention of going back to continue the fight. He straightened his clothes and hair, then spat at the unlucky guy being held by his companion, "I don't care who you are, just don't mess with me."
Then he turned to Burns and said, "I'm sorry for making a mess here. Today is just too ***..." He got angry when he thought about being crossed, "I'll come to apologize personally another day, and don't worry about the compensation."
Without waiting for the bar owner's response, he turned and walked towards the door. As he passed the fat man, he mocked, "Save your milk for yourself, fat pig."
Everyone watched him push the door and leave, but no one thought to stop him; they just stared as he left, leaving a mess behind.
The bar was silent. At this moment, the drunkard who had been passed out at the table sat up, looked at the silent room and the mess, and asked in confusion, "Did I miss something?"
I don't want to be a foreigner! Let me go back, let me go back! Can Don yell like this?
Since his "past life" was quite terrible, why not take this opportunity to have a different life? Although he had never been a football coach, he had watched football for more than a decade and played every generation of football manager games, so he had some understanding of the nature of a coach's job. Isn't this a great opportunity for a challenge?
He no longer considered the boring question of why fate had chosen him. Now, he only needed to think about how to be more like a real professional coach, even though it would be difficult, but worth trying.
"Hey, buddy. You broke into my house without my permission, and I'm warning you, if you don't leave, I'll call the police!" Suddenly, an old voice sounded from the side.
Don looked blankly at the old man standing across from him, who was holding a lot of newspapers in his arms and a half-eaten hamburger in his hand.
"Is this... your home?" He pointed to the bench below him.
"Of course."
"Ah, sorry for the disturbance..." Don stood up from the chair, and the other person immediately sat down and then lay down, covering themselves with the newspaper in their arms, pressing it firmly between the chair's backrest and their body.
Looking at the satisfied beggar eating a hamburger and lying in a "newspaper nest," Don even had to thank God for not letting himself "possess" him. Fate wasn't too bad to him.
A taxi dropped off a passenger in front of him, and he quickly walked up and got in. Donn took one last look at the beggar lying in the cold wind enjoying his "dinner" before asking the driver to take him back to that unfamiliar home.
Starting today, a whole new world slowly unfolds before Dawn's eyes. On a sunny Saturday morning, Zhao Yao walks on the way to sterilization... on the way to sterilize his cat.
The cat in the bag being carried is a yellow tabby, also known as an orange cat, a type of domestic cat. Its head, back, and limbs are all covered with layers of yellow-orange stripes.
The chest and belly are covered with a large patch of fluffy white fur, and the tips of the limbs are white, which is said to have a lethal effect on girls, controlling their brainwaves and making them emit "ah~~ah~~" sounds.
Although it is a male cat, it has big eyes and a very feminine appearance.
At this moment, the cat was letting out a heart-wrenching scream. The vast majority of domestic cats are very homebound, preferring to stay at home their entire lives, and moving or going out is a terrifying experience for them. Zhao Yao could only keep comforting the cat with his voice.
Meanwhile, outside the Earth's atmosphere, a dark meteor slowly streaked across outer space, gradually flying over China. The meteor's surface shimmered with a strange glow, seemingly releasing some kind of rays into the surrounding void.
Inside the Star Pet Hospital, Zhao Yao placed the cat bag on the front desk: "Male cat sterilization, I had made a reservation before, my last name is Zhao."
"You haven't been here before according to our records, so we need you to fill out the information section on the medical card."
In outer space, a meteor slowly streaked across the sky above China, heading towards the Pacific Ocean. As the meteor passed, many cats suddenly shuddered, their eyes flashing with a deep glow, just like the radiance emitted by the meteor.
At this moment, Matcha suddenly moved, struggling to jump up and darted towards the hospital entrance.
The little nurse let out a scream, while Zhao Yao on the side suddenly sprang out and grabbed the escaping Matcha.
Zhao Yao's speed was too slow to catch Matcha's body, and he only managed to grab Matcha's tail.
When its tail was grabbed, Matcha let out a roar and instinctively turned its head to bite Zhao Yao. This was the instinct of a feline animal, and its speed was incredibly fast. In an instant, it left a cut on Zhao Yao's hand, causing him pain and making him immediately release his grip.
Perhaps knowing that it had caused trouble, Matcha did not continue to run away, but curled up its body and looked at Zhao Yao somewhat uneasily.
Zhao Yao hugged the matcha and said, "Silly cat, what are you biting? Are you rebelling?"
Suddenly, a glimmer of light flashed in the eyes of the matcha cat, and the traces of blood on its teeth completely disappeared.
Zhao Yao also felt a sudden dizziness in his head, and then he wanted to check the depth of the wound on the back of his hand, but upon looking, he was slightly stunned to see that the back of his hand was smooth and clean, with no trace of any wound or blood.
The little nurse next to her took the cat and comforted it, saying, "Good girl, Matcha, it's okay, it'll be fine in a moment, don't be nervous."
When Zhao Yao heard this meow, it was not just a simple cat's cry, but rather it turned into understandable words.
Zhao Yao pointed at the matcha in front of him with shock, his face full of astonishment, exclaiming, "This... this... this cat can talk!"
The little nurse looked at Zhao Yao with a puzzled expression and said, "Mr. Zhao, are you alright?"
"Didn't you hear?" Zhao Yao hurriedly said, "It... it's talking."
The little nurse frowned, and her gaze at Zhao Yao became increasingly strange.
"Can you understand what I'm saying, meow?"
"Take me home!"
"Wuwuwuwu, I'm scared to pee~meow."
Zhao Yaomeng opened his mouth wide, looked at the little nurse who was still comforting Matcha without any awareness, and then looked at Matcha and said, "Can you understand what I'm saying?"
"I can understand, I can understand, I want to go home, please take me home, wuwuwuwuwu."
On the other side, the little nurse turned her head and looked at Zhao Yao, who was talking to the cat, her expression becoming increasingly strange.
Ignoring the strange looks from the nurse, Zhao Yao quickly picked up the matcha and stuffed it back into the bag, then hurriedly left the hospital.
Inside the rented house, the matcha cat immediately relaxed in the familiar environment, lying on the tea table and licking its white paws, squinting its eyes, looking content. For cats, grooming is always a very suitable behavior for relaxation.
In front of the tea table, Zhao Yao stared intently at the matcha cat in front of him and tentatively asked, "Can you still talk?"
As he spoke, he stood up with an eager look on his face and said, "Does the master want to play a game?"
"Uh, this... let's play later." Zhao Yao scratched his head, somewhat at a loss for words, and asked, "When did you learn to speak?"
Looking at the innocent face of the matcha cat, Zhao Yao had a strange expression on his face.
Matcha Cat, however, seemed completely unfazed by the situation, suddenly jumping into Zhao Yao's arms, rubbing against his body with narrowed eyes, and cooing in a babyish voice, "Play a game with me."
Looking at the matcha cat in front of him, who spoke like a five-year-old child, Zhao Yao patted its head, and the latter let out an enjoyable purring sound.
"By calculation, you are only one year old, which is equivalent to a five-year-old human." A faint smile appeared at the corner of Zhao Yao's mouth: "Still a child, this seems not bad."
One month later, at nine o'clock in the evening.
Zhao Yao opened the door of the rental house with a tired face, took off his clothes casually, and sat down on the sofa.
Although the rental house he lived in was only 30 square meters, it was fully furnished and used to be the home of a newlywed couple. Moreover, it was close to his company, so he didn't have to worry about transportation issues when working overtime. Therefore, even though the rent was not cheap, Zhao Yao was still willing to pay for it.
After Zhao Yao lay down, the matcha cat unknowingly crawled to his side, rubbing its head against his arm, looking affectionate and flattering.
Zhao Yao smiled, rubbed Matcha's head, and the latter showed an expression of enjoyment.
But at that moment, the cell phone on the sofa was also pushed over by the matcha.
Chapter 1
Tang Mo'er lay on the table, her delicate white arm supporting her head, her long black hair like silk floating in mid-air, revealing half of her youthful and charming face, feeling hot, so hot.
What's going on?
A constant burning heat inside her body scorched her little face, making her feel uncomfortable. Today, she came to the imperial capital from Ye City and just drank a glass of plain water handed over by Han Xiaowan.
Han Xiaowan, her half-sister from the same mother but different father.
"Oh no, Tang Mo'er jumped down, hurry up and chase her, we can't let her get away!"
Tang Mo'er suddenly jolted awake, realizing that Han Xiaowan had actually set her up!
What should we do?
Tang Mo'er looked at the man as if she had caught a lifesaving straw, "Sir, please save me, I've been drugged, and there are a few men behind me who want to force themselves on me."
The man's deep, cold, narrow eyes looked past the girl and glanced at the men behind her; although his gaze was faint, it sent chills down one's spine.
Those men were petty gangsters who had seen some of the world, and they had seen the man who covered the entire financial magazine headlines and controlled the economic lifeline of the entire capital on television.
Gu Mohan.
They knew they couldn't mess with this man, so they turned and ran. In a place completely shrouded in darkness, a earth-shattering battle was taking place, with angels with wings burning in flames, knights clad in heavy armor, and crusaders wielding golden swords, fighting against an evil army composed of bone dragons with black smoke, terrifying death knights, and countless skeleton soldiers.
The battlefield of their struggle was not a place filled with gunfire and smoke or a burial ground full of bones, but rather a vast, pitch-black darkness, which was undoubtedly a very strange imagination.
But even more bizarre was that outside this battlefield, in the void shrouded in endless darkness, one could hear faint whispers of voices murmuring.
"Operate it, hurry up and operate it! Oh my God!"
"Control your Death Knight first when talking about others! The Death Knight is fighting with the moving fortress!"
"Where are my troops? Who is attacking my troops? Where is the enemy?"
After the battle, the angels, knights, and scattered skeleton soldiers that had been on the battlefield disappeared into the darkness of the background, and the place returned to a state of absolute silence, shrouded in endless darkness, as if nothing had ever happened.
But a few voices continued to communicate, and even more voices joined in.
"My teammates are just a bunch of pigs! Even a tied-up dog would be better than them! Not only do they provide no help in the battle, but they also try to take control of the core forces..." The voice from the previous failure spoke with some unwillingness.
"Pah! It's clearly because the undead creatures are too weak. If it were my demon army, things would definitely be different..." Another voice fought back without showing weakness, and made such a forced defense for its wrong command: "I originally thought that the Death Knights could easily deal with those bunkers."
Upon hearing this sound, a few soft laughs couldn't help but emerge from the darkness, and the arguing parties suddenly lost their temper, helplessly saying to the victorious side, "We admit defeat, as our skills are inferior."
And the winning side actually engaged in a round of graceless mockery at this time?
"Ha ha! Justice will ultimately triumph over evil!"
"In the face of our power, whether it be the undead or demons, even gods will be slain before your eyes!"
This undoubtedly made people even more furious, and the two sides, which had already calmed down, suddenly started a new round of verbal battles. The third person from the winning side, who was not involved in this new battlefield, asked somewhat helplessly, "Should I not have organized this game?"
Could it be that the previous tragic and heroic battle was just a game?
A voice that had not participated in the game responded, "Being able to simulate a realistic war with consciousness, making us bystanders feel as if we are in the midst of it, is truly amazing. You are indeed good at bringing us surprises, Lord Hope."
This person, who was called Hope, responded modestly to the sudden gratitude from the other party, saying, "You're too kind; it's just a pastime."
Yes, that battle, which seemed like a life-and-death showdown between the forces of good and evil, was nothing more than a diversion, adding just a little bit of amusement in this endless prison.
This is a void realm beyond the real plane, which should be an eternally dark, cold, and silent place where no living beings can survive, a realm more terrifying than death.
However, in such a place, this desolate land that can hardly accommodate any living beings, there exists a group of indescribable creatures who have lost their physical bodies and only have their last consciousness remaining in this void.
They called themselves Voidwalkers, forever imprisoned in this prison called the Void.
Before being imprisoned here, they were the top powerhouses of various races and fields, mages who reached the pinnacle of the magic path, warriors who touched the limits of martial arts, alchemists who created everything, devout and noble missionaries, demons who ruled hell, necromancers who controlled souls, and so on. They had all left their names in the history of various planes.
Many people thought they had long since perished, only historical records proving their existence, but little did they know that these powerful beings, so strong as to be described as abnormal, were actually imprisoned in the endless void beyond the planes. They had spent countless years there and seemed to be forever trapped in this place. The seemingly thin barrier between the real plane and the void was an insurmountable wall of sighs for them, and even with their once immense power, they were helpless against it.
But they never gave up hope of escaping, because among these 33 void walkers was an extremely special existence, the fifth walker codenamed Hope.
Hope, originally named Bai Yi, did not come from the various dimensions where humans live outside of the void, but from a strange place called Earth. In his previous life, he was an editor for a small news website, where his daily job was to copy news from other domestic and international websites and then add sensational headlines.
Publishing titles like "Men will cry, women will be silent" on their own website, a noisy and tedious job.
Later, due to an accidental life and death incident, Bai Yi's consciousness did not disappear immediately, but instead entered this mysterious void by chance, encountering several other void walkers, and ultimately survived strongly until this moment.
The Voidwalkers insisted that he, coming from a different world, would be the key to breaking free from this endless prison. "Only you are different, wanting to leave this place, you are our only chance, I firmly believe this, so I call you by the code name Hope," said the first Voidwalker, codenamed Magician.
They firmly believed in this, believing that they would see the light of day again someday, even though they had been imprisoned for countless times, hundreds of years? Thousands of years?
To persist for thousands of years without going mad in this eternally unchanging prison, it was clear that chatting or discussing alone was not enough; in fact, the main pastime of the Voidwalkers was an activity called memory sharing.
This activity is based on a mental technique called memory recall, which allows people to remember every detail they have experienced, even down to every punctuation mark on a newspaper.
Then, through a certain degree of editing, removing some memories that one does not want others to see, such as sleeping with a woman or engaging in intimate activities with one's own hands, and exchanging memories with the other person, it is equivalent to watching a super-long movie about someone else's life, which is an excellent way to pass the time.
The memories of thirty-three void walkers were equivalent to experiencing thirty-three lifetimes for him. Even though he later chose to forget most of these memories to avoid confusion, retaining only their knowledge and experience, his mindset had matured and become steady through these thirty-three lifetimes, shedding weaknesses such as naivety and impatience. He was no longer an ordinary person on Earth.
That's why he was highly regarded by other void walkers; however, after countless years had passed, even he could not find any opportunity to break free. The only thing he managed to do was to make this dull and boring time slightly less tedious.
Meanwhile, at this very moment, the real plane of Ister is about to welcome the arrival of nightfall. As the afterglow of the setting sun fills the entire Xiansei Academy, the students finally finish their heavy day of coursework. Accompanied by young and energetic laughter, they stroll in groups of three or two along the tree-lined paths within the academy.
Mia, a second-year student in the Soul Armor series, was one of them. She had a cute and charming face, her black hair tied into two equally adorable pigtails, and wore the standard uniform of Xiansei Academy. After saying a simple goodbye to her classmates, she came alone to the academy's square, found a bench to sit on, and took out a half-eaten piece of bread from her dinner leftovers from her jacket pocket. She carefully tore the bread into tiny crumbs and sprinkled them on the square's bluestone floor.
A moment later, the sound of wings flapping could be heard in the air, and several white pigeons quickly landed at Miya's feet. They pecked at the breadcrumbs she had scattered while cooing softly. Miya carefully squatted down, her long twin ponytails gently sweeping the ground as she moved. She quietly watched the group of pigeons, which she was already familiar with, and a contented smile appeared on her face.
The beautiful young girl, gentle white doves, and statues standing quietly in the square, along with the lush surrounding vegetation, all come together to create a stunning scene under the last golden rays of the setting sun.
This is something Miya does every day, and it is also the most relaxing moment of her day. As a student with average qualifications, life in the higher education institution of Xian Sai College always seems particularly hard.
"The sky is getting dark, let's call it a day. I have to go back and practice. Goodbye, Mr. Pigeons," Mia said with a relaxed smile on her face, bidding farewell to the group of pigeons. She then took quick steps with her slender legs wrapped in white stockings under her short uniform skirt, hurrying back to her dormitory.
Evenings are also an important time for learning, especially for gifted students like Miya, whose efforts are not as effortless as the smile that seems to always grace her face.
Chapter 1
In the Su family mansion, a huge martial arts field was holding a ceremony for the awakening of the martial soul.
The young man on the altar, named Su Yu, was the son of the Su family's elder and possessed exceptional talent.
Su Mo, the son of Su Hong, the head of the Su family, completed the nine-fold body tempering at the age of only fourteen and was hailed as the number one genius of the Su family.
Now that a genius like Su Yu has appeared, the martial soul awakened by Su Mo's talent will surely not be worse than Su Yu's.
If Su Mo could awaken a martial soul of human level five or above, then the Su family would have two top-level geniuses this time, and their future development would be extraordinary.
When the presiding elder called out this name, the shocked disciples, elders, and others all looked at the handsome young man next to them with their eyes full of expectation, even more intense than before with Su Yu.
With a calm expression, Su Mo raised his steps and walked onto the altar.
Walking down the altar, Su Yu had a proud expression on his face, giving Su Mo a cold smile, his eyes filled with provocation.
Su Mo ignored the other party, took a deep breath, sat cross-legged, and closed his eyes tightly.
From beneath the altar, streams of glowing symbols immediately floated out and continuously drilled into Su Mo's body.
His talent was top-notch in the Su family, and he completed body tempering at the age of fifteen, which was undoubtedly impressive. However, he was always overshadowed by Su Mo.
At this time, more and more flickering runes appeared on the altar, enveloping Sumo's body.
With his eyes closed and sitting cross-legged, Sumo's breathing became slightly rapid, and from his body, bursts of rumbling sounds gradually emerged.
Everyone held their breath, their eyes fixed intently on the altar above!
Boom!
Finally, with a loud explosion, a dark shadow suddenly rose, the dark shadow was like a black hole, slowly rotating inside, bottomless, giving a chilling feeling.
At the same time, above the phantom, a yellow halo flickered.
Ah!
In an instant, everyone in the room had their eyes glazed over.
A halo?
The most basic martial soul?
How is this possible?
Even Su Yu was stunned, his face full of astonishment.
Because he couldn't imagine that the number one genius of the Su family had only awakened a first-order human-level martial soul, the lowest level of martial soul!
Su Mo sat cross-legged on the altar, slowly opening his eyes, and was stunned when he saw his own martial soul.
"A human-level first-order martial soul...!" Su Mo murmured to himself, a bitter smile appearing at the corner of his mouth. He never expected that he would awaken the lowest-level martial soul!
The worst martial soul? "He actually awakened a useless martial soul!
"What a so-called genius, he's nothing but the number one waste of my Su family."
For a moment, the gazes of everyone, including the Su family elders and deacons, changed towards Su Mo; there were looks of disappointment, disdain, and contempt.
On the altar, Su Mo slowly stood up, his fists unconsciously clenched tightly.
Sneering around, Su Mo sneered in his heart: "These people are really snobbish!"
Previously, Sumo was exceptionally talented, and everyone treated him with great courtesy. Wherever he went, he was surrounded by people, and flattery was constantly heard.
Now that he has awakened the trash martial soul, these people immediately changed their faces.
Su Mo shook his head, not bothering to argue with them, and walked down the altar, leaving quickly.
There was a slight itch on the face, and it seemed to be surrounded by a patch of grass.
"Didn't I die in a car accident? How did I come back to life?"
He was somewhat surprised, but before he could figure out how he had escaped death, the sight before him immediately made him widen his eyes in excitement. Then he was dumbfounded!
No way! How could such a beautiful girl litter like that?
Xu Que's eyes widened as he watched the beautiful girl completely remove her skirt right in front of him, slowly taking off her underwear as well, revealing a tender and white skin, accompanied by a unique feminine fragrance.
"Girl, what are you doing? You can't just go to the bathroom anywhere!"
The scene suddenly froze. She let out a scream, panicked and dropped her skirt, and the whole person sprang up from the spot, unexpectedly stepping on a sharp sword and flying across the air.
What the heck is this? Flying sword?
So, she's really a fairy, huh?
Xu Que was suddenly startled, and at the same time, a large amount of unfamiliar yet familiar memories flooded into his mind, as if they were innate experiences.
I freaking time-traveled!
Immediately reading the memories that didn't belong to him in his mind, Xu Que sorted everything out.
This place turned out to be a world of cultivation, where people could practice various techniques to become immortals, just like the angry little fairy in front of him who was flying with her sword.
The owner of this body turned out to be the current son-in-law, but this son-in-law was a complete unlucky guy.
He was just a poor orphan, but he possessed a unique spiritual root that was rare in a thousand years.
In his youth, he was chosen by the emperor to be his son-in-law due to a fortunate opportunity, and was provided with countless heavenly treasures to cultivate. In just six years, he condensed his inner core and entered the Golden Core stage.
On the day he entered the Golden Core stage, he finally consummated his marriage with the princess. They spent seven days and nights in the bridal chamber, and as a result, the enchantingly beautiful princess, like a seductive fox, drained all his cultivation and even took away his spiritual roots and talents.
The genius son-in-law had just gotten married when he became a useless person. With no value left to be exploited, he was quietly sent out of the palace overnight. On the way to exile, he was killed by a single palm strike arranged by the emperor, dying of anger, and his body was finally abandoned here.
"Ah, what a pity!"
After sorting out these memories, Xu Que had a regretful expression on his face, shook his head and sighed, annoyed, "Damn it! Why didn't I travel back a step earlier, to the happy time when I was crazily doing exercises in bed with the beautiful princess?"
Recalling the enchanting charm of the beautiful princess on the wedding bed, her proud figure, and her seductive sighs, Xu Que felt even more regretful that he had arrived just one step too late.
"You audacious pervert, daring to peep at this lady while she's using the restroom, come and pay with your life!"
At this moment, a scolding voice suddenly came, and it turned out that the fairy had returned.
Her face flushed with shame and anger, her eyes filled with endless murderous intent, and she stepped on the cold and sharp sword beneath her feet, charging towards Xu Que.
"Damn it, fairy, this is definitely a misunderstanding! It was you who squatted right where I was lying down, and... even if you want to kill me to vent your anger, please pull up your pants first, okay? This way, I don't have much motivation to run away!" Xu Que shouted and started running.
The woman's face changed instantly, her cheeks flushed red as she pulled up her undergarment from under her skirt, spat, and angrily scolded, "You lecherous thief, looking for death." The speed of the flying sword under her feet suddenly increased, whizzing towards Xu Que.
As he ran frantically, Xu Que desperately thought of ways to escape.
Suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck in the mind.
He immediately stopped in his tracks, took out a familiar token from his pocket, and turned to the woman, shouting, "How dare you, demoness! I am the current son-in-law of the Fire Element Nation, and you dare disrespect me? Be careful, or I will punish your nine clans!"
At this moment, a series of system prompt sounds suddenly rang in Xu Que's head.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for activating the show-off face-slapping system. This system will protect you and help you show off and fly!"
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully showing off, rewarded with 1 show-off point. Would you like to enter the store to redeem?"
"The system detected that the host 'Xu Que' has weak abilities and is struggling to survive in this world's difficulty level. A special newcomer gift package is awarded. Would you like to view the gift package?"
At the same time as the prompt tone sounded, a light curtain window popped up in front of the eyes, displaying several pieces of information data.
Xu Que first took a deep breath, and then burst into uncontrollable laughter. What kind of pretentious face-slapping system is this? It's clearly tailor-made for me, a system to help me break through the sky! Now there's something to play with.
"Debauchee, what's so funny when you're on the verge of death?"
Suddenly, a delicate scolding pulled Xu Que back from his ecstasy.
The woman had unknowingly stood about ten meters in front of him, holding a flying sword pointed at him, her watery big eyes staring at him with vigilance and suspicion.
"Come on, come on... Do you want to fight me? Do you dare to take one step closer to me?"
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully showing off, rewarded with 1 show-off point."
Sure enough, the system prompt sound that only Xu Que could hear rang again in his ear, and he couldn't help but burst into laughter once more. "That's right, there seems to be a gift package as well."
Suddenly, the image on the screen in front of the window changed, revealing a square gift box. The box opened, and several streaks of light leaped out, disappearing in a flash.
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining the primary experience pill, which can provide 10,000 experience points when consumed."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining two entry-level teleportation talismans, which can be used to instantly teleport to any location within a five-kilometer radius."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for obtaining the elementary level of 'Ancient Five Elements Technique' (Note: The elementary level can only be cultivated to the foundation-building stage, and subsequent exchanges can be made in the mall)."
"Ding, detected that the host 'Xu Que' has incomplete spiritual roots, not meeting the cultivation requirements, the system will complete all spiritual roots for you."
Immediately, Xu Que felt as if an electric current was passing through his body, causing his scalp to tingle in an instant.
Following this, a sense of comfort arises, as if all the pores of the body have been thoroughly opened, greedily absorbing the spiritual energy from all directions.
Boom!
Soon, he felt a tremendous change in his body, becoming closer to nature, as if he could merge with everything and control everything.
But he was very aware of how familiar this feeling was; back when his Heavenly Fire Spirit Root had not been taken away by the princess, he had such a close connection with the flames. Now, the system not only restored his Heavenly Fire Spirit Root but also completed the spirit roots of other attributes.
Gold, wood, water, fire, and earth - all five spiritual roots were present at once, and each one was of the highest "heavenly" grade.
Oh my god, this is going against the heavens!
Thinking of this, Xu Que couldn't help but raise his arm and shout, "With the system in hand, I have the world! What nonsense about the Fire Element Nation's princess and emperor, when I, Xu Que, return after leveling up, I will trample you all underfoot and crush you to pieces."
"How dare you, a bold and lewd thief, claim to be the prince consort of the Fire Element Nation and even dare to speak such wild words, intending to kill the king?" The woman next to him was a bit dumbfounded, had the prince consort gone mad?
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully showing off, gaining 1 point of showing off value."
It was only then that Xu Que came to his senses, his mouth twitching slightly. Damn, he was too busy showing off and looking forward to the future that he almost forgot the trouble at hand. He needed to think of a way to escape quickly.
"Right, the experience pill!"
He suddenly remembered that there was a beginner's experience pill in the newcomer gift pack.
Without any hesitation, he quickly used his mind to operate the system interface, opened a package, and three items appeared inside.
"Use, use." Xu Que stared at the two items and shouted in his heart.
"Ding, congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for successfully cultivating the 'Ancient Five Elements Secret'."
"Ding, the host 'Xu Que' has taken a primary experience pill and gained 10,000 experience points."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for leveling up, currently at the first level of the Qi Refining stage."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for leveling up, currently at the third level of the Qi Refining stage."
"Congratulations to the host 'Xu Que' for leveling up, currently at the tenth level of the Qi Refining stage."
In just a few moments, Xu Que transformed from an ordinary person with no power to a cultivator, directly reaching the tenth level of the Qi Refining stage, only one step away from the Foundation Building stage.
Moreover, his current strength was even more powerful than the normal Qi Refining Stage's tenth level by countless times.
The reason is that he possessed five heavenly spiritual roots, which is equivalent to a person having five times the strength of an ordinary person.
Even under the mutual promotion and restraint of these five different auras, the power that bursts out is far more than just five times as simple.
"This time, there's really nothing to say. If I'm not invincible, who is?"
Xu Que couldn't help but feel excited inside. However, at this moment, the woman across from him waved a streak of light, cutting through the sky, and the sharp sword blade darted over like a venomous snake in the blink of an eye.
"Damn it, fairy, I just asked you, this little beauty, to come forward and let this prince have a good look at you. Who told you to draw your sword? This is a sneak attack!"
Upon seeing the flying sword attacking, Xu Que was immediately frightened and jumped, cursing out loud.
Although cursing, the movements under his feet were not at all ambiguous. He smoothly slid back, and his fingertips condensed a wisp of water spiritual energy, gently flicking it onto the oncoming sword blade.
"Bang!"
With a trembling sound, the sharp sword was flicked away by him.
"How... is this possible?"
The woman was immediately stunned; in the sect, those who could break this sword so easily, apart from the unfathomable uncles and masters, at least had to be the senior brothers and sisters at the sixth level of the foundation-building stage!
"I was puzzled, even though it was said that the previous incident was a misunderstanding, you still keep entangling and even want to kill me? Don't think that just because you look like a fairy I won't hit you. Anyway, I didn't see it clearly just now, so this time I'll take a good look."
Xu Que, annoyed, cursed and stepped forward with his Yu step. The earth-elemental spiritual energy instantly merged into the ground, and his speed suddenly increased. In the blink of an eye, he appeared in front of the woman.
Immediately after, a wisp of water spiritual energy surged out of his palm, surrounding all sides, and the woman was restrained before she could even react.
"What... what do you want, you lecher?" The woman was shocked and horrified, feeling the fire spiritual energy within her body being completely suppressed.
"Hey! Since you've already called me a lecher, I can't just take the blame for nothing."
With a sly smile on his face, Xu Que raised his eyebrows and reached out directly to lift the woman's skirt.
Chapter One: If there is a next life, I will dance with you across the world!
Nine Heavens, amidst the sea of clouds, the Wind and Thunder Platform, a thin line of sky!
Here is the Nine Heavens Continent, the top three heavens, a place of absolute death, the Wind and Thunder Platform! It can connect with wind and thunder, and has only one way in and out!
But at this moment, on the Wind and Thunder Platform, there was a scene of bloody wind and miserable fog!
"Chu Yang, hand over the Nine Tribulations Sword! Spare your life!"
"Chu Yang, having the Nine Tribulations Sword, the world's number one divine object, in your hands is simply a waste. After so many years, you have made no progress, and it's just a squandering of heavenly resources! You should just hand it over."
Bursts of noisy shouts came from all directions.
The look in his eyes remained as calm and steady as a rock, and his body stood as straight as a javelin!
Just like the sword in his hand, he was full of unyielding determination, even though he had already suffered a fatal injury!
At his feet, within a radius of several hundred feet, there were countless severed limbs and bodies, drenched in blood.
Looking around at the crowd of experts who were only shouting but not rushing over, Chu Yang revealed a mocking smile on his face, arrogant and disdainful!
Such people, with such a mindset, no matter how high their cultivation or how many they are; even if they can kill me ten thousand times, they are not worthy to be my enemy!
How could the matter of the Nine Tribulations Sword in his own hands be leaked? He had clearly investigated for three years before confirming that there was a piece of the Ninth Tribulation Sword in the Wind Thunder Platform of the Upper Three Heavens, and after going through countless hardships, he finally found an opportunity to risk his life and come to the Upper Three Heavens. But why did he encounter such a massive ambush after arriving here?
Today, I have entered the top three days, and it is only the fifth day! Today's situation is purely a dead end! I have always been known for my mysterious whereabouts, who knows my plan?
I charged continuously for more than ten times, and each time, I was blocked by someone! And the places I chose were all in blind spots!
Extreme in emotions, extreme in swordsmanship! He extinguished his emotions and devoted himself to the sword, pursuing the martial path to seek the heavenly path, paying the price of lifelong loneliness, and using widespread slaughter as a means to save the world. Unfortunately, in the end, he still couldn't cultivate the Nine Tribulations Sword or achieve the divine power of the Nine Heavens!
Is it my own wrong choice? Or is this path fundamentally wrong?
A heartless swordsman is a heartless swordsman; if a swordsman has feelings, what kind of swordsman is he? The way of the sword, martial arts, and the way of heaven are ultimately all heartless... But at this moment of life and death, why is it so shaken?
Nine Tribulations Sword, what is your secret?
Looking at the greedy eyes around him staring at the Nine Tribulations Sword, Chu Yang smiled bitterly in his heart. You all only know that obtaining this Nine Tribulations Sword will make you invincible in the world, but do you know how much I have paid for this sword?
There is nothing left.
Blood was flowing, and Chu Yang clearly sensed his life rapidly slipping away. He had pursued martial arts all his life, entering, breaking, and leaving emotions until he reached a state of emotionlessness. At the brink of death, he thought his only regret would be not reaching the ultimate realm he had pursued all his life. However, to his surprise, at this moment, an image he thought he had long forgotten emerged in his mind.
Do not dance lightly, for the woman who breaks hearts in the Chu Yang!
"Turns out, I never really got over her..." Chu Yang revealed a self-mocking smile at the corner of his mouth, murmuring to himself.
A hint of regret quietly spread in his heart, like a mist, sweeping through his entire soul in an instant.
Light dance! In this journey to the underworld, could I possibly meet you?
"Let's all go together! Just chop him down! As for the Nine Tribulations Sword, we can discuss it slowly later!" One person shouted loudly, "Otherwise, once he recovers a bit, it will be our turn to struggle!" The crowd around them roared in agreement, and immediately raised their swords and knives, closing in on Chu Yang.
"One does not dance lightly in a lifetime, one dance brings a lifetime of suffering; in this life, I dance for you, even if it means suffering for a lifetime!"
This is a short poem written by Mo Qingwu on the night of their love confession. I still remember Mo Qingwu's tearful eyes, her gaze filled with sorrow and resentment. She knew that her love was being used for cultivation, yet she still threw herself into my arms like a moth to a flame, allowing herself to burn passionately!
Upon hearing the news, I rushed over immediately, but it was ultimately too late. Although I later killed all the members of the family who had hurt Mo Qingwu, exterminating them and their nine generations without leaving a single living creature, the beautiful woman could never be brought back to life!
That unparalleled beauty, as she lay dying in his arms, softly said to him, "Chu Yang, if there is an afterlife... if I can still meet you, I hope you can take a good look at me. I am more beautiful than a sword!"
Light dance, you are not satisfied, you have regrets, otherwise, why would there be tears in the corner of your eyes?
Two drops of clear tears shattered her heart in that moment, and from then on, her heart was sealed in dust.
Together in life and death, to the highest heavens!
This was a poem written by the world's top talent, Xue Lei Han, who was moved by Mo Qing Wu's deep affection for Chu Yang.
And now, as you dance lightly in the heavens, I remain in the mortal world... but soon, I will be able to join you in life and death... for all eternity!
Chu Yang was lost in thought, and a gentle, melancholic smile appeared on his usually cold and hard lips.
Light dance, wait for me!
Light Dance, do you know, if there is an afterlife, I would rather not practice any swordsmanship, not reach any peak, not seek revenge, just to be with you! In this world, what can compare to your satisfying smile?
No! Not bitter... Light dance, you suffer, but you don't feel bitter, now... I am very bitter!
As more and more swords pierced his body, droplets of blood flew out, and the pain gradually focused from all over his body, finally interrupting the song and dance in his mind!
Chu Yang roared in anger! He suddenly stood up, his black hair flying wildly!
Chu Yang felt a pain in his heart, and when he looked down, the jade pendant hanging around his neck shattered with a snap right before his eyes. In an instant, his eyes were filled with rage!
This is the only memory Light Dance left for herself!
"Kill!" Chu Yang suddenly raised his head, his eyes filled with a crazy surge of murderous intent. With a wild shout, the Nine Tribulations Sword in his hand suddenly stirred up thousands of sword lights, like lightning from the nine heavens converging into a belt of light!
With a series of clangs and clatters, all the weapons surrounding him were neatly chopped off in one stroke!
Everyone hurriedly backed away, looking in horror at the neatly arranged half-cut weapons under Chu Yang's feet, cold sweat streaming down their backs. They never expected the power of a single strike from the Nine Tribulations Sword to be so terrifying!
Chu Yang looked around and suddenly asked softly, "Do you all want the Nine Tribulations Sword?"
Without waiting for anyone to answer, he laughed coldly and slowly said, "Fine! I'll let you all see the Nine Tribulations Sword!"
He suddenly leaped up! Despite having sustained countless fatal injuries, he managed to jump up!
"Nine Tribulations Sword, a glimmer of cold light with ten thousand feet of radiance!"
As the arc shot out, millions of cold rays surged forth!
Nine Heavens Sword Technique! One sword!
Nine Heavens is the name of this continent. Throughout history, no sword technique has ever dared to use these three characters as its name, but this Nine Tribulations Sword Technique directly uses the name "Nine Heavens"!
Throughout history, there has been only this one set!
Although Chuyang could not fully unleash the true power of the Nine Tribulations Sword Technique, he had already grasped these few swords for a long time. The power of these swords, although not as great as imagined, was far beyond the worldly sword techniques.
Surrounded by dozens of experts, they knew that this sword was extraordinary and used their utmost skills to resist this attack. Everyone's body was shaking, feeling that the weapons in their hands were almost unstable.
"With the Nine Tribulations Sword, what's the harm in slaughtering the entire world!"
Before the first move was even finished, the second move arrived with a murderous aura! The surging light was like a rising tide, with boundless killing intent covering the sky and erupting out!
Screams rang out as more than a dozen experts, each capable of dominating a region, tried their best to resist, but still ended up bloodied and retreating in a sorry state.
At this moment, everyone had an illusion: Chu Yang now seemed to be completely uninjured and in perfect condition!
They didn't know that they had interrupted Chu Yang's memories and Mo Qingwu's song and dance, causing Chu Yang to become completely furious and fully unleash all the potential of his body! This was the power of life and the rage of the soul!
"Nine Tribulations Sword, gathering the wind and clouds to become the emperor!"
Chu Yang suddenly opened his eyes and growled, "Why? Why is it gone?"
In the distance, three directions, three rays of light rose simultaneously, transforming into three golden shadows in the air! Dazzling and panic-stricken, they carried an unrivaled arrogance.
Although he was only one level away from the king level, this one level was as different as heaven and earth!
Three kings! What a generous move!
"However, this place is not somewhere where a mere Poison Sword Martial Master like you can run wild for three days!" One person said calmly, "It's just a pity that I can't have a fair fight with you, what a shame!"
With the sound of their voices, the other two appeared together. All three of them were dressed in wide robes with large sleeves, their clothes fluttering as they rode the wind. They had a casual demeanor and calm expressions.
Chu Yang's eyes were already somewhat blurry: "You three kings... also want the Nine Tribulations Sword?"
"Instead, we want you to die!" The three of them smiled at the same time, looking calm and composed: "But taking over the Nine Tribulations Sword along the way can also be considered an unexpected gain. A big gain!"
Chu Yang sneered coldly, straightened his back, and proudly said, "It's a pity that you don't understand the Nine Tribulations Sword! You will never get it!" His eyes became resolute and determined.
He is now too weak to fight anymore!
This was the only sword with which he could unleash his full power, and when he first saw the sword technique, he knew he could perform it. But such a sword required his own life to activate!
It was the Nine Tribulations Sword Spirit that autonomously killed and destroyed everything!
The three kings were almost unable to defend themselves, and they were annihilated without even having time to scream. Even their king-level power's golden shadows were still flashing in the air, but their lives had already turned into nothingness!
Chu Yang sighed, floating in mid-air, and casually glanced to the side, only to find someone he thought should never be here. In the distance, a man in white stared at him in astonishment, his face filled with disbelief.
"Divine plan?" Chu Yang's eyes widened, finally understanding. That's why his secret actions were ambushed, and why all his attacks were accurately predicted and blocked!
It was him, the divine strategist Mo Tianji. No wonder I was defeated so miserably!
Chuyang's body slowly fell from the sky, gently falling down like a withered leaf in late autumn, landing in the dust with a faint but warm smile on his face, murmuring, "Qingwu, if there is an afterlife, I will accompany you in dancing across the world!"
Since death is inevitable, embrace it with the greatest passion and the strongest longing, for there lies your loved one!
Chapter 2
Meng Qi's secret delight was interrupted, his pride turned into embarrassment, and the gazes of the young novices like Zhen De were both surprised and disdainful, with a strong sense of wanting to distance themselves from the bad student. Only Zhen Hui, "Fang Aqi," stared blankly at the golden Buddha statue in front of him, looking as if his mind was wandering far away.
Subconsciously, Meng Qi half-turned his head to look at Xuan Zang beside him, wondering if he had noticed anything.
For him, embarrassment and frustration were minor issues; the real problem was exposing the fact that he had resurrected himself using someone else's body!
Xuanzang still had a bitter expression on his face, his eyes filled with despair. After feeling Meng Qi's gaze, he gently shook his head and said, "Namo Amitabha, everything will be based on Xuan Ku's decision." He didn't imply it, but said it directly.
Uh, he thought I was looking at him for mercy... Meng Qi secretly breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that he had passed this test. Unless the parents who abandoned this body, the uncle with the horse face, and others came looking for him, he shouldn't be exposed. If another ten or eight years passed, there would be even less suspicion, as childhood memories are easily forgotten.
Compared to this, getting into the Ministry of Miscellaneous Affairs is just a small matter!
Trying to play it off, Meng Qi made an effort to keep his expression as dull as Zhen Hui's, so as not to let Xuan Zang see through his actual lack of disappointment and sadness.
After asking the remaining children one by one, the wide-faced and big-eared Xuan Ku, along with Jia Mengqi and Zhen Hui, admitted six people into the Miscellaneous Service Institute, while the rest were assigned to the Martial Monk Institute.
He gently tapped his left palm with the ruler in his right hand, "Follow me to the miscellaneous courtyard to shave your head and receive your monk's robe and scriptures. In the future, work hard and diligently, and you will have the opportunity to enter the Bodhi and Dharma institutes to study advanced Buddhist scriptures and martial arts."
Is Dharma here too?
Meng Qi was stunned for a moment, but Xuan Ku didn't give him time to think, and directly walked through the children towards the outside of the hall.
Surrounded by strangers, Meng Qi didn't dare to ask too many questions and closely followed the two yellow-robed monks, Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang, as they turned into a nearby courtyard.
"You are not formally initiated, you just need to pay homage to the Buddha, shave your head, and leave your name," Xuan Ku pointed to the meditation cushion inside the small Buddha hall.
"Yes, Uncle Xuan Ku." The children all responded with Zhen De, and then one by one knelt on the cushion and bowed to the golden Buddha statue above.
After all the children had paid their respects to the Buddha, Xuan Ku put his hands together and solemnly bowed to the statue, reciting "Namo Amitabha Buddha." Then, he walked over to a child and gently placed his right hand on the child's head.
The child's black hair changed dramatically, turning into a withered yellow at a speed visible to the naked eye, falling to the ground like leaves. In less than two breaths, the child became a true little monk.
"Troubles fade away, and the world of mortals is left far behind," said Xuan Ku solemnly, his deep voice echoing in the quiet Buddhist hall.
"What kind of martial arts is this? It's amazing!"
Meng Qi was both shocked and excited, wondering if he would have the chance to learn such martial arts in the future?
Xuan Ku walked up to each child, removing their hair and repeating the same words throughout.
When it was Meng Qi's turn, he lowered his head, silently reciting the names of Buddha and Taoist ancestors, mourning the hair that was about to part from him.
A thick, broad palm gently stroked Meng Qi's head, and strands of withered hair fell in front of his eyes, filling him with sadness and making it difficult to control himself. He loved the secular world so much and had never thought of becoming a monk.
All troubles are gone, and the world of mortals is far away.
The deep and bitter voice was like a sudden strike of a chime, making Meng Qi shudder all over and his mind become clear.
After Ke Xuan left and Cheng Jing disappeared, Meng Qi's faith remained firm, and he was determined to return to secular life in the future!
After paying respects to the Buddha, having their heads shaved, and leaving their names on the monk's plate, Xuan Ku had several gray-robed monks take the children to the backyard to receive their belongings - two sets of gray monk robes, two pairs of shoes and socks, the "Shaolin Precepts," the "Twelve Morning Mantras," and so on.
"Once you have learned the characters in the 'Scripture Hall,' you can recite the rules and morning prayers of this temple. Before that, let me briefly explain the main rules of this temple: first, do not deceive the master and destroy the ancestors; second, do not allow unauthorized learning of martial arts; third, do not kill; fourth, do not drink alcohol; fifth, abstain from meat and spicy food; sixth, do not break the precepts of lust..." Master Xuan Ku repeated the main rules to be observed several times, and finally said solemnly, "Those who violate these rules will be punished lightly with scolding, or severely with the abolition of their martial arts and expulsion from the temple."
He only mentioned two of the punishments, the lightest and the heaviest, with others including hard labor, copying scriptures, flogging, and facing the wall.
After explaining these matters, he and Xuancang left the "Miscellaneous Items Institute" with the group of young novices.
"Within the temple, those wearing gray monk robes are ordinary monks, those wearing yellow robes are the administrative monks of each institute, and those wearing yellow robes with red kasayas are the abbots, heads of each institute, and elders..." Along the way, Xuan Ku tirelessly instilled "temple common sense" into the young novices, only becoming silent again when Zhen De and the others entered the "Martial Monks Institute."
The group strayed further and further, with green trees covering both inside and outside the yellow walls, few Buddhist temples were seen. After a while, Meng Qi finally saw an old and mottled courtyard.
"Oh dear, Junior Brother Xuan Ku, Senior Brother Xuan Zang, you've arrived so early?" A chubby monk at the door greeted them with a smile, also wearing a yellow robe, but with a slanted collar and a protruding belly.
Xuan Ku furrowed his brow and meticulously brought his hands together, saying, "Namo Amitabha Buddha, Brother Xuan Xin, how can you be so lazy?"
The fat monk Xuanxin was already familiar with Xuanku's temperament and didn't get angry at all. He said, "Oh, you are too attached to appearances. Is this for our disciples in the miscellaneous service department?" He didn't want to argue with Xuanku on this issue and directly pointed to Mengqi and the others.
"Please arrange it, Brother Xuan Xin," Xuan Ku replied seriously.
At this moment, Xuanzang, who had been working on the saw-mouthed gourd, suddenly spoke up: "Is Zhenying and Zhenguan still in the Miscellaneous Service Institute?"
"Still here, still here!" The fat monk Xuanxin said doubtfully, "Brother Xuancang, why are you asking them? Do you intend to take them as disciples?"
Xuanzang shook his head and sighed, "My martial arts have been destroyed, and I cannot mislead others, let alone accept disciples. Brother Xuanxin, please have them stay with Zhenying and Zhenguang in one room."
He was referring to Meng Qi and Zhen Hui.
Meng Qi's heart skipped a beat, as it was the first time Xuan Zang had taken the initiative to arrange something for him. Could it be that the two monks, Zhen Ying and Zhen Guan, had something special that could help him?
"Haha, Brother Xuancang, how dare I say 'troublesome' for the task you have ordered? Such a small matter, why bother like this?" Xuanxin agreed without hesitation.
Xuan Ku glanced at Xuan Zang and didn't say much, but instead spoke seriously to Meng Qi, Zhen Hui, and other young monks: "I arranged for you to be in the Miscellaneous Service Temple because each of you has your own issues. If you can find self-enlightenment and polish your mind, there may be opportunities for you to enter the Martial Monk Temple, Dharma Temple, or even the Bodhi Temple in the future."
"But if you continue to deceive and be lazy, indulge in pleasures, be restless, and cannot bear hardships, I will not conceal it, and I will report it to the disciplinary institute for appropriate punishment."
He openly expressed his thoughts, showing his honesty and lack of selfishness, causing the face of the person next to him, Xuan Xin, to turn slightly red.
"Yes, Uncle Xuan Ku," answered Meng Qi and the other young monks in unison.
After watching Xuan Ku and Xuan Zang leave, Xuan Xin twisted her body, making her fat jiggle up and down: "Finally, they're gone. I'm most afraid of seeing that iron-faced ghost."
This monk... Meng Qi pretended not to look and followed the swaying Xuan Xin into the meditation room.
"True Ying, True Guan, this is your junior brother True Ding, True Hui." After pointing to Meng Qi and True Hui, Xuan Xin turned around and led the other young monks to other meditation rooms.
Inside the Zen room, there was a bedspread that could accommodate seven or eight people to sleep, and there was nothing else.
On the bed, two gray-robed monks, one lying and one sitting, were both in their twenties. The one lying down had a dull expression and was silent, while the one sitting had furrowed brows and a cold tone: "Just put the luggage and packages under the bed. If you want to drink water, fetch it from the water tank in the courtyard." "May I ask how to address you, elder brother?"
Meng Qi glanced at the awkward Zhen Hui and decided to take the initiative to establish a good "roommate relationship" himself.
The seated person coldly said, "True View."
After answering, he stopped talking and even turned his head away from Meng Qi and Zhen Hui, leaving Meng Qi with no opportunity to develop a closer relationship through conversation.
As for Zhenying, she closed her eyes and continued to sleep.
What kind of people are these!
Meng Qi secretly cursed in his heart, but on the surface, he smiled at Zhen Hui and said, "Junior Brother Zhen Hui, I am Zhen Ding, you can just call me Senior Brother in the future."
"Yes, senior brother," Zhenhui called out without any difficulty.
This silly little guy is the best!
Meng Qi secretly sighed and decided to play the role of a senior brother and help Zhen Hui: "Little junior brother, eh, I'll just call you little junior brother, come, let's change into our monk robes first."
Although there were people in the house, Meng Qi, who often went shirtless in his dormitory during college, felt no discomfort. He quickly took off his clothes and changed into a monk's robe.
While quietly appreciating the simplicity of his monk's robe, which prevented him from looking awkward, he examined the items on his body that he had not had time to inspect earlier.
The robe on this body was finely woven and soft in texture, and even though Meng Qi was not an expert, he could tell that it was valuable. At the same time, there was a transparent jade pendant hanging from "his" waist, and a small jade Buddha pendant tied with a red string around his neck, close to his chest, cool and comfortable.
Meng Qi carefully played with the thumb-sized jade Buddha, noticing its compassionate expression and lifelike appearance, which clearly demonstrated extraordinary craftsmanship. At the same time, it had a delicate and smooth texture, both warm and cool to the touch.
As Uncle Horseface said, this jade Buddha was given by some unknown old monk? But since the Marquis didn't take it away, it's probably not an ordinary item, so it's better to wear it close to the body.
Meng Qi hung the jade Buddha pendant back on his chest, close to his body, and then packed up the jade ornaments, clothes, and other items, placing them under the bunk he had chosen.
At this moment, Zhen Ying, who had been sleeping soundly, suddenly sat up, quickly put on his shoes and went out, leaving Meng Qi puzzled and wondering what had happened.
"It's time for dinner," said Zhen Guan coldly, as he got off the bunk and walked towards the door.
Who are these two people?!
Meng Qi cursed under his breath again, then turned to Zhen Hui and said, "Little junior brother, are you done? It's time for dinner!"
"Alright!" As soon as Zhenhui's words fell, the small figure darted to the door like a rabbit, seemingly starving and unable to bear it any longer.
"..." Meng Qi suddenly felt embarrassed; was he the only relatively normal one here?
Zhenhui suddenly stopped at the door, turned back to look at Meng Qi, with a puzzled face: "Senior brother, aren't you going?"
At least you have some conscience and know to wait for me!
Meng Qi thought to himself, then replied half-jokingly, "I'm not as hungry as you guys yet."
Look at you all, like hungry ghosts reincarnated!
He turned and started running.
Hey! After a few flutters, he shouted loudly, "Hey, junior brother, wait for me!"
Suddenly, a wave of sadness swept over him; others had younger female apprentices, but why did he only have younger male apprentices, and it seemed that there would be no female apprentices in the foreseeable future.
In the pouring rain, a beautiful woman in her late twenties, accompanied by a little boy aged five or six, knelt in front of the iron gate of a luxurious villa.
The woman, named Zhao Meiling, came from a remote small mountain village. Six years ago, she was admitted to college with dreams and hopes, but she never expected to meet a man who would change her life. This man was the famous playboy of Beitang City, Li Zhe!
At that time, Zhao Meiling and Li Zhe were in the same school. After an accident, she caught Li Zhe's eye, and he began to pursue her relentlessly, using every trick in the book and stopping at nothing.
Zhao Meiling was just a simple and innocent girl who had just come to the city, and she was no match for such a love expert. She not only gave her body but also her heart completely to him. However, after Li Zhe got tired of her, he cruelly abandoned her.
Later on, Zhao Meiling found out that she was pregnant. She wanted to give birth to the child, even at the cost of falling out with her family.
After giving birth to her child, Zhao Meiling originally planned to raise him on her own. However, five years later, due to excessive physical exhaustion, she developed a terminal illness and had only a few years left to live. In the end, she decided to send her child to Li's family, hoping that he could experience a father's love and have a better life, so that she could rest in peace after her death.
But this was coldly rejected by the Li family, who completely denied that the child was theirs. Zhao Meiling could only kneel in front of the iron gate with her child, begging bitterly.
At this moment, the iron gate slowly opened, and several people walked out holding umbrellas. The man leading the group looked somewhat similar to the little boy; he was the boy's father, Li Zhe.
"Here! Stinky woman, this money should be enough for you to live well," Li Zhe frowned and handed Zhao Meiling a check.
Zhao Meiling shook her head, looked up at Li Zhe, and said, "Zhe! You must keep Fu'er, he is your son!"
Li Zhe refused outright, then said coldly, "Do you want this money or not?"
Upon hearing this, Zhao Meiling's tears fell like rain, and she shook her head.
Seeing this, Li Zhe snorted coldly, threw the check in his hand at Zhao Meiling, and was about to turn around and leave.
Kneeling on the ground, Zhao Meiling suddenly hugged Li Zhe's thigh and pleaded bitterly, "Zhe!"
"Bang!"
Before Zhao Meiling could finish speaking, Li Zhe slapped her heavily on the face, "Let go! You stinking woman."
The little boy next to her saw his mother being beaten and quickly ran over to hug Li Zhe's thigh, shouting with childish innocence, "Daddy! Don't hit Mommy."
In fact, the little boy didn't know who his father was since birth, and his mother never mentioned it. It wasn't until this time when Zhao Meiling showed the boy a picture of Li Zhe that he realized he had a father, and he was so happy that he almost jumped for joy.
But now, he doesn't understand why his dad doesn't want his mom and even hits her.
Li Zhe looked at the little boy hugging his thigh with disgust and kicked him away, saying, "Who is your father, you bastard!"
The little boy was kicked and sent flying, falling to the ground and curling up in pain, clutching his stomach. The pain was far beyond what a five-year-old could bear, and he couldn't help but let large tears roll down from his eyes.
Zhao Meiling was also shocked and quickly let go of Li Zhe, ran over to pick up the little boy, and asked anxiously and concerned, "Fu'er, are you okay?"
The little boy looked at his mother's worried face, pursed his lips, held back his tears, and shook his little head.
Li Zhe didn't even glance at the mother and son as he walked through the iron gate. A man with graying hair, who looked like a housekeeper, picked up the check and handed it to Zhao Meiling, sympathetically advising, "You should take this!"
Zhao Meiling shook her head, holding the little boy, and slowly disappeared into the rain curtain.
The butler watched the mother and child's retreating figures, sighed deeply, turned and walked back into the house, slowly closing the iron door behind him.
Four years later! Before her death, Zhao Meiling called the now nine-year-old boy, who had grown up a lot, to her bedside, gently rubbed his head, and said weakly with a smile, "Fu'er, you must study hard in the future, have a good job, and don't resent the Li family or your father. Promise me, okay?"
The little boy held back his tears and nodded seriously.
Watching the little boy nod his head earnestly in agreement, Zhao Meiling's face wore a peaceful smile as she slowly closed her eyes forever.
At two in the morning, a bright moon hung high in the sky, casting its brilliant light upon the earth and making the surroundings not dark.
"Boom!"
Suddenly, a deafening noise came from the sky. Startled, Zhao Fu looked up and saw the entire sky seemingly ablaze, turning into a vast sea of fire. Countless objects emitting colorful lights and trailing long tails, like meteors, fell from the sky.
"Bang!"
With a loud bang, a meteor emitting a colorful glow fell in front of Zhao Fu, the dazzling light causing him to shield his eyes with his hand. After the bright light dissipated, a crystal stone about one inch long and two inches thick floated quietly in the air, two meters above the ground.
Curious, Zhao Fu walked up and grabbed the crystal, which floated in mid-air without any reaction as he held it.
At this point, people who were originally sound asleep were awakened by a series of loud noises, opened their doors or windows, and saw countless crystals floating in mid-air. They began to rush out of their houses frantically, grabbing these crystals. Zhao Fu did not stay in place for long and hurried back to his own home.
In a rented single room, Zhao Fu carefully examined the crystal. If judged solely by appearance, no gemstone could compare to this crystal. If it were rare, its value would be priceless. However, the key issue was that too many of these crystals had fallen from the sky, at least several billion in number, so the crystal might not be worth anything at all.
"Detecting host as a primary intelligent being, initiating soul binding..."
Ding! Soul binding successful, beginning the journey to the Apocalypse World.
After hearing the sound, Zhao Fu's eyes went black and he fainted on the ground. "Hong Dali, male, 22 years old, orphan, died bravely saving two children who were about to be hit by a car. After research and decision by relevant departments, Hong Dali was posthumously awarded the title of hero and outstanding college student in the province."
"No, no, no, I don't want to go with you to the Hong family to arrange a marriage!" Tang Muxin buried her head in the pillow, kicking her fair little legs desperately. "Hong Dali is a well-known waste in the whole city, he has lost face for the Hong family, and he is not only sick and crooked, but also a standard prodigal son. I don't want to find such a person as my fiancé!"
Tang Muxin, the only beloved daughter of Tang Ruisi, the chairman of Tangshi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., is not only talented, knowledgeable about ancient and modern times, but also beautiful and elegant, with the essence of heaven and earth. She is especially good at cooking, a standard lady who can handle both the hall and the kitchen, and the bed. She is the dream lover of countless male students at school.
Today, however, she heard her father say that he was going to take him to the notoriously extravagant Hong Dalì's house to arrange a marriage, and she couldn't bear it: "If it weren't for his parents spoiling her, the only child of a thousand acres, this kind of waste would have been driven out of the Hong family to fend for themselves long ago, where would there be a chance to be so extravagant all day long?"
After hearing his daughter's words, Tang Ruisi, who was sitting on the bed, showed a bitter smile on his face and said helplessly, "Xinxin, I have no choice."
Your marriage to Hong Dali was personally arranged by your grandfather back then. Although he may have been a bit of a spendthrift, it's not really a big issue, is it?
Tang Ruisi wore a blue-gray vest with a spotless white shirt underneath, a simple bow tie at the collar, a faint stubble on his lips, and an ancient bronze pipe in his hand. His short black hair was meticulously combed back, shiny and sleek. His overall appearance was quite impressive, but his once bright eyes were now filled with helplessness and unwillingness.
Speaking of which, if he wasn't really driven to desperation, how could he be willing to send out his own biological daughter? After all, that Hong Dali could be described as a unique character in the world, and the only thing he liked to do or could do was two words: squandering wealth.
His most famous quote is: "I must squander my family's fortune, otherwise wouldn't I be wasting my parents' talent for making money?"
This sentence can be considered a well-known joke throughout the city, and many parents use it to educate their children: "If you dare to learn from Hong Dali, that prodigal son, I'll break your legs!"
So, it is indeed reasonable for Tang Muxin to have such a strong reaction.
"Well, that's true..." Tang Ruisi frowned and thought for a moment, then suddenly his eyes lit up and said, "Xinxin, how about this? We get engaged first, and when my father's company recovers, we can find an excuse to break off the engagement. This time, our research funding exceeded the budget, but once the funding catches up and the project is successful, it will definitely be a world-shaking event. When we catch our breath, we can find a way to break off the engagement, and their family shouldn't have anything to say about it, right?"
Tang Muxin sobbed, "It's easy to set a marriage but difficult to cancel it. His family is one of the top 500 companies in the world, how can it be so easy?"
It must be said that Tang Muxin is a very smart girl.
If her family falls, her fate will definitely not be good. That's how the world works, survival of the fittest. When you're strong, no one dares to touch you, but when you're truly down and out, there will be no shortage of people coming to kick you while you're down.
For example, the young master of the Liu family who had always been pestering her at school.
So Tang Muxin cried for a while longer, but in the end, she knew that there was no other way besides this method. Reluctantly, she got up and said, "Well, let's give it a try first. Dad, you must remember to cancel the marriage in the future. I don't want to marry that spendthrift!"
"Alright, for the sake of my dear Xin Xin, I will do my best to manage," Tang Rui sighed, patted Tang Mu Xin's shoulder, and said, "Xin Xin, let's go."
Hong Dalì sat on the bed, his eyes blank, and his mind in a mess.
The surrounding environment was unfamiliar, and there were significant problems with his memory. Now, he could only barely recall the sharp sound of brakes, and the rest were some messy memories that didn't belong to him.
"I thought I was dead, so where am I?" Looking at his pale, slender hands, Hong Dali thought to himself: "This is not my body, and this is not the place where I usually live. So, where is this?"
He looked around for a while and thought, "The most urgent task is to figure out the current situation."
"One, am I dead or alive right now? Two, where am I and who am I? Three, what should I do next?"
"So let's start with the first point," Hong Dali pinched a small piece of oily skin on the back of his left hand, rubbed it, and felt pain: "There is a feeling of pain, so I should still be alive." He carefully touched his face, neck, ears, and head: "This body is obviously not the one I had before, but it is still within the scope of being human."
"So, the second question is, where is this place and who am I?" Hong Dali looked around again at the reinforced concrete building structure, the snow-white walls, various modern household appliances, and even a computer with a 30-inch LCD screen in the corner of the room: "It's definitely modern society, but I've never seen the celebrities on the surrounding walls, and I've never heard of the various toy models. So, is this world the legendary parallel space?"
With no one around, Hong Dali carefully stood up and took a deep breath: "This body is really weak, thin like a bamboo pole, I don't know if it will suddenly die at any moment."
Upon turning on the computer, Hong Dali casually opened a few websites, and the content displayed was quite different from that on Earth. However, at least he figured out a few things: "First, the writing in this world or country is still Chinese characters. Second, it is indeed a parallel space, with many things different from Earth, but not too dissimilar.
"No ID card?" After thinking for a moment, he quickly understood: "Haha, looking at the age of this body, it should be around 17 or 18 years old. It's possible that an ID card has been applied for, but it's more likely that it hasn't been issued yet. After all, this world is different from Earth, and some minor differences are considered normal."
"Big spender system binding successful, current level: Level 1."
As the system voice finished its introduction, a small figure suddenly appeared in Hong Dali's mind, which seemed to be himself.
Host Name: Hong Dalì.
Performance ability: 32. Note: The normal index for each person is 100.
Hong Dalì stared in disbelief: "A big spender system? Is this thing real or fake?
Fortunately, there is always a way out. Just as Hong Dali was hating himself and wanting to commit suicide, the metallic voice of the system came again: "Description: The host can obtain one attribute point for every 100,000 yuan (RMB) spent."
Once the host's attributes reach the level of a normal person, the prodigal system will be upgraded, and new items and props will be added. Please look forward to it."
"Can I gain attribute points?" At this moment, there was nothing better than being able to improve one's attributes. Hong Dali was all smiles when he heard this, "Can I really gain attribute points through spending money and become like a normal person?"
Although the system's voice was still cold, it sounded like a song in the ears at this moment: "Yes, it is possible."
Hong Dali was so excited that he almost jumped up: "I want to splurge! I want to ruin my family!"
Next, the host is asked to take on the first task: the first time to overspend. Task requirement: spend at least 100,000 yuan before midnight tonight.
Current money wasted: 0.
"Damn, it's already 8 pm! Only four hours left, I can't take it, I need to go out! I need to go shopping!"
Just as he was thinking this, the door to the room was gently pushed open, and a maid in her forties bowed slightly to Hong Dali, softly saying, "Young Master Dali, the Master and Madam would like you to come over, please follow me."
"Can you buy me a game cabin?" Jiang Fei asked his dad with great anticipation.
"Xiao Fei, now that you're in high school, you can't be as addicted to games as you were before!"
"Mom! This game is different! It's a masterpiece that Shengshi Company has carefully crafted for thirteen years, known as the second world of mankind!"
The game called "Dawn" mentioned by Jiang Fei is indeed another innovation in human history. It is not only a model of virtual reality games with a nearly 100% realistic degree, but also allows players to experience a completely different life through a new technology during eight hours of sleep at night. Through this technology, the human body enjoys eight hours of high-quality sleep physiologically, but mentally, it can experience a 24-hour completely different magical career!
"This game is being promoted by the country! It's not a scam, and not only will it not affect learning, but it will also help people rest better!"
Jiang Fei is still persisting!
"I'm saying it for the last time, no! If you don't go back to your room and do your homework within twenty seconds, your allowance for next month will be cut by fifty percent!" Dad said with a stern face.
"Stubborn old man!"
Jiang Fei muttered in a low voice, but he knew there was no point in discussing it further. His family was well-off, and his father definitely could afford the game cabin; it was just that his father was stubborn and didn't believe that playing games wouldn't affect his studies. "Fei Ge, how about it? Tonight, 'Dawn' will officially open its server. Have you prepared your game cabin?"
As soon as the class bell rang and the teacher left, a chubby kid behind Jiang Fei leaned on his shoulder and asked.
"Don't mention it, I won't be able to join you guys this time!" Jiang Fei said with a bitter smile.
The brothers are all counting on you!
The chubby Zhao Feng anxiously said, this chubby boy was one of the few friends Jiang Fei had in school. Jiang Fei's class, Senior One Class Nine, was a key class in the school. However, Jiang Fei's academic performance was average, neither good nor bad, and he was not good at sports or interpersonal communication, so he was definitely a standard invisible person.
"What can I do if my dad doesn't agree?" Jiang Fei rolled his eyes, but he had no secrets from this only friend.
"How about we all chip in and buy you one?" said Zhao Feng, who had a similar situation to Jiang Fei, both being unremarkable in every aspect. As a result, the two unnoticed "invisible" people had a great relationship with each other.
Jiang Fei comforted himself.
"I hope so!"
Zhao Feng nodded.
Jiang Fei has loved playing games since he was a child, especially these realistic games. As a boy, who doesn't want to wield a sword and become a hero? It is every man's dream to carry a three-foot sword and achieve great deeds. However, in this peaceful era and highly developed technological society, there are no wars, and even if there were, it would only involve pressing buttons. So, if one wants to enjoy the passion of battle, they can only experience it in virtual games!
But this time, Jiang Fei had no hope. Since entering high school, Jiang Fei's father had issued a ban on entertainment, all gaming equipment at home was sealed, and online games were out of the question!
Finally, when school was over, Jiang Fei walked home listlessly. Although it was only around six o'clock in the evening, it was already dark because it was winter.
Thinking that today was the day when "Dawn" was launched, Jiang Fei locked himself in his room in a fit of anger! Around ten o'clock, Jiang Fei finished his homework, lying on his bed and looking at the wall clock as it slowly approached ten o'clock, feeling a bit uneasy in his heart.
The opening time of "Dawn" is tonight at ten o'clock, and then it runs for eight hours every day from ten o'clock to six o'clock the next morning, without affecting the players' normal life and allowing them to fully experience the 24-hour game time! "Ah! Such a great game and I don't have a share in it!"
Jiang Fei muttered to himself while unconsciously rubbing the ring on his index finger with his hand.
"What the hell is this?"
Jiang Fei's mouth was wide open, looking at the faintly glowing ring in his hand, he was so scared that he couldn't speak!
"Buzz!"
A flash of white light passed by, and Jiang Fei's vision blurred. When his sight cleared again, he was no longer in his own room!
"Ding! Welcome to the world of 'Dawn'! Novice Assistant No. 34784 at your service!"
A crisp female voice entered Jiang Fei's ears!
"Dawn? Is this the login screen for Dawn?"
"More precisely, this is the character creation interface!" the novice assistant replied.
Jiang Fei still found it hard to imagine how he could possibly enter the game without having a game cabin.
Perhaps this is my own dream! Maybe I was too tired after finishing my homework, so I fell asleep in bed, and even the mysterious ring incident just now might be part of the dream. Daydreaming and night dreaming, maybe I just want to play this game too much! Chapter One.
"Fraud! Big fraud!"
An angry shout followed by the sound of footsteps fleeing across the cobblestone ground.
Zhang Xuan helplessly stretched out his hands: "I'm really not a liar, I'm a teacher at the academy... I just want you to be my student! And, even if you say I'm a liar, why add the word 'big'?"
After finishing the mutter, Zhang Xuan remembered what the director of political education had said and rubbed his brow: "This is the seventeenth one! If I can't recruit a single student today, I can pack up and go home tomorrow!"
Zhang Xuan was not originally from this world, but rather an ordinary university library administrator on Earth. He only remembered a raging fire, and then... there was no "then." When he woke up again, he found himself in this new world.
As described in the novel, martial arts are highly respected, and strength is king!
I thought I could cross over to a useless person, suffer a divorce, and then fight back and sing all the way... It seems I thought too much. When I got here, I found out that I was not a student, but... a teacher!
The most unfortunate teacher in the entire school!
Other people's classrooms were always packed, with no room to sit, while his classroom had no one. He struggled to bring in a few students, but in the end, they all cursed him as a "fraud" and ran away!
The reason for this is that the person whose soul was pierced by his own was not only the weakest among the teachers, but also had extremely poor vision, unable to see anything clearly, and most importantly... he taught incorrectly, leading to a case of deviation!
This was as damaging to his reputation as a hospital death, and he was despised by everyone. Even the new students kept their distance, fearing that if they fell into his hands, they would be taught to the point of being half-dead!
With no students and facing criticism, the entire college ranked last in last year's teacher evaluation, even receiving the only zero score in history.
In despair, he drowned his sorrows in alcohol, and as he wished, he passed away and managed to travel through time.
At the beginning of the new semester, the college issued an ultimatum: if he could not enroll a single student in his class this year, his teaching qualifications would be revoked!
Today, seventeen new students have passed by his classroom, and as a result, upon hearing his name, they all ran away without exception, as if a little girl had encountered a strange uncle, running as fast as they could.
"It seems that we must find a way to deceive someone!"
As she was thinking about how to approach someone, she saw a girl with a cute and innocent face peeking her head through the door.
"Excuse me, is this Professor Lu Xun's classroom?"
Sweet voice, cute, delicate appearance, and charming.
Professor Lu Xun, the star teacher of the academy, always had a full classroom, attracting countless people who admired his reputation.
"That's her!" Seeing someone walk into the trap, Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up.
Recalling various pretentious routines from his past life, he quietly sat in his seat and assumed the posture of a worldly-wise expert: "You want to take him as your master?"
The girl nodded like a sparrow, her black eyes full of admiration: "I heard that Teacher Lu Xun is the most powerful teacher in Hongtian Academy, and his students are all extraordinary in strength. Everyone is proud to join his class!"
"No matter how well he teaches, if it doesn't match your cultivation theory, not only will you not make progress, but you might even regress! If the teacher is not famous but their theory matches yours, you can still make rapid progress and greatly improve your cultivation!"
"Is that so... I've heard similar words from my brother too!" The girl paused, her beautiful eyes somewhat confused: "However, I don't know what kind of classroom I'm suited for!"
Seeing her take the bait, Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up. He hesitated for a moment, with the images of Marx, Engels, and other great thinkers flashing through his mind, and put on a troubled expression: "Meeting is fate. Well, I am also a teacher at this academy. I can help you check your aptitude, talent, and disposition for free, and recommend a suitable teacher for you!" "Thank you, sir!"
Unexpectedly, the teacher they encountered was so righteous, and the girl excitedly nodded her head.
"Show me your cultivation first!"
Zhang Xuan's eyes were half-open and half-closed, seemingly not caring at all.
Yes!
Hahaha!
In a short time, the room was filled with the whistling of fists, and streaks of energy swirled around the girl like a wandering dragon. Her aura was condensed but not dispersed, powerful but not ostentatious, indicating that she had an excellent foundation.
"Alright, I can see that you practice diligently and seriously, have a solid foundation, and possess exceptional talent; you are a rare genius!" After finishing a set of punches, Zhang Xuan nodded in satisfaction.
He learned this from fortune-tellers on Earth, speaking in a vague and broad manner, making it difficult for people to detect any errors and instead secretly admiring its accuracy.
"Teacher, I've been injured in my leg, and the doctor said it's basically useless now..." The girl interrupted his endless chatter, with some confusion in her eyes.
"Being injured..." Zhang Xuan's old face blushed, but with his thick skin, others couldn't tell, and he continued to talk nonsense: "Do you think I didn't notice? When you exerted your strength just now, I knew it! The reason I said that is because... without breaking, there can be no building!"
Anyway, it's all about deception; if you can bluff, just bluff, and first deceive a disciple to come over.
"Chance? Teacher, what kind of chance?" The girl's eyes lit up.
After injuring her leg, she always felt inferior to others and developed a sense of inferiority, but she never expected that she might turn misfortune into a blessing.
"This opportunity could allow you to soar to great heights and become the best among the newcomers. After all, your talent is already exceptional, a peerless genius that is unparalleled throughout the ages. However..." Zhang Xuanhai spoke continuously, almost as if he was about to present a book on the "Tathagata Palm."
Upon hearing that she could become the top freshman and being praised as a genius, the girl couldn't help but show excitement on her face and quickly asked, "But, what?"
"However..." Zhang Xuan sighed, lamenting as if a talented person was about to be buried: "There aren't many teachers in the entire academy who can see this kind of opportunity!"
"Not accepting students?" The girl, who had high hopes, looked slightly dimmed when she heard this, but then suddenly jumped up as if she understood something: "If they don't accept students, then teacher, do you... accept?"
"Of course, I still accept, it's just that, as you can see, I'm indifferent to fame and fortune, and I don't have that much time!"
Puff!
Before she could finish speaking, the girl fell to the ground and said, "I know you are a noble person, please accept me as your disciple! I will practice diligently and not disgrace my teacher's reputation!"
"The student promises not to disturb the teacher unless absolutely necessary!" Seeing his reluctance, the girl quickly nodded, her face sincere.
"I don't have many students, and I might not have as many resources as other teachers, and I might even be criticized by others..." Zhang Xuan continued.
"I see... I heard that refining resources is important..." the girl hesitated for a moment.
Teachers receive resources at the academy based on various factors such as student performance and numbers; if resources are insufficient, it will be difficult for them to make progress in their training.
"Cough cough, I said that on purpose to test you. Since you are determined and sincere in acknowledging me as your teacher, I will reluctantly accept you!" Seeing her hesitation, Zhang Xuan immediately interrupted and hurriedly said, "Let's verify the identity!"
"This... this fast?"
Unexpectedly, the teacher's change of face was as fast as flipping through a book, leaving the girl slightly taken aback. She took the token representing her identity from Zhang Xuan and was considering whether or not to verify it when the previously calm and composed Teacher Zhang had already pulled her hand, took out a sharp knife, and gently made a cut, causing a drop of blood to fall onto the jade token.
Buzz!
The light sparkles.
The girl daydreams.
Didn't the teacher just say that they were going to consider being indifferent to fame and fortune? How come they acted so quickly, and even... had the knife ready?
"From now on, you are my student!" After the blood oath, Zhang Xuan finally relaxed and resumed his master's demeanor: "What is your name?"
"Reporting to the teacher, my name is Wang Ying!"
Knowing that it couldn't be changed, the girl didn't say anything more and just nodded her head with a cute expression.
"Well, take your ID card, go get your bedding and books, and find your own place to stay! Classes start officially tomorrow, just come here and find me!"
Zhang Xuan waved her hand.
"Yes!" Wang Ying nodded, turned around, and left.
"Successfully fooled another one!"
Seeing her become his student, Zhang Xuan finally breathed a sigh of relief and smiled slightly.
It wasn't easy; if it weren't for the many pretentious techniques I've seen on the internet, I might not have succeeded today.
With one student, Zhang Xuan was able to avoid being expelled, and his mood relaxed. He suddenly felt that his whole spirit was much smoother, and the lingering obsession from his previous life in his mind was slowly disappearing.
"Don't worry, since I've crossed over into your life, I'll live well on your behalf!"
Previously, Zhang Xuan died due to not being able to recruit students, feeling much regret. At this moment, having gained students, his last persistence disappeared without a trace. It was not until this moment that Zhang Xuan fully mastered this body.
Boom!
Having gained complete control of his body, Zhang Xuan was planning to deceive a few more students when he suddenly felt a tremor in his mind and a loud sound like a grand bell rang out.
Boom!
Various mysterious languages made him feel dizzy, and then a huge palace appeared in his mind, with five big characters shining on it.
Tiandao Library!
Pushing the door open, countless bookshelves stood tall, filled with endless varieties of books, stretching as far as the eye could see.
"Library? Damn, I was a librarian in my previous life, I hope it won't be the same in this world!"
Others received amazing gift packages from either the system or their grandfathers, filled with incredibly powerful items, while he was just a library. Zhang Xuan felt his vision go black and almost fainted from the unfairness.
A library? What for? In the future, when people throw swords in a fight, will I throw books?
"What kind of books are these?"
Feeling helpless, Zhang Xuan reached out to grab a book from the shelf, wanting to see what use this library had. However, as soon as he grabbed, he found that his palm passed directly through the shelf, grabbing nothing.
"Are you kidding me? You give me a library, but I can't get any books, can't read anything, what's the point?"
Zhang Xuan was speechless and wanted to cry but had no tears.
Chapter 1
Hey, where's my tattoo?
Zhao Yu pulled up his sleeves and looked at his two fair-skinned arms in surprise. Before, his arms had been adorned with two ferocious, powerful green dragons baring their teeth and claws!
How... is everything gone?
Zhao Yu looked up and found himself sitting in a brightly lit office, surrounded by small office partitions on all sides.
At this moment, the phone keeps ringing non-stop, paper files are flying everywhere, and more than a dozen office staff are rushing around the hall, all looking frazzled and overwhelmed.
At this moment, a middle-aged man wearing a brown jacket quickly approached and greeted the crowd, "Team leader Qu Ping will now give everyone a briefing on the electric baton rape case. We will take action tonight, so please listen carefully!"
Someone quickly pulled over a whiteboard, which was filled with writing and had several photos attached to it.
Upon hearing the call, numerous staff members quickly gathered around, casually grabbing chairs and sitting in front of the whiteboard to listen attentively.
Zhao Yu did not move and remained seated in her own seat.
At this moment, he was still in great shock, as he touched his right ear and found it to be completely intact! Previously, his right ear had been split in half during a fight with a thug.
Zhao Yu wanted to find a mirror to look at his face, but suddenly saw a photo on the desk. In the photo was a young and handsome man in a police uniform, who looked exactly like himself!
Good heavens! In great shock, waves of unfamiliar memories flooded into his mind like a raging river. It was then that Zhao Yu gradually realized that he had encountered the legendary - time travel!
Zhao Yu clearly remembered that he was originally a top-notch fighter of the Qinglong Gang, a fearless and domineering ruffian king! Although his real name was also Zhao Yu, people in the underworld preferred to call him Zhao Tianba!
Oh my goodness!
Zhao Yu was shocked again, as he finally remembered that before this, he had already been executed by lethal injection!
But as I was thinking... how did I end up here?
Could it be... I've really traveled through time!?
And it was seamlessly connected, without any need for reincarnation?
As new memories flooded in, he was astonished to discover that this was a parallel world similar to the one before, and his current identity was that of a detective in the mobile unit of the major case squad - he was actually a police officer!
The large room he was in now was none other than the police station's office!
Zhao Yu couldn't believe his eyes; the huge contrast was unimaginable. A senior rascal had transformed into a serious crime investigator - how could this be explained?
He subconsciously touched his head; in the past, due to several cuts on his scalp, his hair could never grow evenly, so he simply kept a bald head, looking like a fierce and evil spirit. But now, he had a head of flowing black hair, completely resembling a handsome young man.
"Dear colleagues, since the 12th of this month, there have been three cases of electric baton rape in our city..." At this moment, a short-haired, big-eyed female detective was recounting the case to everyone.
Zhao Yu quickly found the information of this investigator from his memory. She was the team leader of the B team in the major case squad. Despite her young age, she had a steady style, a high case-solving rate, and was a favorite in front of the leaders. Generally, any major cases that required the cooperation of the whole team would be presided over by her.
"The victims were all young women dressed in fancy clothes and had questionable lifestyles," said team leader Qu Ping. "The crime scenes were mostly near bars, karaoke halls, and other places of ill repute, and the crimes occurred after midnight."
According to the victim's statement, the perpetrator first followed the victim into a deserted alley, then stunned them with an electric baton, and proceeded to commit rape. After the crime, the perpetrator would also urinate on the victim's body.
Upon hearing the words "peeing," the scene fell silent.
Zhao Yu glanced at the man, who was Liu Changhu, the deputy captain of the mobile team of the major case unit. During Zhao Yu's internship, this man often assigned tasks to Zhao Yu, making him deliver letters and pour tea every day, treating him like a servant.
In this world, Zhao Yu is not a rogue king, but a weak-willed young man who has just finished his probationary period and become a formal police officer. Not only Liu Changhu, but many experienced colleagues would tease him and assign him tasks that should not belong to him.
Now, Zhao Yu was not a pushover anymore; how could he tolerate being yelled at? He slammed the table and stood up abruptly.
His sudden standing up startled Liu Changhu, and even Group Leader Qu Ping had to pause for a moment.
Who would have thought that just as everyone was looking at Zhao Yu, a silver bell-like female voice suddenly cut in front of her. A girl with a ponytail, slightly plump body, and large glasses appeared in front of everyone.
The girl was a new intern clerk assigned to the serious crime team, named Li Beini. This girl was infatuated and had only been in contact for less than a month when she became smitten with Zhao Yu.
Although Zhao Yu had a weak personality and was often bullied, he was actually very handsome, with a height of 1.78 meters, a graceful appearance, and a youthful charm, which indeed had a certain appeal to the opposite sex.
At this moment, seeing her loved one being yelled at, Li Beini hurriedly stepped forward to help: "Captain Liu, let me do it, let me do it! I'm still in my internship period, so it's natural for me to do these tasks!"
After saying that, Li Beini gave Zhao Yu a knowing smile and ran to the tea room in the hall to make coffee.
Zhao Yu couldn't get angry, so he had to patiently sit down and continue pondering his own time-travel problem. Although he had traveled through time, his memory was very clear, because just a few minutes ago he was still lying on the execution chair. In his previous life, he was sentenced to death for the crime of murder.
However, Zhao Yu knew in his heart that he was framed and did not commit murder at all! The person who was killed was a real estate group boss, and Zhao Yu had only beaten him up according to his superior's instructions, which could not have been fatal.
Moreover, even if he really did beat someone to death, it would be manslaughter, not murder! Therefore, his death sentence is the result of someone else's conspiracy!
Thinking of these, Zhao Yu couldn't help but be filled with anger, clenching his fists so hard that they cracked. If he could find the people who framed him in the future, he would make them pay double!
At this point, Libeni had already brewed the coffee and distributed a cup to each of her colleagues present. The young girl's face was filled with enthusiasm, and she would offer friendly encouragement like "hard work" and "keep going" with each cup she handed out, winning the affection of her colleagues.
"Officer Zhao, this cup has two packs of sugar! We're destined to stay up all night tonight, so you have to hang in there!"
Before Zhao Yu could react, Li Beini happily went to put the plates away.
At this point, Team Leader Qu Ping had finished explaining the case, and it was time for Captain Jin Zhenbang, the head of the Major Crimes Unit, to speak. Captain Jin was over 50 years old, with white hair at his temples, and was a very serious and meticulous old gentleman who rarely joked or laughed.
Captain Jin said emphatically, "There have already been three cases of electric baton attacks, and if there's one more, it will be classified as a serial event. Not only will the higher-ups be concerned, but we won't be able to handle the pressure of this big case!"
So, let's all pull ourselves together and strive to solve this case in the shortest possible time! "In this way... Team A will be sent to investigate the crime scene. Since the perpetrator followed the victim to commit the crime, he must have appeared in the bar or karaoke hall where the victim was before. Retrieve all the surveillance footage from there and find this person!
Yes!
"Team B, you are mainly responsible for evidence comparison!" Captain Jin ordered, "The suspect has no criminal record, so the bloodline is not useful. However, the suspect's urine is an important clue. Although the police station cannot find a match, you can go to the hospital or physical examination center to check and compare. As long as this person has had a physical examination or has been hospitalized, you will definitely be able to find him!"
Yes!
"Furthermore, the clues such as the electric baton used by the criminal, the mobile phone signal at the scene, and the only victim who saw the criminal's face cannot be ignored; all of them need to be followed up!"
Yes!
"Alright, each team should arrange their action plan, and if there are no issues, set off as soon as possible!" Captain Jin said, closing his folder and looking ready to turn and leave.
"Wait, I... I have a question!"
Everyone turned around and saw that the person speaking was none other than Zhao Yu.
Captain Jin was also taken aback and quickly asked, "What's wrong, Zhao Yu? Do you have any questions?"
Pointing to her forehead, Zhao Yu said confidently, "I'm not feeling well, I'm going home first, you guys have fun on your own!"
Chapter 1
21st century, Director's Office of Donghai City Senior Private Hospital.
With a "bang," a thick medical record was slammed onto the table. Director Lin's face was livid with anger, "Han Yunxi, Mr. Li is one of the directors of Lingyun Group, and he owns 40% of our hospital's shares. You must prioritize his detoxification!"
Facing the dean's furious anger, Han Yunxi calmly put her hands in the pockets of her white coat and said, "Dean Lin, I'm sorry, but Mr. Li has been poisoned with chronic snake venom. It's not an emergency, and I don't allow queue-jumping in this situation."
She is pure and beautiful, with big eyes and small dimples. At a young age, she is famous in the Chinese medicine field for her amazing acupuncture skills. She is a rare detoxification expert, dealing with animal toxins, plant toxins, chemical toxins, and internal toxins, all of which are her strengths.
"Get it straight, this is Lingyun!" The dean angrily slammed the table and stood up.
"Enough, don't tell me that everyone is equal in front of a doctor, with only gender differences. Han Yunxi, I'm telling you, arrange for detoxification immediately, or else, from today on, get out of the medical field!"
It was thought that Han Yunxi would be afraid, but she remained calm and composed, with a serious attitude. "President Lin, in front of me, there is no distinction between men and women, only two kinds of people: those I want to save and those I don't want to save. I won't save Mr. Li, please find someone else!"
After she finished speaking, she smiled politely, turned around and walked away, her seemingly frail body graceful and composed, with an undeniable pride in her serene beauty. However, when Xuan Hanyunxi opened the door, Principal Lin suddenly became furious.
"Han Yunxi, how dare you speak to me like that, stand still!"
As he spoke, he casually threw the medical record folder on the table at the back of her head. Han Yunxi was taken aback, only to feel a warm and damp sensation slowly flowing down from the back of her head.
Three thousand years ago, the Kingdom of Tianning.
Han Yunxi woke up groggily from the bridal sedan, hearing the festive sounds of flutes, gongs, and drums all around her, while everything in front of her was pitch black.
What's going on?
Han Yunxi pulled down the thing covering her head and took a look, immediately gasping in surprise. Wasn't this a wedding veil? She subconsciously looked up and down, only to find herself dressed in a phoenix crown and wedding attire, looking just like a bride about to get married... How absurd!
The palanquin swayed, causing Han Yunxi to have a headache, and at this moment, unfamiliar memories flooded into her mind one after another. Undoubtedly, she had traveled through time, and she was about to get married as soon as she arrived!
The original owner was the legitimate daughter of the Han family, a prestigious medical family in Tianning Country, also named Han Yunxi. Because her birth mother had excellent medical skills and saved the life of the then queen, who is now the dowager empress, she was betrothed to the seventh prince, who is now Prince Qin Long Feiye. This was once a beautiful story, and the Han family's status skyrocketed as a result.
No one knew that Han Yunxi was born with the ability to kill her own mother and grew up to be a useless ugly woman who didn't know medical skills. Her marriage was delayed and became a taboo for King Qin. Unfortunately, King Qin had angered the emperor a few days ago, and the emperor issued an order to choose a date for the wedding before the end of the month.
Qin Wanglong, a young prince who was crowned at a young age, was the only surviving royal child in the struggle for the throne. Although he was only in his early twenties, he was the only uncle in the current generation and could be regarded as the most powerful and influential person in the Tian Ning Kingdom.
The Qin royal palace was in the south of the city, and the Han family was in the north. The bridal sedan had to pass through the city from north to south. Even though the Qin king himself did not appear, his wedding still attracted thousands of people and caused a sensation throughout the city.
Just as Han Yunxi was sorting out these memory information, the joy suddenly stopped, and she heard the happy old lady exclaim, "Oh no, something terrible has happened!"
Chapter One
"Xiao Yu, Xiao Yu, wake up. It's almost midnight, get up and eat some dumplings."
Feng Yu felt the voice was somewhat unfamiliar, but also very intimate. He responded groggily, opened his eyes, and saw a young face that only existed in his memory.
"Sister?"
"Wake up and go wash your face. I told you not to drink, but you insisted on drinking, and you fell asleep without even watching the Spring Festival Gala," Feng Danying said with a smile.
Spring Festival Gala? Is today New Year's Eve?
Feng Yu looked around in confusion, a small room of less than six square meters, a single bed with patched bedding, an old wooden table, a 20-watt incandescent lamp overhead emitting a dim yellow light, and old newspapers pasted on the walls, featuring some national events that he could no longer remember.
Isn't this the old house from his childhood family farm? But this house was already demolished during the construction of the small town, and how did his sister become so young?
Feng Yu raised his hand, only to realize that this was definitely not a prank, as his hand had become smaller and his arm thinner.
He jumped out of bed and stood by the doorframe, where he had made marks with a small knife every New Year's Day; the highest line was from 1988, at 166 centimeters.
Is it 1988 now? He hasn't even graduated from junior high yet?
He pinched himself hard, almost crying out in pain, could it not be a dream?
Feng Yu opened the door and saw his mother cooking dumplings in a large pot in the kitchen. He lived in a small room, with the kitchen right outside the door, and the living room on the other side, which was called the hall in the farm.
"Are you up? Will you still drink alcohol in the future?" Zhang Muhua lovingly glanced at her son.
Feng Yu looked at his mother, who still had a head full of black hair, and his eyes became moist.
"Mom, you've worked hard."
"What is this child saying? Hurry up and wash your face, go inside and watch TV for a while, the dumplings will be ready soon." Zhang Muhua felt very gratified when she heard the words "thank you for your hard work," thinking that her son had grown up.
When Feng Yu saw his father sitting on the bench in the living room, his lips were trembling. In the future, just as he had the ability to make money, his father was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and passed away in less than three months, without even spending a penny of what he had earned.
The desire to support his parents but they were no longer there, which made Feng Yu feel very upset for a long time.
"Dad." Feng Xingtai turned to his son: "Are you up? Is your head still dizzy? Watch some TV, there's a national dance gala, it's very festive."
"Dad, I'd like to have a drink with you later." Seeing the anger on his father's face, Feng Yu hurriedly explained, "Just beer is fine."
Feng Yu had a strong desire to have a drink with his father again, as they had only shared a few drinks together in their lifetime.
"You still haven't learned your lesson, huh? Fine, drink some more later, and let's see if you can get up tomorrow to pay New Year's visits! Dan Ying, go get two bottles of beer."
Feng Danying shook her head helplessly, turned around to get the beer and cups.
There was also a single bed in the hall, with bedding on it. Feng Danying lived in the school and stayed with her mother in the inner room when she came back during holidays. This bed was for Feng Xingtai. However, three years ago, it was Feng Yu who slept there.
On the west wall of the living room, there is a vertical wardrobe with three doors, and two suitcases on top of it. On a solid wood table, there is a 14-inch black and white TV, which is playing the Spring Festival Gala.
In the middle of the living room, there was a folding round table filled with dishes and tableware. There were a total of eight dishes, all leftovers from the night before. There were chicken, fish, and pork knuckles; all eight dishes were meat dishes, with no vegetarian options.
Feng Yu didn't watch TV, but instead walked to the wardrobe and carefully looked at himself in the mirror.
He glanced at the calendar on the wall by the door, February 16, 1988, Chinese New Year's Eve.
He could now be sure that he had been reborn!
The mother quickly cooked the dumplings, and both Feng Yu and Feng Dan Ying went to the kitchen to help serve them. After the four people sat down, Feng Xing Tai picked up his chopsticks.
"Xiao Yu, you're still drinking!" Zhang Muhua glared at Feng Yu.
"Mom, let me have a little more to drink for the New Year."
Feng Xingtai also said a few words, but Zhang Muhua shook her head and let them go. Feng Yu even enthusiastically poured a glass of beer for his mother and sister, insisting that the whole family should have a drink together.
"Dad, Mom, sister, Happy New Year, cheers!"
Feng Yu casually tasted the leftover dishes on the table and found them exceptionally delicious. In those days, there were no hormone additives like in later times. Fish and rabbits were wild, and chickens and pigs were raised at home. The two of them ate these dishes with dumplings and each drank a bottle of beer; Feng Xingtai wouldn't allow any more.
After eating, Feng Yu finished washing up and returned to his own cabin to lie down. As he lay in bed, he tossed and turned, unable to help but think about his life before his rebirth.
Feng Yu was a man in his forties who, after resigning from a securities company, made a living by doing some personal investments.
He has a wife but no children; his father passed away early due to illness, and his mother lives with him.
He remembered it was the spring of 2015 when he wanted to take his wife abroad for infertility treatment and earn some extra money. He mortgaged all his savings, including his house and car, and borrowed a large sum of money to invest in the stock market. According to his prediction, it was a bull market, and even a fool could make money.
The initial situation was very good, and his investment quickly doubled. So he boldly used high leverage in an investment company, hoping to make more profit. If he could double it again, he would be able to live comfortably for the rest of his life without doing anything.
When the stock market reached 5,000 points, he, like many others, became greedy and believed it would continue to rise. The market did indeed rise a bit more, but it quickly plunged. Because he used high leverage and had no additional funds, he ended up losing a large sum. After repaying the borrowed money, he became penniless. His wife didn't know that the house and car had been mortgaged, and he didn't know how to face his family when he returned home.
He went bankrupt, and one day, after drinking a lot, he deliberately stumbled and fell in front of many people, only to be hit and sent flying by a large truck.
This should not be considered suicide, right? The accidental insurance he took out should be able to compensate a few million, enough to redeem the house and car, and leave some money for his mother and wife.
He remembered watching the speeding truck and thinking that if only he could have a second chance, he wouldn't die so pathetically; he would make sure his family lived a comfortable life!
But unexpectedly, the heavens actually gave him a chance to start over!
Since fate allowed him to start over, the regrets of his past life would not be repeated in this one. He was determined to become a wealthy tycoon and a legend in the investment world!
"Xiao Yu, stop shouting and go to sleep quickly."
On the other side of the wall, Zhang Muhua shouted, complaining about her husband for letting their son drink alcohol again at night, causing him to talk nonsense.
Hearing his mother's complaining voice, Feng Yu smiled, turned over, and fell into a sweet sleep. Chapter 1.
May 20, 2019, Monday.
As spring ends, summer arrives.
During this season, the temperature difference between day and night in the Jiangnan region becomes very large. During the day, it's so hot that people wear shorts; at night, they have to curl up in their blankets, shivering from the cold.
Jiangnan University City.
Song Shuhang stayed alone in the dormitory, with the computer desk pulled to the bedside, making it convenient for him to watch movies in various positions.
Song Shuhang did not have a habit of skipping class - last night, the weather was hot and stuffy, and in his sleep, he used a move called "Double Dragons Emerging from the Sea" and kicked off his blanket.
In the second half of the night, the temperature dropped sharply. Song Shuhang, who was only wearing a pair of briefs, was suddenly miserable. In his sleep, he searched desperately with both hands on the bed, looking for the blanket, but couldn't find it. In the end, he could only curl up like a shrimp, shivering under the midnight cold wind.
As the sun rose, Song Shuhang had become a member of the seasonal flu army.
His roommate has already asked for a leave of absence for today's class on his behalf.
Then, he took some cold medicine and slept until now.
With the fever gone, his body still felt weak, and he was in no condition to attend class. So, he could only stay alone in the dormitory, watching movies to pass the time.
On the screen, the progress bar of the movie slowly advanced. However, Song Shuhang couldn't focus on the content of the film at all.
"Is the medicine still in effect? I'm so sleepy." He yawned, feeling his eyelids getting heavy.
'Drip, drip, drip~' At this moment, the chat software in the lower right corner of the computer screen started to bounce.
This is a notification that someone has added him as a friend or joined a group.
"Who added me?" Song Shuhang muttered, as he reached out and gently tapped the lower right corner of the computer touchscreen, causing the notification message to pop up.
[Huangshan Zhenjun (******) has requested to add you as a friend.] Additional message: None.
Huangshan Zhenjun? Who is that, such a strange nickname?
"Is it a classmate?" Song Shuhang secretly thought, and couldn't help but think of those few people in the class who were clearly in college but still in the youthful fantasy period. If it was them, they would indeed come up with such strange nicknames.
With this in mind, he clicked "agree."
Immediately after, another system message popped up.
Huangshan Zhenjun invites you to join the group 'Jiuzhou No.1 Group', do you agree?
Song Shuhang continued to press agree.
'Shushan Pressure' agreed to join the 'Jiuzhou No.1 Group'.
[You have agreed to join the group, say hello to your groupmates!] A system smiley face is also included.
Nowadays, chat tools are becoming more and more user-friendly.
After a series of prompts popped up, Song Shuhang closed the prompts and group chat window without paying much attention - he was feeling sleepy and had no energy to care about what group he had joined.
Anyway, his group settings have always been set to "do not prompt messages, only display the number," so group chats won't pop up and disturb him, only the number of chats will be displayed behind the group.
Once he becomes more sober, he can check the chat history to find out which group he has joined, and the chat records of the group members will not be lost.
The progress bar of the movie continued to advance stubbornly, but Song Shuhang's consciousness became increasingly blurred.
In the Jiuzhou No.1 group, when a new member joined, some lurking members surfaced. Beihe Sanren said, "Has Huangshan Zhenjun added a new Daoist friend? It's been more than a year since we added a new member, right?"
Another user with the ID 'Su's Aqi' quickly replied: "A new fellow Daoist? Which region of China are you from? What's your Daoist name? What level of cultivation have you reached?"
Is there something off about this series of problems?
"Are you a fairy? If so, tell us your measurements and show us a photo!"
"Sanlang, are you really a golden fish?" Beihesanren sighed, "Don't make a mistake again, what if Huangshan Zhenjun brings in another senior?"
Sanlang is a good guy in every aspect - he's loyal, helpful, and has a good reputation among people. The only thing is that he likes to be glib and is good at playing dead.
Unfortunately, this guy had such low luck that it was infuriating. Every time he unintentionally messed up, he always offended the seniors. These bored seniors were worried about not having fun, so they naturally enjoyed tormenting Kuang Dao San Lang, who brought amusement to their doorstep.
"Please don't mention the words 'great senior,' it casts a shadow in my heart," Krazy Blade Three Waves sent a row of 'tears streaming down' emojis.
Four years ago, his sharp tongue offended a beautiful "senior," who tormented him terribly... That senior tormented him for a full year and four months. You heard right, a whole year and four months! Thinking back to those inhuman times, his eyes became moist.
As soon as Sanlang finished speaking, a series of mischievous laughter emojis popped up in the group chat, blatantly and straightforwardly reveling in the misfortune.
There were eight people showing online status in the group, and six of them simultaneously sent a row of smiling faces.
"You bunch of schadenfreude, I'll remember each and every one of you. Don't let me run into you, or I'll make sure you taste the power of my 72-blade technique!" Kuan Dao San Lang said resentfully. He was very confident in his quick blade, and none of the six guys who had just sneered at him would be a match for him in a one-on-one fight.
Kuang Dao San Lang had just finished speaking.
He has a profound cultivation, reaching the late stage of the 5th-grade Spirit Emperor, only two steps away from the 6th-grade Spirit Monarch, but he cannot defeat Aqi (Ah Seven).
He had a fast and fierce 72-style knife technique and lightning-fast moves, but he couldn't beat Ah Qi.
He claimed to be a mad swordsman, fearing even himself when he went mad, but he just couldn't beat Ah Qi!
Upon seeing the third wave wither in the group, there was another string of unrestrained laughing faces.
"..." This time, Kuang Dao San Lang could only send a series of colons in frustration.
People in the group were making a fuss for a long time, but they didn't hear the newcomer speak, which made them somewhat puzzled.
"Is the new Daoist friend not speaking?" asked the North River Hermit.
Unfortunately, due to the effects of the cold medicine, Song Shuhang had once again entered a semi-asleep state.
At this time, Su's Aqi happily sent another message: "I checked, the new Daoist friend is called 'Book Mountain Pressure'. Have you ever heard of a master with this Daoist name? This name sounds like it might belong to a traveler from the Confucian school?"
Looking back, Confucian practitioners were even more enjoyable to fight than Buddhists, not only were they good with words, but their fists were also tough. Moreover, when they got excited, they would even recite poems to boost their spirits, making it even more enjoyable! I loved fighting them the most.
"A-Qi, I say, is your expectation for new friends always just about whether they are good at fighting and how enjoyable the fight is?" Kuang Dao San Lang said with a tearful expression.
"Uh," Su Shi Aqi was a little embarrassed.
Beihe Sanren sneered, "Could it be another 'great senior' who doesn't know how to use chat tools?"
When he said that, everyone felt a sense of déjà vu, didn't they?
Yes, about four years ago, there seemed to be a senior who had closed himself off for more than a hundred years and finally joined a chat software with great difficulty, being added to the group by True Monarch Yellow Mountain. However, he couldn't type and didn't say anything.
Then, a guy named Kuan Dao San Lang happily chatted away in front of this senior, asking her for her measurements, requesting photos, and wanting to have voice chats and such.
And then... not long after, Kuang Dao San Lang saw this senior with his own eyes. She was a beautiful senior, as dazzling and beautiful as the bright moon in the night sky.
Then, the beautiful senior tormented Kuang Dao San Lang for a whole year and four months before leaving satisfied.
At this point, an ID called 'Pharmacist' spoke up.
A baffling short message with no beginning or end.
Fortunately, the people in the group were already used to the pharmacist's brief chatting habits - he was asking where the group owner, Huangshan Zhenjun, was.
The pharmacist's brief speech was not due to a noble and aloof personality, but because he typed with two-finger Zen and handwriting, which was extremely slow. When there were many words, it was easy to make mistakes, and the process of deleting and rewriting was extremely painful. Therefore, the pharmacist was accustomed to keeping his speech as short as possible.
"He added people and then immediately went offline. I heard that his precious demon dog ran away from home again in a huff, and True Monarch Yellow Mountain went to chase after it," replied the North River Loose Practitioner.
"...Pharmacist."
"We can only chat after the new friend learns to use the chat tool."
They all had preconceived notions, thinking that the newcomers were like-minded individuals.
About an hour later, Song Shuhang gradually regained consciousness.
"Remember someone just added me to a group, I think it was called Jiuzhou No.1 Group?" He muttered softly, casually clicking on the chat tool in the lower right corner and pulling up the chat window for the Jiuzhou No.1 Group.
What kind of group is it?
Soon, the chat history from an hour ago appeared in front of him.
Song Shuhang probably took a tour around.
This seat? Chasing the big demon dog?
Specialized vocabulary in various fantasy martial arts works.
The way people in the group chat is also interesting - half ancient and half modern. It gives the impression that modern people are trying to communicate in ancient language, but due to their insufficient foundation in classical literature, the communication style is awkward.
"Chuckle" Song Shuhang laughed out loud.
It seems like this group was created by a fan of fantasy martial arts?
Oh no, this is definitely not an ordinary group of fantasy martial arts enthusiasts!
Everyone in the group gave themselves a Taoist name, referred to their living places as caves, and described the group owner's lost pet dog as a runaway demon dog. Some even claimed to have not fought a Confucian traveler for hundreds of years, implying that they had lived for several centuries.
Just looking at these chat logs gives a strong sense of embarrassment.
"This level of obsession has reached the level of 'chuunibyou,' and it's a very Chinese-style Xianxia 'chuunibyou,'" Song Shuhang nodded secretly.
It seems like a concentration camp for fantasy and chivalry-loving adolescents with delusions of grandeur!
This was his first impression of the 'Jiuzhou No.1 Group' and its members.
However, why was he added to the group?
He checked the profile of the group owner, Huangshan Zhenjun, and confirmed that he was not his classmate and that he definitely did not know him.
The delicate blue lines flowed smoothly from the tip of the pen. On the palm-sized card, the light blue lines continued to multiply, and gradually, a complex and mysterious pattern became more and more perfect as the pen glided across the surface.
Suddenly, the pen tip paused heavily, changing from its previous lightness, and then swiftly made a sharp side hook, the pen hook like a blade! The pattern on the card suddenly brightened, and then quickly dimmed down, returning to normal.
With a focused expression still on his face after completing this card, he had only finished fifteen so far, with a gap of ten more to reach today's goal. He was currently working on a one-star energy card, which, as the lowest-level energy card, had the widest range of use and was one of the most consumed cards.
At this moment, the room suddenly went dark.
The instrument displayed the number one hundred. Unexpectedly, the energy was used up, and it seemed that today's task would require an additional card. Chen Muxun, who returned to his desk, immersed himself in his work, relying on these most basic cards for his entire livelihood.
Chen Mu's room was very small, less than forty square meters, with a semi-old work desk inside. Apart from the relatively clean work desk, the rest of the room was filled with piles of miscellaneous items. These items were varied, including stacks of old books and scattered various materials.
In this humble place, Chen Mu lived for three years. This was a relief house provided by the federal government, and a small room like this only required a payment of 150 Euros per month to move in. For poor people like Chen Mu, there was no cheaper place than this.
At five in the afternoon, Chen Mu finally finished his day's work - twenty-five energy cards. He carefully counted the number of cards, counting twice to make sure the number was correct before carefully placing the energy cards into the card holder inside his clothes.
As soon as he entered, the shop owner noticed and greeted him, "Ah, Amu is here!"
He replied to the shop owner. Uncle Hua, the shop owner, was a man in his fifties, with the traces of time on his body that could not be concealed. Fine wrinkles, half-white hair, and a pair of reading glasses.
Chen Mu carefully took out the card pack from his arms, pulled out the stack of energy cards, and handed them to the shop owner: "Twenty-five."
Uncle Hua took the card from Chen Mu's hand, put it on the shelf without looking, and said with a smile, "Fortunately, we have Ah Mu sending cards every day, otherwise, we would have a shortage of supplies here."
Chen Mu smiled slightly but didn't respond, knowing that Uncle Hua's words were mostly meant as a joke. A one-star energy card is the cheapest energy card, but it is also one of the most consumed cards, especially since this place is near the East Guard Academy. How could it only sell twenty-five energy cards a day?
Uncle Hua also knew Chen Mu's temperament and didn't waste words, asking directly, "Does Ah Mu need cash or a transfer?"
Chen Mu answered simply and handed over a light green card that he had already prepared to Uncle Hua. After settling the payment, Chen Mu bid farewell to Uncle Hua and turned to leave.
Uncle Hua suddenly called out to Chen Mu, "Ah Mu, wait a moment."
Chen Mu stopped in his tracks, turned around, and looked at Uncle Hua with a slight surprise, "Is there anything else, Uncle Hua?"
Uncle Hua took out a light yellow note from the drawer, smiling at Chen Mu: "Almost forgot something. This is a listening certificate for a card maker training class, which was given by the distributor when the goods arrived yesterday."
Looking at Uncle Hua's kind face, Chen Mu couldn't help but feel touched. He knew how much help this old man had given him over the years, and if it weren't for him, Chen Mu believed that his current life would be just as unattainable.
Three years ago, he had just learned to make energy cards and tried to sell them everywhere, but few people were interested, and no businesses were willing to buy them. The demand for one-star energy cards was very large, and businesses preferred to buy in bulk. However, Chen Mu could only make a maximum of thirty cards a day, which was just a small amount that didn't even count as a fraction for the businesses.
Fortunately, he met Uncle Hua. Uncle Hua agreed to buy his energy cards, but the purchase price for each card was 103 Oudi, which was two Oudi lower than the wholesale price of energy cards on the market. Despite this, Chen Mu was still extremely grateful to Uncle Hua.
Although the price of 103 Oudi was lower than the wholesale price of 105, Chen Mu felt surrounded by immense joy. He sold all the energy cards in his hand, bought the cheapest food, and spent the rest of the money on raw materials for energy cards.
Since then, Chen Mu's life finally settled down.
He never missed a day with twenty-five energy cards every day.
Three years passed, and during these three years, he only made one type of card - a one-star energy card. In addition to producing energy cards, he spent all his time researching how to reduce costs.
Finally, in the third year, he managed to control the cost of energy cards at ninety-five Oudi, making a profit of eight Oudi per card, and his daily income stabilized at two hundred Oudi, a figure he could not have imagined three years ago.
Coming back to his senses, Chen Muchao smiled at Hua Shu and said, "Thank you, Hua Shu!" He took the lecture pass and carefully placed it in the card holder in his pocket.
They often put up incredibly fancy advertisements, such as this lecture certificate that says things like "East Guard Academy Recognized Qualifications" and "East Guard Academy Senior Card Making Authority Personally Lecturing," but in reality, Chen Mu knew exactly what was going on inside. The organization hosting this training session had only a slight connection with the East Guard Academy, which was that they had to pay a fee to the academy each time as the cost of maintaining this nominal "jointly organized" event.
Chen Mu still decided to go and listen to what was being taught in the training class. Card making is one of the most profound subjects, and he has never given up on self-study over the years, but the results have been minimal. It wasn't until last year that he finally understood what was going on.
For a young man with no foundation, it was naturally extremely difficult to self-study the notoriously complex and obscure art of card-making. However, he had no doubt about his own intelligence, and was able to learn how to make a one-star energy card within a week just by memory, earning high praise from the card maker at the time for his talent.
Since then, he has put aside this temporarily unattainable goal and turned to the most basic theoretical learning. No matter how tired he is from work, he always finds time to study this dry knowledge.
After saying goodbye to Uncle Hua, Chen Mu walked south along a small alley. Today was Saturday, and he still had a job to do.
After crossing two streets and walking for about twenty minutes, he arrived at a second-hand waste card purchase station.
He was also the owner of this acquisition station. Every Saturday and Sunday evening, Chen Mu would come here to work for three hours.
Chen Muchao and Xiao Hei nodded slightly, but their faces still had a hint of woodenness.
Xiaohei had long been accustomed to Chen Mu's attitude. When Chen Mu first came here to ask for a part-time job, Xiaohei had originally refused. This recycling station had been managed by one person since his father's time, and when it came to him, he also managed it all by himself.
However, when Chen Mu said he didn't want a salary, Xiao Hei finally agreed. Of course, Chen Mu still received compensation, usually choosing a few old cards to take away as his payment.
Sometimes, Chen Mu would pick out a few energy cards that hadn't been used up from these waste piles. Xiao Hei calculated that the amount he saved on this every month was quite significant. However, for the reticent Chen Mu, he couldn't help but feel curious about how this guy knew there was still residual energy in these cards.
However, since then, every time he saw Chen Mu, he was all smiles.
Chen Mu squatted down and began to sort the pile of discarded cards. There were many types of cards, including energy cards, item cards, imitation cards, and even some rare plant and animal cards. However, all the cards here were useless without exception, and what Chen Mu had to do was to categorize these cards.
The work progressed quickly, and it was evident that he was very familiar with the task.
Chen Mu flicked his wrist and threw a card to Xiao Hei: "Here, this card can still be used for a while." This two-star energy card had at least half of its energy left, and Chen Mu couldn't understand why the original owner had wasted it so much. The capacity of a two-star energy card is 1,000, which means there is still about 500 energy left inside.
Little Black looked at the two-star energy card in his hand, his eyes and eyebrows all smiling. He ran excitedly to the energy meter, inserted the card, and when he saw the number "523" light up on it, Little Black's facial features were almost squeezed together in laughter.
Three years of production experience allowed him to have his own understanding of the most common and basic cards. There is not only one way to make a one-star energy card; Chen Mu has already collected twelve different structures of one-star energy cards from this type.
These diverse one-star energy cards provided great inspiration to Chen Mu, and it was because he learned some techniques from these cards that he successfully reduced the production cost of one-star energy cards to ninety-five Odi. However, such good luck doesn't happen every day, and so far, he has only collected twelve cards.
However, today's luck seems to be good.
Looking at the one-star energy card in his hand, from the surface pattern, it was a new type of one-star energy card with a structure that Chen Mu had never encountered before.
He set aside the energy card and continued to rummage through the pile. There were too many one-star energy cards, but Chen Mu patiently checked them one by one. His speed was extremely fast, and he could almost tell whether it was what he wanted just by lightly touching these one-star energy cards.
All of this came from his familiarity with the one-star energy card. This familiarity was left behind from three years of continuous production, and he could tell whether the card was a one-star energy card or a structure he had seen before just by touch. He was so familiar with them that he knew every detail.
The fingers that were skimming the edge of the card suddenly stopped.
Lin Che got up from the bed in a daze.
Her head felt heavy and disconnected, as if it wasn't her own. The luxurious sheets her palms touched were not the worn-out ones she usually used. The light above her head was not the familiar half-broken energy-saving bulb she was used to seeing. Her body ached as if it had just been torn apart by something. Lifting her wrist, she saw the clear and distinct bruises in shades of blue and purple.
She covered her mouth, not wanting to let herself make a sound, lifted the blanket, and saw her naked self inside, the scream almost bursting out of her throat.
Lin Che's lively eyes spun around in their sockets, decisively lifted the quilt, got out of bed, picked up the messy clothes, put them on casually, and ran out without looking back.
"Ah... let go of me, let go..." Lin Che struggled with both hands and feet.
The man's large hand grabbed her neck effortlessly, pulling her back onto the bed.
His deep eyes seemed to carry an innate arrogance, and on his cold, frosty cheeks, his high-bridged nose stood out on his fair face. His white jade-like skin made her, a woman who considered her own skin to be quite good, feel envious and jealous.
She had seen many men in her life, but those who were called "male gods" suddenly paled in comparison when they stood in front of him.
Was it this man who tormented her half to death yesterday, spending half the night doing so?
"Who sent you, and how dare you drug me? Do you think you can do such a thing and leave here unscathed?" He looked at the stunned woman, anger flashing in his deep eyes.
This unfamiliar woman had skin as white as snow, a charming small face, and a pair of lively big eyes. Her eyelashes fluttered like a frightened little deer, yet she stubbornly stared back at him with wide-open eyes.
Gu Jingze's gaze fixed on her, and he saw Lin Che's eyes start to move rapidly again as her mind worked quickly.
However, she got the wrong person.
The person in front of them, although handsome enough to make one feel dizzy, was clearly not the top-tier superstar Gu Jingyu.
This time, she was once again rudely grabbed by the arm, and when she fell to the ground, she even rolled awkwardly in a circle before steadying herself.
"You've got it all wrong; I'm the one who's seriously hurt right now." She was in pain from falling on her buttocks, her hand hurt, and the pain below was even more unbearable. Annoyed, she blurted out, "I intended to drug someone else, not you. You think you're worth me drugging? I don't just do this to anyone. Give me back my money for the drugs!"
Did you mistake the person?
Gu Jingze's face was tense, his eyebrows knitted into a frown, and his dark eyes were like a lurking beast, staring at the disheveled woman. Her white shoulder was exposed, with bruises and red marks clearly visible, like blooming plum blossoms on her fair skin.
The images from the night flashed through his mind again, and he suddenly felt a warmth in his lower abdomen, feeling the familiar heat surging through his body once more.
He looked away from her face.
This damn woman dared to drug him, and the effect was so strong.
His momentary opening allowed Lin Che to finally seize the opportunity, jumping off the bed without hesitation and forcefully pushing the man away.
Not daring to look back, she quickly ran out.
Hearing him hiss, she shouted, "What are you looking at? Look at yourself!"
"You..." Gu Jingze was about to turn around and grab her, but he felt an unbearable sensation in his body, and his lower part had already risen uncontrollably again.
"Damn it," he cursed, clenching his fists to suppress the damn pain.
A series of sounds came from outside.
Qin Hao looked back and was so astonished that he couldn't close his mouth.
What just happened? How did a disheveled woman come out of the gentleman's room?
He raised his sharp eyes, the black pupils shining with brilliance, causing Qin Hao to quickly swallow all the doubts he shouldn't have had into his stomach.
Gu Jingze kept scrubbing his body in the bathroom until his skin turned pink, then cursed at the mirror, "****."
Gu Jingze was taken aback; at this moment, his mother actually came over, and he knew it couldn't be anything good just by thinking about it.
When the bathroom door was opened, a beautiful lady standing outside was surprised to see the mess all over the bed.
The unmade beds that hadn't been tidied up were clearly telling everyone present what had happened last night.
Gu Jingze's dark eyes were gloomy, and he pulled a bathrobe over his honey-colored shoulders with one hand, "I know what you want to ask, but, Mother, I am very busy today."
How could Mu Wanqing not ask? The excitement on her face was hard to hide. Looking at Gu Jingze, she pointed to the bed and said, "Jingze, I already know. You had a relationship with a girl."
Gu Jingze pushed the door open and said coldly to Mu Wanqing, "Can you please not interfere in this matter?"
"How can I not care? Jingze, you must marry her, you have to take responsibility for the girl."
"Mother, I won't marry her, I'm not crazy. She's just a stranger, and I don't even know her name."
"Mother!" Gu Jingze stood there, his expression even more troubled as he thought of that woman.
"Do you still think about Mo Huiling? I'm telling you, there's no chance for you with her. You've been with her for so many years and still can't touch her. You two are simply not meant to be together!" Mu Wanqing said bluntly.
"Mother, that's enough!" Gu Jingze wanted to interrupt Mu Wanqing.
However, Mu Wanqing was very excited, "Jing Ze, you know that your illness means you can't touch women, and your family has almost prepared for artificial insemination for you to have a child. But today, you touched a woman, which means she is the most suitable partner for you!"
The famous Taoist mountain, Qingcheng, has been visited by countless extraordinary people since ancient times. The saying "hidden dragons and snakes in the grass" perfectly describes this place.
Countless myths and legends, like a thick layer of clouds, have shrouded Qingcheng in a veil of mystery.
At the break of dawn, on a stone path in the mountains, groups of Taoists dressed in blue robes silently and swiftly walked, holding three long incense sticks in their hands. They were heading towards a towering, smooth, and cloud-piercing stone wall on the back mountain.
The mountain road was steep and slippery with dew, yet these Taoists moved faster than galloping horses, leaving behind streaks of green shadows. Some even leaped into the air, soaring across a hundred meters with the morning breeze, their clothes fluttering gracefully, as if celestial beings had descended to the mortal world.
From the mountains, peaks, and various palaces and pavilions of Qingcheng Mountain, Daoists constantly emerged and gathered in front of this unnamed stone wall.
Among them, a large group of young Taoist priests held various flags and ritual instruments, carrying incense burners and walking around the nine-palace array. The incense smoke rose straight into the sky, and the misty air wrapped around and turned into a cloud covering the heads of the Taoist priests.
At the forefront of the many Taoist priests, right below the stone wall, a group of people wearing purple robes with golden edges, embroidered with the Eight Diagrams on their chests and backs with silver threads, and adorned with cloud patterns and various floral designs on the edges of their sleeves, stood solemnly and expressionlessly, holding dusters in their hands, looking incredibly magnificent.
The crowd waited quietly for a while, and when a red light suddenly leaped up in the east, and the faint red light instantly tore open the sky and sprinkled all around, many Taoists bowed down together, facing the stone wall and performing the devout ritual of three kneels and nine kowtows.
Thousands of people chanted the mantra simultaneously, and the intertwined "Om" sounds turned into a subtle wave that made one's heart tremble and spread far away. Gradually, a strange power rose from the chanting, and a bright, colorful glow shot out from the heads of the many people, shining on the smooth, polished stone wall.
The Taoists wearing purple robes with golden edges knelt down and murmured a prayer.
This continued for half an hour, and finally a ray of white light emerged from the top of the stone wall, and soon the entire stone wall emitted a bright and clear white light.
Mist and smoke soared into the sky, and countless clouds of smoke entwined around the stone walls, revealing several faint figures wrapped in golden light within the smoke. The figures became clearer and clearer, and eventually, three men and two women, all dressed in white robes with their faces obscured by golden light, appeared before everyone.
The woman in the center looked down at the many Taoists kneeling in front of the stone wall, and suddenly had a scroll in her hand, which she casually threw out.
A flash of white light appeared on the stone wall, and the scroll made of purple jade and gold threads slowly floated out, landing precisely in the hands of the purple-robed elder leading the group of Taoists in worship. The woman who threw the scroll muttered a few words, then turned to leave with her companions.
Several purple-robed elders suddenly cried out, "Ancestors have mercy, have mercy!"
The sound of "dong dong" kept ringing, and all the Taoists bowed their heads heavily to the five men and women, their foreheads hitting the rocks and ground with a chaotic noise.
The woman who threw the scroll shouted coldly, and suddenly all the Taoists fell to the ground, stiff and motionless, not daring to make any more movements or sounds.
On the other hand, the woman next to her laughed softly and threw out a few more things with a backhand.
As the light on the stone wall dimmed, the five Taoists disappeared without a trace.
Several objects shining with a strange glow slowly fell from the sky, including a sword, a bead, a small tripod, five talismans, and nine medicine bottles.
The sword, pearl, and small tripod were tiny like children's toys, but each one was dazzling and surrounded by mist, clearly extraordinary objects.
The five talismans were wrapped in golden light and exuded an oppressive purple aura. The seemingly endless waves of pressure emanated from the talismans, causing the nearby Taoists to lose their footing and be pushed back by the force.
On the nine medicine bottles were densely engraved with various talismans and seals. The old Taoist who had just received the scroll opened one of the bottles in front of the many Taoists, and a burst of refreshing fragrance suddenly gushed out. Thousands of Taoists in front of the stone wall took a deep breath at the same time, feeling their seven orifices unblocked, as if their whole body's meridians had been washed by clear water, and their whole body became bright and clear.
Just smelling a whiff of the medicinal fragrance was more effective than the three months of hard work these Taoists had put into their breathing exercises. The purple-robed elder hastily sealed the medicine bottle tightly. The mere scent of the elixir had such a miraculous effect, one can only imagine what a treasure the pill inside the bottle must be.
Several purple-robed elders gathered together and whispered for a while, then separately packed up their swords, beads, tripods, talismans, and medicine bottles, and then unfolded the scroll in front of everyone.
The first half of the scroll was a scripture on cultivating qi and nourishing the spirit, called "The Tai Xu Qi Jing." The second half of the scroll, however, caused the purple-robed elders to turn pale and cry out in alarm. About a quarter of an hour later, countless Taoist priests swarmed out of Qingcheng Mountain.
The potential power of Qingcheng Mountain in the secular world was fully mobilized, setting off an invisible huge wave.
Chapter 1
In the sweltering heat of July, the asphalt road emitted a pungent smell of paint under the scorching sun, as if it was about to melt.
The air above the road surface is distorted and twisted due to evaporation.
Under such a scorching sun, there were hardly any pedestrians on the street, and even the traffic was sparse. Everyone was either seeking shade to escape the heat or enjoying the comfort of air-conditioned rooms.
A woman wearing a washed-out white shirt and gray, dusty suit pants hurriedly walked, heading straight for the Second People's Hospital.
The woman's hair was stuck to her face due to sweat, and her cheeks had an unusual red flush, clearly sunburned.
The white shirt was soaked with sweat and clung uncomfortably to his body, but Qiao Nan had no time to worry about that as he tightly gripped the bag containing 100,000 yuan.
This was the money she had painstakingly gathered by selling all the valuable things around her. Her sister needed 200,000 for surgery, and she still had to find a way to come up with another 100,000.
As Qiao Nan walked straight towards the ward, he touched the doorknob and heard the conversation between the mother and daughter inside the room.
"Mom, it's all Qiao Nan's fault. If it weren't for her, Da Jun wouldn't have divorced me." This was the voice of Qiao Nan's sister, Qiao Ziqin.
"Don't cry, Mom has already taught Qiong a lesson for you," Mother Ding Jiayi said, comforting her eldest daughter as she stroked her head.
Standing outside, Qiao Nan's heart skipped a beat. Her sister was not caught cheating by Chen Jun, which led to their separation, but what did this have to do with her?
Thinking of Chen Jun, a wave of sadness filled Qiao Nan's eyes.
Chen Jun was originally Qiao Nan's boyfriend, but Qiao Zijin became pregnant with her sister's boyfriend's child. Ding Jiayi scolded Qiao Nan, accusing her of harboring ill intentions and being a heartless little beast who not only stole her sister's boyfriend but also forced her own sister to have an abortion.
In the end, Qiao Nan had no choice but to step aside and let Chen Jun be with his sister.
"Mom, Da Jun divorced me, the child is not with me, and I have this disease, what should I do? Mom, I don't want to die, I haven't been filial to you, I really don't want to die."
In the ward, Qiao Zijin hugged Ding Jiayi and cried bitterly, as she was still so young and had many good days ahead; she really didn't want to die.
Upon hearing that her eldest daughter had such a serious illness but still wanted to be filial to her in the future, Ding Jiayi was deeply moved.
Ding Jiayi coaxed and patted Qiao Zijin's back: "Don't worry, Mom will definitely not let anything happen to you. Mom has already gone to raise money for you because of that dead girl Qiao Nan."
Not long after divorcing Chen Jun, Qiao Zijin suffered from kidney failure and needed an immediate kidney transplant.
However, in this marriage, Qiao Zijin was the one who made a mistake by having an affair, and since Chen Jun worked for the government, Qiao Zijin was left with nothing. Now, she doesn't even have money for medical treatment and medication when she is sick.
Upon hearing this conversation, Jiaonan, who had long known that his mother was biased, couldn't help but feel pain in his already numb heart.
She was already forty years old, and after breaking up with Chen Jun, she never had a relationship again. It wasn't that she didn't want to, but her mother wouldn't let her.
Over the years, she had given most of her earnings to her mother, who used the money to buy a 150-square-meter apartment for her sister, while she still had to live in a rented room of only a few dozen square meters.
She paid for the food, utilities, and even the water and electricity bills at her parents' house. Every time her sister came home, she would bring some things with her, but she would take even more when she left.
Qiao Nan knew that at her age, being unmarried and being laughed at as a leftover woman was not because she didn't want to get married, but because her mother didn't want her to get married and only wanted her salary.
But it was her own mother who caused trouble every time she went on a blind date or tried to start a relationship, leaving her with no choice.
After years of hard work, all she got in return were the three words "dead girl." Especially since Qiao Ziqin pushed all the responsibility for his infidelity and divorce onto her, Qiao Nan suddenly didn't want to give him the 100,000 yuan in her hand.
Before Qiao Nan could leave, the following conversation he heard was what truly made him feel cold and desperate.
What if Qiao Nan manages to raise 200,000 but can't find a suitable donor? In fact, the doctor said that if there is a relative willing to donate a kidney, the compatibility would be higher and the chances of rejection would be lower.
Leaning on Ding Jiayi's chest, Qiao Zijin said pitifully, "If I really had a relative's help, maybe I could save some money on my medical expenses."
It's not that easy to find; some people wait their whole lives and never get such an opportunity!
Knowing this, Qiao Zijin realized that money alone was not enough for her to survive; she had to find other ways as well.
"How about mom getting a blood test?" Ding Jiayi asked hesitantly.
Qiao Zijin shook her head repeatedly, knowing that her mother was already at an old age and her kidneys must not be much better than hers. Since she needed a transplant, she definitely wanted a good one: "Mom, you are the one who gave birth to me and raised me, I can't bear to see you go through surgery, and I'm sure my dad wouldn't be able to either."
"Well..." Ding Jiayi thought for a moment, her eyes lighting up: "When that dead girl comes later, I'll have her get a blood test. She's your biological sister, so it's definitely a match!"
"It's good, but will Qiao Nan refuse, after all, it's a kidney." Qiao Zijin's eyes were full of calculating light.
In order to survive and to be prepared for any eventuality, she would never allow Qiao Nan the possibility of refusal.
"Miss Qiao, are you here to see your sister? Why don't you go in?" Qiao Ziqin was chatting with Ding Jiayi when the nurse's voice came from outside the door.
Qiao Ziqin's face changed dramatically: "Mom..." Had her conversation with her mother just been overheard by that dead girl Qiao Nan?
Without hesitation, Ding Jiayi got up and chased after him, indeed seeing Qiao Nan's back, and then shouted Qiao Nan's name.
Upon hearing Ding Jiayi's shout, Qiao Nan refused to turn back or stop, tears kept falling, but her heart was shattered into pieces.
For the sake of her mother and sister, she didn't even have a home of her own, but her mother and sister's scheming for her money wasn't enough, and now they even wanted her kidney.
Qiao Ziqin's words were not understood by Ding Jiayi, but Qiao Nan understood them clearly. The more she understood, the more Qiao Nan hated it, thinking that even if she really owed the Qiao family, she should have paid them back enough by now!
Jianan felt a sudden pain in her head and was about to tell her mom that it was dangerous on the street when a car rushed towards her.
With a "squeak" and a "bang," two loud noises exploded in Qiao Nan's ears, causing her whole body to ache so much that she couldn't speak. Despite the pain, she forced herself to open her eyes to check on her mother.
Ding Jiayi was indeed frightened. Seeing her younger daughter lying in a pool of blood, she ran over and muttered, "Qiao Nan, it's good that you're dead, at least you can still help your sister. Zijin has a kidney now, and the money is there too!"
The younger daughter was hit and killed, and the person who hit her must definitely pay compensation.
Upon hearing Ding Jiayi's words, Qiao Nan's eyes widened, staring at Ding Jiayi intently, unable to wait for the paramedics to arrive before being infuriated to death by her!
Chapter 1
The most frustrating thing in the world is when one moment you're fantasizing about heaven, and the next moment you find yourself in hell.
Mo Wen was such a person; two months ago, he was sitting in the classroom, dreaming of getting into his desired key university, but now he was working as a laborer on a construction site under the scorching sun.
Recalling his miserable experience, Mo Wen spat fiercely on the ground and wiped the sweat that kept streaming down his face with his hand. He had just finished moving a cart of bricks, and by now he was drenched in sweat.
Mo Wen, a seventeen or eighteen-year-old boy, had an ordinary face, dark skin, a lean figure, and a pair of somewhat steady eyes. Perhaps children from poor families had to take charge early, making him appear mature beyond his years despite his young age.
After placing the cement truck carrying bricks on the side of the road, Mo Wen found a shady spot to sit down. It was a good time to sneak in some laziness since the foreman was not around. On the dry and busy construction site, being able to steal a moment of laziness was a great happiness.
He sat on a concrete slab with his legs wide open, constantly scanning the road. In a short while, his eyes lit up; a graceful figure emerged from across the street, immediately capturing his attention.
Although the distance was far and the other person's appearance was not visible, their figure was definitely attractive, especially the elegant walking posture, like a professionally trained model.
Don't underestimate the art of a woman walking; there is much to learn. As for Mo Wen, he spends his days guarding the construction site, with the road and sidewalk right across from him.
He seemed to remember something and pulled out a blue metal disc from his chest, the size of a coin, with a thin blue chain attached, like a strange necklace.
This item was accidentally discovered by Mo Wen a few days ago when he was demolishing an old house. At that time, he found an ancient green brick in a wall, which was pitted and broken, and estimated to be a hundred-year-old historical brick.
If it were an antique with a hundred years of history, it might be worth some money, but a piece of green brick, even if it is an antique, is probably not worth anything.
At that time, Mo Wen casually threw the green brick on the ground, but unexpectedly, the green brick broke in half, and a metal ornament fell out from inside, which was the strange necklace in Mo Wen's hand.
The blue metallic disc was somewhat strange, divided into eight sections on the surface, each engraved with various bizarre and ancient symbols.
Mo Wen was not familiar with antiques, but he could tell that the object in his hand was a miniature version of a Bagua plate. Ordinary people would hang the Bagua plate in their homes to attract good fortune and ward off evil, treating it as a sacred instrument.
Although he was not superstitious and did not believe that the Bagua plate had any ability to bring good luck or avoid misfortune, he knew that this ancient Bagua plate should be valuable, and it might even be an antique. If sold to an antique dealer, it could potentially make him rich overnight.
Mo Wen's eyes were full of longing as he caressed the eight trigrams necklace as if it were his lover. Once he became rich, those beautiful women he had only dared to secretly watch and drool over from afar would be his for the taking.
"Something's wrong. Something's wrong!"
"Something's wrong! Call an ambulance quickly."
A burst of noisy shouts came from not far away, followed by many people running towards that place, and the shouting also interrupted Mo Wen's beautiful dream.
He looked at the other side with confusion, hesitated for a moment, but still stood up and ran towards the place where the crowd was gathering.
At a glance, the situation before him startled him. A middle-aged man, nearly fifty, dressed in tattered clothes, lay on the ground convulsing, his face pale, breathing heavily, and clutching his chest with both hands, seemingly in great pain.
From his eyes, filled with deep fear, it seemed as if he could sense death.
Many workers rushed over, but no one dared to approach. A group of workers with little education obviously didn't know what had happened and were afraid to take action rashly.
"Acute myocardial infarction!"
Mo Wen looked at the convulsing Old Zhang on the ground with a slightly changed expression, somewhat unpleasant. He recognized Old Zhang's symptoms at a glance because someone in the village had once suffered a sudden acute myocardial infarction and died within a few minutes, and he had witnessed the whole process.
The village he lived in was very remote, with basically no professional doctors. When people got sick, they would simply use traditional remedies passed down from their ancestors for treatment, without any targeted therapy.
His mother was weak and sickly, and suffered from overwork. There were no doctors in the village, so his greatest dream was to be admitted to the most prestigious medical university in the country and become a doctor to treat his mother and the villagers.
Unfortunately, he failed in the college entrance examination. With his score, he could have been admitted to the Medical Department of Huaxia University and qualified for free admission. However, he was replaced by a well-connected young man from a powerful family who had a lower score than him, pushing him out of the running.
Although he could have been admitted to other good schools based on his achievements, the high tuition fees were something he simply could not afford. In order not to add burden to his mother, he had to give up his studies and start working to earn money.
The construction site is located in the outskirts of the city, far from the urban area, and the nearest hospital ambulance takes 25 minutes to arrive. Judging by the patient's condition, it's uncertain whether they can hold on for 25 minutes. Holding on for 25 minutes? That would be a miracle!
He knew this person, who lived in the same dormitory as him, named Zhang Lao Shi. Everyone usually called him Old Zhang, an honest and simple person. Due to his lack of skills, he could only work as a low-level laborer on the construction site, just like him.
It is said that he also has a son in college, and he works so hard to earn money to support his son's education.
Mo Wen hesitated as he looked at his coworker, Old Zhang, on the ground. His dream was to become a doctor, and he had some understanding of simple and common diseases and their pathology. As for acute myocardial infarction, he knew there were several emergency measures that could alleviate the condition.
But these days, who dares to save people casually? It's a good thing to save someone successfully, but if the rescue fails and the patient suffers any consequences, the responsibility might fall on him.
Unfortunately, society is so realistic that perhaps simply taking some emergency measures, alleviating the condition, and prolonging the time of death could save a life. However, Mo Wen, like the others around him, did not dare to step forward and help rashly.
Taking a deep breath, he fell silent for a moment, and finally sighed, stepping towards the sick Old Zhang. He was not a do-gooder, but he had a good relationship with Old Zhang. They were both poor rural people who came to work, deeply understanding each other's hardships. Old Zhang was the pillar of his entire family, and he couldn't bear to watch him die with his own eyes.
"Don't touch him, I'm a doctor."
A graceful figure ran from a distance, passing through the messy construction site and jogging to the scene of the incident.
Mo Wen was momentarily stunned and stopped walking subconsciously. A fragrant breeze blew, and a graceful figure appeared in front of him.
She was a beautiful girl with a tall and slender figure, only half a head shorter than Mo Wen. She wore a light beige floral dress that fell to her knees, revealing a pair of delicate and fair legs. As she ran, her dress fluttered, making her look charming and attractive.
Mo Wen couldn't help but stare, captivated by the sight. He spent every day squatting at the construction site, watching young girls pass by, but this was the first time he had seen such a beautiful girl! Her naturally stunning, unadorned face lingered in his mind. Without makeup, she was still breathtakingly gorgeous.
He discovered that the girl in the white skirt was the same woman whose figure he had secretly admired from across the street earlier. Now he realized that not only did she have a great figure, but her face was also exceptionally beautiful.
The girl ignored Mo Wen and directly squatted down to check on Old Zhang's condition. Soon, her beautiful face changed, as if the situation was quite serious.
Without asking, it was clear that the patient was experiencing shock at this time, and the situation was not optimistic.
"Can you help me?"
The girl raised her head anxiously and looked at Mo Wen, who was the closest to the patient at the time, and naturally sought his help first.
Sure!
Mo Wen was taken aback for a moment, not expecting the girl to ask for his help, but he quickly reacted and hurried to her side.
"Can you help me straighten his body and slightly lift his legs?" The girl carefully performed chest compressions on Old Zhang while speaking to Mo Wen.
Mo Wen already knew some methods to alleviate myocardial infarction and quickly followed the girl's instructions. He knew that the girl's method was correct; raising the patient's legs was to prevent the patient's brain from being deprived of oxygen due to shock. In the absence of oxygen tanks and other equipment, this was the best solution.
He suddenly found that his chest was getting hotter and hotter, as if a red-hot iron was sticking to it. His face changed slightly, and he subconsciously touched his chest, only to find that it was the eight-diagram plate that had been excavated from the blue ancient brick.
Anlin stood on the top of the high-rise building, facing the noisy wind.
The howling wind and the sudden feeling of weightlessness from the rapid descent made him scream, even though he had nothing left to live for. "Help! ! !"
The fear of impending death enveloped him, causing every part of his body to tremble.
At that moment, Anlin's entire body was suddenly enveloped by a mysterious white light.
The terrible sensation of being overweight also came at this moment, and he felt as if he was riding a roller coaster, rushing to the bottom, then making an arc, and flying into the sky.
Anlin's scream continued as his body flew into the sky and then landed back on the rooftop.
The intense feeling of alternating between extreme weight and weightlessness, along with the sensation of life and death, made An Lin feel dizzy and then uncontrollably vomit.
"Hey, hey, young man, are you feeling better?" Just then, a faint voice reached An Lin's ear.
He looked up and saw an old man looking at him with a loving expression on his face.
The old man had white hair and beard, an immortal aura, and was surrounded by golden celestial energy, giving him a pure and flawless appearance.
Upon witnessing this scene, An Lin's whole body trembled, and countless emotions surged in his heart.
Various scenes began to emerge in Anlin's mind, and wasn't the beginning of all these fantasies right in front of her eyes!
Puff!
An Lin bowed deeply, with tears in his eyes, and said, "Immortal, thank you for saving me!"
The old man, who was called an immortal by An Lin, gently stroked his white beard and smiled faintly, "Young man, you are in the prime of your life, why do you choose to end it so prematurely?"
"My mother passed away early, and my father was addicted to gambling." "After losing the house in gambling, my father owed millions in gambling debts that he couldn't repay, and then he ran away alone!"
"Millions! What can I use to pay it back?"
"After that, I was forced to drop out of school and work as a laborer for my creditor."
Anlin tearfully poured out her feelings, feeling that her life was bleak. A life spent repaying debts was no different from a salted fish, and it would be better to reincarnate sooner.
After hearing An Lin's story, the immortal also had a sympathetic look in his eyes. He slowly said, "Young man, your life is really hard... Well, since we met, it must be fate. And I see that you have excellent qualifications, so why don't I give you a 'system' to help you change your life?"
Upon hearing this, An Lin shuddered. He originally thought that it was a great fortune to form a connection with the immortal, but he didn't expect the immortal to be so generous, giving him a system as soon as they met!
"Wuwuwu, immortal grandfather, you are really too good to me! I really don't know how to repay you!"
The immortal smiled kindly, raised his palm towards the sky, and immediately a pure white light sphere appeared in his palm.
"Young man, come here and hold this light ball in your palm," the immortal said to An Lin.
Upon hearing this, An Lin was extremely excited and couldn't wait to grasp the light sphere.
The light sphere in his hand emitted a gentle warmth, and the radiance it revealed was incredibly soft.
"Initiate system transfer," the immortal said slowly.
As soon as the immortal's words fell, the light on the white sphere shone brightly!
At this moment, the immortal said to An Lin, "Young man, make a vow to accept this War God system and never abandon it in your life!"
War God System?
What a powerful name!
However, how does this vow sound like a marriage declaration?
Without time to think, An Lin hastily said, "I swear to accept the War God system and never leave it for my entire life!"
As soon as Anlin finished his vow, the light ball made a whooshing sound and directly collided with his body, merging with him as one.
Immediately after, a voice sounded in his mind: "Host detected with a Heavenly Dark Dao physique, meeting the qualifications, system begins to merge!"
Anlin was so excited that he wanted to cry.
Originally thought that their life was bleak, but unexpectedly turned around, and actually welcomed the life of a cheat system at this moment!
The immortal was also very excited, and so excited that he had already cried!
"Old immortal grandfather, what's wrong with you? Are you alright?" Seeing the old man's strange behavior, An Lin curiously asked.
The immortal came to his senses, wiped away his tears, and realized he had lost his composure.
"Young man, after obtaining the system, you must work hard," the immortal said earnestly.
"Um! I will!" An Lin nodded heavily.
"So, do you want to go to school to cultivate immortality?" the immortal asked.
Going to school to cultivate immortality? Only a fool would refuse, right?
"Oh, I really want to cultivate immortality!"
Anlin answered almost without thinking. The immortal smiled with satisfaction, took out a golden piece of paper, and handed it to Anlin, saying, "This is my recommendation letter. With it, you can go to the Immortal Union University to study and officially embark on the path of cultivation."
An Lin was shocked to find that even the immortals had paved the way for Long Aotian's cultivation journey!
He solemnly took the recommendation letter from the immortal and looked at him with gratitude on his face.
Anlin was very curious about the immortal who had given him a new life.
"Well, let's not talk about the name." The immortal gently stroked Anlin's head, with a sympathetic expression on his face.
"I have to go now, young man, goodbye."
The immortal said goodbye to An Lin and then rode away on clouds and mist.
"Farewell, immortal!" An Lin gratefully bowed to the immortal flying towards the sky.
From the sky came the laughter of immortals, that laughter was incredibly hearty and unrestrained, as if venting a lifetime of grievances.
Why is this immortal so happy, it seems even happier than me?
An Lin looked puzzled.
At that moment, a woman's voice echoed in Anlin's consciousness: "Hello."
The woman's voice was enchanting and melodious, like heavenly music, making An Lin shiver all over.
Is this the sound of the system?
An Lin was uncertain and doubtful.
At this moment, an interface appeared in Anlin's mind.
The interface was gray and white, with only a few words displayed on it: The functions of the War God System will be activated after entering the Primordial Continent.
What is the Taichu Continent?
Anlin thought of the recommendation letter given by the immortal, and he unfolded the golden paper in his hand with great anticipation.
Next, he discovered that there was nothing inside the golden paper, only a slightly indented handprint.
Anlin was somewhat puzzled, but still followed the flow and placed his hand on the paper, overlapping with the handprint.
Suddenly, the paper shone brightly with golden light, and An Lin only had time to exclaim in surprise before being completely engulfed by the golden light.
An Lin only felt a whirl of dizziness, and his vision went from pitch black to bright once again.
Then he found himself in mid-air again, beginning to free fall.
Anlin experienced the feeling of jumping off a building once again, and no matter how many times he went through it, that thrilling sensation always brought tears to his eyes.
Anlin struggled to lift his head, and then saw a scene he would never forget in his life.
Two white dragon gate pillars, reaching a hundred feet high, stood between the sky, with mysterious characters engraved on the plaque above that he could not understand.
Beyond the gate, there were countless palaces, with no end in sight.
Colorful clouds floated around the palace, various mythical creatures soared between heaven and earth, presenting a magnificent and grand celestial atmosphere.
An Lin stood still, his face full of shock.
It turns out that there really are fairylands in this world!
Anlin tried to calm her emotions and settle herself down.
After a while, he saw a woman in a Taoist robe approaching and quickly went up to greet her.
"Hello, fairy sister," An Lin waved to the woman.
The beautiful woman saw An Lin waving at her and walked over.
Seeing the situation, An Lin asked somewhat excitedly, "Beautiful fairy sister, may I ask what place this is? I am new here and don't know much about it."
Upon hearing An Lin's words, the woman's expression became somewhat strange, and then she said, "Ji Li Gu Lu?"
"Ah, what did you say?" An Lin was somewhat puzzled.
The woman showed the same expression as An Lin and asked, "Ji li gu lu wa lie ji li?"
At this moment, An Lin was confused, and a terrible conjecture appeared in his mind.
"Sister Fairy, can you speak Mandarin?" An Lin's eyes were a little moist.
"Gurgle gurgle wajiji?" The beautiful woman put her hands on her hips, somewhat angry.
It's over, there's a language barrier.
What is she talking about? I can't understand at all!
Nani?! In the end, An Lin cried.
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
"Roar!"
On a platform, hundreds of people gathered together, screaming and cheering, surrounded by dozens of cars, most of which were supercars.
The most eye-catching spot is the two cars that are about to start racing.
One was the most expensive car in the field, a bright red Ferrari 488 worth over four million, and the one next to it was the cheapest, a Ford Mustang worth five hundred thousand, forming a striking contrast between the two cars.
This is a showdown between the newly-promoted young master Liu Feng in the capital and one of the former top four young masters, Zhang Han.
Beside the Ford Mustang, Zhang Han leaned silently against the car door, his clothes disheveled and his hair long. His bangs covered his eyes when he looked down, making it impossible for people to see his tightly closed eyes. From the lower half of his chiseled face that was exposed, one could still vaguely see the unique handsomeness of the young master Zhang from the past, but his current temperament had become full of decadence.
As for Liu Feng, he was in the crowd on the right, like the center of attention, his expression seemingly saying that the whole world was at his feet.
"Let's go take a look at the once high and mighty Young Master Zhang."
Liu Feng waved his hand, a cold smile appearing at the corner of his mouth as he took the lead and walked over.
"Zhang Dashao?"
"Are you asleep? The once arrogant Young Master Zhang has now become so down and out. Tsk tsk, the competition is about to begin, and you're still acting indifferent, my Young Master Zhang!"
"He looks like a beggar to me now!"
"No, I think he's even worse off than a beggar, maybe he's living on pig food."
On the side of the Ford Mustang, there stood a chubby man with glasses, and beside his leg was a three or four-year-old little girl.
The little girl looked like a delicate porcelain doll, wearing a white dress and having a delicate little face like a lovely princess from a fairy tale. Except for her slightly messy hair, everything else was perfect. However, at this moment, the little girl's clear big eyes were filled with tears of grievance. As she listened to the people's accusations against Zhang Han, she seemed to be on the verge of crying.
If it were an ordinary day, the little girl's cute appearance would probably attract a lot of attention, but now, it was Liu Feng's solo performance time.
A burst of ridicule and abuse finally elicited a slight reaction from Zhang Han.
When Zhang Han opened his eyes, there was a moment of confusion in his gaze. Seeing the actions of the people in front of him, his eyes narrowed, and his expression was filled with a sense of disdain for the world.
"How dare you insignificant ants bark in front of me?"
Suddenly, such an inexplicable sentence burst out of Zhang Han's mouth.
The entire room fell silent, but the next moment, a wave of sarcastic laughter erupted.
"Zhang Han, are you out of your mind?"
"I'm afraid I've turned into a fool."
The crowd began to mock again, but when Zhang Han saw the scene before him, he was stunned.
"Isn't this when I was racing with Liu Feng on Wolf Mountain in 2009?"
"How did I end up here?"
"Am I not going through a heavenly tribulation?"
"Could it be... I've returned?"
"I was reborn by the nine heavenly thunderbolts of the tribulation?" A tremor flashed in Zhang Han's eyes.
In Zhang Han's memory, five years ago, the Zhang family was one of the eight major families in the capital. Zhang Han's father was the head of the family at the time, so Zhang Han was fearless. However, during a family trip by plane, they encountered a crash halfway through, resulting in the deaths of his parents and sister. His second uncle, Zhang Ming, took over as the head of the family, but he couldn't prevent the decline of the Zhang family.
At that time, Zhang Han was deeply affected and believed that his family had been victimized. He began to investigate Zhang Ming, who had always been hostile to his father, but was discovered. In addition, Zhang Han had offended many people before, and was eventually driven out of the Zhang family.
It has been five years since Zhang Han refused to leave, always wanting to investigate the matter thoroughly. Despite the hardships, he persisted until this incident at Wolf Mountain.
I remember when I was racing in the Wolf Mountain, I had a serious accident, lost both of my arms, struggled for five years, and eventually committed suicide by jumping off a cliff. Unexpectedly, I entered the world of cultivation. When I first started practicing immortality, Zhang Han awakened his innate supernatural power - the Treasure-sniffing Nose, which allowed him to smell the aura of treasures within a certain range.
With this magical power, Zhang Han managed to accumulate his cultivation to the extreme using various treasures over the course of five hundred years.
"Why not five years ago?"
Zhang Han's expression revealed a hint of desolation.
Not fulfilling filial piety has always been the greatest regret in Zhang Han's heart. Before his family members passed away, he was young and reckless, causing a lot of trouble for his father and saying many hurtful words to his mother. No matter how much he regrets it, he cannot undo what has been done.
Filial piety is the most important virtue; although Zhang Han initially rebelled, his love for his parents in his heart was no less than that of others.
The tree desires stillness, but the wind does not cease; the child wishes to care for their parents, but they do not wait.
"Zhang Han!"
A cold voice interrupted Zhang Han's contemplation, and when he looked up, he saw Liu Feng staring at him with a chilling gaze.
Five years ago, you drove me out of the capital city!
Five years later, today, I, Liu Feng, the king of cars in Los Angeles, have made a strong comeback, while you, Zhang Han, are living a life worse than a pig or a dog! Remember, today I, Liu Feng, will make you, Zhang Han, leave Beijing horizontally!
"Oh, really?" Zhang Han exclaimed in disbelief and refused, "Then I won't compete."
"Zhang Han!"
Liu Feng shook the Ferrari keys in his hand and said, "As long as you beat me, this car is yours." "Well, I can't refuse such a generous offer."
Zhang Hanmei said with a smile in her eyes.
"Heh."
Liu Feng sneered and raised his hand to order the people around him, "Set up the screen!"
As the words fell, several television screens were set up behind the crowd, and remote-controlled drones were simultaneously raised in various places around Wolf Mountain. The screens were turned on, and the cameras on each drone transmitted images, reflecting the entire racecourse of Wolf Mountain.
"Let's get started!"
Liu Feng secretly nodded at the chubby guy with glasses behind the Ford Mustang and got into the Ferrari.
"Daddy, come on, beat the bad guys."
"How can such a cute little girl casually call someone 'Dad'?"
Zhang Han shook his head with a smile.
"Han, you can definitely win!"
The chubby guy clenched his fist at Zhang Han, making an encouraging expression.
"May your words bring good fortune; your car will bring me good luck."
Zhang Han glanced at him lightly and sat sideways in the wild horse cart.
"Get ready!"
The angry roar of the engines from both cars simultaneously.
Inside the Ferrari, Liu Feng's mouth curled up with a smug smile.
The chubby person at the back let out a meaningful smile.
The lovely princess at his feet had a look full of fear and worry in her eyes, tears welling up, making her appear pitiful and endearing.
Meanwhile, in the wild horse carriage, Zhang Han had a faint cold smile at the corner of his mouth.
"Are you conspiring together to harm me?"
"Unfortunately, I am not the same as I used to be." "Even without any cultivation now, how could you ants provoke me?"
Chapter One
Rusty Lake.
Federal Special Waste Disposal Site No. 23.
Also known as the "Treasure Tomb."
With the continuous development of the cultivation civilization, the magical treasures that were once high above and could only be driven by cultivators have entered thousands of households, becoming essential tools for ordinary people in their daily lives, travel, study, and work.
While providing convenience in life, it also generated a large amount of discarded magical treasures and metal waste.
These trash treasures often contain a lot of residual spiritual power, which can easily cause radiation pollution. The formation of the treasures is extremely unstable and even has the risk of explosion. If left unchecked, it can cause great damage to the environment.
Therefore, around every major city in the federation, there are several "special waste disposal sites" dedicated to handling scrapped magical treasures.
The 23rd Special Waste Disposal Site is located in the southern suburbs of the federal refining town "Fuguo City."
Under the dim sky, a polluted purple swamp emitted a strong stench, and metal fragments formed mountain peaks like hundreds of dinosaur backs emerging from the swamp. The peaks were filled with broken flying swords inserted haphazardly, and beside them sat rusty crystal puppets, their hollow eye sockets long extinguished of spiritual fire. Only small insects that fed on spiritual energy poked their heads out, cautiously observing this dangerous "treasure graveyard."
"Boom!"
Countless metal components scattered like celestial flowers, causing a chain reaction of collapses in the surrounding garbage hills, raising dust and smoke that filled the sky like dancing demons, obscuring the entire sky.
Here, it seems to be a forbidden zone for life, with only insignificant cockroaches and worms considering it a paradise.
Li Yao lay hidden behind a pile of garbage, licking his cracked lips. His dusty yellow windbreaker was covered in dirt, blending him seamlessly into the environment.
Glancing at the rising explosion cloud not far away, the teenager's clear eyes did not reveal any emotions, remaining calm and undisturbed.
It was only when dirt and metal fragments splashed onto the garbage pile where he was hiding that he shrank slightly deeper into the pile and put on goggles that covered half of his face.
"Here it comes!"
At 3:52:38 pm, the daily routine garbage dumping time, it is also the carnival moment for Li Yao and other "garbage bugs"!
The spirit watch on his left wrist, a hunting-specific model introduced by the cultivation sect "Flying Spirit Sect" three years ago, took him a full two months to repair after he found it in a garbage dump.
In addition to keeping time, it also has a powerful function that can record vibrations at specific frequencies and notify the owner when specific vibrations are detected nearby.
This feature was originally designed to alert hunters to the possible presence of powerful monsters nearby.
After Li Yao's modification, it became a reminder that the garbage ship was about to appear.
A moment later, accompanied by a faint buzzing sound, a dozen black dots appeared on the northern horizon.
At this time, the smoke and dust from the explosion had not yet dissipated, and more than a dozen small black spots were mixed in, making it impossible to distinguish clearly.
Li Yao shrugged his nose and lightly touched a rune on the side of the wind mirror. "Whoosh," a blood-red color appeared on the surface of the wind mirror.
Under the scanning of the red light, the garbage ship hidden behind the smoke and dust was outlined with a round and rolling shape, clearly visible.
The hunting function of the Lingzi watch also firmly locked onto the special vibration frequency of one of the garbage ships.
"Garbage ship number 1327, that's you!"
From birth to the age of ten, Li Yao had spent ten years in the magical treasure tomb, knowing every inch of the land and every garbage ship in the sky like the back of his hand. The "Garbage Ship No. 1327" was specifically responsible for collecting garbage from the "Upper East District" of Fuguo City.
The Upper East Side is the most luxurious and wealthy area in the city, with many cultivators living there, and the treasures they discard are the most valuable.
Many magical treasures were still intact, but were discarded carelessly by cultivators and wealthy people simply because they were slightly outdated or a new generation of products had been introduced.
For Li Yao, this was not a garbage ship at all, but a treasure ship loaded with gold mines!
"Whoosh!"
Li Yaoshuang exerted force with both feet, shooting out like a bullet, rushing wildly between the garbage mountains, heading towards the smoke and dust, and towards the "No. 1327 garbage ship"!
Surrounded by crumbling garbage mountains and standing on a bubbling toxic swamp, Li Yao moved like the most agile monkey in the forest, occasionally using protruding parts of the garbage piles for leverage. Each step propelled him dozens of meters away, his movements smooth and pleasing to the eye.
"Li Yao, you bastard, you're stealing food from me again!"
At that moment, more than a dozen figures emerged from behind several garbage hills, dressed similarly to Li Yao, but without wearing his advanced blood-red goggles and spiritual wristwatch.
These people were holding shovels and iron bars, coming aggressively.
Like Li Yao, they all relied on the "No. 23 Special Garbage Disposal Site" for their livelihood as garbage worms.
Where there are benefits, there are struggles. Shiploads of abandoned treasures may be just garbage to the high and mighty cultivators, but for these impoverished people, they are the hope of survival. Li Yao is the best scavenger in the treasure tomb, and naturally, he is a thorn in the side of most other scavengers.
Li Yao didn't care at all, chuckled, suddenly exerted force on his waist, and his figure strangely bent, unexpectedly turning ninety degrees without any warning. He dodged a chubby teenager with angry eyebrows in front of him and took the opportunity to step heavily on the fat face. With this step, he swept out another thirty or forty meters.
"Fat Dragon, we all come out to make a living, and it's all about who's faster. You need to lose weight!"
The obese teenager had a huge red mark on his face, his nose almost sinking into his fat, angrily yelling and commanding his subordinates to chase relentlessly. The group quickly entered the dusty area.
An explosion had just occurred here, making the area extremely unstable, with dozens of garbage hills at risk of collapsing at any moment. Even the vicious Fat Dragon gang of teenagers couldn't help but slow down their pace as they entered this place, watching Li Yaofeng speed away.
Fat Dragon couldn't help but spit.
Before the words fell, another explosion occurred inside a garbage mountain not far from Li Yao, and tens of thousands of tons of metal components and broken magical treasures rushed down like a flash flood!
So amazing!
Suddenly, a scream came from the smoke and dust: "Xiao Hei, save me!"
A black light more profound than the night sky shot out, spinning around in the metallic torrent, and then rushed into the sky. It was a rusty, notched, and completely black flying sword with a huge guard like black wings. Li Yao clung to the flying sword like a drowning man grasping at straws, awkwardly lying on it, surrounded by black light, and rushing towards the sky!
In the sky, more than a dozen garbage ships had already revealed their massive shapes, each one several hundred meters long, their round bodies resembling the legendary turtles that support the earth. The "turtle shells" were densely engraved with tens of thousands of runes, flashing with spiritual light and colorful, helping these tens of thousands of tons of behemoths resist the onslaught of gravity.
"Whoosh!"
The belly doors of the "giant turtles" opened, and a flood of metal components and broken treasures poured out, slamming heavily onto the ground.
For a moment, the spiritual energy between heaven and earth stirred wildly, setting off a storm of shocking waves!
Even garbage ships weighing tens of thousands of tons swayed and shook violently in the psychic wave, having to desperately separate to reduce interference.
Feilong and the others did not dare to approach easily, fearing being affected.
Li Yao still rode the black flying sword, darting left and right through the waves of spiritual power. Although he looked extremely embarrassed, he was as agile as an eel.
He certainly didn't dare to confront the raging waves head-on, but relied on his decades of survival experience to find relatively calm safe areas between the spiritual tide, just to get as close as possible to the landing point of the trash treasure, and take advantage of the proximity.
After nearly ten minutes of dumping, the garbage ship let out a monstrous roar, changed direction, and lazily returned, with the dust gradually dissipating.
Fat Dragon finally managed to crawl into the densely packed dumping center, only to see Li Yaoshu sitting comfortably on a brand new pile of garbage, smiling at him.
"Damn it!"
The fat dragon's face trembled with flabby flesh, but deep down, he was quite conflicted.
The garbage mountain chosen by Li Yao was quite clever; it was not the largest one, nor did it appear to be the most resource-rich.
There are also dozens of garbage mountains scattered around, containing valuable garbage treasures.
If they continued to entangle with Li Yao here, they might end up being taken advantage of by other garbage worms.
Around the edges, the silhouettes of other garbage worms began to appear, and cheers could be heard from many garbage hills, indicating that someone had found something valuable.
Feilong heard that Li Yao, the stinky kid, was also a student of the famous "Chixiao Sect Affiliated Second High School" in Fuguo City.
The Chixiao Sect is a well-known and powerful sect in the southern part of the Federation, with numerous strong and skilled members.
Although Li Yao may not have learned any real skills, he was not someone who could be easily dealt with by a few punches and kicks. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to wander around the magical treasure tomb alone for more than a decade, still alive and kicking, and even earned the nickname "Vulture."
But if he just leaves like this, where will he put his face?
His nose was still embedded in the flesh! As he struggled internally, a strong gust of wind swept by, and Fat Dragon instinctively reached out to grab something. It was cold to the touch, and turned out to be a discarded crystal brain the size of a fist.
Li Yao grinned and said, "Fat Dragon, we're all just trying to make a living. It's not like I killed your father just because I snatched a 'Starlight' level crystal brain from you last time. Is it really necessary to be so relentless? Look, I just found a 'Qinglongmen' refined 'Xiaolong 17' crystal brain, the most advanced model, which can process over 5,000 thoughts per second. Although it's burnt out, I estimate it can still sell for three or four thousand. Let me offer it to you as a tribute, Brother Fat Dragon, and from then on, we'll be even. How about that?"
"You..." Fat Dragon didn't expect Li Yao to pull such a stunt, and was momentarily stunned, scratching the fat on his face in disbelief.
"Hey, look over there, the 'Wild Wolf Gang' is coming. They're not like me, a lone traveler. They'll definitely devour dozens of garbage mountains, not even leaving a single screw for you!" Li Yao pointed to the west.
"Good job, kid! You've got skills! Let's go and quickly grab the goods!"
A group of garbage bugs scattered and rushed towards the garbage mountains in all directions.
Li Yaochang let out a long sigh, plopped down onto the garbage heap, sweat the size of soybeans rolling down his forehead, and his smiling face instantly turned into a mournful one.
"Fatso, the 'Snapdragon' level crystal brain I discovered with great difficulty has been taken advantage of by you for nothing!"
"Just wait and see, is it that easy to take something from me, 'Vulture Li Yao'?"
One day, you'll have to spit out what you've eaten from me, return what you've taken from me, plus interest, calculated at usurious rates, so you'll know why everyone calls me 'the money-hungry vulture who values money over life'!
"No, we must speed up. The 'Wild Wolf Gang' is even more unreasonable than Fat Dragon!"
"Mom, how many times have I told you, I'm going to save people, not commit suicide!"
"Don't lie to me, you can't even dog paddle, let alone save someone! Besides, there's no one in the river!"
Wang Yao was speechless. Today, he came down from the mountain and saw someone falling into the river by the village. He hurriedly jumped in to save them, only to realize that he couldn't swim. Even more ironically, the person who fell into the water wasn't a person at all, but a very realistic inflatable doll.
"Can't believe someone in the village is actually using something so trendy?!"
This was his last thought before losing consciousness, and when he woke up again, he was lying on the kang at his own home, with his parents beside him, their brows furrowed with worry.
Less than a day later, the entire village knew that the foolish university student who had contracted the mountain to plant medicinal herbs had become despondent and committed suicide by jumping into the river. "These kids nowadays, they haven't experienced setbacks and can't handle the blows!"
"That kid must have messed up in school, which current prestigious university student would return home to farm?"
"Exactly!"
"We're not growing this medicine anymore!"
The father, who had been squatting and smoking a pipe, blurted out these words in anger. The villagers cared about their reputation, and these rumors made Old Wang feel uneasy. Moreover, if they continued to plant, they might lose not only money, but also their son.
"Exactly, listen to your mother this time, stop growing herbs, and let your sister help you find a decent job in the city. Your cousin from your Uncle Changmao's family, who just graduated from an unknown school, found a job in the city and is even buying a house there!" Wang Yao's mother also chimed in.
After hearing this, Wang Yao no longer argued with his parents and could only nod in agreement.
He was a graduate from a prestigious university. After graduation, he returned to his rural village with great enthusiasm and started his own business by contracting a barren mountain in the village, intending to grow medicinal herbs and make a fortune. However, when he actually started working, he realized that growing medicinal herbs was far from as simple as he had imagined. Pure enthusiasm was not enough, and many things were not covered in textbooks, but could only be learned through practice and experience.
In the first year, the herbs he planted were infested with pests, resulting in a total loss. In the second year, the herbs bloomed and grew leaves but did not grow roots. Now in the third year, just when things seemed to be improving, another problem has arisen.
But after feeling better, he went up to the South Mountain, a barren mountain that, perhaps due to the soil, didn't grow crops well, but had a dozen or so large chestnut and jujube trees. On the mountain was a large gentle slope, where he had painstakingly cultivated a few acres of medicinal fields. For this, he had even paid to have a small house built on the mountain, with electricity installed, specifically to look after these few acres of medicinal fields. Through wind and rain, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, he had devoted three years of hard work. To give up, he really couldn't bear to.
Looking at the thriving herbs, he reached out and touched them.
Why not try for another year?
"Herb detected, trigger condition met, activate system?"
A cold mechanical voice suddenly sounded.
"What sound, who?!"
Surrounded by mountains, water, and forests, there was not a person in sight.
"Sigh, could it be a hallucination?"
"Activate the system?"
The sound of machinery rang out again, seemingly just a few steps away.
"There's a ghost!"
Wang Yao shuddered all over.
Pharmacist system?
As soon as he uttered these words, a light screen appeared in front of him, very much like the character panel in Wang You's story.
It must be an illusion.
He shook his head vigorously, and the light screen that appeared out of nowhere disappeared.
Woof, woof, woof, just at this moment, a mongrel rushed down from the mountain and came to his side, panting with its tongue out, wagging its tail, looking very happy.
"Sanxian, where have you gone again?"
This is Wang Yao's mongrel, who has accompanied him on this mountain for three years. The man and the dog entered the small mountain hut, and Wang Yao lay down on the bed, feeling a bit dizzy.
"What on earth was that just now?"
He recited the name of the spell again, and the light curtain reappeared as if projected.
"Here we go again!"
After several trials, Wang Yao confirmed that this was not an illusion, but something real that could not be explained by science. It had character attributes, skills, and packages, much like an online game.
Professional rank: Rookie (Actually, you can't even be considered a bird, at most an egg!
Physique 1, strength 0.9, spirit 0.85, agility 0.9, willpower 1.1 (1 being the average level of a normal adult male).
Is this true? He was completely fooled.
Great, he's planting medicinal herbs right now, just what we need! Wang Yao, who had come back to his senses, jumped up excitedly, startling the "Three Fresh" next to him.
There's another skill panel? Wang Yao wanted to click but couldn't see it.
"Why can't it be opened?" he asked subconsciously.
"If you can't even grow herbs properly, you might as well go shovel shit!"
Seemingly hearing his question, a line of text popped up on the panel.
What the hell, what's going on? Who designed this, come out, I promise I won't kill you! "What is this?"
Wang You looked in the parcel column and found a symbol that looked like a water bottle.
The ancient spring pot contains ancient spring water, one bucket a day.
How to use it, just reach out and take it?
With a slight movement of Wang Yaonian's head, a wooden water bottle appeared in his hand. It was antique-looking and had a certain weight to it. When gently shaken, the sound of water could be heard inside.
"Is there really water! Ancient spring water?"
He found a bucket in the room and poured out the water from the kettle. Despite the kettle being small, the water kept flowing until the entire bucket was filled.
Isn't it amazing?
Wang Yao stared blankly at the water in the bucket, which was very clean and pure. He scooped up a handful and put it in his mouth, finding it very sweet.
Delicious!
He picked up the bowl on the table, scooped it up and drank, not stopping until he had drunk three large bowls. After drinking this water, he felt much more comfortable, and his fatigue was gone.
Woof woof woof, the three fresh ones circled around the water bucket.
"Come, have a drink too."
Wang Yao also filled a bowl with water for it, which the dog quickly drank up. Then it started barking again, wagging its tail, clearly it hadn't had enough.
"Fine, drink to your heart's content!"
This person and dog drank almost half a bucket of water, and if they weren't so full, they probably would have finished the whole bucket.
Wang Yao had never tasted such sweet water in his life.
Chapter One: I Want to Lose Weight!
In the scorching summer, the Chi Yun Rainforest located in the eastern part of the Federation is shrouded in mist, like a thin veil surrounding it. The towering ancient trees crisscross, and from the lush canopy, occasionally a few birds soar into the sky, squawking as they fly across the horizon.
In the sky, the sun, which seemed to exist eternally, was no longer as people remembered it. Years ago, it was pierced directly by an indescribably large ancient bronze sword, revealing half of its tip!
This ancient sword, seemingly having experienced countless eons, came from the stars, exuding endless vicissitudes. It also emitted a strong pressure, forming a halo that enveloped the sky, as if it could suppress the earth and make all beings worship!
From a distance, this scene of the Jianyang rainforest looked like a painting, until the humming sound from afar broke the silence. A large red hot air balloon was slowly flying over the rainforest.
The hot air balloon cabin was large enough to accommodate hundreds of people, and many young men and women could be seen in groups on the deck, occasionally bursting into laughter and chatter.
They were students from Phoenix City who had been admitted to one of the four federal Taoist academies, the Piaomiao Taoist Academy. They were travelling thousands of miles on this airship belonging to the Piaomiao Taoist Academy to study there.
Perhaps due to the anticipation of studying, the journey was not dull for these young men and women. There was a vague attraction between the sexes, which added a certain pleasure to this long journey.
Due to the long journey, this airship was equipped with areas such as a restaurant, a spiritual room, and a medical room.
At this moment, in the restaurant of the airship, there were many students, and next to one of the dining tables sat a chubby little boy with a protruding belly.
The chubby boy, about seventeen or eighteen years old, was dressed in a loose blue robe. His round face could barely be considered handsome. He was patting his belly, making a popping sound, while regretfully looking at the seven or eight empty plates in front of him.
"Eating this meal will make me gain three pounds, how could I not resist? If I want to become the President, I can't die young."
The chubby boy frowned and regretted deeply, letting out a burp. This chubby boy is named Wang Baole, who is also a student who passed the entrance exam to the Piaomiao Taoist Academy this time. His lifelong dream is to become an official, and he regards becoming the president of the federation as his lifelong pursuit. The reason for having such a great ideal is inseparable from his childhood experience.
In his memory, when he was young, his father often patted his head with deep emotion and sighed.
"Bao Le, it's good to be an official. Remember, although money can solve everything, you can still be bullied. If you don't want to be bullied, you have to become an official, a person above others."
At first, Wang Baole didn't understand, until he was in elementary school. Because he didn't hand in his homework on time, he was scolded by the class monitor. After he gave the monitor two pieces of candy, he was reported to the teacher by the monitor. All of this left an indelible mark on his young mind.
From that moment on, he wanted to be the class monitor, not to bully others, but to prevent himself from being bullied.
As he grew up, he realized that there were many others who could bully the class leader, so he thought that if he became the highest official, that is, the Federal President, no one would dare to bully him. The reason he worked hard to get into the elusive Taoist Academy was because all the high officials in the Federation graduated from the four major Taoist academies.
He was just unlucky, his family lineage was very peculiar, he still remembers that night a year ago, his emaciated father in the family ancestral hall, showed him the family tree.
It was the first time Wang Baole saw the family tree, and he clearly saw that every generation of ancestors who weighed more than 200 pounds died young and did not live past 35.
That night, Wang Baole had a dream... before he could become the president of the federation, he was reunited with those chubby grandfathers.
In the following year, for him, losing weight had reached a certain height. Even after the Federation entered the Spirit Yuan era, with the richness of spiritual energy and the resurgence of ancient martial arts, there were various methods of losing weight. However, Wang Baole had almost tried them all, but his weight was still steadily increasing.
The emergence of memories made Wang Baole grit his teeth and resolve to diet again tomorrow.
With such a decision made, Wang Baole suddenly felt a lot less pressure. He hummed a tune while picking his teeth, looking up at the blue sky outside the distant window, his mind also began to become more active.
"I don't know if Dr. Lu liked the gift I gave him. It was an antique I took from home. That old guy should like it, right?"
Wang Baole comforted himself, thinking that as long as he got close to Doctor Lu, he would have a small backing in the Taoist temple in the future.
"The old man's power is limited, but he will send some gifts in the future. However, this Dr. Lu is of a great age and must have a wide network. I think I have taken the right step."
Thinking of this, Wang Baole was very pleased, feeling that he had taken another step closer to the position of the Federation President.
He was confident in his ability to become the President, a confidence largely derived from his lifelong study of autobiographies of high-ranking officials, from which he even summarized a few killer moves for being an official.
Feeling happy and content at this moment, Wang Baole looked out at the blue sky and found it exceptionally beautiful.
But soon, his eyes widened abruptly, noticing a black cloud gathering in the distant sky, spreading as if to cover the heavens. Within it, thunder and lightning flashed, slowly approaching. This scene also caught the attention of many students, causing exclamations of surprise.
Wang Baole was also taken aback. After the Federation entered the Spirit Yuan era, the emergence of spiritual energy led to the birth of many astonishing phenomena in the world. The previous flying objects were no longer safe, leading to the birth of hot air balloon airships driven by spirit stones.
With continuous exclamations, the thunderous roar suddenly came, the loud noise was shocking, and you could see the distant thunderclouds growing rapidly, with lightning already spreading inside, like a large black net, flickering across the sky, dazzling and shocking, making one's heartbeat involuntarily speed up, and the originally moving airship also gradually slowed down.
Just as everyone was uneasy, the restaurant door was pushed open, as if a wind was howling, and an old man in a white Taoist robe walked in. This old man had a face full of wrinkles, but he had an immortal wind and bone, a dignified face, especially his eyes were shining, and his righteousness spread all around. As soon as he arrived, his majestic voice spread throughout the restaurant.
"Everyone, report to the spirit repair room immediately, put on your magnetic spirit suits, we will enter the thunder magnetic zone in half an incense stick's time!"
As soon as the words were spoken, the students in the restaurant quickly stood up in respect.
Wang Baole's eyes lit up. The old man in front of him was Doctor Lu, to whom he had previously given a gift. Seeing the other's dragon-like momentum, Wang Baole felt more and more that his previous investment was correct. He secretly thought that this old man must be extraordinary, and he himself was even more so.
Just as he was basking in satisfaction, the old doctor glanced over and saw Wang Baole. He snorted, walked over, took out a half-black mask from his bosom, and threw it on Wang Baole.
"At such a young age, don't let your mind wander to all sorts of messy places. You haven't even entered the Taoist temple yet, but you've already learned to give gifts. I've seen a lot in my life, so keep this mask for yourself," the old doctor said solemnly, with an upright and incorruptible demeanor, as if he was reprimanding in a disappointed manner.
Wang Baole took the mask, his heart skipped a beat, realizing that the old doctor was angry. He was a bit anxious and was about to explain, but suddenly remembered one of the killer moves he had summarized from the autobiographies of those high-ranking officials. One of them was to admit mistakes in front of the boss as soon as possible, which often minimized the seriousness of the situation.
So, taking a deep breath, I quickly put on a remorseful expression and admitted my mistake.
"The teacher is right, I was wrong!"
The old doctor was somewhat taken aback, the words of reprimand he had intended to say were halted by the other party's quick admission of fault.
Seeing the old doctor's expression, Wang Baole breathed a sigh of relief and felt a bit smug, thinking to himself that this autobiography of a high official was indeed useful.
The old doctor snorted, raised his head to scan all the students in the restaurant, and pointed at everyone with his right hand.
"And you, you are all the future students of my Piaomiao Daoist Academy. Look at what you have been like these days. Always remember, as martial artists, we must first establish our character, then our words, and finally our actions!"
The old doctor's harsh words echoed through the restaurant, causing everyone to lower their heads in shame. However, Wang Baole's eyes lit up, feeling that it was his time to shine.
He quickly took out a small notebook from his pocket and started recording, occasionally looking up at the old doctor with a listening expression, and sometimes nodding seriously, as if to remember every word the other party said. This move was also his killer trick summarized from the autobiography of high officials.
The other students watched this scene, looking at Wang Baole as if he were a god.
Upon seeing this, the old doctor was momentarily stunned. An unprecedented sense of strangeness welled up in his heart. Despite having seen many students come and go, this was the first time he had encountered such an eccentric individual. He couldn't help but take a few more glances, but gradually began to sneer.
"Little guy, it's not so easy to flatter me," he said. "You should thank this magnetic storm, otherwise, I could lecture non-stop for three days and nights. I wonder if you could write it all down in your notebook!"
As soon as the old doctor spoke, the atmosphere changed dramatically. A strong aura emanated from him, as if transforming into a pressure that enveloped the entire restaurant. All the students were stunned, feeling that in this battle of wits, the old doctor was a cut above the rest.
Wang Baole blinked, touched the recording jade slip in his pocket, weighed it for a long time, and looked at the approaching thunderstorm, but still gave up the idea of taking it out. He felt that it was not shameful to be timid in front of his boss.
Seeing the expressions of the crowd, the old doctor felt proud and spoke a few more impassioned words.
"Remember, focus your mind on cultivation, and in the future, do not be greedy or unjust, and don't always think about finding a female companion. You should know that lust is like a knife hanging over your head. These days, your behavior towards each other is really inappropriate!"
Just as he was saying this, suddenly, a delicate voice floated out from the old doctor's communication bracelet.
"Doctor Grandpa, where are you? I can't tie this magnetic suit, please come and help me."
The voice was charming, and the old doctor shivered involuntarily upon hearing it. He coughed awkwardly, gave a stern glance at the crowd, and then hurriedly turned to leave, simultaneously speaking excitedly to the spirit-transmitting bracelet. "Oh, I'm coming, I'm coming. Don't worry, darling, I'm on my way to help you."
The turn of events was too abrupt, the contrast too stark, everyone was dumbfounded, even Wang Baole was stunned for a moment, it took him a while to gasp, along with the crowd's uncontrollable uproar, Wang Baole gritted his teeth and also cursed a few times.
"That old lecher, all that he said before was nonsense! There are only so many female classmates, and we don't have enough to go around. At his age, he's still competing with us for resources, just because he's an official!"
The more Wang Baole thought about it, the angrier he became. In discussions with his classmates, his dream of becoming an official became even more firm.
As the alarm intensified, everyone finally ended their discussions and went to the spirit repair room, each with resentment in their hearts.
The Spirit Repair Room, located in the core area of the airship, is, as the name suggests, a place for these students to practice, and it is also the most strictly protected area when the airship passes through special areas.
At this moment, in the spirit refining room, as everyone gathered, under the arrangement of the teacher who came with the ship from the Piaomiao Dao Institute, everyone sat in several rows, wearing the magnetic spirit suits specially issued by the Piaomiao Dao Institute for airships.
Just after putting on his magnetic suit, Wang Baole was still immersed in his resentment towards Doctor Lu. He casually looked around and his already gloomy mood worsened due to a gaze from afar. Unconsciously, he furrowed his brows and showed a look of disgust.
Where his gaze fell, there sat a girl with long slender legs, very attractive, but currently frowning, showing a disgusted expression. Clearly, in their mutual gaze, they were both familiar and extremely disgusted with each other.
"Damn it!"
Both of them muttered in their hearts, quickly avoiding each other's gaze, as if even a glance at each other was too much to bear.
"You can run into this annoying Du Min anywhere, it's so annoying!" "What's so great about him, he's just a class leader. When I get to the Taoist Academy, with my killer moves in the officialdom, I can also mix up a half official position!"
Soon after everyone was dressed and the teachers from the Piaomiao Daoist Academy who were on board had checked them one by one, they gave some precautions and sternly warned everyone that there was danger when the airship entered the magnetic storm area, and there was a certain possibility of a life-threatening crisis.
Upon seeing the change in everyone's expressions, the teachers who came with the ship solemnly left, and the door to the spirit room was directly sealed, with the lights gradually dimming.
At this moment in the spirit mending room, although there was still low conversation, as time passed, the tension became increasingly intense, gradually no one spoke, falling into complete silence.
In this silence where one could seemingly hear their own heartbeat, even Wang Baole, who was still in a state of indignation, couldn't help but become nervous. Until half an incense stick's time later, the entire airship suddenly shook, entering the thunder magnetic region!
From the outside, the entire thundercloud looked incredibly majestic, like a large mouth, swallowing the comparatively tiny hot air balloon directly.
This kind of weather, seemingly containing destructive power, capable of sweeping everything away, perhaps only the startling sword sun in the sky can ignore all, as if looking down on the world for thirty-seven years is not enough, but even longer.
This year was the 37th year of the Lingyuan era.
In the year 3029, Earth's technological development was rapid, there were no national borders, and the world had unified into a federation era. It was at this time that a large sword flew from the stars, piercing the sun, causing a sensation around the world.
The hilt of this great sword, perhaps already damaged, shattered into numerous fragments during this intense vibration, scattering across the starry sky, with some falling to various parts of the Earth.
With the arrival of the bronze great sword and the falling of the fragments, a new energy source that seemed to pervade the world and was inexhaustible suddenly appeared on Earth, which was later named... spiritual energy!
Aura is like air, dense in some places and thin in others. Due to the scattered fragments obtained by the federation and various forces, various methods of cultivation, refining tools, alchemy, and refining spirit stones were found on them. The text on them is full of ancient meanings, leading people to engage with ancient texts, becoming a trend.
The emergence of spiritual energy quickly replaced the original energy sources, changing people's lives. It not only formed a spiritual network, but also changed the course of Earth's civilization, initiating a civilization of spiritual cultivation.
From then on, the rise of ancient martial arts led to a great transformation in the world, ushering in an era where everyone practiced immortality.
Historically, it is known as the Lingyuan era.
At this moment, within the magnetic thundercloud, the slowly moving red hot air balloon airship was surrounded by countless lightning strikes. Fortunately, the soft light curtain diffused around it, providing protection and ensuring the airship's stability.
As for the core area of the cabin, the spiritual chamber, all the students including Wang Baole, were now unknowingly asleep, as if a strange force was guiding them into a dream.
Only in the main cabin at the bow of the ship, at this moment, there were seven or eight teachers, some drinking tea, some smiling, having a relaxed conversation with each other, which was completely different from the way they had scared the students before.
The leader was an old man, his face full of wrinkles, holding a smoking pipe, puffing away. If Wang Baole was here, he would definitely recognize at a glance that this old man was the shameless Doctor Lu from before.
With the start of a middle-aged teacher's speech, the old doctor who was smoking, gave a slight smile.
