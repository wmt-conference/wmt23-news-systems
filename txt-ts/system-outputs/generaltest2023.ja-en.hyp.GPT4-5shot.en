Increase in rabies infections in northeastern Thailand.
On February 9th, Dr. Tawichai of the 9th Disease Prevention and Control Office revealed that there has been an increase in rabies infections in northeastern Thailand over the past few months, with the total number of infected individuals reaching 74.
So far this fiscal year (from last October to this September), a total of 74 people have tested positive for rabies in the northeastern provinces of Surin and Buriram, with 67 and 7 people respectively.
Everyone has been vaccinated against rabies in the past.
The doctor is urging people to get rabies vaccinations with their pets and to avoid contact with the saliva of animals suspected of being infected.
Rabies can be transmitted to humans not only from dogs but also from cats and bats.
Almost 100% of people who become infected and develop symptoms will die, but vaccination before the onset of symptoms can prevent death.

The Park Chung Farm in Kyongsong County, North Hamgyong Province, located in the mountainous region, consists mostly of steep fields with poor soil.
Such farms achieved unusually high yields last year.
The achievements of the Seijin Central Zoo Feed Security Fisheries Office are significant.
The business was established in 2011 with the mission of sending seafood for feed to the Central Zoo in Pyongyang.
While exceeding the fishing plan, in recent years, they have been supporting farms in Seishin City, such as procuring agricultural materials.
However, this time the business supported a farm in the neighboring Kyongju County, not within the city of Chingjin.
Moreover, they decided to help with the "grouping" at Park Chung Farm, which is considered to have the strictest conditions in the county.

FUJI develops a system to prevent abandonment accidents, tests it on company vehicles | Chubu Economic Newspaper Economic Information for Aichi, Gifu, Mie, and Shizuoka.
FUJI, a company based in Chiryu City that manufactures and sells electronic component mounting robots and machine tools, has begun developing a system to prevent "abandonment" situations, such as children being left behind in cars.
A system where a human sensor is installed in the car, and when it detects human movement, notifications are sent to the phone or chat.
Currently, we are conducting demonstration experiments with our company's shuttle vehicles.
In the midst of heartbreaking accidents caused by abandonment, we must protect the safety of children.
Currently, we are conducting a demonstration experiment with two vehicles used for pick-up and drop-off at our own English conversation after-school program for children, "teracoya THANK," located in Chiryu City.
Install human detection sensors that detect movement from the difference in temperature between people and their surroundings in three places on the vehicle's ceiling.
If the vehicle's engine is turned off and the doors are closed, and movement is detected after a certain period of time, an automatic warning notification will be sent.
By synchronizing the state and information of the engine and doors, false detections can be minimized as much as possible.
Alert notifications are sent through the cloud.
In addition to calling pre-registered numbers, it can also display on the chat of a computer or smartphone.
Multiple addresses can be registered, and care is taken to prevent mistakes such as oversights.
The demonstration experiment will continue until around the end of February.
Kazumitsu Kamiya, the head of the second division of the Innovation Promotion Department, pointed out that "During the experiment, we started to see peripheral issues other than the system."
For example, they were able to identify various issues related to school buses, such as creating an environment where drivers can focus on driving.
"Put effort into expanding the solution," they say.
The development of the anti-abandonment system was triggered by a series of incidents across the country where children were left behind in shuttle buses.
A suggestion was made by an employee with young children, asking if there was anything that could be done to ensure the safety of their children.
The decision to develop was made with the intention of leveraging the expertise in information management using IoT (Internet of Things) and sensors, cultivated through the FA (Factory Automation) related business.
The selling point of FUJI's anti-abandonment system is its simplicity.
The sensor can be installed simply by pinning it to the ceiling.
By making it easy to retrofit onto shuttle vehicles, the aim is to lower the barrier to adoption and promote widespread use.
Moving forward, we will consider product development with the cooperation of nurseries and kindergartens.
[Editorial] The postponement of the start of construction of the Hokuriku Shinkansen from Tsuruga to Shin-Osaka, originally scheduled for the fiscal year 2023, is beginning to affect the town development west of Tsuruga in Fukui Prefecture.
In Obama City, where a new station is to be installed, the detailed location of the station has not yet been revealed, and urban planning, including the surrounding development, is at a standstill.
Formulating a plan is expected to take a long time, and there is a demand for it to be announced as soon as possible.
The planned Hokuriku Shinkansen station in Obama City will be the only new station development west of Tsuruga.
In 2019, the Railway Construction & Transport Facility Development Support Organization indicated a rough location for the station, centered around JR Higashi-Obama Station, within a radius of approximately 2.5 kilometers.
The detailed station locations and route determination were targeted for the winter of 2022.
In Obama City, full-scale operations related to the Shinkansen, looking ahead to the opening of Tsuruga and beyond to the opening of Obama, will begin in fiscal 2021.
In the initial budget for fiscal year 2022, they plan to increase the number of projects and promote urban development in anticipation of the announcement of new station locations.
However, the exact location of the new station has not been revealed yet.
The city, as a project, has set aside 3 million yen in this year's budget to formulate a basic plan, considering land use and development concepts based on the location of the new station, but it is expected to remain unexecuted.
The urban planning centered around the new station "takes time to form a consensus among citizens" (city official).
There is an example in Echizen City of a new suburban station being built in the prefecture that is not attached to an existing JR station, but it seems that it would take a considerable amount of time to put together an overall plan.
The longer the announcement is delayed, the shorter the preparation period for the opening will be, and there are concerns that this could impact the surrounding development.
There is a sense of uncertainty surrounding the extension west of Tsuruga, prior to the location of the new station.
In October last year, a citizens' group in Kyoto City on the extension route submitted a petition to the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism, demanding the cancellation of the extension plan.
In the political world of Ishikawa Prefecture, voices are calling for a reconsideration of the Maibara route following the postponement of the construction. There are successive movements to reset the route setting, which was considered settled, back to square one, creating a situation where it is hard to say that the neighboring prefectures are united.
The citizens of Ooma city are relatively calm about the postponement of the construction, but there are concerns that the unclear location of the new station and the uncertain opening date may affect future momentum.
Mayor Koji Matsuzaki plans to continue lobbying the national government for an early full-line opening, but the voices of the communities along the line demanding an early start to construction will be indispensable.
Indifference such as "Someday, the Shinkansen will pass through (west of Tsuruga)" will not be able to move the national government or neighboring prefectural governments.
I want a passion that continues to raise its voice.
The chocolate section for Valentine's Day, where tasting has been revived after three years, on February 9th at the Seibu Fukui store in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture.
Ahead of Valentine's Day on February 14, despite the rising retail prices of chocolate due to the soaring costs of raw materials and packaging, sales of high-priced "reward chocolates" for oneself, family, and friends are doing well.
Retail and confectionery stores in Fukui Prefecture are trying to attract customers with products that emphasize local color, luxury, and commitment to ingredients.
Seibu Fukui Store (in Fukui City) will open a special sales area on the 6th floor event hall on January 25th.
For up to 14 days, they are selling about 450 types from around 40 brands, including 10 confectionery shops in the prefecture.
Products such as sandwiches filled with raw chocolate and cookies made with local sake from Fukui are popular.
According to the store representative, the retail prices of most products have risen by about 10% compared to the previous year.
This year's trend is characterized by products that emphasize quality ingredients and luxurious packaging. As for consumer trends, there is a tendency to purchase for oneself or for family, and enjoy comparing different tastes.
Even in the face of price increases, sales in the high price range remain strong.
Due to the impact of high prices, the average cost per grain has increased by 25 yen.
"The person in charge says, 'We are committed to creating a shopping environment where customers can enjoy the event of Valentine's Day itself.'"
In addition to selling daily recommended sweets from January 26th, the store has resumed tastings for the first time in three years.
The Western Confectionery Club (headquartered in Maruoka Town, Sakai City), a manufacturer and seller of Western confections, launched its original chocolate "KISEKI" series for the first time in the Valentine's Day sales battle, which was jointly developed with a long-established French chocolate maker at the end of last year.
They are particular about the cacao beans, characterized by a fruity taste with subdued bitterness, and are sold in sets of three for 1,000 yen and nine for 3,000 yen.
The company's Director of Purchasing, Ryoma Takakura, says, "While the culture of obligatory chocolate is gradually fading, there is a demand for enjoying a little luxury on Valentine's Day. We aim to enhance the added value of our products and differentiate ourselves."
⇒To receive chocolate from a woman... ask the trending AI chatbot.
On the 9th, a woman in her twenties who works for a company (from Fukui City) visited the Seibu Fukui store. She said, "I've always loved chocolate, and now that I have a job and can earn money, I want to buy it as a reward for myself," as she was checking out the products.
A woman in her 30s who bought obligation chocolate said, "It hurts that the price increase extends to chocolate, but I want to give it to my family and people who take care of me regularly because it's once a year. However, I might reduce the number of people I give it to."
Products made with Fukui plums and locally produced midi tomatoes - February 9, at the Fukui Prefectural Office.
On February 9, Seven-Eleven Japan announced that it will start selling six new products, including those made with sweet shrimp and other ingredients from Fukui Prefecture, in 339 stores across three prefectures in the Hokuriku region.
To commemorate the first anniversary of the signing of the comprehensive cooperation agreement on prefectural administration, we will promote the appeal of local products.
In addition to four new products including shrimp miso ramen and dumpling soup using sweet shrimp caught in the prefecture, salad using locally produced midi tomatoes, and cream puffs with feather-light mochi and red bean paste, we also offer rice balls with Fukui plums and sauce katsudon.
We plan to sell until the 20th.

On the 9th, Tomohiro Akutsu, the Deputy Head of the company's Operations Headquarters, and others paid a courtesy visit to Governor Tatsuji Sugimoto.
Governor Sugimoto, who tasted the dumpling soup, gave it a rave review, saying, "The sweet shrimp broth is strong and delicious."
The company representative said, "We want to continue to develop products using produce from Fukui Prefecture."
The ruins of Ushigahara Castle, said to have been built in preparation for the battle with Hiraizumi Temple, are located in Ushigahara, Ono City, Fukui Prefecture.
The Inuikawa district of Ono City, Fukui Prefecture, where there once was a large-scale Ushigahara Manor.
The Ushigahara Castle is said to have been built on the hillside of Nabeyama within the district in preparation for a battle against Hiraizumi Temple, which was in conflict with the manor during the Kamakura period.
It appears in the military tale "Taiheiki".
There are no remaining documents about Ushigahara Castle, but in the eleventh volume of the Taiheiki, titled "The Suicide of the Echizen Ushigahara Land Steward," the following content is written.
Tokiharu Aikawa, a government official of the Kamakura shogunate, was dispatched to Ono as a local governor.
In 1333, the Rokuhara Tandai, established in Kyoto to monitor the imperial court and control the western provinces, was overthrown by Ashikaga Takauji, and the Kamakura shogunate was destroyed by Nitta Yoshisada.
When the news of the destruction of the Rokuhara Tandai reached the servants of the Heiji family, they immediately fled, leaving only about 20 people behind.
Taking advantage of the gap, the monk soldiers of Hiraizumi Temple launched an attack.
Toki was said to have drowned his wife and two children in the river before committing suicide himself.
⇒ The impregnable castle where Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu all gathered.
The local residents' group "Improving Inui Side Association" published "Inui Side History Story" in 2014.
The tragic story of Tokiwa is presented in a comic format that is easy for even elementary school students to understand.
Mr. Masao Kitagawa (75), who was involved in the publication, said, "I want people in the community to know about the local history and pass it on to future generations."

The roadside station "Rennyo no Sato Awara" under construction in Yoshizaki, Awara City, Fukui Prefecture, will open on April 22.
Looking ahead to the opening of the Hokuriku Shinkansen's Awara Onsen Station in the spring of 2024, we anticipate approximately 360,000 users annually, as a new regional revitalization and tourist hub in the northern part of the city.
The main dining and retail facilities at the station are single-story steel structures with a total floor area of 975 square meters.
The total area of the roadside station, including the parking lot and Nagisa Children's Park, is 8137 square meters.
The facility will also include rest areas and tourist information centers.
Electric bicycles are available for rent, and there is also a shower room.
The two parking lots can accommodate a total of 66 vehicles, both small and large (including 3 for the disabled).
This was revealed by Mayor Morinosuke of the city at a regular press conference held on February 8th.
In the food and drink corner, we sell parfaits made with fruits from the Sakai Northern Hills and pies made with sweet potato.
We are committed to developing menus that make generous use of local ingredients, such as egg over rice using Fukuji chicken, and seasonal dishes using eel from Kitagata, available only in autumn and winter.

The cat-shaped serving robot introduced at the "Iwashi Jukusei Jingisukan Bonta Fukui Station Front Store".
The adorable expressions are popular with families = Located at Ote 2-chome, Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture.
In the restaurant industry in Fukui Prefecture, which is struggling with a labor shortage, there is a growing trend to introduce serving robots to deliver food to customers' tables.
The automation of store operations and the "non-contact" customer service to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus are beneficial, and the adorable expressions of the robots are popular among family customers.
Restaurant owners and stakeholders have voiced that "it is difficult for local restaurants to secure employees and part-time workers, and the use of serving robots is likely to become more widespread."
"Jing, Jing, Jingisukan♪".
A robot displaying a cat's face on the screen, serving food while playing light music, smoothly runs around the restaurant.
Upon arriving at the customer's table, they would say things like, "I've brought your order, meow," to the customer.
The "Bonta Fukui Station Front Store," a Genghis Khan restaurant in Oote 2-chome, Fukui City, introduced a cat-shaped serving robot in August 2022.
When you load the dish ordered by the customer onto the robot waiting near the kitchen and press the table number on the screen, the robot will autonomously navigate and deliver it to that table.
It is equipped with AI (Artificial Intelligence) voice functions and reacts when touched by customers, and the cat face displayed on the screen also has rich expressions.
The "Bonta Group", which manages the store, has introduced serving robots in two stores, including this one.
President Toshiyuki Saito emphasized that the main reason for the introduction was "a shortage of manpower", and stressed that it is part of productivity improvement through labor-saving and digital transformation (DX).
The proportion of labor costs to store sales is usually around 30%, but it is said that it can be reduced to 21-22% by implementation.
The robots also have the role of collecting plates after customers have finished eating, which leads to more efficient clean-up. Additionally, they bring joy to families and children, and also have a promotional effect.
The "Rokken Hoshiyama Fukui" store, a grilled meat and hormone pot restaurant located in Araki Shinpo-cho, Fukui City, also introduced a serving robot in August 2022.
The president of Sonsan Shouten, which he manages, Mr. Hoshiyama Eifuku, said, "Even if we recruit employees or part-timers, they hardly come. I thought it was absolutely necessary to solve the labor shortage," explaining the background of the introduction.
At the Fukui store, operations are divided into zones where employees serve and areas where robots deliver.
The lease cost of a robot is said to be equivalent to the wages of one part-time worker.
In an effort to reduce manpower, the store is considering the introduction of robots, a tablet-based ordering system, and self-checkout registers.
According to the Fukui Labor Bureau, as of December 2022, the job-to-applicant ratio for "customer service" roles such as restaurants is 6.94, indicating a high demand for workers in these roles.
A representative from Netsystem (located in Takagi Central 2-chome, Fukui City), which serves as a sales agent for meal-serving robots, says, "Due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the shortage of staff in restaurants within the prefecture is becoming serious, and we are receiving many inquiries about introducing robots."
President Hoshiyama analyzed, "It will become even more difficult to secure employees for suburban stores in the regions, and I think that serving robots will become more widespread."
[Editorial] Echizen Town has created an "ending note" and is distributing it to residents who wish to have one.
The trigger was the publication two years ago of the "Condolence Handbook," which covers all the necessary procedures and written forms such as inheritance list tables and family trees needed when a family member passes away, and the fact that many people came to pick it up for their own use.
In various parts of the prefecture, workshops on how to write an ending note and pre-death organization are frequently held, and "end-of-life preparation" seems to be well established among the residents.
The ending note of Echizen town is 35 pages long.
Starting with a review of one's personal history in five chapters, it goes on to record the current state of health and assets, future care, end-of-life medical wishes, and requests regarding funerals and graves.
There is also a section where you can write down things you want to do in the rest of your life and messages to your loved ones.
Writing a 35-page document seems daunting, but there's no need to fill every page.
What do you most want to leave behind in writing for your family and those around you?
The key is to clearly define the purpose.
Various notebooks for different purposes are commercially available in bookstores and other places, and you can start writing casually from where you can write.
The term "end-of-life planning", likened to job hunting, was coined in 2009.
The Great East Japan Earthquake occurred two years later, in 2011.
Many people have witnessed the reality that "death comes suddenly", leading to an increase in those preparing for their own end or final stages.
More than 10 years have passed since then.
The global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus is still not under control.
Due to events such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, prices have risen, and this winter's electricity bills have unexpectedly skyrocketed.
On the other hand, wages have not risen enough to match the current high cost of living, and many people are worried about the future.
On the other hand, in an era where being an only child is not uncommon, funeral expenses, caregiving costs, and grave maintenance, which used to be shared among siblings and relatives, are now often shouldered by one person.
While lifespans have significantly increased compared to the past, there is a dilemma that the risk of dementia and the need for care increases with age.
We should bear in mind that the rise and persistence of end-of-life planning is also due to increasing social anxieties.
In any case, no one wants to put an excessive burden on their partners or children.
"Living one's final moments in their own way" seems to be a popular keyword for ending notes, but one must be careful not to become too self-absorbed.
Instead of secretly writing down hopes and wishes, one should consult with their family at least once and calmly prepare for that time.
Prime Minister Fumio Kishida (second from the right) and Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Keiko Nagaoka (third from the right) pose for a commemorative photo with stakeholders at the elementary school they visited.
On February 10th, in Toda City, Saitama Prefecture, it was suggested that it is not necessary for students and staff to wear masks as a rule at graduation ceremonies.
The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided on February 10th that the basic policy for students at graduation ceremonies is "not to wear masks".
The principal of a large middle school reveals, "It's actually difficult to maintain a wide distance between students, and we're struggling with how to respond. There are also students who feel anxious about removing their masks."
In response to reports about wearing masks at graduation ceremonies, it is said that this topic has been brought up among faculty members.
On the other hand, an elementary school principal predicted, "If the government decides, we will probably not wear them. If we exclude singing, it might be realistically possible to cope."
At this graduation ceremony, some schools in the prefecture are exploring easing measures, such as allowing the participation of students who had been refraining from attending, and resuming the graduation choir.
In the prefecture, the prefectural high schools plan to hold ceremonies in early March, and public elementary and junior high schools plan to do the same in mid-March.
The prefectural and municipal boards of education plan to decide on their response after waiting for an official notification from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.
There were cautious voices about the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology's decision to not require mask-wearing in all school educational activities from the new school term this spring.
The elementary school principal said, "Children would be confused if we suddenly stopped wearing masks one day. It would be a natural progression to first decide that 'wearing is optional', and then gradually see an increase in the number of children who choose not to wear them."
× × ×
On February 10th, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology decided not to require the wearing of masks in school educational activities from April, in line with the government's new mask-wearing guidelines.
The principle is to not wear masks during choir, physical education classes, and club activities.
During the fiscal year 2022, we will require infection control measures in accordance with the current hygiene management manual, and we will inform the Board of Education and schools about precautions from April onwards.
Graduation ceremonies at elementary, middle, high schools, and universities during the 2022 fiscal year will primarily involve participants, including graduates, faculty, and attending students, not wearing masks, provided that measures such as ventilation are implemented.
Mr. Yasushi Nagata, who prays for success, cuts the hair of an examinee (left) with his blessed scissors at Hair Atelier Rim Rim in Tsuka Town, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture.
Every exam season, at the Hair Atelier Rim Rim beauty salon in Tsuka Town, Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture, students are given haircuts using scissors that have been used in prayers for successful exam results.
Test takers have given positive feedback, saying things like "I gained confidence" and "I was able to take the exam calmly."
The representative director of the beauty salon, Yasushi Nagata, has observed students opening textbooks while waiting for their haircuts and expressing their anxieties about exams during the haircut.
So, with the hope of "helping even a little," they started offering pass-prayer cuts in 2014.
⇒ Final day tally for applications to national and public universities.
Every year, at the start of work, the beauty salon has a prayer for success for their scissors and combs at the Kazusa Shrine in Wakatake Town, in the same city.
Every year, around 80 people are cut.
This refers to various exams such as high school and university entrance exams, job recruitment exams, driving license exams, and so on.
I am giving a pencil that has been blessed for passing exams.
⇒ Message from "Mama" Ogaki: "To You, Who Are Challenging High School Entrance Exams"
The 19-year-old man who successfully passed the University of Tokyo in his first attempt in 21 years said, "I was happy to feel the support. I used the golden pencil I received for the exam, and it boosted my spirits," he recalled.
The NPO "Heartfelt Anthology Editing Bureau" self-published the book "Dear Prime Minister, 'Life's Breakwater' from Tojinbo".
I self-published my tenth book titled "Dear Prime Minister, From the 'Life's Breakwater' Tojinbo".
Newspapers across the country have covered it, and we have received many reader responses.
The purpose of publishing this book is to share with you the content directly heard from suicide attempters about the "social and structural" environmental issues related to the causes of suicide in Japan, with the hope of creating a "comfortable society to live in".
We have been patrolling the rocky areas of Tojinbo in Fukui Prefecture, known as a suicide spot, for 18 years and 10 months to prevent suicides. We continue to support activities to find and protect those intending to commit suicide until they can start anew.
This book, which compiles the issues raised by the 784 people we have protected so far (as of February 6), appeals to the Prime Minister for the following seven measures necessary to prevent suicide.
(1) Suicide prevention activities are "life-saving" activities.
(2) There are a pile of "human rights violations" behind suicide.
(3) Suicide victims are victims of social and structural organized crime.
(4) Administrative agencies are treating citizens living outside their jurisdiction as "outsiders" and giving them the cold shoulder.
(5) People with mental disorders such as depression are drugged, and even if they commit suicide, it is treated as an "accident".
(6) The "duty of care" in high-risk suicide areas is being forgotten in favor of commercialism.
(7) In the doctrines of emerging religious groups, parts that cannot be scientifically proven are deceptive, and acts of threatening others by foretelling future curses and making them offer money and goods are extortion.
Religious organizations engaging in fraudulent and extortionate criminal activities should be publicly exposed and eliminated.
We have received overwhelming feedback from those who have subscribed to this book, such as "I was moved by the strong mentality of those involved in this activity," "This former police officer is a model among police officers," and "Supporting others as if they were your own family is like a living Bodhisattva." Here, we would like to share one of these comments.
Looking at the photos in the newspaper article, I was moved to tears, thinking "What were they thinking..."
I hear that the number of suicides is increasing among people who are feeling cornered due to the current COVID-19 crisis.
It's truly a sad thing.
Everyone being true to themselves.
I hope for a society where people can live happily with the life they have been given.
I felt a sense of respect and gratitude for the staff who are wholeheartedly dedicated to helping those who are suffering to the point of wanting to end their lives.
I understand that this activity can be physically and mentally demanding, but please take care of yourself and continue to reach out to us.
Thank you.
Smart
We hope that all our readers will become gatekeepers of life in their communities.

Kenji Shimada, who takes photos of capybaras every week and posts them on social media, at the indoor facility "Hapijan" in the Asuwayama Park amusement park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture on February 1st.
There is a man in the city who takes weekly photos of the capybaras at the indoor facility "Hapijan" in the Asuwayama Park amusement park in Fukui City, Fukui Prefecture, and shares them on Instagram.
The post features a variety of thumbnail images lined up, including moments of yawning with teeth peeking out from a big mouth, and lying down basking in the sun.
The account has over 10,000 followers both domestically and internationally, playing a significant role in spreading the charm of Hapijan and Capybaras to many people.
⇒ Shizuka Kudo posted traditional vegetables from Fukui Prefecture on Instagram.
The man is Kenji Shimada (38), a company employee living in the city.
I started posting on social networking sites (SNS) from March 2021.
The capybara is one of the world's largest rodents, with webbed feet that make it an excellent swimmer.
At Hapijan, since its opening 18 years ago, we have been raising a total of three animals, one male and two females, which can be observed up close and fed.
Mr. Shimada learned about capybaras 5 or 6 years ago.
Watching a video of an animal relaxing in a hot spring, one might be shocked and ask, "What kind of animal is this?"
I was drawn to its charming expressions and gestures, just like a human.
I was excited to hear that it would be bred at Hapizan and was looking forward to being able to see it up close.
I started taking photos seriously about three years ago, triggered by the purchase of a single-lens reflex camera.
I take advantage of capturing the adorable appearance of capybaras, not missing any photo opportunities such as when they shake their bodies like a drill to shake off water.
The number of Instagram posts has reached about 830, which is enough to make one reflect, "I can't believe I took so many."
After frequent visits, it seems that Mr. Shimada has become familiar to Yamato-kun, the male, who now approaches and makes a "kyurukyuru" sound.
"Shimada's love for capybaras deepens, finding them 'cute and delightful'."
Through SNS, capybara lovers nationwide are enjoying interactions such as sharing their best shots every month.
Shimada, who visits local zoos to see capybaras, said with a smile, "I want to continue taking pictures and sharing them, mainly from my home base, Ashiyama."

Toba City accidentally double-pays child-rearing household benefits, requests return - Ise Newspaper
On the 10th, Toba City announced that there had been an erroneous payment of a total of 600,000 yen to 11 households (12 people) for the Reiwa 3 fiscal year's special child-rearing household living support benefit (other household portion).
The city has apologized to the individuals involved and explained the situation, and is now seeking to initiate the process for restitution.
According to the city, it was revealed on January 27, 2023, due to a tip-off from the guardian of a child who had confirmed past payments.
Upon verification of all 79 households and 182 individuals eligible for the payment in the same fiscal year, it was found that benefits were paid twice to 11 households and 12 individuals on July 20, 2021.
The city provides a grant of 50,000 yen per child to households that are exempt from municipal tax, targeting children who are high school students or younger.
The company in charge of data processing provided data extracted from the target children, but it was mistakenly believed by the staff in charge that high school students were not included, and they were paid twice as a result of adding them to the data.
The person in charge of the city's child-rearing support office has stated that they will "take this matter seriously, strive to restore trust by ensuring thorough prevention of recurrence, such as rechecking the data."

The policy is to not impose admission restrictions, provided that basic infectious disease measures are taken on both days.
Admission is free.
The president of the Mie Prefecture Soft Tennis Federation, Haruo Amano, who is in charge, said, "This is a great opportunity to see top-level players in action. We hope many people will come to watch."

February 10, 2023 - Iwaki Minpo Co., Ltd.
It's snowing again.
It seems to be the effect of a low-pressure system moving east along the Japanese archipelago, not a cold wave from the north.
It's not long since we experienced the unusual cold from the 24th to the 26th of last month, and we still can't let our guard down. The same cold weather would be even more unbearable for the people of the Republic of Turkey who have been hit by a major earthquake.
The building collapsed in an instant.
So far, more than 20,000 people have become victims in neighboring Syria and this country, known for its pro-Japanese stance, with many still trapped in the rubble.
The origin dates back to 1890 (Meiji 23), when the Ertugrul, a warship dispatched to Japan by the Ottoman Empire at the time, was involved in a shipwreck accident.
The fact that residents of Kushimoto Town, Wakayama Prefecture, the site of the incident, helped and cared for the crew members has been featured in movies and novels. About 100 years after this incident, on the eve of the Gulf War, a Turkish aircraft was dispatched to rescue Japanese hostages in Iraq, repaying the favor.
Those who have experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake can share this pain.
I want to keep in mind until the situation calms down and recovery and restoration are complete.

Berino Hotel illegally received subsidies from the prefecture and city's accommodation support project, but has already returned the full amount | Iwanichi Online Iwate Daily News
On the 10th, the prefecture and Ichinoseki City announced that the Berino Hotel Ichinoseki (located in Yamame of the same city) had been improperly using their respective subsidy programs, which discount the accommodation fees for travelers, for about a year from October 2021.
When non-eligible individuals stayed, they were given discounts through practices such as name lending by employees.
Many instances were confirmed where employees used the accommodation in a manner that did not align with the business objective of "stimulating tourism demand".
Including independent investigations by the prefecture, city, and hotel, a total of 7,231,000 yen, which was received due to inappropriate use, has been returned as of the 6th of this month.
The fraudulent receipt of subsidies occurred in the "Iwate Travel Support Project", a lodging discount implemented by the prefecture affected by the spread of the new coronavirus, and the "Ichinoseki Lodging Support Discount", an emergency countermeasure project for tourist accommodations by the city.
The period is from October 18, 2021, to October 10, 2022 (the Ichinoseki lodging support discount is until September 30, 2022). As a result of the investigation, there were 95 cases of inappropriate use, such as those outside the target area or unvaccinated, which were not eligible for the discount, amounting to 587,000 yen, and 1,239 cases of use that did not align with the purpose and objectives of the project, amounting to 6,644,000 yen.
While the prefecture's business contractor was proceeding with the settlement process, multiple instances were confirmed where the user of the accommodation discount and the hotel's receptionist were the same person.
In a detailed investigation by the prefecture, inappropriate use was discovered, and the city, having obtained this information, confirmed the facts.
The city's project has already ended, and its registration for the prefectural project was also removed on December 2nd last year.
In response to the interview, Michiaki Tsuchihashi, the representative director of Berino, which operates the hotel, said, "I apologize for causing inconvenience to the local community, the prefecture, the city, and many others. I am deeply remorseful. The hotel exists because of the local community, and I want to restart from zero and work on regaining trust." He also mentioned plans to hold a compliance (law-abiding) training session for all employees.
Chiba Keijin, the head of the Promotion Division of the Prefectural Tourism and Promotion Department, said, "It's truly regrettable. We want to promote compliance and adherence to rules, and call for proper use in line with the purpose of the business."
Mayor Yoshito Sato commented, "It is truly regrettable that there has been inappropriate use of the business at accommodation facilities in the city."
People and horses start training with breath turning white, ritual at Mizusawa, Morioka Racecourse | Iwanichi Online Iwate Daily News
The training commencement ceremony of the Prefectural Horse Racing Association was held on the 10th at both Mizusawa and Morioka racecourses, where stakeholders prayed for the safety of the people and horses and purified the racecourse.
Among these, a ritual was held in front of the Barekijin at the Mizusawa Racecourse in Mizusawa Aitai-cho, Oshu City. About 50 people, including staff, horse owners, jockeys, and stable workers of the racecourse, attended, and Kenichi Odajima, the director of the racecourse, offered a tamagushi.
In the main arena, the Shinto priests and representatives walked around corners and purified the area by scattering cut hemp.
In the training, several racehorses were brought out to the track for light adjustments.
You could also see a horse exhaling white breath in the cold.
The racecourse is installing new track lighting for the 2023 season.
It becomes possible to hold events at twilight, and after test lighting, it will be fully operational.
The 2022 season of Iwate horse racing has the "Spring Horse Racing" event remaining, which will be held at the same racecourse on March 11-14, 19-21, and 26-28.
Director Oda Island said, "I want to train thoroughly for about a month and prepare for the special event."
On Thursdays only, Ramen shop introduces new Dan Dan noodles to the menu at Roadside Station Nishiwaga, Lake Kinshu | Iwanichi Online Iwate Daily News.
The Roadside Station Nishiwaga Town Suginahata (Manager Koki Masuoka) operates a ramen specialty shop, "Menya Nishiki," on Thursdays, a day when the restaurant was previously closed.
We have developed a new Tan Tan noodle dish using local ingredients (850 yen including tax), to allow more people to enjoy the taste of our local cuisine.
The restaurant Kinshuko Lake at the same station, which serves "Yuda Dam Curry" (1200 yen) and "Nishi-Waga Whole Ramen" (900 yen), had been closed on Thursdays to ensure staff days off, but there were voices of disappointment from customers who visited.
In response to this, they started a ramen-only business on the 9th that can be managed by a small number of people.
The restaurant decided to limit its menu to four items: soy sauce ramen, soy sauce chashu ramen, miso ramen, miso chashu ramen, and dan dan noodles.
The new tantan noodles, launched to coincide with the opening of "Noodle Shop Nishiki", are made using "Yukikko Miso", which is made from ingredients such as soybeans from Nishi-Waga and sun-dried salt, and uses local onions, western bracken, minced meat, and chili peppers.
There were many orders from the first day, and we are considering offering services on days other than Thursday in the future.
The station on the same route will be closed from May 2021 to November 2022 due to the closure of National Route 107.
During this time, they operated an alternative shop called "Ramen and Donburi Shop Nishiki" in the town of Kotsunagi, and they will utilize the know-how they have accumulated.
Manager Masuoka says, "The warming tantan noodles are perfect for this season. Although the menu is small, I want people to eat delicious food and feel happy," he promotes.
Winter business hours are the same as the restaurant, from 11:00 AM to 2:30 PM (last order at 2:00 PM).
For inquiries, please contact the station at 0197 (84) 2990.
Introduction to Pioneers in Plant Research: Hachimantai Collection Materials also on Display at City Cultural Center Exhibition [Hanamaki] | Iwanichi Online Iwate Daily News
A special exhibition titled "People who Introduced the Flowers of Hachimantai - A Brief History of Hachimantai Plant Research," which highlights the pioneers who laid the foundation for plant research on Mount Hachimantai, known as a treasure trove of alpine plants, is being held at the City General Cultural Property Center in Osako Town, Hanamaki City until the 12th.
The collection features 124 valuable specimens and materials collected by predecessors, introducing the footsteps of those who were involved in botanical research on Mount Hachimantai.
The study of the plants of Mt. Hachimantai began with the Russian botanist Karl Johann Maximovich (1827-1891), who came to Japan in the late Edo period, and Nagayosuke Sugawa (1842-1925) from Shiwatown, who collected plants under Maximovich's guidance.
Maximovich, who was not allowed to freely walk around the country as a foreigner, asked Sugawa to collect specimens for him and continued his research for three years based in Yokohama and Nagasaki.
Sugawa continued to support Maximovich's research even after his return home, leading to the announcement of Mt. Hachimantai's unique "Himekozakura", "Nambutouuchisou", and "Miyamayamabukishouma".
Subsequently, the modern botanist Tomitaro Makino (1862-1957) published species such as "Nambu Torano-o", "Kobano Tsumekusa", and "Nambu Inunazuna" in 1903 (Meiji 36), based on the collected specimens of local researchers, and in 1905 (Meiji 38), he himself climbed Mt. Hachimantai and discovered and named "Katou Hakobe".
From the exhibition materials, it can be seen that many researchers have revealed valuable alpine plants.
Also introduced are Matsunosuke Sugimura (1874-1948), the principal of Hanamaki Elementary School who accompanied the natural monument preservation survey in 27 (Showa 2) and was researching plants, and Shichiro Tamagawa (1914-88), who served as a curator at the Osako Town Mountain Museum and was involved in the publication of "Plants of Hachimantai".
Researcher Sohei Yoshida from the center said, "Behind the name of each plant on Mt. Hachimantai, there is a lot of accumulated research and connections between people. We can trace the connections between researchers from local to national levels."
The exhibition is divided into four sections. The first section focuses on the faith and history of Mount Hachimantai, while the second section highlights the characteristics of Mount Hachimantai from a geological perspective, based on the research of Heinrich Edmund Naumann (1854-1927), a German geologist who laid the foundation for Japanese geology.
Multiple local lines in Iwate Prefecture suspend operations | Iwanichi Online Iwate Daily Newspaper
Due to heavy snowfall, JR local lines in the prefecture were suspended on the 10th, with successive suspensions on the Kitakami, Hanawa, Yamada, Ofunato, Kamaishi, and Hachinohe lines.
According to the JR Morioka branch, among these, three trains on the Kitakami line were suspended between Kitakami and Yokote, disrupting the travel of about 80 passengers. In addition, four trains on the Ofunato line were suspended between Ichinoseki and Kesennuma, affecting about 280 passengers.
The branch office announced the conventional line operation plan for the 11th, anticipating heavy snow.
The Fujine-Yokote section of the Kitakami Line suspended operations from the first train until around 9 am in both directions, and some trains between Kitakami and Fujine were cancelled.
The Ofunato Line will suspend operations on both up and down lines between Ichinoseki and Kesennuma from the first train until around 5:30 pm, and the Kamaishi Line will suspend operations on the down line between Morioka and Kamaishi from the first train until around noon, and on the up line until around 11 am.

Even with a different ball, his proud fastball shone.
On the 9th, Roki Sasaki of Lotte (Ofunato High School) made his first appearance in the batting practice at the Ishigaki camp in Okinawa, throwing 30 balls with the World Baseball Classic (WBC) ball and marking 160 km/h.
Against six batters, he allowed only two hits and expressed satisfaction, saying, "There were various gains. My forkball has improved a bit since last year's training games."
The 160 kilos was measured twice, causing Fujiwara to foul, and Yasuda grounded into a double play.
The pitcher calmly constructed his pitch sequence, including sliders, and Matsukawa, who received the ball, was impressed with the quality of the finish, saying, "Really strong balls were coming, and the batters were also being jammed."
Director Yoshii also seems satisfied with the steady progress of the fourth-year pro, saying, "I think it's going well. At this point, it's more than satisfactory."
The promising power pitcher is scheduled to take the mound in a practice game against Yakult on the 15th (in Itoman, Okinawa), planning to throw around 40 pitches as the next step.
"I want to improve the accuracy of my fastball and overall consistency," he said, focusing on the details.
Northwestern Syria's Idlib province, which was hit by a major earthquake, in the early hours of the 9th (provided by local residents, Kyodo).
According to authorities in Turkey and neighboring Syria, the confirmed death toll from a major earthquake centered in southern Turkey, Gaziantep, has exceeded 21,000 in both countries as of the 9th.
In the severe cold, the rescue of survivors from collapsed buildings and the like is becoming increasingly difficult over time.
In the disaster-stricken area, a desperate search was underway.
On the 9th, the United Nations, for the first time since the earthquake on the 6th, brought supplies into the disaster-stricken Idlib province in northwestern Syria through the Turkish border.
Idlib province is the last stronghold of the opposition against the Assad regime in the Syrian civil war, and there were concerns that international aid might not reach there.
Rescue operations continue at disaster sites in both countries, using heavy machinery, but they are facing difficulties.
Many people are still buried in the rubble, and the death toll is likely to rise further.
According to Turkish authorities, 17,674 deaths have been confirmed in Turkey.
Including the over 3,000 deaths in Syria, it has become a disaster surpassing the 1999 earthquake in northwestern Turkey, which claimed more than 17,000 lives.
Miyako City plans to implement its own support measures to subsidize energy costs such as electricity, gas, and gasoline for local businesses struggling to secure profits due to rising fuel and commodity prices.
As an emergency measure, invest self-generated funds to support the regional economy in harsh environments.
The target is business operators in all industries (excluding farmers, fishermen, and electricity and gas supply companies).
It requires that the profit margin of the business year that just ended is lower than the previous year.
The subsidy amount will cover half of the increase in expenses for a continuous six-month period between April 2022 and March 2023, compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, with a maximum limit of 1 million yen per business.
It is expected to benefit about 800 people.

Reira Iwabuchi, a female snowboarder (Burton, Ichinoseki Gakuin High School - Law University 3rd year), is skipping the third round of the World Cup (WC) Slopestyle in Canada to train in Fukushima Prefecture, in preparation for the World Championships opening on the 19th in Georgia.
"Going through the entire World Cup doesn't leave much time for practice during the season. I wanted to adjust properly in Japan and improve my accuracy," he calmly stated.
In the past two competitions, the highest rank was 5th in slopestyle, and this year, the goal is to reach the podium in two events, including the favored big air.
This season's World Cup saw a victory in the Big Air category, and a second place finish in the second Slopestyle event.
"He emphasized being natural, saying, 'Tighten up a bit more, but don't get too stiff and approach it as usual,' hinting at his good condition."
At the end of January, the world's top pros gathered for the Winter X Games, where they achieved their first victory in Big Air.
She attempted the three backflips on a diagonal axis that were not decided at last year's Beijing Winter Olympics, and was the first woman to succeed in competition.
"I took it step by step and was able to visualize it clearly. It was a huge accomplishment," he said, feeling more confident.
Rescue workers searching through the rubble - 10th, in the southern Turkish city of Kahramanmaras (Getty=Kyodo)

The acquisition included a cattle building and approximately 29.6 ares of land, with costs totaling 94 million yen, including a multi-story car park.
The procedures for transferring ownership, such as registration, were completed by mid-December last year.
The basic survey scheduled for fiscal year 23 will grasp the current situation and issues regarding land use and facility location in the city center, population density, etc., and analyze future predictions.
We will consider the future vision, including the required facilities.
It will also be included in the municipal land rationalization plan, which is necessary when utilizing national treasury subsidies.
On the 9th, the Japanese International Emergency Assistance Team and Rescue Team are conducting search operations at the site of a residential collapse in southern Turkey, Kahramanmaras (Kyodo).

Around them, the relatives of the household family were watching on, looking completely exhausted.
The Japanese rescue team entered Kahramanmaras on the night of the 7th.
Approximately 70 people and 4 rescue dogs.
Team leader Hideaki Yamamoto said, "The situation on the ground is quite severe. It reminds me of the scenery from the Great East Japan Earthquake. Helping each other in times of trouble is the relationship between Japan and Turkey."
The site is a four-story residential building located in a residential area spread halfway up a slope overlooking the city.
The silver-colored Yamagata Shinkansen "Tsubasa," which has been revived after about six and a half years, at JR Yamagata Station on the morning of the 11th.
On the 11th, the silver-colored Yamagata Shinkansen "Tsubasa", which has been revived for the first time in about six and a half years, began operating at JR Yamagata Station (Yamagata City).
Many railway enthusiasts flocked to the commemorative ceremony to see the nostalgic vehicles.
When a vehicle with a silver body and green lines appeared on the second platform, fans simultaneously took pictures.
The first train headed to Tokyo amidst cheers of "Have a good trip".
According to JR East, the Silver Tsubasa was in use from 1992 to 2016.
For the time being, we will operate with one train out of the current 15 trains.
Kanatomo Iizawa (5), from Yonezawa City, Yamagata Prefecture, who saw off the departure in a station staff uniform, said with a smile, "It was cool."
Discussing Renewable Energy Introduction and Goals at Amami Airport's 2nd Decarbonization Promotion Council | Society & Economy | Nankai Daily News
The promotion council discussed the decarbonization of Amami Airport on the 9th in Kasari Town, Amami City.
The "Amami Airport Decarbonization Promotion Council" (Chairman: Takashi Ando, Director of the Construction Department of the Oshima Prefectural Office, 13 members), composed of the prefecture and airlines using Amami Airport (Kasari Town, Amami City), held its second meeting at the airport on the 9th, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the airport.
All committee members, including those online, are in attendance.
We had a discussion about setting decarbonization goals and introducing renewable energy, mainly solar power.
The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism has set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at each airport by more than 46% (compared to fiscal 2013) by 2030, aiming for "carbon neutrality" to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In response to this, the council held its first meeting in November last year, aiming to formulate plans ahead of the other six remote island airports in the prefecture.
The second meeting, like the first, was closed to the public except for the opening.
According to Chairman Ando, who responded to interviews after the meeting, the meeting confirmed the amount of greenhouse gas emissions from the airport.
Discussions have been advanced in line with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism's guidelines for setting goals and introducing renewable energy.
According to the distributed materials, the CO2 emissions from the airport facilities and vehicles in the base year of 2013 were 1476 tons (excluding aircraft).
Of these, the emissions from lighting and air conditioning in seven facilities such as airport terminal buildings account for about 90% or 1321 tons, followed by 84 tons from aviation lights and 71 tons from airport vehicles.
The council is advancing discussions to reduce emissions from these facilities and vehicles.
Chairman Ando said, "We are at a crossroads now. The direction of the committee members is aligned, and we want to first focus on compiling the interim report properly."
Moving forward, an interim report will be presented at the third meeting, and after hearing opinions on the final draft at the fourth meeting, a promotion plan will be formulated.
"Upside-down Real Estate" opens Okinoerabu branch to attract people to the island - Landlords are sought by those wanting to rent homes | Society & Economy | Nankai Daily News
A station opening event on the 8th in Chiname town, where understanding of "Upside-down Real Estate" was deepened through talk sessions and the like.
The Okinoerabu General Office of the real estate web service "Sakasama Real Estate", which visualizes the desires of those who want to take on challenges by renting vacant houses and shops, and recruits landlords, held its Okinoerabu branch opening event on the 8th at the community space "entaku" in Chiname, Chiname Town.
The operating company explains the overview of the service through a talk session.
Masahiro Okubo, the representative director of Tsuginoba (Rishiri County, Hokkaido), who is in charge of branch operations, said, "By carrying out this initiative on Okinoerabu Island, we hope to create a movement and flow that attracts people to the entire island."
Upside-down real estate works in reverse of the usual real estate procedures, disclosing the information of those who want to rent, initiating contact from the landlord, and if an agreement is reached, each party enters into a contract.
As a demonstration experiment responsible for uncovering potential vacant houses and building relationships through vacant houses, On-Co Corporation (headquartered in Mie Prefecture) started the service in June 2020.
This is the seventh branch opening and the first in Kyushu.
This is the first time in the entire country on a remote island.
About 20 people participated in the event, including staff from On-Co and TsuginoBa, officials from the town halls of Wadomari and China, and local residents.
Representative Director Okubo explained the background of the branch opening, saying, "As efforts to attract people from outside the island are being intensified, I thought that if we could utilize vacant houses and shops, the town and the island would become more lively."
He expressed his desire to connect with people who own properties on the island or want to do something, and to help advance their efforts, even if it's just one property or one person at a time.
Takeshi Mizutani, the representative of On-Co, emphasizes the importance of valuing each vacant house and the need for local residents to discuss how they want to develop their area, who they want to invite, and what criteria to select, as a point of caution in operation.
He appealed to the islanders for participation in discussions and cooperation in providing information, saying, "The deeper the connection between people, the more information will be gathered."
Is Luis Rodriguez, the new foreign player being developed by SoftBank, wearing the number 156 that was previously worn by Kanade Tagami?
It seems so, doesn't it? ♪
It seems that the pitcher Luis Rodriguez from Dominica has the jersey number 156 (^_^)
Do you like meat dishes?
Of course.
I also like steak, but...
You love Tonkatsu and Karaage, don't you?
I have fully painted the Gunpla.
How many points is it?
For now, I've properly made and finished the armament, so I guess it's about 50 points.
I think I could have rated it a bit higher if the thick paint hadn't obscured the details of each mold.
Do you have a Mercari's Mercard?
I don't find Mercari very convenient because the money made from sales is used for purchases.
I proceeded with the process for the initial benefits...
I haven't used it yet.
I don't think the listed products will get any cheaper yet...
Are there any campaigns where using a card can get a discount?
Will the turn signal blink if I turn the key to ON without starting the engine on the NSR250R?
If the battery is normal, turning the key to ON will power the ACC, or accessories, so the turn signals and brake lights will come on.
The horn will also sound.
However, starting the engine will increase the voltage, which will make it more energetic.
Can ADATA's DDR4 and Samsung's DDR4 be mixed?
It's a laptop.
In principle, as long as the pin arrangement, voltage, frequency, and other standards match, they can be used together.
If it's just a difference in frequency, it's designed to operate according to the slower one, but depending on the item, there have been cases where that didn't work well, so it's not absolutely guaranteed to be okay.
If you're going to serve customers sleepily in the morning, shouldn't you just go to bed earlier the night before?
Exactly.
Sometimes I think so.
What's for dinner tonight?
It's sashimi of scallops and chijimi full of garlic chives.
Also, I will do something about the frozen vegetables.
Why are many of the delinquents in anime and manga often depicted as muscular characters?

I would like to ask married men over 60 years old.
Do you think all the retirement money is yours?
Don't you think that the support from your spouse has contributed to your ability to work until retirement?
The retirement fund is something that was earned by both spouses.
It is being allocated for post-retirement living expenses.
Of course, I acknowledge the merits of the mediator.
Is there any free software that can repeat a certain part of an mp4 file?
Or, can it be done with the software included in Windows 10?
With VLC media player, you can perform "A-B loop playback".
However, it is necessary to specify each time as it cannot remember between A and B.
I drive a 1999 model 17 Crown Estate.
It's a 1J turbo.
I'm considering replacing the MT on the R154, but how much would it cost including the transmission fee?
If anyone has more information, your advice would be appreciated.
Are you ignoring everything like the harness, controls, and settings?
Then it would be around 300,000, wouldn't it?
I think you should prepare about one million separately.
I've gained fat around my waist and hips, does it make me look fat?
The upper body gives the impression of a typical middle-aged belly, but the lower body is noticeably large!
Looking at it as a whole, it seems to give a rather large impression.
My nephew was surfing the internet and it seems like he received something like this. Is it okay to completely ignore it?
If you didn't input various things from here, the claim that it's registered is false, so you can ignore it.
Is this thinning hair?
It's the "parting" of the hair caused by the hairstyle.
Continuing with such hairstyles and incorrect combing or brushing can lead to thinning hair, so be careful.
If you're brushing your hair correctly, you're less likely to experience thinning hair.
If you don't like your scalp showing, changing to a hairstyle that doesn't part your hair could solve the problem.
Is this Dunhill wallet authentic?
If it was purchased at a renowned department store like Takashimaya, it would come with a warranty, so you can be sure it's genuine. But isn't that the case?
Is it a gift or something!?
If you are suspicious, you should have it appraised by a professional at a nearby pawnshop or brand purchase store.
Did the teacher who is inexperienced as a club advisor not participate in club activities during their student days?
If the club advisor is inexperienced, it may be because there are no other experienced individuals available (including those already serving as advisors to other clubs), and it does not necessarily mean they did not participate in club activities during their student days.
I am a high school student.
Recently, it's been getting a bit colder so I've started wearing black stockings. Is it still too early for this time of year?
You can put them on if you feel cold.
You don't need to match your clothes to the season.
If you ruin your health, it's all for nothing.
At night, my legs and feet are so itchy that I can't sleep.
Why are my legs and feet so itchy at night?
There might be ticks.
It's a good idea to air out your futon occasionally.
Why is it said that a structure with less than 1/20 of the wavelength can be approximated as a continuous medium?
In the equation, the effect of scattering is incorporated in the form of structure/λ, and if this value is small, it can be considered continuous.
About Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War.
Ares has reached the maximum level.
Have the parameters maxed out?
I would usually reset if I had less than three pins when leveling up.
My lover is Lean.
Magic power is 20, skill is 24, luck is 30, HP is 80.
You can easily find out what the maximum para is if you Google it, you know?
A rough estimate is fine.
Number one is probably Osaka Toin.
It must be Chiben Wakayama.
I have won three times in the summer and once in the spring.
Osaka Toin has been to the summer tournament five times and the spring tournament three times.
I'm looking for a simple chocolate without any extra ingredients like fruit, similar to what you might find in a department store basement.
Please let me know if you are aware.
Godiva is good.
It's a bit pricey, but I recommend it because they also have very simple chocolates.
Do you live alone?
Is there something fun?
I was living alone.
Until last year.
I had fun.
Humans are creatures of habit, so when enjoyable days continue, that state becomes the norm.
If fun becomes routine, unless there is something more fun, you will no longer consider it "fun".
I understand that, which is why I find "ordinary days with nothing special" enjoyable.
I feel that way.
Would you like to put plenty of tempura bits on your cup yakisoba?
There is no custom of adding tempura bits to yakisoba after cooking...
While it is typically used for soba and udon, it can also be added to takoyaki and okonomiyaki.
Will painting stainless steel with spray paint make it less magnetic?
It depends on the magnetism, but yes.
As No1 mentioned, stainless steel is not magnetic, so it's probably a low-purity stainless steel mixed with iron.
This is a common story with counterfeit stainless steel made in China.
Even if you date a lover who you get along with so well that you wonder if you'll ever meet someone like them again in your life, a breakup will eventually come.
Is it common for the actual marriage partner to end up being someone different?
Marriage involves a certain amount of momentum and timing.
We got married because we got along so well, it felt like a once in a lifetime connection.
I am currently on the UR3 vessel.
I have a mid-term 2017 model, but I want to upgrade it to the final late-term specifications. However, it seems that just changing the lights won't be enough.
Has anyone transitioned from early to late specifications?
How much did it cost?
Where else did you see an effect besides the light?
If anyone knows more, could you please enlighten me? Thank you in advance.
Generally, buying later is cheaper.
Good evening.
Thank you for your response.
I think of "computers" as "games and comics".
Don't you think it's interesting?
Do you all find it interesting?
To each their own.
Isn't the industry thriving because there are people who find it interesting?
How would you feel if the woman you like kept all the boxes of chocolates you've ever given her as presents?
If you're keeping something for use, that's fine, but if not, I'm a little worried that you might be on your way to becoming a hoarder.
Why do elderly people like priority seats?
The people who sit in the priority seats are always elderly.
I rarely see young people sitting in priority seats, maybe about once in every ten times.
Why is that?
Priority seats are specifically for the elderly and people with physical disabilities who have difficulty standing.
Do you think it would be acceptable to wear the polo shirt in the following image in a casual office setting?
It's an office job, but not as rigid as banking or securities.
I believe it's important to adapt to the atmosphere of the surrounding employees.
Why not start by observing the people in your company and make a judgment based on that?
I think it's best to strike a balance between "flashy dressers" and "plain dressers" in the office.
How do you feel about a boyfriend who gets along well with his mother?
Why not?
It's great to have a close-knit family!
What are you worried about?
Do creatures have a tendency to not want to leave the place they were born?
One does not want to leave familiar places because they are safe and provide food.
They will leave if it becomes dangerous or if the food runs out.
That's how humans spread from Africa to the rest of the world.
Does envy refer to someone who is jealous of another person?
Envy is not about talking about someone who envies another person, but about expressing the feeling of envying someone else.
If I apply for both the JCB Card W and the JCB Card Plus, can I receive the membership benefits for both?
You cannot hold both the JCB CARD W plus L and the JCB CARD W at the same time.
Even if you apply for two, only one will be issued.
Are there any characters in anime, manga, or tokusatsu who you thought were obviously hiding their true identity, but turned out to be someone else?
In fact, there are so many characters who are fed up with the pointlessness of hiding their true identities, I'd like to know about these curveball characters.
Full Frontal from Gundam U.C.
Among these, do any of you like the anime SLAM DUNK and plan to go see the SLAM DUNK movie after December 3rd? ( ^o^)ノ?
The movie has switched to new voice actors, not the traditional ones.
I am living just for that pleasure.
What are MT4 and MT5 in the forex market?
It is a platform (app) for automated trading (trading by program) in FX.
MT stands for MetaTrader.
4 and 5 are different versions.
Why am I such a failure?
That's probably because you're comparing yourself to someone incredibly talented.
Comparing oneself to others leads to labels like "excellent", "amazing", or "worthless".
Isn't it fine to be oneself?
As long as you're doing your best, you're not at least a "bad person".
Recently, I had ramen with a ton of pork fat, added kimchi, and it was super greasy and spicy!
Yuck!
Don't you have light ramen, like soy sauce ramen or light tonkotsu ramen?
I don't need anything Korean-style!
Chinese noodles in a diner in an old town!
Any restaurant that serves rice bowls, udon, and soba is okay.
I also prefer that type of ramen.
Ramen from Hida Takayama and Kitakata Ramen are examples of the lighter flavor variety.
I am going for an interview for a part-time job at the supermarket tomorrow.
I'm nervous about what I might be asked...
Basic information to write on your resume (you may be asked to repeat this verbally)
Commute time from home to work.
Transportation expenses
Whether or not they have byte experience.
Why did you choose this workplace?
Days and time slots for shifts.
I think at least this much will be asked!
Under the Japanese constitution, does one have to change their surname if they register their family register?
It would be the Civil Code, not the Constitution.
Have you ever been infected with the flu in your life so far?
Did it take quite a few tries?
I myself have forgotten about the past, but probably a few times?
I think so.
Since becoming an adult, I have no memory of getting the flu for over 50 years, but 5-6 years ago, when I had my antibody levels measured by the city, they were sufficient.
I also don't remember getting vaccinated, but I think I probably got the flu without knowing it and developed antibodies without realizing it.
Is the dining table a tray or a placemat?
The dining table has become a tray due to Corona.
I heard that housework is easy.
Is there anyone who started playing basketball as an adult from the age of 24?
I'm not a beginner, but I can't say I'm very good either. I've been gaining weight recently, so I'm thinking of trying it out as part of my diet. What do you think?
There are many such circles, and if invited, I will go play basketball.
Even beginners are of course welcome.
When watching commercials of Showa-era cars on YouTube, it seemed to me that they were stirring up purchasing power along with the music. Can you say that the old car commercials were good, or well done?
I think Honda's commercial was good.
I don't recall popular actors and actresses being actively used in car commercials during the Showa era like they are today.
Well, there were also many commercials featuring celebrities.
There's no doubt that the atmosphere was much more stylish than it is now.
This happened a while ago, but it's been bothering me, so I'm asking for your help.
I was hospitalized for prostate enlargement surgery, but since I was hospitalized for two months, I hardly benefited from the high-cost medical care system.
(Since one month is the standard)
Is it possible that a doctor would intentionally make this last for two months?
It's probably because of the coronavirus.
If there's no threat to life, it's triage.
Should I just speak up to clear up the misunderstanding?
Can you solve it right away as I said?
I believe the misunderstanding will be resolved if the other party is convinced that it is a misunderstanding.
Why don't you give it a try?
Isn't it a bit problematic if you've studied economics in graduate school and obtained an MBA, but still can't manage your own money?
It's not a problem, I didn't get an MBA to manage my own money.
Does it take several days for swollen lymph nodes to heal?
I think the cause of the swelling would depend.
If you have a swollen infection like a cold, I think it will subside once the cold is somewhat healed.
If the swelling is too severe and there is pain, the doctor said that it won't heal without antibiotics, so it might be a good idea to go to the hospital once.
Can you run longer than a fifth-grade elementary student?
Absolutely impossible!!
Isn't Vegeta from Dragon Ball kind of cute?
Yes, that's right.
Her personality is tsundere and she's quite short, which makes her feel cute.
I think it's about 165 cm.
There are towns where you pay a condolence fee of 500 yen when a town resident dies, but would you pay 500 yen for someone you're not acquainted with?
The neighborhood association's bylaws stipulate the handling of condolence money in the event of death.
In the town, regardless of whether there is a relationship or not, it is uniformly set at 500 yen.
Even if the drawings are poor in a comic, would you still read it if the story is interesting?
Do you want to continue reading?
Even a terrible artist like me...! (;_;)
It's still a rough draft and I haven't decided on the character design yet, but I plan to make it dark from the first page!
A good drawing skill is essential for manga.
You wouldn't even pick it up if the drawing is bad.
Would you be upset if your wife occasionally decided to make dinner with frozen food?
First, I'm concerned about your health.
If you can make delicious frozen food, that's fine, but if it's obviously bad or doesn't suit my taste, I might get angry.
We might explore together better ways to make frozen food more delicious.
A naive question.
Can I, who am not very tech-savvy, use ChatGPT?
Registered.
I feel that quite a bit of knowledge is necessary to apply it.
Playing is simple, so anyone can do it.
Please share a quote that can be helpful during times of fatigue or hardship, or at any time.
Eat your meal while it's still hot.
The clerk's smile has become scary (-_-;) It's scary when they smile at you even when you're not interested.
What do you think?
Don't overthink it, don't rush, just have conversations little by little. I think it's natural to gradually become friends♪
Doesn't grilled squid go well with sake?
It's perfect with sake, but with western liquor, the fishy smell tends to linger.
Isn't there a latest movie for the "Dangerous Detective"?
Since it's 2016, that would be six years ago.
Ah, I'm tired again today, so tired.
By the way, even if you fail at work, it's good to analyze why you failed and use it for next time, right?
Is that okay?
Thank you for your hard work today.
Yes, that's right.
I think it would be best to analyze why you failed and make sure not to fail next time.
Rikkyo University's Yosuke Ikeda has declared his professional aspirations, so is he aiming to be the 17th professional baseball player from Chiben Wakayama High School?
It seems that he started to become aware of his own potential when his senior at Rikkyo University, Yasumasa Shoji, was selected as the first draft pick by Rakuten last year.
183cm, 92kg, right-handed, pitcher.
With a fastball reaching speeds of up to 150km, there is also a variety of breaking balls including sliders, curves, change-ups, forks, and two-seamers.
If selected, it would be the 17th time a student from Chiben Wakayama High School has been chosen since Juto Kobayashi was picked by Hiroshima in the 4th round of the 20-year draft.
Including comic books, and so on...
Recently, I've been re-reading books that I read a long time ago.
When the rain stops...
It's enjoyable when the actor is doing the reading.
With Mr. Morito's deep voice...
Roughly one book every two days.
About 15 books a month.
Borrowing from the library or re-reading something I read a long time ago.
It's not that I want to read, it's just to kill time.
I believe each has its own strengths and weaknesses.
What are the pros and cons of the car you are driving?
Who has the authority to buy a car?
I will buy my own car.
The advantages are that it's cheap and has good fuel efficiency.
The downside is that it comes with almost no optional equipment.
A look that seems too sweet...
The length of the skirt is a bit tricky...
I would appreciate your advice.
This is intended for everything from commuting to going out.
The top and bottom are both flared and annoying, so how about making the bottom a pants style or a tight fit?
Or how about trying a more streamlined top?
Is Shimajiro's Wow aired on Sundays on TV Tokyo?
Yes, that's right.
It will start late at night on 7/10 (Sunday) on TV Tokyo.
Time Note:
It is from 25:30 on Sunday, July 10th.
In other words, it would be from 1:30 AM on the morning of July 11th (Monday), when the date changes.
Does the outdoor unit not operate when the air conditioner is blowing air?
How do you generate wind?
The indoor unit's fan draws air in from the air intake and expels it from the air outlet.
When changing the temperature of the air, the outdoor unit operates to work the heat exchanger, but if it's just for ventilation, there's no need for that, so the outdoor unit is not involved.
If I ask the supermarket clerk for a case of giant ice cream cones, will they sell it to me?
If they have stock in the backyard and there is no problem with the number of items they can display in the store, they will probably accommodate you. However, this applies not only to giant corn but also to dry batteries, sweets, and bread. Since there are circumstances at these stores, it is more reliable to contact them in advance for reservations.
When I ordered 30 ice creams as a treat for the children's club activities, I made sure to request it in advance.
Please tell me if there are any free location-based apps.
Now that my child has a smartphone, I would like to be able to confirm their whereabouts.
I installed an app called "Cocodayo" and after a month, it required a payment.
Please tell me if there is a free location confirmation app.
The "Location Sharing" feature on Google Maps is available for free.

Which commercial facility do you like?
I don't go often, but it's Apita.

During the sale period, I can buy clothes and bags at a great price, which is really helpful. ^ - ^

Can you find out how many accounts you have at the same bank by contacting the bank?
If it's in your name, they will probably tell you if you show your ID.
It's impossible to use someone else's account.
It was lushly grown around the home vegetable garden.
Could it be a relative of chives?
It's hard to understand because the flower part is not clear.
Could it be chives?
It is known as an invasive species with a very strong ability to reproduce as a weed.
If it's edible chives, tearing the leaves will give off a unique chive smell.
Please be aware that field garlic is not edible.
In this day and age, is it considered rude to brush your teeth in the restroom after eating at a restaurant?
I don't think it's unreasonable.
I just think you're very meticulous.
What do you think of people who play brick breaker games?
Is it because it's still fun after all?
When you do well in a game of breakout, it can be exhilarating and give you a sense of superiority.
Because it's fun after all?
It does require some thinking, but it's fun!!!
Has it been confirmed that the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks and the Orix Buffaloes will be in the A-Class of the Pacific League for the 2022 season?

Sugarvine.
I am growing houseplants indoors.
Recently, there seems to be a brown or reddish pattern on the surface of the leaves.
Please determine whether it's leaf burn or mold.
It's expanding day by day.
We recommend liquid fertilizer to prevent pests and diseases.
Anyway, it's important to provide nutrients and build resistance during periods of active growth.
What happens if you cook rice with the lid of the rice cooker open?
It probably won't move.
If it moves, the moisture will fly off and it will become crispy.
Even when cooking rice in a frying pan, you have to make sure the lid is properly closed.
Is the UK equivalent to Ireland?
Although they are both Christian countries, they have become separate nations due to differences in denominations (England = Church of England, Ireland = Catholic).
I am looking for a gaming router that is not compatible with Wi-Fi 6 and has a good reputation for its wireless LAN.
Due to certain circumstances, construction is not possible. I am fully aware that without Wi-Fi 6, it doesn't make much sense, but still...
If you know something good like this, please let me know.
Thank you in advance.
Nowadays, it's harder to find products that are not compatible with Wi-Fi 6.
I think it's fine to use Wi-Fi 6 products because they normally support even unsupported devices.
Does the Tokaido Shinkansen slow down at Yamashina when arriving in Kyoto?
Naturally, I started to slow down before reaching Yamashina.
The distance between Kyoto and Yamashina is only 5.5 km.
Assuming you were traveling at a speed of 280 km/h, it would only take about one to one and a half minutes to reach that distance.
Why do few people put mayonnaise on delicious yakitori?
It's because many people do not find it delicious.
Was the CD single by Porno Graffiti released on July 13, 2022 (Wednesday)?
If anyone knows, please tell me.
It is not released yet.
Their last CD single was the 51st [Theme Song], which was released on Wednesday, September 22nd last year.
It rose to a highest rank of 2 on the Oricon chart.
It's June now, it wouldn't be strange to wear off-shoulder clothes, right?
I think it's not strange, as the kimono is already a summer one.
It depends on the weather of the day.
What does "chan-chan" at the end of a sentence mean? Thank you in advance m(_ _)m.

Is it better to do strength training before or after a meal?
Training while in a state of depleted energy (on an empty stomach) can lead to muscle loss.
Consuming nutrition (mainly protein) after training makes it easier for muscles to grow.
Therefore, if you're serious about it, you might need to replenish both before and after training.
But if you had to choose between the two, I think it's better to eat before training.
Do you like posts from friends who don't like your posts on Facebook or Instagram?
I will do it if I think it's good.
I believe that "likes" are not something to be done reciprocally, but something to be done when you genuinely like a post or information.
I have absolutely no interest in whether other people like it or not.
Is the Cretan who says that all Cretans are liars telling the truth?
It's a paradoxical problem.
If an honest person becomes a liar, and a liar continues to lie, they are lying about being a liar.
Which one would you recommend if I were to buy one among Dragon Quest Theatrhythm, Rhythm Heaven Fever Wii, and Wario Land Shake?
I highly recommend Theatrhythm.
Please tell me about the economic effects of reducing working hours.
According to reports from companies that have implemented shorter working hours, many have seen an increase in performance as employees have sought to improve their work efficiency due to the reduced hours.
Improvements in performance lead to higher salaries and more holidays, which in turn increase spending. This also has an economic effect.
Does increasing the air pressure in car studless tires have no effect on driving on snowy roads?
Will increasing the air pressure slightly improve fuel efficiency?
Do I need to set it quite high?
I believe the rolling resistance will improve.
Studded tires are low-pressure tires, so increasing the pressure can lead to issues such as the tires not gripping the snow well and becoming more prone to bursting, which is not beneficial.
I have never received the best answer.
How can I get the best answer?
I'm not consciously aware of it, but I do receive it sometimes.
Firstly, I sincerely answer those who are asking questions seriously. I put myself in their shoes and think carefully before responding.
I am thinking about what would be the best response to the other person.
That means it can sometimes be the best thing for the person asking the question.
For your reference.
After I lift my eyelashes, they droop down again. I would like to know a method to keep them lifted.
Apply mascara, let it dry, then gradually create a curve in three stages.
Applying mascara first, to put it simply, acts like a glue, creating a firm feeling. If you curl your lashes after that, they are more likely to hold their shape.
It looks neat when divided into three stages.
Please tell me about some convenient gadgets that you wish you had started using earlier to make life easier.
Futon dryer
I didn't expect it to be this good.
The futon is freshly aired and fluffy!
During this time, you can get a heavenly sleep♬.
As shown in the photo, is the AKB48 Team 8 costume the one worn at Odaiba Gasshukoku 2013?
By the way, can it be worn on the eighth day as well?
There are photos from Odaiba Gasshukoku 2013 in the same outfit, aren't there?
I was not sure whether it was worn on the eighth day.
I would like you to tell me your favorite soba and udon.
The soba is zaru soba, isn't it?
I also like tororo soba (buckwheat noodles with grated yam).
The udon is tempura udon.
Whether it's because I'm poor, tempura shrimp udon feels like a real feast.
Too persistent.
It's been going on and on since about 1:30.
This sentence does not contain any meaningful content to translate. "ゴロゴロ" is a Japanese onomatopoeia that represents the sound of thunder or a rolling object.
Even with earplugs in, I could hear everything clearly; they had no effect at all.
The unbearable, painful hell of sleeplessness truly exists.
Just how long will this go on????
Isn't it referred to as spring thunder or snow removal?
It will end soon.
I have been to several different dentists so far, and when I sit in that treatment chair, there are doctors and dental hygienists who talk to me from slightly behind and at an angle.
I'm not sure whether it's better to look back, but constantly looking back is hard on my posture and tiring. On the other hand, I wonder if it's rude to keep facing forward...
Does anyone understand?
How are you doing?
Not only at the dentist, but also at the barber or perm shop, you talk while facing forward.
Which material is cooler, 100% polyester or dry rayon?
Dry rayon is excellent and cool.
Please tell me.
I joined the company in April.
What should I do to become a savvy person?
Thank you in advance.
Rather than thinking about becoming a savvy person, the priority now is to quickly master the job you have been given and become a valuable asset to the company.
Is your body clock accurate?
Only my internal body clock and stomach clock have never gone haywire.
The surface panel of my bathroom sink has peeled off and I would like to request a repair. Which store should I contact for this?
Please advise.
I will measure the size of the decorative board available at the home center, process it, and repair or replace it myself.
When going to submit your tax return documents to the tax office, they don't need to be in color print, right?
Yes
When can I expect the amount I applied for in my tax return after the New Year to be deposited into my account?
It should be transferred in about 2 to 3 weeks.
You will receive a postcard notifying you to make a payment in advance. Once you receive it, please update your passbook as the payment has been made.
For now, all we can do is wait for the postcard (notification).
Please tell me how to check my LINE ID.
You can view it by selecting the home icon in the bottom left, then pressing the gear icon in the top right, and finally selecting the top profile.
If it has not been set, you can set it only once.
Can I purchase a ticketless express ticket at E5489 using a VISA LINE PAY prepaid card?
Good evening.
The "ticketless express ticket" for JR West's "e5489" requires payment by credit card.
Prepaid cards cannot be used.
A considerable amount of time has passed, do you think it's okay?
It's vegetable juice.
It also depends on how you save it.
If it has been kept in the refrigerator all the time, you can drink it even after 2 or 3 days. However, if it has been left out or kept at room temperature, it might be better to dispose of it.
It would be a problem if something happened to your body later on.
Why is Shinichi Saruhara, the "Sal Brother" from "Avatarou Don Brothers", able to eat and drink at "Cafe Donbura" even though he is unemployed?
What is the payment?
Except for the two episodes that were paid for in haiku, no orders have been placed.
Which function of this washing machine is similar to a gentle water flow (such as a hand wash function)?
Thank you in advance.
Please select "Dry" in the course.
Can I enjoy the movie "The Promised Neverland" without knowing anything about the plot beforehand?
You can enjoy it.
Because it's a simple story.
May I write a story about humans escaping from monsters that feed on them?
I think nurses come to work in casual clothes, but is it okay to wear sandals with bare feet?
Well, since you're going to change all your clothes anyway, isn't any outfit that's not too weird and easy to commute in fine?
I envy houses where no one comes at all, but is there anything disadvantageous about such houses?
I end up not doing the cleaning inside the house regularly.
Hospitality towards customers can also become unfamiliar.
About Instagram.
I (an ordinary person) currently have about 10,000 followers. If someone who doesn't know me saw this, would they think, "Wow, that's amazing"?
Or do you not think anything of it separately?
What does it feel like?
I think it's incredible.
It's a miracle for the average person.
I think something special was being done.
Frustrated with problems.
Since I don't have much time to exercise, I decided to try the popular trend of pressure innerwear and bought one.
My body type is 175cm in height and 80kg in weight. I purchased a size L.
It may be quite difficult to wear at first, but I think it will be fine once you get used to it.
I had been using it for a few days, but due to a problem, I am now using a different compression innerwear.
The issue is that unless you have quite slender arms, the sleeve edges (right around the upper arm) are too tight, causing a situation just short of congestion, which can be itchy.
I stopped using it due to two issues: 2, the lower abdomen is too loose.
The fit is quite tight, but it's comfortable enough to sleep in without any problems.
It's a great deal for the right person.
Even at 158cm and 50kg, size S was fine.
But it didn't suit me, who is large-framed and muscular.
Since it is not three-dimensional like a buttock, it does not fit well, tends to sag, and can create strange gaps.
I always felt like I had to keep pushing myself up.
I think it would be good for people with a stick-like body shape.
Would you call it a reassuring thinness in terms of thickness?
The boots were not flimsy or about to tear, but were snug knee-high boots that could be tucked in, creating a neat look.
That's nice.
I came across this while looking for something different from a fitness swimsuit for the upper body, but I didn't want to show too much skin.
The top features a stylish lace-up back and a single mark at the hem for a fashionable touch.
It's nice to have the option to wear either a bikini bottom or shorts over it in two ways (^.
I just received it and have only tried it on, so I don't know about its durability or how it feels when wet. However, the stitching is beautiful, the fabric is sturdy, and I thought it was a great deal for the price.
The description mentioned that there was no wire in the bust area, but upon touching it, it seems that there is a firm core under the padding.
But, it doesn't hurt to wear it, and it fits well along the bust, so I think it seems good even when moving.
Did they change the model from one without a pad to one with a pad?
(^. - This appears to be an incomplete sentence or a typographical error. Please provide more context.
I'm looking forward to getting in the water now! Thank you so much!
At 45kg and 156cm, the medium size is a bit large.
Although the raincoat is made of thick fabric and may feel stuffy, I believe it can be used for a long time because it is well made.
The two rain visors kept my face from getting wet.
The strength was not an issue, and it could be used with confidence even in a bicycle during a storm.
It was not torn after use.
I carry it in a compressed bag to keep it compact.
Truly, this product exceeded expectations for its price.
It was successfully installed.
It was installed on the CLA 180 Shooting Brake in the 2016 model.
Even beginners can manage the installation by watching YouTube videos or reading the instruction manual.
Be careful, as loosening the Torx screw too much can cause it to fall inside the car.
I dropped one and it went missing.
Lastly, when crimping the gray connector onto the brown and green-red wires, using a type of pliers such as radio pliers with a tapered tip can result in uneven force, causing the plastic to crack as shown in the photo, making it impossible to install.
When you call their support, they will send a new cable by mail the next day. It's a company with very solid support.
On the retry, it worked well when I applied force all at once with the wide pliers as shown in the instruction manual's photo.
When returning the last main unit to the car, it took a bit of skill to store the wiring, but I was able to install it somehow.
After installation, there are no issues and you can watch DVDs, TV, and use the navigation system even while driving.
I believe this product offers excellent cost performance, considering that it costs over 80,000 yen at a dealer and over 40,000 yen even at a specialty store.
More than worth the price.
Honestly, I don't understand why this is so highly rated. First of all, the stuffing inside is polyester, but it's cut off in the cushion, so there are fluffy parts and empty parts. It already feels worn out. In fact, there's not much stuffing overall. I tried it out and thought that products where the head and body pillow parts are integrated, you won't know if it suits you or not unless you try it. I thought it would be better to have separate pillows and body pillows to avoid failure. I bought it in a time sale for 3600 yen, but I want to return it. I regret not being more cautious about reviews with 5 stars in the first place.
Neither yes nor no.
Product arrival.
I started using it right away.
There are no issues with usability and it can properly express milk.
However, I sometimes find the sound a bit noisy and there are times when the power button doesn't respond well.
I don't mind because I can use it without any problems, but it might bother people who are particular about such things.
It's not super quiet 😅 You might have to be a bit careful if you're using it in the middle of the night.
I was also worried about whether the included tube would fit into the machine, but it went in by pushing it in 😂 It's lightweight, so I think it's easy to carry around!
There's a knack to making it frothy...
I'm not sure if it's due to my hair type or the performance of this shampoo, but it hardly lathers at all with normal use.
(The shampoo I've been using so far has been foaming up without any problems even when used normally) So, here's the solution I found↓ ①First, take less shampoo than usual in your hand and lather it into your hair all over.
(At this point, it does not foam to the level where not a single bubble appears) ② Rinse your hair once, then take an appropriate amount of shampoo in your hand and blend it into your hair.
(Finally, it lathers normally) Well, in essence, it's a double wash, haha. The shampoo itself has a rather small volume, so the trick is to use as little as possible for the first wash... I am satisfied with the effect of the shampoo itself.
It's clear that I've bought a rather expensive shampoo, but I definitely felt that the texture of my hair improved.
However, to be honest, my overall impression was that I was not satisfied.
It's a shame about the Quattro Botanico series, especially since it was popular as a facial cleansing product...
The poor cost-effectiveness of being forced to wash twice despite the small capacity.
Considering that the scent may not be universally appealing, I will give it a somewhat strict rating of two stars.
Evaluation is difficult.
There are pros and cons, making evaluation difficult.
The blade cleaner will only clean the front side of the blade.
I believe it matches well with a razor that has good original blade precision.
Posi: As intended, it can remove dirt such as sebum and soap scum that has adhered to the blade.
(Although it's only the surface) If the sharpness is reduced due to the dirt, it will last longer.
Negative: The lifespan of the smoother is drastically reduced.
Items with coatings on the blade edge, such as titanium coating or ceramic coating, tend to peel off easily.
I think it's better to use this cleaner after using the razor 2-3 times, as most of the coating comes off by then.
Be careful with razors that have a warning not to wipe the blade.
I heard that anti-tip rubber (vibration-proof rubber) that can be placed under furniture for earthquake preparedness can be used as a substitute, so I'm wondering about its cost performance.
*Note: From my experience, the lifespan of the razor increases by 20-30%.
Determining when to dispose of a razor blade can be difficult, but I believe it's when the blade has been damaged by shaving and the edge has become jagged.
In that sense, I think it's a good product because it can prevent the sharpness from decreasing due to dirt.
(Note that this is strictly a cleaner and does not have a sharpening effect. There may be times when it feels like it's sharpening, but that's likely because it's removing small rust.)
Lured by a TV commercial...
I ended up buying it after seeing a TV commercial where an older woman's face was lifted just by applying it once.
Upon actual use, the texture is slightly firmer than regular gel, and I use it after wiping off with a pre-lotion.
At first, it feels sticky and unpleasant, but as you massage it into your skin, it surprisingly absorbs well.
Once applied, there was hardly any stickiness, and it felt like my skin was adhering to my hand.
The lift-up did not go as smoothly as it does on TV.
I felt the firmness immediately.
As I have extremely dry skin, this alone is not enough, so I have been using it after applying a certain Moisture Surge 72 beforehand.
It feels just moisturized.
I was hoping that it would also cover the looseness of my pores, but it does not.
You might want to try one bottle and see if it works. If it does, you might consider repurchasing.
It must have been quite a task to compile all of this...
It is a laborious work that summarizes the statements of politicians over the past few years.
While reading, you will somewhat understand and agree with what was said at that time.
However, when considering its value as a reading material, it's a delicate matter whether what the authors call "fact-checking" is sufficient.
To be honest, it's not interesting to read.
After much consideration, I felt that the major flaw of this book lies in its "method".
What we are calling "fact" here, whether it remains a fact forever or not, ultimately no one knows.
I felt quite suspicious from the way they wrote, wondering whether they were aware of the fragility (or should I say, refutability) of "fact-checking".
If the current Japanese journalists' perception of "facts" is at this level, it makes me feel a bit gloomy.
It seems to be highly recommended, but it might be suitable for those who want to have some knowledge about the content covered in this book.
If you are a reader interested in the "fact-checking" conducted by the current Japanese media, like the reviewer, this book may not be for you.
For those who can't improve their scores in mock exams.
In my school, political economy was taught in a print-based format, and the class structure felt like we were being forced to study, which was really boring. Before I knew it, I had come to dislike political economy.
To be honest, this reference book saved me.
Currently a senior in high school and taking the university entrance exams this year.
I chose this as my study partner for the one-hour commute to and from school since purchasing it in March.
The first impression can be summed up in one word: straightforward.
You're reaching the realm of the divine, aren't you?
After going through one cycle and trying past questions, I, who used to average 40, scored 70.
I was indeed surprised myself.
It grows so much you'd think it ate something strange.
What I gained from this reference book was not only knowledge and information about political economy, but also an increase in my own abilities and motivation to study, which I could tangibly feel improving synergistically.
I am truly grateful for the encounter you have given me.
Security
Eight years ago, I experienced two attempted door pickings and have since taken security measures.
This time, I am replacing a camera that I bought 8 years ago.
Previously, we used a 30m infrared radiation type (from another company).
As others have mentioned, this product can recognize faces at a distance of about 5 meters at night.
I agree as well.
I just received it and haven't set it up yet, but I'm at the stage of comparing the camera's image quality and checking for any issues.
The image quality has significantly improved compared to a camera from 8 years ago (which is to be expected).
I displayed it in four sections on a 32-inch monitor, but there is no problem if you maximize the shooting size.
So far, there are no issues with the product.
For those considering a system that can do facial recognition for purposes beyond security, you might be dissatisfied with the night-time shooting, but at this price, it's top-notch!
I am for security measures, but I am not requiring facial recognition.
This is because it is not possible to identify someone if they are wearing a disguise or mask (especially at night).
Professional burglars have knowledge of security cameras.
Even small, high-performance cameras and recording devices can be detected.
On the other hand, it would be a problem if you're not a professional.
However, recent burglars are bold and clever, so it is recommended to not only rely on cameras but also use various security gadgets.
For example, you can purchase a white solar LED garden light at a home center for about 1,500 yen (the latest ones are very bright when six are installed together).
Although it's solar-powered and doesn't require electricity, it doesn't stay lit until morning in the winter, so we also have three 100V motion-sensor LED lights installed.
With this combination, we were able to ensure a distance of 30 meters for recognizing human figures.
Also, for daytime security, if you feel that the deterrent effect is diminished because the camera is small, I think it is necessary to cover it with ingenuity.
I have a sticker that says "24-hour surveillance camera in operation."
This is an original product from the security camera manufacturer I used to use.
Manufacturer's products are more effective than those sold at home improvement stores.
The place to stick it is the thief's entry route that would likely not be covered by camera surveillance.
In that sense, I really wanted a sticker this time.
Additionally, I found the network setup instructions difficult to understand, which is a negative point.
I will add any corrections if there are any oversights after the setup and configuration.
So relatable it hurts to read.
If you were born in Japan in 1982, your social situation might be somewhat better than hers, but despite the implementation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Law, the situation is still far from equal.
As I read on, memories of living through discrimination as a member of society, of the painful realization that 'yes, that's how it was, it really was', came flooding back, making me feel suffocated.
It depicts the struggles of all women trying to live as humans, not just as women, in feudal societies, not just in Korea and Japan.
Isn't it time for at least women to stop emotional conflicts, join forces, and confront this society?
A drama that makes you think "Men are the worst".
The story of a protagonist who suffered sexual abuse from their biological father during their childhood.
Naturally, one continues to carry those wounds even into adulthood.
All the men that show up are the worst.
The protagonist's husband, who appears to be gentle and family-oriented, is in a way, the worst.
Spoiler alert↓ The protagonist's sister is being domestically abused by her husband, and even though the protagonist knows about it, she ignores it. When the sister-in-law finally gathers the courage to report her husband to the police, the protagonist's husband, who is a police officer, ignores it. The actions of the men in the story are frustrating.
The protagonist's elderly mother, who pretends to be senile, knows the fact that her husband (the protagonist's real father) was killed by their daughter, but the daughter is unaware of this (officially, the father's death is due to drug overdose).
In short, after the death of the rapist father, it seems that the daughter was not given any counseling, so it's only natural that the protagonist would go insane.
Why does the protagonist's daughter keep asking about her deceased grandfather?
Are you really that concerned about the death of an old man at your young age?
There are too many question marks in the drama.
A few years ago, during a summer heatwave in France, many elderly people died. Despite hospitals and facilities contacting their children, many French people responded that they couldn't take them in because they were on vacation. This led to reports of morgues in Paris becoming full.
These people are "dry".
Towards the end of the drama, watching my husband and daughter, I felt that it was indeed "dry".
French films are quite different from American ones, often leaving a good aftertaste with their ambiguous parts. However, there were quite a few scenes that I thought should have been cut, and I ended up fast-forwarding through a lot of it.
Professional boundaries
Even with meticulous calculations, if an unforeseen accident that couldn't be fully accounted for involved someone's life, they must have been prepared to stake their own life on it, to some extent, even if they had calculated from the beginning.
The script was brilliant, embodying the subtle drama of her private struggles and battles, and how far she would deceive those around her to uphold her own beliefs.
Even so... Jessica's acting is truly amazing.
There's no such thing as a miss, no matter what you look at.
It's truly a professional's job.
It broke down after use.
I have used three units so far, but this product, for better or worse, broke in no time.
The reason I chose this product was because I used the first built-in vaporizer with 2200 milliamps, but the battery ran out after three sessions at 200 degrees for 5 minutes each.
The second USB port is defective.
It becomes impossible to charge.
This product was intended to solve previous issues, but after reinserting the battery about 15 times (I was using a charger to avoid damaging the USB port), it seems the contact has deteriorated and it has become difficult to turn on the power.
Pressing the lid turns on the power.
I believe some of you who use IQOS may have had this experience.
That symptom.
As noted in the instructions, the device does not use any batteries other than the ones provided.
The claw and catch parts seem to be carved out, so they don't seem to bend.
Therefore, it was returned in about 10 days.
I bought one without the Starly logo at the same time as the return, and I will describe the content compared with this one.
The appearance and size are the same.
The chamber and the draw are the same.
The LCD is cleaner on this one.
It might be newer than the one without a logo.
The vibe here is understated.
Like the vibration of a smartphone.
Without the logo, the vibration or rather the sound of the vibe is loud.
A cheap-looking Chinese smartphone.
This product is also Chinese...
The attachments may vary slightly.
This comes with a liquid case.
Without a logo, it's like a lump of steel wool.
That's roughly the idea.
I think Starly would have been better, but if it breaks immediately, it loses credibility.
I wanted to exchange it, but only returns were available, so I proceeded with the process, even though it was a hassle.
It's just an ear rubber, but still an ear rubber.
This flat rubber really doesn't hurt.
In terms of comfort, it's the best mask of its kind that I've used so far.
Even with flat rubber, it can sometimes twist, causing the twisted helix part to rub against the base of the ear, which can be more painful than round rubber. However, I believe this product is not only soft to the touch, but also made to be just the right length to resist twisting.
The mask fits well on the face, not only because of its fit, but also because of the adequate space created in front of the mouth between the nose wire and the lower edge that extends to the chin, making it less likely to feel suffocating.
It could be because it fits the dimensions of your own face.
I can't guarantee it will suit everyone, but if you're not satisfied with other smaller sizes, I think it's worth giving it a try.
When you open the outer box, it's in a vinyl with a central slit like a box of tissues, but when you take out the first one, the ear loops on both sides get caught and it's hard to take out, so I deducted one star for that.
The vendor's response is one star.
The price and taste were impeccable, but I felt distrustful of the vendor's response, who ignored my specified delivery date and sent it anyway.
In addition to this product, I bought drinks in bulk.
I always purchase from Amazon, so I'm familiar with the delivery person.
We made arrangements to match the arrival date as much as possible, especially for carrying heavy items upstairs, but it was all in vain.
While it's said that Amazon is causing difficulties for delivery companies, I'm doing what I can to help, even if it's just one thing, from the user's side.
I am disappointed with the arrogant vendor's response.
But the price is cheap.
If considering a purchase, include the disposal cost.
I have many complaints and I don't think I can use it for long.
I think it's best to consider the cost of disposal when making your decision.
For reference, there seem to be some municipalities that have centers where they will accept large waste items for free or at a low cost if you bring them in.
[Comfort] The seat is slightly tilted to the left and wobbles, making it very tiring to sit on.
Even the slightest movement produces a loud creaking noise.
It's too noisy to use at night.
This is my biggest concern, and I feel that I cannot continue to use it in this state.
[Assembly] The assembly instructions are only roughly explained through diagrams.
The information needed for assembly is insufficient and there are many errors.
There is no explanation about the direction when attaching the seat and the pillar base. Some reviews mention that it tilts forward, but there is a possibility that the direction of attaching the seat and the pillar base is reversed.
When correctly installed, the height adjustment lever should be on the right side facing backwards, and the dial to adjust the tension of the back spring should be facing forward.
However, many people may mistakenly install the height adjustment lever facing forward as it feels more natural.
The instructions do not include these basic precautions, so you will have to assemble it by trial and error while looking at the rough drawings.
There is an error in the description of the contents. The list of contents at the beginning of the manual is incorrect.
It seems that many buyers are unable to find the included 12 pieces of 8x20mm screws and end up searching for them.
The 8x20mm screws are already inserted into the chair, so be careful not to waste time looking for them unnecessarily.
The workmanship seems to be poor, as there appear to be combinations of the same screw holes and screws that fit and others that do not.
In some combinations, it can be very difficult to just insert the screw into the screw hole.
Therefore, one can imagine that it might be shipped in this state with the screws inserted.
Also, I couldn't find the spare screws mentioned in the manual.
[Others] The black part of the vinyl leather surface has uneven coloring and is white in some places, so it's better not to expect it to look as nice as the product photos.
An explanation of any inaccuracies in the instructions and additional explanations of the above installation methods were sent to the email address registered with Amazon 2-3 days after the product arrived.
Ideally, these should be issued immediately after the product is shipped.
It is completely meaningless as many buyers have finished assembling the product within 2-3 days of its arrival.
Hmm...
I've been a big fan of Thermos and have been using their straw type for over 15 years, but this model is by far the most difficult to use of all the ones I've tried so far.
The straw's drinking part is now made of a harder material and fits snugly into the grooves of the main body, making it impossible to remove the straw's drinking part from the main body!
I tried so hard to get it that I ended up breaking a nail..
The tip of the straw's drinking part has become narrower than before, making it impossible to insert a straw brush.
The mysterious part called a valve attached to the end of the straw is thicker than the straw brush, making it dramatically harder to clean.
I've been using the straw type until now and I've never had a single complaint, so this is a bit of a shock.
It's really stressful when the drinking spout can't be removed from the main body.
The good point is the consistently outstanding cooling power.
When I forget to take it out of the bag and wash it the next day, about half of the ice I put in the day before is still left.
I don't drink hot beverages, so I will continue to be a straw type.
Please make improvements in the next model.
First review (with additional photos)
This will be my first time conducting a review.
(I am a complete novice with little knowledge about buying a doll from scratch and installing doll eyes for the first time) The product arrived as shown in the photo.
I am very satisfied with how cute the Obitsu doll looks when dressed up, and how well it catches the light.
However, the fit is a bit tight and you need to push it in with some force to put it on.
I think I did it differently, but I inserted tweezers into the doll's eye hole and pushed it in.
Regarding shipping, it was my first time shipping from overseas so I was estimating about three weeks, but it arrived much faster than expected in just 8 days (since Narita Airport is close).
I was worried because the shipping email was never sent.
Looking at the Amazon shipping status just now, it is still marked as in transit.
There was no damage or air in the pupils, and the back of the envelope was filled with bubble wrap and it was in a small sealed bag, so I think it's somewhat reassuring.
However, the phone number was printed on the envelope, is it okay to have personal information on an international mail?
I felt doubtful, so I'm giving it a minus one.
I believe the product is a great deal at that price for this quantity, without any issues.
Addendum: Doll Eye 8mm model for iPhone SE.
It's a bit small (the workspace is narrow), and it has severe static electricity.
I looked at the size chart before ordering, but it felt about two sizes smaller than I had imagined.
Although it is larger than A4 size, the outer perimeter is a groove for part stock, so the usable range in work is narrower than A4.
I was thinking of using it for repairing electronics and building Gunpla, but without B4 size, it's indeed hard to use.
If you only use the soldering iron for soldering work and use a different tray or mat for assembly or disassembly, it might work out.
It's impossible to place tools, parts, and also work within the area of a magazine size.
I considered ordering another one to double the area, but during work, the static electricity was so severe that dust and cut parts were all attracted to it, so I think it might be tough to continue using it.
Fatal defective products.
After struggling to open the battery box lid, I finally managed to open it using a rubber non-slip sheet. However, after inserting the batteries, I couldn't close it no matter what I did.
You're out at this point.
Highly rated ones!
Does the battery box lid close?
Additionally, instead of a protective seal on the product, there was a loose piece of cling film attached.
Could this possibly be a used item???
The only description was a small piece of paper densely filled with English text.
I have no idea how to operate it, and there are no explanatory diagrams.
It might be good for other fingers...
I found a good product!
I thought about it and immediately made a purchase.
I used it for a pinky ring, but unless I use a lot, it doesn't fit perfectly and it becomes a bit rough, which I didn't like very much.
But I think it's good to use for other fingers.
But I think you're a good idea merchant.
You get what you pay for.
Indeed, one should not expect quality from this type of product.
One of the flower marks was crushed.
The size feels just right when I tried it on.
It might be tough for people with thick earlobes.
Perhaps it would have been better to buy one without a pattern.
Oh no.
The design is good, but it's big when you hold it. I wonder if the effect won't diminish even if you put it on your foot?
In the harsh winter of Eastern Hokkaido...
As mentioned in other reviews, the heating wire is only 110x80 in net size and is arranged horizontally, not vertically.
I wanted to evenly warm the entire futon, so I bought a larger one even though it's more expensive than the mattress type. However, unlike famous brands, I couldn't check it in the store, so I guess it can't be helped.
You have no choice but to use it in combination with a hot water bottle and N Warm of 〇 Tori.
By the way, the quality of the blanket is out of the question.
Well done, but...
It's compact and has sufficient airflow.
The battery can also be replaced and spare ones are available.
If you're adjusting the angle on a desk, it's best to do it as shown in the photo.
On a smooth desk, it may blow away with a gust of wind, but there's no problem if you lay a handkerchief down.
The sound is unnoticeable at 'medium' level when used outdoors or in a family restaurant, but it's too loud and unacceptable at 'low' level in an office setting.
It is necessary to understand that it is ultimately meant to be a companion for when you go out.
Also, in office use, even the "small" setting can be too cold due to the high air volume.
It's perfect for scenarios where you're sweating heavily on the go, duck into a family restaurant, and cool down all at once with a "large" size.
There is just one issue, occasionally when thrown into a bag, the power button may be pressed and the device may unknowingly be left on.
It would be nice to have features such as slightly recessing the button or making the first press a long press.
In this era of dangerously hot weather, it is an essential item, so it would be helpful if you could make a better one.
Multifunctional Light Speaker
I use it in the bedroom, set to the softest warm color.
It's better than I thought!
I'm glad I bought it.
As a light, it allows you to adjust the brightness and color by touch.
The white color matches any room, and the color light changes in gradient, which is beautiful.
Also, by simply touching your favorite color, it will stop at that color, allowing you to light it up according to your mood!
Since it is LED-based, a long lifespan can be expected.
As for the sound quality, to my amateur ears, I think it's more than satisfactory.
Another amazing feature of this light is its multifunctionality.
At the top, there is a large speaker.
You can pair it with mobile phones and other devices via Bluetooth, allowing you to enjoy music wirelessly.
If paired with a mobile phone, it can also be used for hands-free calls.
Also, it supports MicroSD, which allows for collaboration with a computer, and it can play music as an mp3 player.
Drumming and piano practice.
Started trying DTM at the age of 66 to prevent dementia.
Purchase the audio interface and this device.
Initially, I was into programming, but I got hooked on playing the piano and now spend every day immersed in practice.
I downloaded the commissioned sound source, but the protection didn't work well. Initially, I downloaded ASIO, but the free piano sound source has a good sound, so I use this for piano practice.
I think it was a good purchase.
I feel like I've been deceived by appearances.
Is the product hit or miss?
This will be a long text.
Considering purchasing a chair with a flip-up armrest made of non-synthetic leather, as the synthetic leather on the Doshisha office chair (with a flip-up armrest) that I've been using for 4-5 years has deteriorated and become ragged.
I've looked around home centers and furniture stores, but I can't find anything suitable.
There was anxiety about not being able to check the actual product, but I compromised on the design and price and purchased this product on Amazon.
The product box is surprisingly light and compact.
There is one spare screw.
[Note] The included hex wrench and screws are sticky with oil.
At first, I didn't realize that oil had gotten on the hex wrench, and because the main body was white, I panicked when it got oily.
Assembly completed in 40 minutes.
Product completion and verification.
The flip-up armrests have different levels of stiffness when raising and lowering on each side, with the left being heavy and the right being light, making the armrests inconvenient to use (there is no way to adjust this).
The angle adjustment of the movable headrest is weak in holding power and it droops immediately with a "click" sound.
The seat feels hard due to the non-regenerative high-density urethane foam, making it uncomfortable to sit on (lacks elasticity?).
The competitive mesh on the backrest is harder compared to other company's mesh chairs, and it can be uncomfortable on the back when wearing thin clothes.
It's a minor point, but the height from the seat to the ground was not 550 but 530 (seat height is important for tall people). Also, since the legs supporting the casters are not made of steel, there are questions about durability.
I am using a separately purchased cushion and for the mesh fabric part, which seems likely to deteriorate quickly, I am using it with a towel blanket laid on it.
At 186cm and 80kg, I felt that only the fit on my back was good, but otherwise, I think it's a product with low satisfaction. I also feel that it's a hit-or-miss product.
Indeed, it might be better to see and sit on an office chair in person before purchasing it.
I received a greeting email from Amazon about the purchase from the manufacturer, should I inquire about the armrest and headrest?
Under consideration.
Well, I guess that's just how it is.
In my home environment, it seemed like I could watch right-turn BS4K, so without much expectation, I purchased a Pixera 4K tuner which was reasonably priced.
As an experiment, I was able to watch free broadcasts such as NHK BS4K, and at the same time, I was able to enjoy them beautifully on the 4K TV from Panasonic that I purchased simultaneously.
(Sometimes the image is choppy) After purchasing, an update came immediately and it became recording compatible, so I have been making some scheduled recordings and watching them, but I wonder if it is also due to the influence of the external 2.5-inch HDD, the situation is such that the image stops during playback or frame skipping occurs.
The user interface is not something to be praised, it is simply accepted for its ability to view 4K broadcasts.
By the way, during a scheduled recording, you can only do catch-up playback of the program being recorded. This is also accepted as a positive feature that allows you to record in 4K on the HDD.
If you buy with various expectations, you may be disappointed, so it's best not to get your hopes up too much.
We hope for improvements with the update.
The insulation function is OK.
I have only used the insulation function so far, but when I put in two 500ml plastic bottles, they became warm in about 2 hours and felt hot in 2 and a half hours.
I used it installed at the foot of the passenger seat in a compact car. The fan noise is noticeable when the car is idling, but not at all when driving.
Because it was still new, the smell of chemical substances being emitted by the fan was noticeable and it was necessary to regularly open the windows for ventilation.
As another person wrote in their review, the burrs on the part where the shoulder strap goes through are terrible, so you need to fold the burrs with a minus screwdriver or something similar.
Really fragile.
Today, it suddenly broke down two months after I started using it.
I liked both the feel and size of the keystrokes, but it's pointless if it breaks.
I use my PC all day for video editing work, but the volume automatically goes up to 100%.
Even if it drops, it will return to 100% in an instant.
The earphones are unusable due to ear pain, and the volume is too loud to use the PC at night.
It seems to be sending a signal every few seconds, causing the volume display to repeatedly appear and disappear on the computer screen.
Furthermore, the keyboard interferes with the mouse instructions, so unless you turn off the keyboard each time, you cannot use the mouse freely.
The enter key and backspace key have also stopped responding.
I wouldn't recommend it at all, but if it's in the thousand yen range, it might be worth a try.
If you're lucky, it should last about half a year.
Compared to other companies that offer a 1 to 3 year warranty at the same price range, this one only offers a 6-month warranty.
The short warranty period speaks to the fragility of the product.
The product is the best, the packaging is the worst.
I love using the product in different colors. It's my favorite.
I highly recommend the food stocker for those who are looking for one!!
However, the packaging was terrible, with a lot of empty space in the large cardboard box and no delivery note included.
When I opened the box, the lid was also off.
The product is recommended, but it might be better to purchase it elsewhere.
I'm concerned about the strength, but for now.
I bought this because the support became unreliable after I replaced the lid.
It plays a role in the stability of the lid, but as it is a delicate plastic product, if you are not careful when opening and closing the lid, it makes an unpleasant sound as if it is about to break.
You need to choose something that fits the thickness of the lid, so be careful when purchasing.
A bag with cute paw prints.
I have a dog and was looking for a bag for when we go out. I was attracted to this stylish grey bag and decided to purchase it.
It was surprisingly light to hold, as it was assembled and didn't feel too heavy.
The zipper moves smoothly and there is no snagging.
It seems like it would be comfortable even for long journeys.
It is very compact and easy to fold.
Even when folded, the paw design is visible, making it cute even when left out.
Light and comfortable!
The pulley spins smoothly and is comfortable to use.
Firstly, I was instantly smitten by its appearance and affordable price, so I bought it immediately.
The TSA lock has been my favorite for the past few years, and I have several others as well. It's really convenient.
And for those who are prone to forgetting or losing keys, a number lock is recommended.
However, to be honest, I place the utmost importance on lightness, so it's fine for me. But if you're looking for durability and security, the zipper goes all the way around and it's made of cloth, so if it's cut with a knife, it would break in an instant.
Also, the zipper alignment is loose, so I would like some improvements to make it overlap better.
It is recommended for carry-on luggage when traveling abroad.
For now, I used it on a bullet train trip and it was comfortable.
Choosing a size is difficult...
Because of my wide feet, I have a hard time buying shoes.
I wear a size 24cm in Converse and Vans.
The MRL996 is also 24cm.
At first, I thought it was tough, but I got used to it and it's fine now.
This time, my sister said that the ML574 was tight at 24.5cm, and indeed it was when I tried it on.
It felt like my pinky finger was being hit.
Therefore, I purchased 25cm.
When it arrived and I opened it, it was big...
When tried on, they feel a bit loose even with socks on.
I was considering returning it, but I decided to keep the size 25 and wear it with insoles, as it would be a hassle if I changed it to 24.5 and it ended up being too tight.
I purchased Team Red, and it's a vibrant red that's really nice!
Wearing these can brighten up your look, especially if you often wear monochrome outfits in black or white!
165cm, male in his 40s.
I ordered a size L appropriately, but if you have similar specifications, I recommend a size M.
Height: 165 cm, Weight: 60 kg, Waist: 81 cm, Belly circumference: 100 cm. This is a typical case of a metabolic belly.
<Comfort> Underwater, the rash guard tends to roll up due to the waist part being loose.
I am swimming while fixing the flipped up parts.
Especially when you let your guard down in the jacuzzi, your belly fat can be completely exposed.
Also, if you walk with intense up and down movements, it will inevitably flip up from the bottom.
The construction of the product: The fabric is sturdy and not too thin, so you don't have to worry about your nipples showing through.
At this price and with this quality, you will be satisfied, but I think buying a smaller size would fit better.
Indeed, there was a gas leak...
The Silver Colt 25 had a gas leak, and while replacing the valve, a part of the tank broke off. However, by using "Bus Bond Q" to seal the tank and applying repair grease, it was able to shoot smoothly again. If you want to buy this Colt 25, you need to be able to disassemble and assemble it yourself, or ask someone who can. If you're not confident, it's not recommended unless you don't mind if it breaks. It might be fun for those who don't mind. I also bought another black Colt 25. The trick to disassembling it is to hold the trigger with your left thumb and remove the left side, then you can disassemble it without the parts flying off. When assembling, apply silicone grease to the springs and small parts and assemble while fixing with grease. To disassemble, first remove the grip, remove the safety screw, pull out the safety, remove the two screws on the left side of the body, and be careful not to scratch the tip of the barrel and not to pinch the front sight and inner barrel with pliers. Then, you can disassemble it by slowly removing the left side due to its wafer structure. However, do it at your own risk and don't blame others if you fail.
I wondered about the quality, given it's only 188 yen.
You can switch between them when you need fast forwarding and torque.
I like its lightness, small size, and above all, its unpretentious simplicity.
I was amazed at the cost performance of this, considering it's only 188 yen and there's no play when the bit is attached.
The only thing left to consider is durability.
You may not use it very often, but I think it's a good thing to have in your toolbox.
I also purchased the "1/4 inch hex shank magnetic quick release driver roulette bit holder 60/100/150 mm" from the same seller.
This one was also not a problem, in fact, it was quite good for the price.
The controller stops working.
The device moves on its own and becomes unresponsive to controls.
Once the cable is reconnected, it can be operated, but after a few minutes, the device moves in an unintended direction and becomes inoperable.
It would be better not to buy this product.
Just to give you all a heads up.
It's a terrible product.
Although it's wired, I recommend the BEBONCOOL PS3 controller.
It is highly reliable and has not broken even after long-term use.
It can also be used for PC games.
...Additional note: I think it was good that I was able to get a refund in the form of an Amazon gift card for a return due to a defective product within one month.
Will this increase the computational power?
I think it's suitable for children who understand calculations.
Wouldn't it be impossible unless the child has some understanding of calculations?
The problem is difficult to understand.
Also, when giving tools to the boss, you slide the items on the screen upwards with your finger. However, no matter how many times I try, it doesn't go smoothly.
In other words, it might be easier for people who are accustomed to the DS to slip up.
I can't seem to like illustrations of cartoon characters, or rather, I think there's something to be said about getting into the fun of the screen with things like the DS... but for some reason, I can't feel a sense of familiarity.
The method of calculation is also competitive in terms of time, such as how many questions can be answered correctly within a certain number of minutes.
I understand the urgency for tests and such, but can't you make calculations without rushing?
For some reason, I don't like it when the gong sounds at the end.
Even though you're working hard, wouldn't it be nice to have a more pleasant sound?
I feel like I've lost money with this 6,200 yen.
I understand if it's half this price.
I'm sorry, this translation ended up with two stars.
Indeed, the songs from Persona are great!
I have reached the ending of Persona 3.
I played up to the middle of 5.
I have achieved the platinum trophy for Persona 4 on Vita.
What you can do hasn't changed from the previous game, Persona 4.
Without a story, it feels shorter than the previous work.
The song is really cool, isn't it!
Just listening to it lifts my mood!
I was moved when I first saw the characters of Persona 3 in HD for the first time.
Somehow, Junpei looked handsome (laughs). Persona 5 is already beautiful, so there's no freshness... Considering that, Persona 3 feels more valuable.
As a rhythm game, I found 5 easier to play than 3.
Persona 3 primarily uses blue, but it was hard to see when the background was dark.
5 is mainly bright colors like red and yellow, so it's easy to see even if it overlaps with the background.
With plenty of assist features, I believe even those who are not good at rhythm games can enjoy playing.
For skilled rhythm game players, turning on the challenge feature might make the game more challenging.
The triple pack comes with a soundtrack, but it's not just a bonus, it's a solid four-disc set, so if you like Persona's music, I recommend this one.
That's a shame.
I bought it because I liked the color of the dial in the photo, but the actual product is closer to black or charcoal gray with a hint of blue.
And it wasn't a double buckle.
So, I was considering buying gold, but for now, I'm holding off. I guess I can let it go since the price is low?
Addendum: After the review was published, I received an email from the seller apologizing and offering to exchange the product for a new one.
The subsequent processing was also prompt.
Despite the product being inexpensive, I think the service was very good.
Four stars for the response. Additional note: I also purchased gold afterwards.
I think the color is very beautiful and almost exactly as shown in the photo.
But it's clear that the buckle is not a double lock, which is a noticeable difference from the description photo.
That's the only regret.
The evenings become very heavy.
I used it on a SIM-free iPhone 7s.
At first, I didn't know what to do after inserting the SIM upon arriving in Korea, so I asked a woman at the SK counter at Gimpo Airport and she taught me (Settings > Mobile Data > Data Roaming ON), and it worked well.
It seems like the manual that came with the product wasn't really relevant...?
However, around Gimpo Airport, the signal was poor and it was constantly on 3G.
When I went out into the city, it switched to 4G.
In the evenings or at night, the connection sometimes became very heavy, but in retrospect, I may have reached the maximum limit of several hundred MB per day.
Better than I expected.
I have been using Softbank Z4 for two years, and I unlocked it to use with Ymobile. As the Z4 started to malfunction, I was considering buying a used Xperia, but then I found this new phone that supports mobile wallet and decided to purchase it.
I was worried about whether I could use it properly because I was using Mobile Suica, but there was no problem at all.
The size, weight, and the fact that I bought it in silver gives the impression that it's an iPhone 6 at first glance.
I don't play games, so the processing speed seems to be the same as the Z4, if not a bit faster. The reviews mentioned that the fingerprint recognition is slow, and I do feel it takes a bit of time to recognize, so I use face recognition, which is faster.
I thought it was amazing, like an iPhone. I also upgraded my Android to Ver9, so I was able to make a satisfying purchase.
Things I noticed: It could be a bit smaller. There's no strap hole. *I've addressed this with a case that has a strap hole. I haven't tested its water resistance. It's a bit heavy. I haven't used it much yet, but I'm satisfied. I recommend it.
